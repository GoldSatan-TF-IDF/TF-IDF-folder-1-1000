steven saylor empire history is scarcely capable of preserving the memory of anything except myths gustave le bon the crowd roman months and days the names of the roman months were januarius februarius martius aprilis maius junius julius to honor julius caesar augustus to honor caesar augustus september october november and december the first day of each month was called the kalends the ides fell on the fifteenth day of martius maius julius and october and on the thirteenth day of the other months the nones fell nine days before the ides the romans reckoned dates by counting backward inclusively from the kalends ides or nones thus for example the date we would call june was called by the romans the fifth day before the ides of junius part i lucius the lightning reader ad lucius woke with a start he had been dreaming in his dream there was no earth only a dark empty sky and beyond the sky unimaginably vast the crystalline firmament in which the stars shone brightly no clouds obscured the stars and yet there was lightning in the dream lightning without thunder random flashes of blinding light that illuminated great flocks of birds that suddenly filled the dark sky there were vultures and eagles ravens and crows every sort of bird imaginable soaring and flapping their wings yet making no more sound than the silent lightning the dream had filled him with a sense of urgency and confusion awake now lucius heard a faint rumble of thunder in the distance he heard other sounds from elsewhere in the house the slaves were up and beginning to stir stoking the kitchen fire and opening shutters lucius jumped from his bed his room with a small balcony looking west was on the upper floor of the house below him was the slope of the aventine hill the nearer houses along the crest of the hill were large and well made like his familys house farther down the hill humbler houses and tenements and artisans workshops were crowded close together and farther yet was a flat expanse with large granaries and warehouses close to the tiber at the river the city ended on the far side of the tiber woods and meadows were divided into the private estates of the rich which extended to the far horizon of hills and mountains how his mother hated this view born into a wealthy branch of the cornelius family she had grown up in a house on the other more fashionable side of the aventine hill with a view of the vast circus maximus below the capitoline hill crowned by temples off to one side and directly opposite the opulent palatine hill where the emperor lived why from our rooftop when i was a girl she would say i could see the smoke from sacrifices on the capitoline watch the chariot races below and even catch a glimpse of the emperor himself strolling on one of his terraces across the way all at the same time camilla luciuss father would say gently mocking her but this was the view lucius had grown up with for twentyfour years this had been the roma seen from his room a jumble of the rich and poor mostly the poor where slaves laboured endlessly in vast storehouses to accommodate all the goods and grain that arrived day after day carried up the river from the great world beyond the world that belonged to roma the month of maius had been overcast and rainy so far and this day promised to be no different by the dim light of dawn beneath an overcast sky lucius saw the towering cypress trees along the tiber sway this way and that the blustering winds were warm and carried the smell of rain in the far distance black storm clouds roiled on the horizon bristling with lighting perfect weather for an augury whispered lucius his room was sparsely furnished with a narrow bed and a single backless chair a small pigeonhole bookcase filled with scrolls left over from his childhood education a mirror on a stand made of burnished copper and a few trunks to accommodate his clothing he opened the most ornate of the trunks and carefully removed the special garment it contained ordinarily he would have waited for a slave to help him dress arranging the folds correctly was a complicated task but lucius could not wait the garment was not simply a toga such as the one he had put on when he became a man at the age of seventeen it was a trabea the special garment worn only by augurs the members of the ancient priesthood trained to divine the will of the gods it was not white but saffron with broad purple stripes except for the fitting when the tailor had made it for him this was the first time lucius had even touched the trabea the neverworn wool was soft and thick and had a fresh smell of murex dye he put on the garment and did his best to pull the hanging folds into a proper arrangement he glanced at himself in the copper mirror then reached into the trunk again he picked up a slender ivory wand that ended in a little spiral the lituus was a family heirloom and a familiar friend lucius had spent countless hours practising with it in preparation for this day but now he looked at the lituus with fresh eyes studying the intricate carvings that decorated every part of its surface with images of ravens crows owls eagles vultures and chickens as well as foxes wolves horses and dogs all the various creatures from whose actions a trained augur could interpret the will of the gods he left his room and descended the stairs crossed the garden surrounded by a peristyle at the centre of the house and stepped into the dining room where his mother and father reclined together on a couch while a slave served their breakfast his mother was wearing a simple stola with her long hair not yet combed and pinned for the day she leaped up from her couch lucius what are you doing dressed in your trabea already you cant eat breakfast wearing that what if you get food on it the ceremony is hours away well be going to the baths first the barber must shave you and your father lucius laughed mother i did it on a whim of course i wont wear it to breakfast but what do you think camilla sighed you look splendid lucius absolutely splendid as handsome as ever your father was in his trabea dont you think so dear luciuss father who strove always to maintain the restraint proper to a man of his standing a patrician a senator and a cousin of the emperor merely nodded handsome our boy certainly is but looking pretty is not the point when a man puts on his trabea a priest must carry his garment as he carries his lituus with dignity and authority as befits the intermediary of the gods lucius drew back his shoulders raised his chin and held forth his lituus what do you think father do i look properly dignified the elder lucius pinarius looked at his son and raised an eyebrow to him young lucius often still looked like a boy and never more so than at this moment dressed up in priestly finery but with the folds of his trabea tucked and draped haphazardly like a child in grownup costume twentyfour was very young for a man to be inducted into the college of augurs the elder pinarius had been in his forties before the honour came to him with his black hair mussed from sleeping his broad smile and his smoothly handsome features young lucius hardly fitted the standard image of the wrinkled greyhaired augur still the young man came from a long line of augurs and he had shown great aptitude in his studies you look very fine my son now go change into a nice tunic we shall have a bite to eat then be off to the baths for a wash and a shave then hurry back home to get ready for the ceremony hopefully the storm will hold off and we wont be drenched with rain having a slave arrange the trabea certainly made a difference lucius had to admit as he studied himself in the copper mirror later that day the sight of himself freshly groomed and properly outfitted in his trabea filled him with confidence of course he was not an augur quite yet preceding the induction ceremony there would be a final examination in which lucius would be called upon to demonstrate his skills lucius frowned he was a little nervous about the examination this time when he descended from his room his mother almost swooned at the sight of him his father now dressed in his own trabea and carrying his own lituus gave him a warm smile of approval shall we be off father not quite yet you have a visitor across the garden a young man and a girl were seated on a bench beneath the peristyle acilia lucius began to run to her then slowed his pace a trabea was not made for running and it would not do to catch the soft wool on a thorn as he passed the rose bushes acilias older brother rose to his feet nodded curtly and discreetly withdrew looking over his shoulder lucius saw that his parents had also disappeared to allow him a moment of privacy with his betrothed lucius took her hands in his acilia you look beautiful today it was true her honeycoloured hair was worn long and straight as befitted an unmarried girl her eyes were bright blue her cheeks were as smooth as rose petals her petite body was largely hidden by her modest longsleeved tunica but during the year that they had been betrothed she had definitely begun to acquire the contours of a womans body she was ten years younger than lucius look at you lucius so handsome in your trabea thats what my mother said as they strolled across the garden he suddenly felt selfconscious about their surroundings lucius was acutely aware that the house of acilias father was far grander than that of the pinarii more lavishly furnished tended by more household slaves and located on the more fashionable side of the aventine hill near the temple of diana the acilii were plebeians descended from a family far less ancient than the patrician pinarii but the acilii had a great deal of money while the fortunes of the pinarii had dwindled in recent years luciuss late grandfather had owned a fine mansion on the palatine but his debts had forced the family to move to their current accommodations to be sure the vestibule of their house contained the wax masks of many venerable ancestors but that was not the sort of thing to impress a girl had acilia noticed how overgrown and untended the garden was lucius remembered the perfectly trimmed hedges and topiaries the marble walkways and expensive pieces of bronze statuary in the garden at acilias house the roof of the peristyle behind acilia was missing more than a few tiles and the wall was unsightly with peeling plaster and water stains the slave who was supposed to tend the garden was already overworked with other duties and there was no money to repair the roof or the wall lack of money that was the reason they were not yet married acilias father after the initial excitement of betrothing his daughter to the patrician son of a senator and a cousin of the emperor had since found one excuse after another to postpone setting a date for the ceremony obviously having discovered more about the pinariis finances titus acilius had grown dubious about luciuss prospects in the world from the moment lucius first saw her at a meeting arranged by their fathers lucius had liked acilia since then he had fallen hopelessly in love with her and she seemed to feel the same but that counted for nothing unless her father could be swayed to approve the union acilia said nothing about the state of the garden or the unsightly wall she gazed admiringly at the lituus he carried such ornate carvings what is it made of ivory from the tusk of an elephant so they say its very beautiful its been in the family a long time you can tell the ivory is very old because of the colour many generations of pinarii have been augurs taking auspices at state ceremonies on battlefields at temple dedications and at private events as well like weddings acilia seemed duly impressed and only men from the ancient patrician families can become augurs thats right and i can give you a patrician son he thought yet even as he basked in her admiration he heard a scurrying noise and looked up to see a rat running along the roof of the peristyle behind her with a flick of its long tail the rat dislodged a loose tile hearing lucius gasp acilia look around just in time to see the tile fall and shatter on a paving stone she jumped and uttered a little cry had she seen the rat to distract her he seized her shoulder spun her around to face him and kissed her it was only a quick kiss but still she looked astonished lucius what if my brother should see see what this he kissed her again not as quickly she drew back blushing but looking pleased directly in front of her was the amulet on the necklace that lucius was wearing it had slipped from inside his trabea and lay nestled amid the saffronandpurple folds is that part of your augurs outfit she said no its a family heirloom my grandfather gave it to me when i ten years old i wear it only on special occasions may i touch it of course she reached up to touch the little lump of gold which was vaguely cruciform in shape i remember the day my grandfather gave it to me he showed me the proper way to wear a toga and then took me all around the city just the two of us he showed me the exact spot where his greatuncle julius caesar was murdered he showed me the great altar of hercules the most ancient shrine in the city which was erected by the pinarius family in the days before roma even existed he showed me the fig tree on the palatine where romulus and remus and their friend pinarius climbed among the branches and finally he showed me the temple of venus that caesar built and that was the first time i saw the fantastic golden statue of cleopatra inside my grandfather knew cleopatra very well and he knew marcus antonius too someday someday i want to have a son and take him to see all those things and tell him about his ancestors acilia still held the amulet as he spoke she had drawn closer to him until her body pressed gently against his she gazed at the amulet then looked up into his eyes but what sort of amulet is this i cant make out the shape lucius shook his head its funny my grandfather made such a fuss about giving it to me but even he wasnt sure what its supposed to represent or where it came from he only knew that it had been in the family for many generations the original shape must have worn away over so many lifetimes theres nothing like that in our family said acilia clearly impressed she was so close that lucius felt an urge to put his arms around her and hold her tightly against him no matter that her brother might appear at any moment but the sky above them suddenly opened and pelted the garden with rain the raindrops were warm and lucius would have been happy to stand there holding her both of them getting soaking wet but acilia dropped the amulet seized his hand and with a shriek of laughter pulled him through the peristyle and into the house they found luciuss father and acilias brother sitting next to each other in a pair of matching ebony chairs with inlays of lapis and abalone it was no accident that his father had guided their guest to the best two pieces of furniture in the house marcus acilius was only a few years older than his sister and had the same golden hair and bright blue eyes but its been five years since the disaster that took place in the teutoberg forest he was saying and still nothing has been done to settle the score with the germanic tribes theyre laughing at us its a scandal so the rain has driven you inside luciuss father looked up at the couple and smiled warmly at acilia he wanted the marriage to take place as badly as lucius did marcus and i have been talking about the situation in the north he turned his attention back to acilias brother youre a young man marcus five years seems to you a very long time but in the grand scheme of things its no more than the blink of an eye this city was not built in a day nor was the empire conquered in a lifetime to be sure for a long time roma seemed unstoppable ever outwards our legions pushed the limits of the empire and all obstacles fell before us to the north my fathers greatuncle julius caesar conquered gaul and set the stage for our cousin augustus to push beyond the rhine and conquer the germans the wild tribes were pacified their leaders were won over with the privileges of roman citizenship cities were built temples were dedicated to the gods taxes were collected and germania became a province like any other and then came arminius or hermann as the germans call him a german who was trained to fight by romans who was given all the benefits of roman hospitality and who repaid us by the most despicable treachery on the pretext of stamping out a small uprising he lured three roman legions into the teutoberg forest then staged an ambush not a single roman escaped arminiuss men werent satisfied with simple slaughter they desecrated the corpses chopping them into pieces hanging their limbs from trees and mounting their heads on stakes a thoroughly disgusting business to be sure but not the end of romas interests in germania the massacre in the teutoberg forest took place because of the ambitions of one man arminius who wants to turn the province we have built into his personal kingdom the man is nothing more than a thief i hear he dares to call himself augustus of the north if you can believe such effrontery but never fear young marcus our efforts so far to punish arminius and bring the situation under control have been thwarted but not for much longer as a senator i can assure you that the emperors attention to this matter is unwavering not a day passes that he does not take some action to correct it and what augustus sets out to do augustus does but the emperor is seventyfive years old said marcus true but there are younger more vigorous members of his family with military expertise his stepson tiberius is a very fit commander it was tiberiuss late brother drusus germanicus who conquered the province in the first place and theres germanicuss son whos eager to earn the name his father handed down to him by his own victories never fear marcus it will take time and effort and no small amount of bloodshed but the province of germania will be pacified ah but listen to me rambling on about warfare and politics in the presence of one with such tender sensibilities he smiled again at acilia is it true about the germans cutting off the soldiers heads and putting them on stakes she whispered looking pale youve upset her father said lucius taking advantage of acilias distress to put his arm around her her brother did not object no more talk of such unpleasant subjects then said the elder pinarius no more talk at all if youre to be on time for the ceremony said luciuss mother entering the room the rain has let up the two of you must be off and quickly but you neednt leave yet acilia i have some spinning to do nothing is more relaxing than spinning wool you can help me if youd like and we can have a nice visit camilla accompanied lucius and his father to the vestibule dont be nervous son i know youll perform splendidly or is it the presence of acilia that makes you tremble she laughed now off with you you dont think i laid it on too thickly do you said luciuss father reminding young marcus about our kinship to both the divine julius and the emperor they had descended the slope of the aventine and were walking through the crowded riverfront district heading for the stairs of cacus which would take them up to the summit of the palatine i think the acilii are quite aware of our family connections said lucius ruefully but im not sure that it helps to keep bringing it up for all that my grandfather was an heir of the divine julius and were cousins of the great augustus what do we have to show for it his father sighed what indeed except for the fact that were still alive what do you mean by that they began to ascend the stairs of cacus as recently as the days of julius caesar it had been nothing more than a steep winding footpath as it had been since the time of romulus augustus had made it into a stone stairway decorated with flowers and terraces luciuss father looked ahead of them and behind checking that no one was close enough to overhear have you never noticed son how many members of the emperors family have been sent into exile and how those dearest to him have a way of dying lucius frowned i know he banished his daughter julia her morals disappointed him and his grandson agrippa who was also deemed insufficiently upright and i know that his other grandsons lucius and gaius the ones he intended to make his heirs both suffered untimely deaths so they did being too close to the emperor is not necessary beneficial either to ones happiness or to ones health are you saying i am saying that the emperor is like a flame those around him are like men eager to warm themselves but no one envies the man who draws so close that he sets himself afire lucius shook his head might things have gone differently if my grandfather had received more favour from the gods the elder pinarius sighed like his cousin augustus your grandfather was named in the will of julius caesar but little good it did him since he chose to side with marcus antonius and cleopatra in the civil war after those two lost everything at the battle of actium your grandfather saw sense and went over to augustus who graciously forgave him and forever afterwards showed him not one iota of generosity perhaps the victor thought it was enough to spare his errant cousins life and allow him to keep what remained of his fortune most of which your grandfather eventually lost anyway despite all his business concerns in egypt since then your cousin augustus has mostly ignored us we are tolerated but granted little in the way of either favour or disfavour which is not necessarily a bad thing oh yes to have his favour could be grand but to suffer his disfavour or the disfavour of those who scheme and plot around him can be fatal you say he grants us few favours yet he put me in the lists to become an augur that he did and you have no idea how many favours i had to call in to make that happen be grateful for this opportunity my son i am father said lucius humbly and sincerely at the top of the stairs of cacus they were afforded a view of the river even on an overcast blustery day the wharves were bustling and the choppy water was crowded with ships above the river loomed the capitoline hill with its white temples glistening after the recent shower a solitary sunbeam broke though the ragged clouds overhead and shone brightly on the gilded statue of hercules in luciuss short lifetime he had seen the city of roma acquire an evergreater air of prosperity and opulence countless shops were filled with goods from all over the world ancient temples and monuments had been refurbished and new even grander temples had been built state buildings made of brick had been faced with slabs of travertine and marble the emperor had once said i found roma built of sundried bricks i will leave her cloaked in marble augustus had made good on the promise lucius had never lived anywhere but in roma and had never travelled farther than pompeii but it seemed to him there could be no other place as exciting and beautiful as roma he felt proud that he was about to become truly part of the city to be given a role to play to act as a mediator between the gods and the city they had favored more than any other on earth amid the grand houses on the palatine hill was an open square planted with grass and surrounded by a low stone wall known as the auguratorium on this very spot almost eight hundred years before romulus performed the augury that established the site of the city romulus saw twelve vultures over on the aventine hill his twin brother remus spotted only six vultures thus the gods made known their preference that the new city should be founded on the palatine not the aventine in time the city grew to contain the aventine and all the seven hills along the tiber but this was the spot where it began according to family legend a pinarius had been present with romulus on that sacred occasion and so the induction of a new pinarius into the college of augurs was always an event that resounded with significance as lucius and his father emerged from a narrow street and approached the auguratorium a sea of saffron and purple enveloped them every man in the crowd was wearing a trabea and clutching a lituus a tall young man abruptly appeared before them holding his arms open to give lucius an embrace lllucius he said i thought youd never get here the idea of going through the examination all by myself was making me break into a ccold sweat surely you jest cousin claudius said lucius your skills at augury are far greater than mine and you know it seeking signs from the gods is one thing ddoing it in front of an audience is another matter youll both do very well im sure said luciuss father beaming proudly at the two of them lucius and claudius were to be the only inductees into the college on this day claudius was the grandson of livia the emperors wife and thus the stepgrandson of augustus but was not the emperors grandson officially by either blood or law since augustus had never adopted claudiuss late father drusus germanicus nonetheless claudius was a blood relative to augustus he was the grandson of marcus antonius and octavia augustuss sister and thus the emperors greatnephew and also a distant cousin to lucius claudius and lucius had been born the same year in recent months the cousins had been studying the science of augury together they had become close friends though to luciuss father it seemed that their differences were greater than their similarities lucius was strikingly handsome well built and graceful that was a plain fact and not the prejudice of a doting father while claudius though tall and not badlooking had a cowed manner often spoke with a stammer and suffered from nervous facial tics and jerks of the head the stammer and the jerking were more pronounced at some times than at others some people assumed that the young man was mentally incompetent in fact despite his youth claudius was an antiquarian scholar more deeply versed in the minutiae of romas history than anyone the elder pinarius had ever met of the friendship between his son and claudius he entirely approved the danger he had just warned lucius about of drawing too near the emperor and his inner circle seemed hardly to apply to claudius whom the emperor embarrassed by the young mans defects kept at a distance a gong was struck the augurs stopped their milling and assembled along the four sides of the auguratorium in order of their age and rank in the centre of the square the magister of the college called on lucius and claudius to stand beside him then asked who nominates these new members luciuss father stepped forward and placed his hand on luciuss shoulder i lucius pinarius an augur nominate my son lucius pinarius another figure emerged from the crowd an old man who seemed quite careless of his appearance his grey hair needed barbering and his threadbare trabea had seen better days but when he placed his hand on claudiuss shoulder and spoke his voice carried an undeniable ring of authority i gaius julius caesar octavianus augustus an augur nominate my nephew tiberius claudius nero germanicus the magister nodded then i shall begin the examination a rumble of distant thunder caused him to glance skyward divination is the means by which humankind may determine the will of the gods the gods make their will known by signs which we call auspices those who know the way may determine whether these auspices are favourable or unfavourable by augury the site of roma was decided as ennius began one of his poems after by augury august roma had been founded as the empire of roma has grown we have encountered other peoples with other means of divination the etruscans studied the entrails of sacrificial animals the babylonians observed the stars the greeks listened to blind prophets the jews received instruction from a burning bush but these ways are not roman ways these are inferior means of divination as is made evident by the inferior fortunes of their adherents the roman way of divination handed down to us from our most ancient ancestors is augury which was and is and always shall be the best and truest means of divining the will of the gods hear hear shouted augustus prompting others in the crowd to do the same there are five categories of augury the magister continued five means by which the auspices may be obtained the most powerful auspices are delivered by thunder and lightning which come directly from jupiter auspices may also be obtained by the observation of certain birds the raven the crow the owl the eagle and the vulture from this second avian form of augury derives the third form which our ancestors originally devised for use on military campaigns where an auspice might be required at any moment to make a critical decision this third type of augury is performed by releasing a hen from its cage scattering grain before it and observing the way the creature pecks or does not peck at the food auspices may also taken from fourfooted animals and this is the fourth form if a fox wolf horse dog or any other quadruped should cross a persons path or appear in some unusual setting only an augur may interpret the meaning but it is important to remember that this fourth form of augury is never employed on behalf of the state only as private divination the fifth class of augury pertains to all signs which do not fall into the other four categories and may include all manner of unusual events the birth of a twoheaded animal a strange object that falls from the sky flames that appear and disappear leaving no trace the fifth form of augury may also be derived from common accidents a sneeze a stumble a misspoken name or word claudius suddenly jerked his head from side to side lucius barely glimpsed the movement from the corner of his eye but it must have been quite obvious to the crowd before them was this spasm such an accident as the magister had just mentioned a sign from the gods lucius thought not everyone knew that claudius had been prone to such twitches from childhood sometimes a twitch was merely a twitch still there were uneasy murmurs from the crowd the magister pretended to take no notice lucius pinarius what form of augury will you demonstrate for us today to determine whether the gods favour your admission into the college given that the day was stormy the answer was obvious the first form said lucius the others stepped back leaving lucius alone in the centre of the auguratorium he slowly turned about in a circle surveying the sky the storm clouds were concentrated most thickly to the southwest he raised his lituus and pointed in that direction the augurs gathered behind him with his lituus he drew an invisible square upon the sky from left to right the square included everything from the top of the temple of diana on the aventine to the top of the temple of jupiter on the capitoline from bottom to top it included everything from the horizon to the zenith having delineated a segment of sky lucius lowered his lituus and proceeded to watch and wait lucius was patient at first keeping his eyes open trying not to blink then he began to grow a bit nervous the gods including jupiter did not always send signs what if no lightning appeared the absence of a sign in such a circumstance would be taken as an unfavourable auspice behind him lucius thought he heard the sound of murmurs and shuffling feet as if the augurs were growing as restless as he was how long was long enough to await a sign only the most senior augur present in this case the emperor could determine that they might stand there for hours until night fell awaiting the appearance of a lightning bolt or augustus might decide to end the examination the next moment luciuss heart pounded in his chest the wait was maddening if no sign appeared what would become of him what would his father say he realized that he was clutching his lituus with white knuckles he took a deep breath and relaxed his grip he slipped the fingers of his other hand inside his trabea and touched the gold amulet he wore around his neck he saw a flash an instant later he heard the gasps of the others behind him and then a few heartbeats later he heard the thunder the distant flash was to the left just above the temple of diana but still within the delineated area lightning to the left was favourable and the more to the left the more favourable the auspice was good jupiter was clearly pleased and then as if to quell any doubt about his approval several blinding flashes of jagged lightning appeared in the same spot one after another followed by rolling peals of thunder to lucius it sounded as if the god were laughing with delight the auspice is favourable shouted the magister is there any augur present who disagrees lucius turned around and sought his fathers face amid the crowd his father was smiling as were those around him augustus too seemed to smile though lucius found it hard to read the old mans expression his eyes looked weary not joyful and the baring of his yellow teeth resembled a grimace more than a grin i think we are all agreed that the auspice is favourable are we not said the emperor there were nods and utterances of agreement from the crowd the magister placed his hands on luciuss shoulder congratulations lucius pinarius on this day you have become an augur may you always use your skills and the power of your priestly office wisely for the benefit of roma and with the greatest respect for the gods the magister turned to claudius and now you tiberius claudius nero germanicus what form of augury will you demonstrate for us today to determine whether the gods favor your admission into the college claudius stepped forward i choose to watch for he came to a complete stop as he sometimes did when speaking his stutter was making it difficult for him to say the next word at last pressing his lips tightly together he blurted out bbbirds there were murmurs from the crowd most of whom including lucius were surprised by the decision on such a day with so much lightning about surely all the birds were in their nests hiding from the wind and the rain nonetheless claudius seemed sure of himself after carefully scanning the sky he faced northeast directly opposite the direction lucius had chosen he used his lituus to delineate a segment of sky above the forum and the esquiline hill beyond just as he was finishing the delineation claudius dropped his lituus lucius groaned as did several others claudiuss clumsiness was one thing but to drop his lituus was surely a bad omen if augustus was embarrassed he did not show it pick up that lituus he said and lets get to the business at hand young man quick as boiled asparagus the tension in the crowd was relieved with laughter the emperor was known for such homespun metaphors which from any other speaker would have sounded oafish augustus cleared his throat and spoke back when i first took the auspices i also chose to watch for birds i spotted twelve vultures yes twelve the very number romulus saw when he founded the city let us see how jupiters feathered emissaries will augur for my nephew today the old man flashed a smile or a grimace lucius could not tell which while they watched and waited for a sign lucius considered the daunting complexities of avian augury to take the auspice one had to consider not only the types of birds that appeared but how many and whether they flew in a single direction or doubled back and whether they called or were silent every sound and motion of each bird had a different meaning according to different circumstances and the time of the year when it was observed an avian augury was far more likely than a lightning augury to yield an auspice susceptible to differing interpretations if indeed on such a day any bird would appear they waited lucius began to grow uneasy feeling almost as anxious for claudius as he had felt for himself it had seemed unthinkable that lucius might disappoint and embarrass his father how much greater must be the pressure felt by claudius with the emperor looming behind him just when lucius could stand the suspense no longer claudius raised his lituus and pointed thththere he cried two vultures above the esquiline gate flying this way to be sure two flitting specks had appeared but they were so distant that lucius who had excellent eyesight was not sure what sort of birds they might be apparently claudiuss eyes were even keener than his for as the birds drew nearer there was general agreement among the squinting augurs that the birds were indeed vultures the birds wheeled back towards the esquiline gate and began to circle above it two more vultures appeared from the same spot and then two more and then another until seven vultures were circling about the esquiline gate beyond the gate outside the walls was the necropolis the city of the dead where slaves were buried and the carcasses of executed criminals were left to the birds it was not surprising that vultures had appeared in that region but it was surely fortuitous that so many had appeared at once during claudiuss augury and on such an inclement day the pattern of their flight first towards the auguratorium and then away was a favourable auspice as well augustus declared the augury completed the magister was impressed seven vultures to be sure considerably fewer than the record set by romulus and matched by our emperor but one more than remus saw does anyone here doubt that the auspice is favorable no very well then i declare that on this day tiberius claudius nero germanicus has shown himself to be a true augur accepted by his colleagues and more importantly by jupiter himself may you always use your skills and the power of your priestly office wisely young man for the benefit of roma and with the greatest respect for the gods the ceremony was concluded lucius and claudius received the congratulations of their fellow augurs and then the members began to head to the imperial residence the banquet following the induction of new augurs was usually held in a private home but on this occasion augustus was playing host he had certainly made a point of reminding everyone of his kinship to claudius the fact that lucius pinarius was a cousin had not even been mentioned during the short walk which took them past some of the finest houses in the city lucius walked beside claudius and told him how impressed he was by the vulture sightings that was very bold of you i would never have dared to choose an avian augury i did the safe thing and went with lightning the smart thing as well or so i thought since lightning auguries are usually more highly respected but you outshone me today claudius claudius pursed his lips nodded and hummed thoughtfully his head twitched to one side yes well i suppose i did even though as you say lightning augury is the most highly esteemed of all forms why do you suppose that is with the examination behind them his stutter had momentarily abated as the magister taught us lightning and thunder come directly from jupiter said lucius ah but birds are the messengers of jupiter so why should avian augury not be as prized no i think lightning augury is more impressive because a flash of lightning cannot possibly be fabricated by mortal men while anyone might arrange to release certain birds from a certain area at a certain time lucius frowned are you saying those vultures were deliberately released oh not for romulus surely and certainly not for greatuncle but for me who knows claudius shrugged thanks to my obvious shortcomings greatuncle can foresee no higher station in life for me than to be an augur i twitch too much to find glory as a warrior you saw me drop my lituus today imagine me dropping a sword on the battlefield i ststutter too much to make impressive spspspeeches in the senate he flashed a sardonic smile was he stuttering on purpose since this is as far as i shall go greatuncle is determined that everyone should acknowledge my competence at augury if at nothing else three vultures would have sufficed dont you think greatuncle always overdoes these things when the two vacancies opened in the college why do you suppose he chose to allow you to enlist lucius i know my father did everything he could to promote me and to win the emperors favour he was surprised he succeeded considering my youth ha greatuncle approved of your admission to the college for only one reason he wanted to make me an augur and so be done with me and he wanted another candidate my age to enter alongside me so that i shouldnt stand out so much you werent made an augur despite your age lucius but because of it but the important thing cousin lucius is that our examinations are over and now we are augurs augurs for life but what is that youre wearing claudius referred to the amulet on luciuss necklace it had slipped outside his trabea and the gold shone brightly against the purple wool its a family talisman where did it come from what does it symbolize i dont really know lucius confessed with some chagrin claudius was such a scholar and so steeped in his own familys history that he was never at a loss to explain even the most arcane bits of ancestral lore claudius came to a halt reached for the amulet and studied it closely lucius had seen such a spark in his friends eyes before during their studies together the excitement of the devoted antiquarian in the presence of an intriguing puzzle i think lucius yes i thththink i may have ssome idea of what this is ill have to do a bit of research come along my fellow augurs said luciuss father catching up with them were almost there like lucius he had never been inside the imperial residence and he was flushed with excitement they entered a courtyard first no grander than that of any house of moderate wealth except for the trophies on prominent display in the center of the yard on a wooden stand was displayed the emperors personal armour including his sword ax helmet and shield see how they gleam whispered lucius as if theyve just been freshly burnished yes i believe there is a slave who performs that duty daily said claudius as the augurs filled the courtyard waiting for the massive bronze entry doors to open lucius looked up at the giant laurel crown carved into the marble lintel above the doors the laurel crown is traditionally awarded to a soldier who saves a comrades life in battle noted claudius following his gaze can you guess why the senate voted to award that stupendous image of a laurel crown to my uncle i suspect you can tell me it was awarded to him in honour of his victory over cleopatra and my grandfather marcus antonius whom i never knew of course since he died by his own sword twenty years before i was bbborn by winning that war you see augustus saved us all from being enslaved by the egyptian queen the entire citizenry of roma and all the generations to come and thus he deserved a laurel crown of suitable splendor the booming noise of a thrown bolt resounded from within the house and then the great bronze doors began to slowly open inwards flanking the doorway lucius noticed were two flourishing laurel trees as lightning flashed over their heads and a peal of thunder shook the courtyard he saw several of the augurs break sprigs from the trees and slip them into their trabeas it was a wellknown fact that the laurel tree was lightningproof of all trees the only one never struck would carrying a sprig of laurel protect a man from lightning many people thought so rather than being opulent or ostentatious the interior of the imperial house was decorated with great simplicity the columns were of travertine not marble the floors were paved with blackandwhite tiles in simple geometric patterns not decorated with colourful mosaics the walls were painted in solid colors not with the amazingly realistic landscapes lucius had occasionally seen in the houses of his wealthier acquaintances such as the acilii the several dining rooms that opened onto the central garden were spacious enough to accommodate a great many guests but the dining couches themselves were as humble as those in luciuss house the meal was simple as well when asparagus was served as the first course dipped in boiling water for just a moment so that it was cooked but still crisp claudius reclining next to lucius snapped a stalk in two and quipped quick as boiled asparagus just the way greatuncle likes it lucius had never seen his friend in such high spirits im a little surprised at how simply the imperial residence is furnished he said even the house of acilias father is more opulent are the private quarters equally austere more so greatuncle sleeps on a bed of straw and will have only backless chairs in the house a romans spine should be sufficiently stiff to hold him upright he says he believes in setting an example by practising oldfashioned virtues of decorum and restraint he expects his family to do the same when julilla his granddaughter built a mansion for herself on too grand a scale greatuncle had the whole thing ddddemolished i cant remember was that before or after he banished poor julilla to that island for committing adultery and then when she bbbore her lovers child greatuncle ordered that the baby be abandoned on a mountainside to die claudius bit a stalk of asparagus chewed loudly and swallowed hes banished julillas mother as well his own daughter likewise for scandalous conduct and his only surviving grandson agrippa he too failed to meet greatuncles standards and so ended up on an island somewhere so you see these spartan surroundings are not a pretense they are a genuine reflection of my uncles temperament in each of the dining areas a couch was set aside for the host who moved across the garden from room to room allowing all the guests the honour of his presence to lucius it seemed that the emperor was more an observer than a participant in the festivities saying little and eating nothing the old man appeared restless and distracted giving a start whenever there was a peal of thunder light rain occasionally swept across the garden and gusts of wind fanned the braziers that were lit as darkness fell hardly an hour after sundown with several courses yet to be served augustus strode to the center of the garden where all the guests could see him bade his fellow augurs good night and excused himself with the host gone the atmosphere became noticeably more relaxed a few guests dared to drink their wine without water but no one got drunk after a final course of carrots in a thick garum sauce the guests begins to disperse paying their respects to the new inductees before departing luciuss father was the last to leave youre not coming with me son claudius has invited me to take a stroll to the temple of apollo in this weather the temple is only a few steps away and its not raining now the sky could open at any moment if the storm grows worse lucius cccan spend the night here in my quarters offered claudius i suppose i can hardly object said the elder pinarius looking at once pleased and anxious that his son should become a welcome guest in the house of augustus the temple of apollo was surrounded by an ornate colonnade directly adjoining the imperial residence perched on the crest of the palatine hill directly above the circus maximus of all augustuss new constructions the temple of apollo was the most magnificent lit by flickering braziers from the surrounding colonnade with a light mist descending the temple appeared even more spectacular by night the glistening walls were made of solid blocks of white luna marble and the gilded chariot of the sun atop the roof seemed to be made of flame dominating the square in front of the entrance a marble statue of apollo loomed above an altar flanked by four bronze oxen in the flickering light the oxen seemed almost to be alive when lucius said so to claudius his friend explained that they were hundreds of years old the creations of the great myron famed for his muchcopied statue of the discus thrower at the top of the steps past the towering columns they came to two massive doors each decorated with reliefs in ivory by flashes of lightning lucius gazed at a fabulously detailed panel a riot of figures in violent motion young men and women running this way and that in a great panic some pierced by arrows and in the sky above them each wielding a bow the divine siblings apollo and artemis the slaying of the niobids of thebes claudius explained when their mother niobe boasted of having more offspring than leto the goddesss children took offense and slew them every one apollo shot the sons artemis shot the daughters niobe committed hubris overweening mortal pride and her children paid the price for it the dddescendants of powerful mortals often seem to pay a price simply for existing claudius looked thoughtful then turned and pointed with his lituus to the rectangle of sky framed by the nearest columns the lightning seems to be drawing closer look at that thunderbolt have you ever seen one like that the magister says that every possible manifestation of lightning has been catalogued and categorized over the years but that implies that lightning repeats itself as letters and words in a language repeat but i sometimes wonder if every thunderbolt is not unique to itself of course if that were so there could be no meaning in lightning at all or none that men could make sense of a great blackness darker than all the rest of the sky and filled with flashes of lightning was sweeping toward them from the southwest it was over the tiber now its fury reflected on the waters turbulent face lucius felt steeped in privilege to be standing with his friend a member of the imperial household on the threshold of the emperors greatest temple but at the same time he felt a slight thrill of fear for the approaching storm promised to be violent and the horrific images of the slaughtered niobids disturbed him he was here to pay homage to apollo but apollo could be a vengeful god claudius did not appear to share his anxiety did you know years ago this very spot was the site of the imperial residence then one day it was blasted by lightning and burned to the ground augustus declared that the gggods had marked this as a sacred site suitable only for a temple and got the senate to dedicate the funds to build not just the temple but the new imperial residence next to it the temple is magnificent as you can see and everyone thought greatuncle would build himself an equally magnificent palace but instead he made the new house exactly like the old one only a little bigger and with annexes to accommodate his growing staff claudius chuckled was augustus in the house when it was struck by lightning yes he was and that wasnt greatuncles first encounter with lightning he was very nearly kkkilled by a thunderbolt during a night march in the cantabarian campaign after my grandfather antonius was vanquished a flash of lightning grazed greatuncles litter and struck dead the slave who was carrying a torch before him after that narrow escape he dedicated a shrine to jupiter the thunderer there if you squint you can see it over on the capitoline looking very impressive when the lightning illuminates it ever since greatuncles had a morbid fear of lightning how he hates a thunderstorm im sure thats why he left the bbanquet early to take shelter under ground the man fears nothing and no one here on earth but he thinks that dddeath from the sky might still claim him as it did king romulus thats why he was wearing that amulet tonight he always wears it in stormy weather an amulet did you not notice lucius he was wearing an amulet made of sealskin for protection the way others carry a sprig of laurel sealskin just as the laurel is never struck by lightning neither is the sea calf its a scientific fact confirmed by all reliable authorities i myself prefer laurel he produced a sprig from inside his trabea i suppose i should have taken a sprig said lucius the lightning and thunder were coming closer the storm was almost upon them stay close to me perhaps my sprig will protect you theres an interesting story about those laurel trees at the entrance to the imperial house not long after livia was first betrothed to augustus she was riding in a carriage on a country road and a perfectly white hen dropped from the sky into her lap with a sprig of laurel in its beak livia bred the hen to use its offspring in auguries and planted the laurel from which a sacred grove sprang up on the imperial estate along the tiber as well as the two specimens that flank the doorway of the imperial house augustus wore wreaths from those laurel trees in his triumphal pro cessions ah but i digress you sometimes do lucius smiled then gave a start at a loud boom of thunder he heard the hissing of the rain as it swept towards them over the aventine well you did ask about the sealskin amulet and speaking of amulets ive been thththinking about the one you wear i believe i may have an idea of what it is he was interrupted by a flash of blinding light followed at once by a tremendous thundercrack lightning had struck the palatine somewhere very close to them do you think it struck the imperial house said lucius they ran to the end of the porch and peered towards the residence there was no sign of fire then a sudden downpour obscured everything beyond the temple steps wind blew rain onto the porch the pediment gave no protection claudius opened one of the tall doors they slipped inside the temple and closed the door behind them the air smelled of incense a giant statue of apollo dominated the sanctuary lit by flickering lamps mounted on the walls on this stormy night it seemed to lucius that the place had an eerie magic the air itself carried a charge of excitement gazing up at the god lucius felt hackles rise on the back of his neck with an uncanny certainty he knew that something very important was going to happen that night he looked behind him claudius was sitting on a marble bench against one wall already nodding his jaw hanging open and a bit of drool suspended from his lower lip truly anyone who saw him at that moment would have assumed he was an idiot poor claudius the uncanny sensation subsided lucius sat beside claudius listening to him softly snore and waited for the raging storm to subside when the massive door began to swing inwards he gave a start had he been dozing and for how long a man entered the temple dressed in the tunic of an imperial servant and carrying a torch claudius are you here claudius claudius woke he clutched luciuss arm and wiped a bit of drool from his chin what whos there euphranor it was one of the emperors most trusted freedmen his hair was black but his beard was almost entirely white ive been looking everywhere for you he approached and handed claudius a wax tablet of the sort that could be written on rubbed flat and written over by the light of the torch claudius peered at the tablet in a crabbed elderly hand was written the quaint phrase come quick as asparagus with the word asparagus marked through and the word lightning scrawled above a message written in greatuncles own hand declared claudius obviously surprised the man has an army of scribes to take his dictation at any moment of the day or night why in his own hand what can he want so urgently and why quick as lightning lucius suddenly felt out of place i suppose i should go home now while the storm still rages no no youll come with me are you sure greatuncle didnt say for you not to come follow me cousin quick as asparagus euphranor lead the way pelted by rain they followed euphranor back to the house past the dining rooms and the garden where rain descended in a torrent and then through a series of doors and a maze of hallways at last they came to a narrow doorway that opened onto a flight of stairs leading down ill stay here said euphranor youll find him at the bottom of the steps claudius descended the long steep winding flight of stairs with lucius following at last they arrived in a lamplit subterranean room lucius saw at once that the ceiling and the walls were decorated with mosaics the thousands of tiny tiles glinted and shimmered among the dazzling images he recognized king romulus with his long beard and iron crown another image could only be the infant twins romulus and his brother remus adrift on the tiber in a basket another image showed romulus being carried up to the heavens on a ray of light sent by jupiter there were many more images all illustrating stories from the life of the founder what is he doing here lucius turned to see augustus standing closer than lucius had ever seen the man before what terrible teeth the emperor had all yellow and decayed and how short he was wearing slippers instead of the thicksoled shoes that usually made him taller lucius told himself he should be at least a little awed but the presence of the emperor was underwhelming in his younger days the fairhaired octavius was said to have been the bestlooking boy in roma so pretty that his uncle julius caesar took him for a lover so went the whispered rumour and in later days the boy octavius who became the man augustus had commanded sufficient authority to bend whole nations to his will but at that moment lucius saw only a little old man with rotten teeth unkempt strawcoloured hair tufts of hair in his nostrils and bushy eyebrows that met above his nose eye to eye with the ruler of the world lucius was buoyed by a curious sense of confidence remembering the premonition he had experienced in the temple of apollo that something very important was about to happen shall i send him away greatuncle said claudius augustus stared at lucius so long and hard that luciuss confidence began to waver the old man finally spoke no young lucius pinarius may stay he is an augur now is he not and his ancestors were among the very first augurs in roma a pinarius accompanied romulus when he took the auspices and before that the pinarii were keepers of the peoples first shrine the great altar of hercules the state assumed that duty over years ago perhaps i should return the great altar to the hereditary keeping of the pinarii reviving ancient traditions is pleasing to the gods and he is a blood relation for what ever thats worth perhaps lucius pinarius the gods themselves delivered you here to me tonight lucius averted his eyes humbled by the emperors scrutiny he stared at the mosaics above them images from the life of romulus as you no doubt perceive explained augustus the chamber in which we stand is the lupercale the sacred cave where the foundling twins romulus and remus were suckled by the shewolf i myself discovered the cave when the foundations for this house were being laid and under my directions its been decorated as a sacred shrine the mosaics are exquisite said lucius yes there you see the twins suckled by the shewolf and there the rescue of remus by his brother the slaying of king amulius and the taking of his iron crown there the sighting of the vultures and romulus plowing a furrow to mark the city boundaries there the first triumphal procession and the kings ascent to the heavens during a thunderstorm lucius nodded he recalled something claudius had told him that the emperor had considered taking the name romulus as a title rather than augustus but ultimately rejected the name as unlucky romulus murdered his brother after all and though legend said that romulus was taken alive by the gods to olympus some historians believed he was murdered by conspiring senators of course one cannot take the legends too literally claudius noted pointing to the image of the suckling shewolf my tutor titus livius says that our ancestors used the same word lupa to mean either a shewolf or a whore livius suggests that the twins may have been raised not by a wild beast but by a common prostitute dont be impious nephew snapped augustus and seemed about to say more when a crack of thunder shook the room the emperor frantically reached for the sealskin amulet he wore on a chain around his neck even here so deep under ground the earth shakes he whispered is it possible the house has been struck by lightning two times in one night his rheumy eyes flashed with something lucius could only interpret as fear why did you sssummon us greatuncle asked claudius quietly ill show you now though to do so well have to leave the safety of the lupercale augustus frowned then braced himself and led the way up the stairs taking them slowly euphranor was waiting for them at the top of the steps at augustuss order the freedman brought each of them a torch to carry when you see the omen claudius youll understand why no one else must know of this no one augustus turned to lucius do you understand as well young man any omen that regards my person is a state secret and must never be divulged theres no telling how it might be used by those who wish me harm to divulge such a secret is a crime punishable by death he led them to a courtyard the neatly trimmed hedges and paving stones glistened the rain had relented only a light mist descended on them the courtyard was dominated by a bronze statue of the emperor himself painted in lifelike colors did he ever look like that wondered lucius for the statue of the serenely selfassured handsome young warrior scarcely resembled the shaken old man standing beside him as they stepped closer to the statue luciuss torch illuminated something on the ground on the far side of the pedestal it was the dead body of a young man dressed in the charred remains of what once had been the tunic of an imperial slave look there cried augustus wisps of smoke still rise from the corpse he burns from the inside like a coal in a brazier claudius pursed his lips this slave he was kkkilled by the first lightning bolt the one that struck while lucius and i were in the temple of apollo yes lightning struck the statue the slave must have been standing too close see the damage to the statue the places where the paint has been scorched the way the ivory inlays for the whites of the eyes have turned black augustus sucked in his breath by hercules the statue has been struck again by that second lightning bolt the one we felt down in the lupercale its incredible impossible protested claudius all authorities agree lightning nnnever strikes the same spot twice such a thing is unheard of and yet its true the bronze plaque on the pedestal wasnt damaged before i swear to jupiter it wasnt but now see how the letter c is missing blasted into nothing augustus swallowed hard his face was ashen looking closer lucius saw that the damage was just as the emperor had described on the bronze plaque with an embossed inscription the first letter of caesar had been melted away leaving almost no trace what does it mean claudius asked augustus such freaks of nature are always signs from the gods useless as you are for most things skulking in that library of yours you do know everything there is to know about omens claudius touched his fingertips to the scorched bronze plaque then quickly drew them back too hot to touch he gasped then stared at the plaque and whispered aesar whats that you say claudius shrugged i was simply reading the word that remains without the letter c but aesar is not a word i think it might be in etruscan im not sure then find out tttime greatuncle it will take time to properly interpret such an omen do you not agree lucius we must know to the minute the time of the two lightning strikes we must know the name of the dead slave even the name of the sculptor who made this statue might be significant i must retire to my library to look through the literature to ccconsult my etruscan dictionaries to study previous omens derived from lightning how long will this take claudius furrowed his brow then brightened lucius will help me as you yourself noted greatuncle its no accident that lucius was with me when you sent that summons together i promise you lucius and i will determine the meaning of this omen do it quickly ququick as asparagus greatuncle claudius smiled crookedly and wiped a bit of drool from the corner of his mouth perhaps our fortunes are about to improve lucius said claudius weve just been given a very important task by the emperor himself that makes us important men wed better get started they were in claudiuss library the room was brightly lit by many lamps lucius had never seen so many scrolls and scraps of parchment in one place all neatly even obsessively filed and sorted there were histories maps calendars and genealogies there were detailed lists of every magistrate who had ever served the roman state there were numerous dictionaries not just of latin but of greek egyptian parthian the punic tongue that had died with carthage the virtually defunct etruscan language and even languages lucius had never heard of there were sketches of historic sites claudius has visited together with his personal notes and copies of inscriptions taken from statues and other monuments searching among the documents claudius found a scroll of heavy parchment unrolled it on a small table and placed weights to hold down the corners a large circle drawn on the parchment was divided into quarters by a vertical line and a horizontal line and surrounded by notations though he knew little about astrology lucius recognized it as a horoscope and not just any horoscope but that of the emperor himself said claudius this is an exact copy of the very horoscope that was cast for the young octavius by the astrologer theogenes of apollonia surely you know the story no ah well then claudius cleared his throat this was back in the days when the divine julius was still on earth though very near the end of his life he decided to send his nephew to be educated at apollonia on the west coast of greece for a companion octavius took along his dear friend marcus agrippa the boys decided to have their horoscopes cast by the famous theogenes agrippa went first telling the astrologer the exact time and place of his birth theogenes disappeared into his study while the boys waited the horoscope that resulted was so fffavourable theogenes swore he had never seen one to match it that octavius decided not to have his done after all for fear that it would pale beside that of his friend but agrippa pressed him teased him mercilessly i should imagine until octavius relented and gave the astrologer the information he needed again the boys waited when theogenes finally emerged from his study he fell to his knees before octavius in awe and declared that octavius would become the master of the world they say though i have never been able to verify this for certain that the horoscope was delivered to octavius at the very moment that his uncle was murdered back in roma ever since that day the emperor has been so sure of his dddestiny that hes made no secret of the hour of his birth he even puts his sign capricornus on his ccoinage if anything merits classification as a state secret youd think its the emperors horoscope yet here it is for you and me to study just as theogenes cast it and since we have access to the information we might as well use it but claudius i know nothing about astrology then you shall leave this room knowing more than when you entered but the magister says that augury is sufficient for all divinations i suspect the magister is a bit envious of the increasing popularity of astrology i myself see no conflict between the principles of augury and the study of astral science any thoughtful person must perceive that heavenly bodies exert an influence on objects both animate and inanimate certain effects of the sun and moon are obvious they cause vegetation to grow determine when animals sleep and rut and control the tides likewise the stars control storms and floods which can be observed to come and go according to the rise and fall of certain constellations this influence is invisible as is the influence of a magnet considering the allpervasive nature of this invisible influence it would be irrational to presume that it does not exert an effect on human beings it was the babylonians who first charted the movements of the stars and created a vocabulary to describe their influence on humankind after alexander the great conquered persia the study of astrology spread to greece and egypt it was the babylonian priest berossus who moved to cos founded the first astrological school in greece and translated the eye of bel into greek it was bolus of egypt who wrote sympathies and antipathies which remains the standard textbook ive almost worn my copy out lucius stared at the horoscope puzzling over the mathematical calculations and the notations about houses signs and planets do you really think the solution to the lightning omen lies in the emperors horoscope i wouldnt be surprised if it has some role to play in our research but i think we should begin by consulting my etruscan dictionaries to see if im right about this word aesar all night the storm continued rattling the shutters pelting the roof with rain and shaking the ground with thunder while lucius and claudius pored over various texts from time to time slaves brought them food and drink and replenished the lamps when the oil ran low lucius was not aware that dawn had broken until he heard a cock crow claudius opened the shutters the storm had passed the sky was clear but the pale morning sunshine could not dispel the grim mood in the room they had succeeded in interpreting the omen perhaps we could tell him that the omen defeated us that we discovered nothing said lucius claudius shook his head he wont accept that hed be able to tell at once that we were hiding something then perhaps hell simply dismiss our interpretation why should he believe the two youngest augurs in roma because our interpretation is correct as he will see for himself greatuncle has a deep and abiding faith in omens the outcome of every one of his bbbattles was foretold by an omen which he himself divined the eagle that drove away two ravens at bononia which foretold his eventual triumph over his fellow triumvirs the shade of caesar that appeared before philippi the driver and ass he met on the road before the battle of actium one named eutychus and the other nicon greek for prosper and victory and now this omen which we have no choice but to dddeliver euphranor accompanied them up several flights of steps to the high manywindowed chamber where the emperor awaited them this was the room as claudius informed lucius in a whisper that augustus called his little syracuse because the great syracusan inventor archimedes had had such a room in his house isolated from the rest of the building augustuss secluded retreat was cluttered with mementos there were architects models of various of his buildings including a miniature temple of apollo in ivory there were war trophies including a captured ships beak from the battle of actium where the naval skills of agrippa had soundly defeated antonius and cleopatra there were exotic egyptian treasures brought back from alexandria where antonius and cleopatra had escaped capture only by committing suicide draped upon a statue of the divine julius was a red cape a bit faded and motheaten that had been worn by the great man himself at his last great battle at munda in spain there were also more personal mementos including toy ships and catapults that had belonged to the emperors deceased grandsons when lucius and claudius entered augustus was fiddling with a pair of baby shoes such tiny feet he has little gaius these just arrived from the german frontier claudius with a note from your brother your little nephew has just outgrown these so germanicus sends them to me as a keepsake charming arent they i suppose germanicus and agrippina think they can induce me to name their twoyearold as my heir well your older brother isnt a bad sort and agrippina is the only one of my grandchildren who turned out to be not completely useless little gaius is my greatgrandchild and they say the boy is healthy so perhaps there is some hope for the future after all his voice trailed away he stared at the tiny shoes for a long time before he finally put them down among the castoff toys the emperor appeared to have suffered as sleepless a night as had the two younger men and he looked much worse for it he had changed from his trabea into a tunic so drab and worn that lucius would not have been surprised to see a slave wearing it the emperors voice was hoarse and there was a rattle in his throat so what have you discovered claudius stepped forward but when he opened his mouth to speak nothing came out for a moment he was as stiff and silent as a statue then suddenly he began to twitch and stammer jerking this way and that and making incoherent noises lucius gripped his shoulder to steady him but the twitching only grew worse he had never seen claudius so severely afflicted by his infirmities augustus grunted and rolled his eyes jupiter help me you then yes you lucius pinarius speak luciuss heart pounded and he felt something thick pressing inside his throat for a moment he feared that he was about to have a fit like claudius then he managed to take a breath and the words tumbled out we believe that is claudius and i that our examination of the literature and our study of certain precedents precedents pertaining specifically to lightning and to to statues and the etruscan language which we found in the literature by hercules youre as useless as my nephew say what you have to say lucius felt lightheaded and dazed from lack of sleep but he pressed on for example in the days of tarquin the last king one of his statues was struck by lightning which did damage only to the inscription which was written in both latin and etruscan well you can see how the precedent applies here in that instance the numeral x was defaced in four places as were the etruscan words tinia meaning days and huznatre meaning a group of young men no one could interpret the omen but its meaning became clear when forty days later a company of forty young warriors literally ran tarquin and his sons from the city ending the monarchy and establishing the republic it became clear then that the four xs defaced by lightning meant forty and referred to both the days remaining in tarquins reign and the number of warriors who would drive him out and there is a further example enough of this antiquarian drivel you try my patience lucius pinarius deliver the omen clearly at once lucius took a deep breath as claudius thought aesar is an old etruscan word it means a deity or divine spirit and of course c the letter that was melted away by the lightning is also the symbol for one hundred the presence of the dead slave was an indication of mortality a small death foreshadowing a great one when these facts are assembled and the relevant precedents considered the details of which you would have me omit then we must conclude that the omen of the two lightning strikes indicates this that in one hundred days the person portrayed by the statue will leave the world of mortals and join the gods the colour abruptly drained from the emperors face like wine from a cup his expression became so strange and his voice so thin that lucius almost believed the shadow before him was the lemur of a man already dead what are you saying young man are you telling me that i have only one hundred days to live nnninetynine actually said claudius suddenly able to speak but keeping his head down and his eyes averted the omen occurred yesterday so we mmmust subtract he abruptly looked up as if surprised to hear his own voice and fell silent augustus was quiet for a long moment will it be an easy death the omen gives no indication regarding the manner of death said lucius augustus nodded slowly ive always envied those who died easily the greeks have a word for it euthanasia good death that is all i hope for euthanasia i accept that i cannot control the time and place that will be chosen by others but i wish to go as quietly and as painlessly as possible with my dignity intact he turned away from them drew himself upright and composed himself you understand that you must repeat this to no one now go you are both dismissed as he was leaving the room lucius looked back to see the emperor pick up the baby shoes of his greatgrandson and stare at them ashenfaced and with tears in his eyes euphranor was nowhere to be seen they found their own way down the steps its almost as if he was expecting it said lucius he felt utterly drained perhaps he was expecting it ppperhaps it was what he wanted to hear what do you mean claudius do you think your greatuncle is contemplating suicide or that he fears being murdered what did augustus mean about not being able to control the time and place of his death that will be chosen by others he said what others the gods claudius shrugged hes an old mmman lucius you and i cant begin to imagine all the terrible things hes seen all the terrible things hes done life has brought him a great deal of disappointment especially in the last few years so many ddeaths in the family so much strife he drew a sharp breath speaking of which coming towards them down the hallway imposing despite her advanced age and the unassuming nature of her dress was claudiuss grandmother the wife of augustus did nothing to colour her hair or mask her wrinkles and wore a stola simple enough to please even her luxuryhating husband yet livia projected an undeniable aura of privilege and power walking beside her in an equally simple tunic was her son claudiuss uncle tiberius a robustly built man of middle age with a dour expression by all accounts augustus intended to make tiberius his heir despite the fact that his stepson was not a blood relation claudius and lucius stepped to one side but instead of passing by livia and her son came to a stop before them claudius swallowed hard then began to introduce lucius but he stuttered so badly that livia cut him short with a wave of her hand never mind grandson i know who this is young lucius pinarius she looked them up and down and raised an eyebrow curious that the two of you should still be wearing your trabeas from yesterday off to take the auspices at this early hour or did you never go to bed yes from the look of you i think youve been up all night but doing what i wonder not celebrating or else youd smell of wine she stared at lucius who was at a loss for an answer the emperor had explicitly ordered them to speak of the omen to no one livia seemed amused by his discomfort cant you see that im teasing you young man nothing that happens in this house is a secret to me im perfectly aware that lightning struck my husbands statue last night not once but twice while im amazed that he would entrust the interpretation of such an omen to the likes of you two id be curious to know what you came up with no answer ah well i shall simply ask him myself lucius glanced at claudius it was obvious that he lived in fear of his grandmother tiberius apparently did not frighten him as much for claudius dared to reach out and tap the sprig of laurel pinned to the mans tunic from last nnnight uncle the storm is over and you need the laurels protection no longer but i should think an atheist like yourself had no fffear of lightning claudius turned to lucius uncle tiberius has no faith in the gods and thus no belief in ddivination if there are no gods there is no point in trying to discern their will uncle tiberius spurns augury he puts his faith entirely in astrology tiberius looked at claudius glumly that is correct nephew the stars decide when a man is born and when he dies and the stars determine the course of his life the logic is undeniable some mechanism unimaginably huge must control the movements of the stars which in turn control our tiny lives we mortals are many times removed from whatever primal force animates the cosmos then the stars control humanity rather as the mmmechanism of a ballista controls the trajectory of its missile suggested claudius or the cogs and gears of a water wheel control the mmmovements of a leaf caught in the channel is that all we are uncle tiberius missiles hurtling through space or leaves on a torrent not bad metaphors claudius especially for someone who believes lightning is an omen tiberius sniggered and shook his head only a fool or a child could believe that lightning is a weapon thrown down by some malicious giant in the clouds lightning is a natural phenomenon which occurs according to very precise if very complicated rules just like the movement of the stars i believe in science claudius not superstition livia sighed bored by the turn of the conversation she took her sons arm and indicated her desire to move on claudius watched until they disappeared around a corner gnashing his teeth there goes the next emperor is it certain hell succeed augustus theres always a chance the old man will chchchange his mind about agrippa hes augustuss only surviving grandson after all and only two years older than you and me young enough to enjoy a long reign agrippas banishment was livias doing i suspect people who stand in her way have a habit of either dying or disappearing uncle tiberius is the last man standing so tiberius is the heir apparent its probably for the best the bleeding wound of the german frontier is the biggest problem facing the empire right now and tiberius is a ccompetent general even if he is an atheist i fear lucius that our aptitude for divination will not serve us as well under the next emperor as it has under our present one served us well i dont see how ive been well served by any of this lucius snapped suddenly feeling completely undone by lack of sleep and the strain of meeting the emperors demands he lowered his voice to a whisper what if our prediction becomes known and the emperor doesnt die in a hundred days i shall look like a fool nnninetynine days actually and if he does die then you shall look like a young fellow wise beyond his years or will people hold us responsible for his death whats that old etruscan saying men blame the soothsayer oh no lucius if the emperor dies its not you and me whom people will suspect claudius glanced towards the spot where they had last seen livia and tiberius you might do well to take up a new study lucius how much astrology do you think you can learn in nninetynine days perhaps father we should go to the temple of apollo on the palatine and pray said lucius by his careful reckoning exactly days had passed since lightning had struck the emperors statue the date on which he and claudius had predicted that augustus would be taken by the gods had come and gone but the accuracy of the prophecy was still uncertain augustus was away from roma and since news could arrive no faster than the pace of a quick horse there was no way to know whether something had happened to augustus or not but the latest news which lucius and his father went seeking in the forum each day was unsettling intending to journey to beneventum accompanying tiberius partway on a mission to begin new military operations in illyria augustus had fallen ill he was said to be recuperating at his retreat on the island of capri suffering from a minor irregularity of the bowels again today lucius and his father had come to the forum anxious for further news of the emperors condition prayer is to be commended said luciuss father but why the temple of apollo because that was where this all began the night of the storm lucius recalled the uncanny premonition he had experienced just before euphranor had come to summon claudius ah but what would we pray for his father lowered his voice and looked around they were not far from the temple of vesta on a busy stretch of the sacred way several vestals were leaving the round temple with their attendants and a group of senators in togas was nearby some of them nodded and hailed the elder pinarius before passing on father and son retreated to a more secluded spot on the far side of the temple of castor as i was saying son for what would you have us pray surely not for the emperors death that would be treason yet if we pray that the emperor should not die in accordance with the omen then are we not praying to thwart the will of the gods not for the first time lucius regretted confiding in his father if anything the elder pinarius was more nervous than lucius about the omen and its outcome and had he not put his father in danger by telling him about the omen against the emperors explicit orders yet lucius could hardly have borne the strain of waiting alone then let us pray for neither of those things father let us pray for the wellbeing of the roman state suggested lucius ah you remind me of your late grandfather said the elder pinarius with a dry laugh the old man was a master at finding the middle path youre right of course we shall go to the senate house and make an offering there they crossed the forum walking past the massive buildings augustus had erected to house the imperial bureaucracy they passed the ancient speakers platform called the rostra decorated by capturedships beaks where the great orators of the republic had harangued the voters of roma the rostra was little used these days the senate house was relatively new having been begun by julius caesar just before his assassination and completed by augustus the exterior was quite austere compared to the elaborately coloured and decorated temples nearby i was present when the emperor dedicated this building recalled the elder pinarius still a boy not yet wearing my manly toga i practically grew up here watching debates with your grandfather taking notes and carrying messages for him long before i became a senator myself they ascended the steps and entered in contrast to the exterior the chamber was exquisitely finished gilded railings and plush red draperies divided the various spaces within the vast room polished marble adorned the walls and floors windows set high in the walls filled the lofty space with light the senate was not meeting on this day but there were plenty of members about idly conversing or tending to business with their secretaries under the autocratic rule of augustus the senate still performed numerous bureaucratic functions the continuing survival of the ancient institution helped to maintain the official fiction that roma was still a republic and the emperor was merely the first among equals not the master of his fellow citizens but the devoted servant of all lucius and his father approached the altar of victory the altar itself was made of green marble adorned with elaborate carvings of laurel leaves looming beyond and above the altar was a towering statue of the goddess victory surrounded by a sampling of the spoils of war taken by augustus these displays were changed from time to time on this day the spoils on exhibit included the iron prow of an egyptian warship taken at actium fashioned in the shape of a crocodiles head there was also a selection of queen cleopatras royal jewellery including a carnelian necklace and one of the queens tall atef crowns made of ivory with inlays of gold and lapis the elder pinarius began the ritual performed by every senator upon entering the chamber he burned a bit of incense on the altar poured a libation of wine and recited a prayer goddess grant victory to roma and defeat to her enemies watch over the empire which you delivered to augustus protect roma from all those who would cause her harm whether from without or from within they stepped back from the altar luciuss father shook his head as he repeated in a whisper the final words of the prayer enemies from without or from within that last part was meant to apply to people like marcus antonius and your grandfather what a mess the old man made of his inheritance he too was a greatnephew of the divine julius no less than augustus he too was named an heir though he was given a smaller share he too might have risen to greatness but how he loved that scoundrel antonius to please antonius he made an enemy of his own cousin augustus never quite trusted your grandfathers late conversion to the winning side the emperor spared him but excluded him from playing any role in the new regime the pinarii was set to one side neither persecuted nor rewarded the forgotten heirs of julius caesar the wistful tone of his voice suddenly turned bitter and through all our financial difficulties augustus has never so much as tossed a sesterce our way he left unspoken the hope that he and lucius had already discussed privately and in whispers that perhaps things would soon change if the emperor should die tiberius would almost certainly take his place and tiberius had no reason to treat the pinarii like outcasts perhaps the family fallingout between augustus and luciuss grandfather could finally be forgotten if lucius could please the new emperor there was no reason why he should not move forward in life towards that end following claudiuss advice and with an aim towards pleasing the future emperor lucius had begun to study the babylonian science of astrology and though claudius carried little weight with tiberius he was nonetheless a member of the imperial family and perhaps his growing friendship with lucius might yet bring some benefit to the pinarii even as luciuss thoughts turned to claudius his friend appeared at the entrance to the senate house claudius looked this way and that appearing flustered and confused then spotted lucius and hurried to him i thought i sssaw you earlier in the forum ive been looking everywhere for you lucius raised his eyebrows is there news claudius shook his head nothing to report but i do have something else to tell you something quite interesting perhaps it will at least take your mind off the mmmatter that is preoccupying us all he looked around the chamber at the clusters of senators in hushed conversation and the secretaries scurrying to and fro and cringed i cant stand the atmosphere in this place all the stuffy formality and selfimportance come lets find a more comfortable spot to talk i know where we can go he led them across the forum through the valley between the capitoline and the palatine all the way to the waterfront their destination was a tavern on the docks as they stepped inside and their eyes adjusted to the darkness lucius wrinkled his nose at the smell a combination of spilled wine unwashed humanity and the effluvia of the cloaca maxima which emptied into the tiber nearby the handful of patrons were the types who habituated taverns in the middle of the day actors sailors prostitutes and gamblers claudius heaved a sigh of relief thank the gods for a place where i can feel at ease no one staring at me no one cccarping at me expressing their disapproval and disappointment here i can be myself are you sure its proper for someone from the imperial household to be seen in such an establishment luciuss father looked askance at the clientele he hung back for a moment then sat on a bench beside his son across from claudius why not quite a few of greatuncles freedmen patronize this tavern why it was euphranor who first showed me this place theres no one more trusted by the emperor ive seen the mmman on this very bench so drunk on cheap wine he couldnt stand up you said you had something to tell us said luciuss father he looked up at the buxom serving girl who had brought cups and a pitcher of wine just a splash of wine no more fill the rest of the cup with water lucius gave the same order as his father but claudius drank his wine neat he drained a whole cup then ordered another before he spoke its about that amulet that family heirloom of yours i see youre wearing it today lucius lucius touched the lump of gold at his breast i have been ccconsulting with my old tutor titus livius said claudius his speech slightly slurred of course youve read his history of the city from its earliest beginnings no neither of you not even the parts about your own family most people at least have a slave search through the scrolls to find the mentions of their ancestors claudius shook his head well my conversations with livius have confirmed my initial belief that this talisman can be identified as a fascinum in other words long ago before the details were worn away it would have depicted a magical phallus probably a winged phallus considering the shape if you squint and use a bit of imagination you can visualize the amulet as it originally appeared without asking he reached out and took hold of the talisman pulling the necklace towards him and lucius along with it yes look here is the shaft and here the ttestes and here the two little wings claudius released the amulet lucius took it between his fingers and gazed down at it feeling profoundly disappointed a fascinum such trinkets were exceedingly common worn for protection by women in childbirth and put around the necks of infants to protect them from the harmful gaze of the envious the socalled evil eye even slaves wore them so thats all it is lucius said nothing but a common fascinum claudius wagged his finger ah hardly cccommon no this fascinum is special very special indeed if my conjectures are correct it could be the oldest such amulet in existence these days a fascinum is thought of as a mere trinket a goodluck charm one sees them made of cheap metal hanging from the necks of slaves hardly anyone remembers the god fascinus from whom such amulets take their name but the winged phallus appears in some of the most ancient stories told by our ancestors such a manifestation appeared in the hearthfire to the mother of king servius tullius and even earlier another such manifestation appeared to one of the kings of alba tarketios and demanded to have intercourse with his daughter no god who takes such a form was ever described by the greeks or indeed by any of the peoples that roma has conquered we may conclude that the god fascinus appeared exclusively to our ancestors and must have played some role in the origins of roma furthermore not every fascinum is a mere trinket one of the holiest objects of the state religion is the sacred fascinum in the keeping of the vestal virgins ive seen the thing myself its larger than life and very heavy made of solid gggold for centuries the virgo maxima has placed it in a hidden spot under the ceremonial chariot driven by generals during their triumphal pro cessions to ward off the evil eye you could count on one hand the people who know the origin of this cccustom titus livius the virgo maxima myself and probably no one else since you pinarii seem to have neglected to pass the story down through the generations are you saying a pinarius was involved in the origin of this custom said luciuss father he had been distracted earlier by the gambling with dice and certain lewd behaviour that was going on in the shadows elsewhere in the tavern but now claudius had his full attention i am saying exactly that the cccustom of placing a fascinum beneath the triumphal chariot originated with a vestal who had a special devotion to fascinus and her name was pinaria oh yes without a doubt she came from the pinarius family this pinaria served under the virgo maxima foslia in the days when the gauls captured the city some years ago back in those days amulets like your fascinum were not at all common indeed i can find only one reference to a fascinum that dates as far back as the time of pinaria now listen closely because this is where the story gets tricky especially when youve had as much wine to drink as i have thanks to the exhaustive history of roma written by fabius pictor who paid special attention to the contributions of his own family the fabii i dont suppose youve read that either i have discovered a reference to a gggold fascinum worn by a certain kaeso fabius dorso this kaeso was the adopted son of the famous warrior gaius fabius dorso who was trapped atop the capitoline hill when the gauls occupied the city along with the vestal pinaria they were trapped on the capitoline for about nine months almost immediately after their liberation gaius fabius dorso adopted an infant he named kaeso whose parentage is unknown given these circumstances it is not hard to imagine that this kaeso was the love child of the vestal pinaria and gaius fabius dorso and that the gold fascinum he was known to wear was a gift from his mother the same woman who originated the custom of placing a fascinum under the triumphal chariot claudius leaned back against the wall looking pleased with himself and waved to the serving girl to bring more wine the elder pinarius frowned in the first place the notion of a vestal secretly and criminally bearing a child is distasteful to any respectable person but hardly unknown said claudius i assure you the history of the vestals is full of such indiscretions some made public and punished but many others covered up thus the old joke show me a vestal whos a virgin and ill show you an ugly vestal luciuss father did not laugh even so if one accepts that this kaeso fabius dorso was the love child of the vestal pinaria and that she gave him a gold fascinum what does that have to do with amulet handed down by my father and worn by lucius claudius gazed at him in drunken disbelief you pinarii what sort of pppatricians are you not to know every root branch and twig of your family tree you are kaeso fabius dorsos direct descendants are you not aware of the fabia who was your manytimes greatgrandmother from the era of scipio africanus oh yes i am certain of the lineage i have the genealogical proof in my library and so we may conjecture that the fascinum you wear lucius an ancient object which has been handed down through many gggenerations is the very fascinum that was worn by your ancestor kaeso fabius dorso which i conjecture came from the vestal pinaria from whom did pinaria inherit it who knows it may go back much much further in time that little lump of ggold is almost certainly the oldest specimen of a fascinum that i have ever encountered we might even conjecture that it is the fascinum the original prototype that predates even the fascinum of the vestal virgins perhaps it was created by the god fascinus himself or by his first worshippers the pinarii who also founded and tended the great altar of hercules long before the city of roma was founded claudius opened his eyes wide overwhelmed by his own erudition talking made him thirsty he swallowed the wine in his cup and ordered more the pinarius family is very ancient even more ancient than my own my ancestor the sabine warlord appius claudius arrived relatively late in roma in the first years of the republic but you pinarii were here before the republic before the kings even before there was a city in the days when dddemigods like hercules roamed the earth and that little trinket that hangs from your neck dear lucius is a direct link back to those days lucius looked down at the fascinum duly impressed but still a bit dubious but claudius were not even sure that this is a fascinum lucius lucius i have an instinct for such things and my instinct is nnever wrong is that what history amounts to asked lucius looking through old lists and scraps of parchment making genealogies connecting odd facts and then leaping to conclusions based on guesses or instinct or wishful thinking exactly you put your finger on the very essence of history said claudius with a drunken laugh lucius had never seen him so inebriated or so relaxed it occurred to him that claudius had stuttered very little since they had arrived at the tavern to be sure lucius history unlike divination is an inexact science that is because history deals with the past which is gone forever and which neither gods nor men can alter or revisit but divination deals with the present and the future and the will of the gods which has yet to be revealed divining is an exact science provided the diviner has sufficient knowledge and skill claudius glanced at the entrance and gave a start he sat upright and his eyes grew wide like a messenger in a ppplay arriving at the appropriate moment the newcomer was euphranor entering the dark room from the bright outdoors he did not see them until claudius called and waved to him looking for mmme euphranor actually no i just arrived in the city and i need a drink then jjjoin us claudius made room on the bench and patted the spot beside him euphranor sat with a wince saddlesore he explained id prefer to stand but im too exhausted his cloak and tunic were covered with dust what nnews euphranor for the love of venus man let me have a drink first euphranor called for the serving girl and downed two cups in rapid succession he stared blearily at lucius and his father and seemed reluctant to speak go on euphranor said claudius you can speak freely surely you remember lucius pinarius the other fellow is his father euphranor closed his eyes for a long moment then spoke in a voice just above a whisper im the first to arrive with the news so not a man in roma knows this yet the emperor is dead numas balls whispered claudius now we all need another drink he waved to the serving girl when euphranor five days ago claudius and lucius exchanged glances augustus had died exactly one hundred days after the lightning strike where in the town of nola thats just east of mount vesuvius why has it taken so long for the nnnews to reach roma the delay was by order of tiberius but why euphranor grunted i can only tell you the sequence of events augustus died tiberius gave strict orders that no one was to make the news public until he allowed it some days later a messenger arrived with news that young agrippa is dead the emperors grandson said luciuss father killed by the soldiers guarding him on the island where he was in exile after that message arrived tiberius told me to ride to roma as fast as i could and deliver the news to the imperial staff i see whispered claudius uncle tiberius held off making augustuss death public until agrippa was disposed of thats what you mmmean poor agrippa ive only told you the sequence of events i wont speculate on the whys or wherefores said euphranor with the blank expression so often assumed by imperial servants when he received the message about agrippas death tiberius immediately and publicly disavowed any responsibility claudius nodded its possible that augustus left instructions that agrippa be killed upon his death or that livia forged such instructions technically uncle tiberius may be innocent of agrippas mmmurder but claudius what will become of you said lucius me harmless stuttering halfwitted claudius i shall be left to my bbooks and my lituus i imagine the serving girl came to pour more wine luciuss father waved aside her offer of water and took his cup fullstrength lucius did likewise how did the emperor die said claudius euphranor suddenly seemed to fade done in by exhaustion and wine his shoulders slumped and his face went slack wed left capri and were on our way back to roma the emperor had been unwell weakness a pain in his stomach loose bowels but he seemed to have gotten better but on the road he took a turn for the worse we made a detour to the family house at nola the emperor took to bed in the very room where his father died he was lucid almost until the end he seemed resigned to his death he even seemed a bit amused he assembled his family and travelling companions including livia and tiberius and myself and he quoted a line from some play like an actor seeking approval if i have played my role in this farce with convincing ease then applaud me please applaud applaud and we did that seemed to please him but at the very end he became restless and frightened he saw things no one else could see he cried out a word in etruscan huznatre and then theyre carrying me off forty young men are carrying me off and then it was over claudius and lucius exchanged knowing looks a dying mans delusion said luciuss father not a delusion but a prophecy said euphranor tiberius has arranged for forty praetorians to form an honour guard that will carry the emperors body back into the city ad it was a bright morning in the month of maius on this day so long awaited lucius pinarius and acilia would become husband and wife their marriage had finally been made possible thanks to the generosity of the late augustus in his will besides naming livia and tiberius as his chief heirs augustus had made numerous smaller but still very generous bequests among these was a large sum left to lucius pinarius the gossips of roma who pored over the details of the will like etruscan soothsayers scrutinizing entrails assumed that this bequest was the emperors way of making amends after a lifetime of ignoring his cousins the pinarii and perhaps it was but lucius assumed that the inheritance was also a kind of fee paid posthumously to him for his role in divining the lightning omen for whatever reason augustus had made lucius a wealthy man yet even with luciuss new wealth acilias father had insisted on a lengthy engagement this gave lucius time to pay off the familys debts to invest the money left over in the egyptian grain trade renewing his grandfathers old business associations and to buy and furnish a house for himself and his bridetobe he could not afford property on the palatine but he was able to buy a house on the more fashionable side of the aventine with views from the upper story of the tiber and the capitoline and just a glimpse of the circus maximus this pleased his mother greatly at sundown the wedding party departed from the house of acilius the procession was led by the youngest boy in the household acilias little brother who carried a pine torch lit from the familys hearthfire its flame would be added to the hearthfire of the bridegroom when they arrived at the house of lucius pinarius following the torchbearer was a vestal virgin she wore linen vestments with a narrow headband of twined red and white wool called a vitta across her forehead a headdress called a suffibulum that concealed her closely shorn hair and a mantle that covered her head and shoulders the vestal carried a cake made from consecrated grain and sprinkled with holy salt a few bites would be taken by the couple during the ceremony after which the cake would be shared with their guests next came the bride acilias golden hair was pulled back from her face elaborately coiled and secured with pins of ivory she wore a yellow veil and yellow shoes her long white robe was cinched at the waist with a purple sash tied at the back in a special configuration called the hercules knot later it would be luciuss privilege to untie the knot acilia carried a distaff for spinning and a spindle with wool flanking her were two of the brides cousins little boys hardly older than the torchbearer following the bride were her mother and father and the rest of the bridal party who sang the ancient wedding song it was called tallasius and recalled the taking of the sabine women by romulus and his men according to legend the most beautiful of the sabines was captured by the henchmen of a certain tallasius as she was carried off the sabine begged to know where the men were taking her the women in the wedding party sang the questions and the men sang the responses where do you take me to tallasius the dutiful why do you take me because he thinks you re beautiful what will my fate be to marry him to be his mate what god will save me all the gods have blessed this date the wedding party arrived at the home of lucius pinarius in the street under the open sky a sheep was skinned and sacrificed on an altar its pelt was thrown over two chairs upon which the bride and groom sat claudius as augur asked the gods to bless the union and took the auspices the flight of two sparrows from right to left across the darkling sky he declared to be a very favourable omen carrying her distaff and spindle acilia rose from her chair and stood before the door to the house which was decorated with garlands of flowers her mother embraced her everyone knew what was to come next and there was a thrill of nervous excitement in the crowd when lucius still seated seemed to hesitate his father shouted go on son do it yes lucius dddo it shouted claudius smiling and laughing and clapping their hands others took up the chant do it do it do it blushing and laughing lucius sprang from his chair and pulled acilia from her mothers arms she shrieked as lucius swept her off her feet kicked open the door and carried her like a captive sabine over the threshold the wedding party cheered and applauded and crowded around the open door to witness the final act of the ceremony inside the house lucius set acilia down on a sheepskin rug she put aside her distaff and spindle he handed her the keys to the house who is this newcomer in my house he said his heart pounding when and where you are lucius then and there i shall be lucia she replied the ceremony gave acilia something no unmarried woman possessed a first name it was a feminine form of her husbands first name and would be used only in private between the two of them amid the feasting that followed lucius sought out claudius they strolled to a quiet spot away from the others under the portico that surrounded the garden the moon was full the air was fragrant with nightblooming jasmine you have a lovely house lucius thank you claudius and thank you for taking the auspices today it was my pleasure to serve as augur lucius but with this house and your lovely bride you hardly needed mme to confirm that fortune is smiling on you fortune or fate claudius laughed i see youve followed my advice and taken up the study of astrology as bolus writes in sympathies and antipathies every student of astrology must sooner or later confront the paradox of fate versus fortune if fate is an inexorable path laid before us by the stars from which no divergence is possible then what good is a prayer to fortune or any other deity yet men call upon fortune all the time and in every circumstance it is our nature to propitiate the gggods and ask their blessing so there must be some utility in doing so despite the inescapable nature of fate it is my opinion that our personal destiny is like a broad pathway we cannot go backwards or leave the path or change the destination but within the pathway we can execute small twists and turns in those circumstances we are able to exercise choice and the favour of the gods can make a difference lucius stared into the middle distance and nodded claudius sighed i see by your face lucius that not one word ive said makes sense to you lucius laughed to be candid claudius my study of astrology has not gone especially well its not like augury i didnt particularly like spending all that time with the magister but i did enjoy the instruction he gave us because the science of augury makes perfect sense to me augury was perfected by our ancestors it served them well and its our duty to continue the practice so as to maintain the gods favour for ourselves and our descendants but astrology lucius shook his head naming the planets categorizing their effects on human behaviour and the rest it all seems rather arbitrary to me as if some longdead babylonian simply made it up and as you say if fate exists what point is there in knowing what the future will bring unlike you claudius im not sure that augury and astrology can be reconciled i think a man must believe in one or the other in that respect at least you are in agreement with uncle tiberius it was thoughtful of you claudius to obtain the emperors birth information for me as well as those two horoscopes the older one cast by scribonius at tiberiuss birth i was able to decipher fairly well but the more recent horoscope by thrasyllus well it made no sense to me at all i simply couldnt follow his calculations and his description of tiberiuss character a humble man reluctant but compelled by fate to assume great responsibility may be accurate but i couldnt see how it followed from the casting it could be that thrasyllus sifting among the dddata delivered a reading in accordance with the image uncle tiberius wishes to project you mean he told the emperor what the emperor wanted to hear the fact that an astrologer may be devious does not negate the science itself lucius uncle tiberius is probably as great a puzzle to thrasyllus as he is to the rest of us we have an emperor who refuses to wear the laurel crown or to take any of greatuncles titles no augustus no father of his country no imperator after his name but neither dddoes he seem likely to restore the republic he says the whole lot of senators are fit to be slaves is uncle tiberius truly a humble man thrust into prominence by circumstance not to mention the ambitions of my grandmother or is he merely striking a pose as greatuncle did when he styled himself the humble public servant who wanted nothing more than to serve the state studying the stars may give an answer to thrasyllus but not to me said lucius i simply have no aptitude for astrology ah well i had thought to set you on the pppath but it was not to be smile lucius i just made a joke about fate and you had no choice but to make it claudius nodded and looked across the garden where acilia was speaking to her mother if free will exists then you certainly made a fine choice for a bride acilia is very bbbeautiful she is and i love her its a curious thing my father chose to court the acilii because they had money but now thats irrelevant thanks to the fortune i inherited from your uncle i am free to marry for love lucky man nowadays most people marry for the tax advantages greatuncle was determined that everyone should pair up settle down and breed so he punished the unmarried and childless with taxes he made life easier for the married man and easier still for the man with children you can get started on that tonight lucius joined him in gazing at acilia in her white robe and yellow veil lit by moonlight and lamplight she seemed to glow softly at this time next year i could have a son he said awed by the enormity of it do you remember claudius when augustus showed us those baby shoes baby shoes when we spoke to him in that upstairs study he showed us a pair of your nephews shoes ah yes the baby shoes my brother sent as a keepsake little gaius has grown since then hes big for a fouryearold and quite the warrior germanicus tells me the boy has his own pair of miniature army boots the caliga worn by soldiers how the troops love to see the boy on parade caligula they call him little boots your older brother has done well hes lived up to his name he has indeed his first task was quelling the unrest in the ranks when uncle tiberius reneged on the bonuses promised by augustus only germanicuss popularity with the troops prevented a wholesale uprising we learned a lesson there about where the real pppower behind the emperor lies not with the senate but with the legions germanicus not only rallied the troops on the rhine he led an invasion deep into german territory and avenged the disaster of the teutoberg forest two of the lost eagle standards were retrieved and hes vowed to take back the other as well even if he has to pry it from the dead hand of arminius everyone in roma is talking about his success the people now love him as much as his troops do almost certainly tiberius will have to award germanicus a triumph when he returns to roma imagine the pomp and glory all the german slaves and captured bbbooty on display the acclamation of the legions and little caligula riding beside his father in the chariot wearing his tiny army boots lucius touched the fascinum at his breast and beneath the chariot will be the sacred fascinum of the vestals to ward off the gaze of the envious the envious in this case being tiberius said claudius under his breath lucius lowered his voice does he see germanicus as a rival who cccan say if tiberius feels threatened by your brother what does that mean for you claudius perhaps i should cconsult my horoscope lucius suddenly felt uneasy for many years under augustus power in roma had been a settled affair whether a man liked it or not everyone knew his place but in the aftermath of augustuss death the future of the city and the individual destinies of its people seemed uncertain but for himself at least in the short term lucius could foresee only happiness the opportunity to serve augustus had made him a wealthy man and delivered to him the bride he had longed for his friendship with claudius had brought him into the outer circles of the imperial family close enough to enjoy certain privileges but not so close as to provoke the fear and jealousy of powerful men to be sure his study of astrology had led him to a dead end but his love of augury was greater than ever what did it matter that the new emperor placed his trust entirely in astrology the current fascination with babylonian stargazing might be only a passing fashion while augurs would always be needed and respected in roma at last after much celebration the last of the guests departed the slaves disappeared into their rooms for the night while acilia withdrew to the bed chamber to make ready lucius walked alone from room to room taking inventory of his surroundings claudius had said the house was lovely and it was lamplight softly illuminated the walls freshly painted with images of peacocks and gardens and fell softly on all the beautiful objects lucius had purchased to make the house worthy of acilia the lamps and tables the chairs and rugs the dining couches and draperies what a great deal of furniture was required to fill a house and how expensive it all was how could anyone who had not received an inheritance afford it lucius knew he was a very lucky man he entered the bedroom where acilia awaited him with trembling fingers he untied the hercules knot that secured the purple sash around her waist and removed her bridal robe beneath she wore a brief gown made of shimmering fabric so sheer that he could see right though it she unpinned her hair and the honeycoloured tresses fell almost to her waist he stood rooted to the spot simply gazing at her wishing he could stop time what moment could be more perfect than this balanced between the deep satisfaction the day had brought him and the exquisite pleasures of the night to come he stroked the golden hair that framed her face then he touched the shimmering fabric and felt the warmth and solidity of her flesh my lucia he whispered uttering the name only he was allowed to speak as he covered her mouth with his ad to walk across the forum on a crisp october day dressed in his trabea and carrying his lituus gave lucius a wonderful sense of belonging and selfworth at the age of twentynine he was not just a citizen of the greatest city on earth he was a husband and the father of twin boys how augustus would have approved and a highly respected member of the community the augury he had just performed had gone very well a new tavern was about to open on one of the less disreputable streets in the subura and the owner wanted to determine the best day to begin serving customers the toandfro flight of seagull a bird seldom seen so far inland had clearly indicated the day after tomorrow the ceremony was hardly a momentous occasion but part of an augurs duty was to make the auspices available to all citizens for all sorts of purposes the tavern owner had paid him the standard fee lucius patted the full coin purse tucked inside his trabea the man had also offered to supply lucius with food and drink free of charge any time he wished to drop in lucius had feigned gratitude but it was unlikely that he would ever take up the offer he had grown used to vintages superior to any the humble tavern had to offer and except for official purposes he rarely visited the teeming noisome streets of the bustling subura his usual places to dine and drink were located on the lower slopes of the aventine and the palatine in neighborhoods where men of a better class tended to congregate he was considering a visit to his local favourite a charming hideaway just down the street from his house when he ran into claudius he was about to invite claudius to come along then saw the look on his friends face claudius whats happened ttterrible news ttterrible there were tears in his eyes he seemed unable to speak for a moment caught on some stubborn consonant then he blurted it out ggermanicus is dead my dear brother dead oh claudius this is terrible news lucius wrinkled his nose at the smell of stale wine his friend was drunk lucius took his arm but claudius was rooted to the spot trembling and blinking back tears a year before luciuss father had died the elder pinarius had not suffered much he developed a terrible headache one day fell into a coma that night and two days later was dead without ever regaining consciousness the sudden loss had shaken lucius claudius had been a comfort to him in the days of mourning and lucius would do his best to return the favour to his distraught friend did he fall in battle asked lucius after his grand triumph in roma germanicus had been posted by tiberius to asia where he had enjoyed even greater success defeating the kingdoms of cappadocia and commagene and turning them into roman provinces lately there had been talk of granting germanicus a second triumph only the greatest commanders in romas history had received more than one no he died in his bbbed but germanicus was so young barely thirtyfive and in the bbbest of health until he fell ill the physicians blame some mysterious wasting disease but there are rumours of pppoison and mmmagic spells scrawled on lead tablets but who would have dared to murder germanicus claudius took a deep breath and steadied himself in the days of augustus we wondered who might pppoison the emperor now we wonder whom the emperor might ppoison and in both cases the culprit is the same lucius looked up and down the street there were few people in sight and no one close enough to overhear them still lucius lowered his voice you mustnt say such a thing claudius at least my nephew is well as far as we know pppoor little caligula an orphan surely no one would ppoison a sevenyearold boy surely not agreed lucius thinking of his own sons who were barely a year old he reached up to touch the vacant spot at his breast on this day he was not wearing the fascinum he felt an urge to hurry home come with me claudius acilia will want to hear the news my mother will cook us dinner you can spend the night with us no no no i have too much to do pppeople to tell arrangements to mmake then ill come with you said lucius trying to hide his reluctance no no lucius you belong with your family go to them now i shall be quite all right no one would ever want to ppoison or put a spell on pppoor claudius he turned away and hurried down the street lucius looked after him until he disappeared around a corner then headed home even before he entered the house he knew something was wrong the door stood wide open where was the slave who minded the entrance from within he heard the twins titus and kaeso crying loudly then he heard moredisturbing sounds a man barking orders the stamp of booted feet the sound of furniture being overturned a shriek from acilia lucius rushed inside in the vestibule the wax effigies of his ancestors were askew in their niches as if someone had been rifling among them the effigy of his father had fallen to the floor he ran into the reception hall from which he could see into the surrounding rooms soldiers had invaded his house and were busy ransacking it from their imperial insignia he knew that they were praetorians the elite corps of centurions stationed in a fortified garrison just outside the city the praetorians were charged with guarding the emperors person and with apprehending the emperors enemies what were they doing in his house tearing the furniture apart shaking out rugs knocking holes in the walls stop this at once lucius shouted the soldiers looked at him and paused two of them ran to him while one held his shoulders the other searched his person no weapons the soldier shouted they released him and carried on with what they were doing acilia appeared carrying kaeso and titus one in each arm the boys were redfaced and wailing their mother was ashen she ran to luciuss side following closely behind her was a tall man with a commanding presence at his approach the twins fell silent lucius recognized him sejanus prefect of the praetorians and righthand man to tiberius the mans steely gaze made luciuss blood run cold what is the meaning of this said lucius why are these men looting my house looting sejanus smiled grimly later if an order of confiscation is issued your possessions will be removed in an orderly fashion but for now lucius pinarius my men are not here to rob you they are here to search for evidence evidence of what we shall know that when we find it one of the soldiers approached he held an unrolled scroll in his hands prefect i found this among the documents in that room over there he nodded towards luciuss study sejanus took the scroll blew dust off it and studied it his face grew long what have we here by hercules i believe this is a horoscope that was cast for the emperor what possible excuse can you give me for possessing such a document lucius pinarius lucius opened his mouth but did not speak sejanus held the copy of a horoscope cast by thrasyllus that claudius had given him years ago as an example for him to study when lucius had tried and failed to master the science of astrology no answer snapped sejanus where did you obtain this should he tell the man that the emperors own nephew had given it to him surely that would absolve him of whatever suspicion sejanus harboured or would it claudiuss brother had just died and claudius clearly thought that tiberius was responsible doddering stuttering claudius had always been considered outside the circle of those who might pose some threat to the emperor but claudius now had more motive than ever to hate his uncle telling sejanus that claudius had given him the horoscope might endanger claudius it might also endanger lucius making it look as if he were conspiring with his friend i bought it from a vendor in the subura years ago when i made a stab at learning astrology i had no idea what it was look in my study youll see a few works about astrology and some other horoscopes as well none of any importance i havent looked at them in years you saw yourself that this one was covered with dust sejanus glared at him i didnt become prefect of the praetorians without learning to tell when a man is lying to me no matter a new imperial order decrees that all practising astrologers except those expressly retained by the emperor himself are to be exiled from italy i would say that this document and the others you admit to possessing are ample evidence that you are among the class of persons to be banished but thats ridiculous i just told you i havent even looked at those documents in years and if i examine these materials closely will i find astrological calculations and horoscopes executed in your own handwriting luciuss face became hot perhaps years ago i cast a few horoscopes simply as exercises but i am not and have never been an astrologer i am an augur as you can see by what im wearing lucius impotently waved his lituus in the air sejanus stepped closer looming over him and looking down his nose he was so close that lucius could feel the mans breath on his forehead what sort of fool are you lucius pinarius cant you see that im offering you a way out i dont understand most enemies of the emperor have no choice about the charges brought against them but i am giving you a choice why because im a nice fellow said sejanus sweetly because i love babies he glanced at the twins who stared back at him in wideeyed silence because one way is more work for me and the other way is less you fool now here are your choices first choice a charge of unauthorized possession of the emperors horoscope a treasonable offense if i bring that charge against you there will necessarily be a very extensive investigation and no one can say where that might lead think of your friends pinarius and the penalty is not only death for you but confiscation of your estate think of your wife and sons second choice a simple charge of practising astrology without the emperors knowledge in that case you will be exiled from italy your destination to be determined by me and only those materials that relate to the practice of astrology will be confiscated from you lucius looked at acilia she gazed back at him trembling and terrified titus and kaeso sensing her distress began to wail again this is outrageous lucius whispered my father was a senator my grandfather was a nephew and heir to the divine julius a cousin of the divine augustus while tiberius was merely the stepson of augustus is that what youre saying are you questioning the legitimacy of the emperors claim to power are you asserting that you have a better claim no is that why you possess a copy of the emperors horoscope to discover on which days he is most vulnerable so that you can plot his downfall and take his place of course not i told you already lucius fought to control his shaking ive never been disloyal ive never spoken against the emperor never why did you come here today what made you think youd find something incriminating you were on the list said sejanus what list the list of men to be watched but why for what reason for knowing too much i suspect thats usually the reason and sure enough here in your house we have found the means for gaining knowledge that might be used against the emperor but this is madness i told you im not an astrologer i am a respected member of the college of augurs a public servant of the roman state i loyally serve tiberius just as i served augustus lucius fell silent suddenly he understood he had answered his own question why was this happening because he was an augur because he had served augustus because of the lightning omen his role in that singular event had seemed to bring lucius a happy destiny confirmation of his skills as an augur closer friendship with claudius an inheritance from the emperor that had changed his life but now his part in that singular event had led to this catastrophe had augustus died on the appointed day because of fate or because of human intervention livia and tiberius must have known of the prediction they knew everything that happened in the imperial house lucius had long suspected that one of them or both had a hand in augustuss death he had never spoken of such a possibility not even to claudius but tiberius was no fool the emperor was taking drastic action to eliminate every possible threat to his rule his rival germanicus every astrologer in italy the unfortunate men on the mysterious list mentioned by sejanus and lucius was among those who might know too much sejanus was right lucius should consider himself lucky if he could escape with his life and his fortune intact he stared at the document that sejanus clutched in his hands why had he not burned the incriminating horoscope of tiberius long ago lucius had been a fool to keep it but would burning it have made any difference if sejanus had not discovered the astrological documents he would have found some other way to incriminate lucius you finally seem to have run out of words said sejanus have you anything more to say no he raised his voice lucius pinarius you are guilty of practising astrology without the authorization of the emperor you have ten days to settle your affairs in roma after that you will board a ship and leave italy under penalty of death if you wish you may take your wife and children and my mother lucius looked about where was his mother probably in her bed she had been in poor health ever since luciuss father had died and your mother said sejanus sweetly do you have a preference for your destination lucius felt numb with shock the twins wailed my grandfather had friends in egypt i have investments in alexandria he said dully sejanus nodded egypt is good egypt is a possession of the emperor rather than a province under senatorial jurisdiction it will be easier for my agents to keep an eye on you there sejanus rolled the scroll tightly and handed the horoscope back to the praetorian who had brought it to him burn this immediately collect all the other documents and take them with you call off the search were finished here in moments the soldiers were gone except for the crying twins the house was silent gradually the slaves began to emerge from their hiding places the women surrounded acilia trying to comfort her and the babies the men approached lucius but he waved them away lucius walked into his study the room had been stripped of every scroll and scrap of parchment not just the few items pertaining to astrology but all his business documents as well how was he to settle his affairs without his financial records even his small collection of plays and poetry had been taken he found himself staring at the row of empty pigeonholes that had contained the many scrolls that made up his copy of titus liviuss history a gift from claudius which he had never read how was he ever to read it now of course there would be copies of liviuss work in egypt alexandria was famous for its books alexandria was the home of the great library he shook his head in disbelief the last few moments had destroyed his life yet already he had begun to accept his fate he walked through the house like a man in a dream he found himself in his bedroom the place where he had first coupled with acilia where kaeso and titus had been conceived where acilia had given birth even this room had been ransacked the trunks and cabinets had been thrown open the clothing scattered across the floor the bed had been overturned the cushions into which he had sighed with pleasure when coupling with acilia wept with joy at the birth of his sons breathed the essence of his dreams while he slept had been cut open as if sejanus thought they might contain some terrible secret on the floor lay a silver box with its lid pried open among the scattered pieces of jewellery was the gold fascinum lucius knelt and picked it up he clutched it tightly he whispered a prayer to the ancient god who had watched over his family from its very beginnings fascinus god of my ancestors watch over me watch over my sons bring us back someday to roma ten frantic tormented sleepless days later lucius was ready to leave the city true to his word sejanus had not confiscated his property but had insisted that lucius sell his beloved house lucius had done so at a considerable loss his financial records after being thoroughly scrutinized had been returned to him as had his copy of titus liviuss history along with several other valuable scrolls the documents had all been tightly rolled and carefully packed away in round leather bookboxes of the sort called capsae lucius stood with his family and the slaves they were taking with them on a dock at the riverfront waiting to board the boat that would take them down the tiber to ostia where he had secured passage on a trading vessel bound for alexandria the smell of the waterfront reminded him of the tavern where euphranor had arrived with news of augustuss death where was that tavern not far he thought turning around and looking beyond a stack of crates filled with his familys belongings he saw the entrance to the tavern from where he stood how long ago that day seemed even as he looked at the tavern the door opened a figure emerged and began walking towards the dock weaving this way and that and nearly colliding with the stack of crates it was claudius claudius averted his eyes as he approached lucius stepped forward to meet him and opened his arms the two men embraced lucius im so sorry if only i had never gggiven you those horoscopes no claudius this is not your fault but it was i who insisted that you ccome with me that night when lightning struck greatuncles statue no claudius youre not to blame nor is sejanus nor is tiberius if fate exists and cannot be altered then this moment had to arrive and the next step in my lifes journey is already predetermined as is the next and the next and the next until the moment i die and if there is no fate if chance and free will rule the cosmos then it was i who failed to win the favour of the goddess fortune it was i who made the wrong choices what a philosopher youve bbbecome sometimes the consolations of philosophy are all that a man has said lucius bitterly he shut his eyes took a deep breath and shook his head no thats wrong i have acilia i have the twins i have my mother he looked at camilla who was holding one of the boys kaeso he thought though it was hard to be sure cooing and clucking her tongue she looked very old she had been in low spirits and poor health since his father had died the disaster had dealt her a tremendous blow a sea voyage in october was no place for a woman of her years but she had insisted on coming to stay close to her grandchildren acilia was holding the other twin how miserable she looked through all the agony of the last ten days she had not said a word against him her father and brother had not been so kind the two of them had arrived at the house the morning after sejanuss visit first anxious and alarmed at the rumours they had heard then furious and full of recriminations against lucius acilius said hurtful words of the sort that could never be taken back about the worthlessness of luciuss patrician blood and the shame he had brought upon the acilii he had argued that his daughter and grandsons should remain in roma with him and lucius had wavered trying to imagine his exile in alexandria without them it was acilia who had silenced her father saying that she had no intention of abandoning her husband or of taking her sons from their father acilius had left in a rage and they had not seen him since he had not even come to see them off no one had come no one wanted to be seen saying farewell to an exiled enemy of the imperial house no one except claudius the twin held by his mother began to cry yes it was kaeso as lucius had thought he could recognize the boys more readily by their cries than by their faces which were truly identical slaves began to load the crates into the cargo hold of the boat lucius and claudius were in the way they stepped to the edge of the dock and stood side by side staring at their distorted reflections in the water it may be that your exile is a ggood thing who can say a good thing to leave the only city i know the only home ive ever had the idea of raising my sons anywhere else is unspeakably bitter to me almost unbearable no lucius hear me out tiberius is increasingly detached he gives more and more authority to sejanus the situation in roma can only grow worse for the first time in my life ive begun to fear for my own survival the atmosphere around tiberius is so clouded with suspicion even a fellow as harmless as myself mmmight become a target what will you do claudius i intend to disengage from public life as much as pppossible grow root vegetables at my country house pppursue my antiquarian studies get drunk with my lowlife friends as soon as you leave i intend to head back to the tavern and get even drunker than i already am the stack of crates had vanished packed inside one of them was luciuss trabea and his lituus the boat was ready to cast off his mother stumbled on the gangplank when lucius caught her he was shocked at how little she weighed he wondered how she could survive the journey claudius stood alone on the dock and waved as they departed then turned around and went back to the tavern lucius gazed at the buildings passing by he knew every street and rooftop of this part of the city between the tiber and the aventine though he was more used to looking down from the top of the hill the view was strange looking up from the river scanning the skyline he happened to spot his house high on the crest of the aventine but it was not his house any longer the new owners were standing on one of the balconies waving to their neighbours across the way lucius gazed at the sight and knew how the lemures of the dead must feel watching the living from the shadows titus and kaeso both began to cry would they cry all the way to alexandria the boat sailed on on the shore temples and houses gave way to warehouses and rubbish heaps and then to open fields the city disappeared from view as clearly as if a god had whispered the knowledge in his ear lucius knew he would never see roma again part ii titus and kaeso the twins ad impressive i suppose but so is alexandria said kaeso pinarius surveying the heart of roma from the summit of the capitoline hill the temple of apollo atop the palatine dominated the skyline adjacent to the temple the imperial complex had been much built up since the time of augustus and presented a jumble of tile rooftops aerial gardens and colonnaded terraces directly below was the forum with its procession of grand edifices along the sacred way from the senate house to the round temple of vesta and beyond to the north and east lay the other hills of roma and nestled among them the concentration of towering tenements some as tall as seven stories in the crowded subura impressive its incredible alexandria simply cant compare nor can any other place ive seen kaesos twin brother titus could hardly contain his enthusiasm at the age of twentytwo titus could not claim to have travelled the world but their late father had once taken them on a trip to antioch and he and kaeso had stopped in several cities including athens on their journey to roma in alexandria all the streets are laid out in a grid every corner is like every other its so regular and boring but roma is all hills and valleys and streets as jumbled as a pile of serpents and huge buildings everywhere you look kaeso nodded yes its a mess its magnificent magnificent would describe the temple of serapis in alexandria or the great library or the pharos lighthouse or perhaps the museum but none of those can rival the temple of jupiter said titus he looked over his shoulder and up at the grand structure with its immense columns and pediment roof surmounted by a gilded statue of the greatest of the gods in his quadriga glimmering under the slanting light of a bright november sun titus turned in a slow circle taking in the view in every direction enchanted by the sinuous course of the shimmering tiber awed by the sheer immensity of the city surely brother this is the most magnificent sight on earth father certainly thought so how he loved to reminisce about his beloved roma kaeso sighed if only he were still alive to be here with us today titus nodded he was supposed to be here he would be here and so would mother if the fever hadnt taken them last year fate was cruel to our parents kaeso more than anything they wanted to return to this city at last the opportunity came and then fortune snatched it away but fate has been kinder to us eh brother we are finally home home kaeso shook his head we were babies when father and mother fled from the city we have no close kin here except the acilii who severed all ties with our mother fathers parents died before we were born not grandmother camilla she died on the journey to alexandria dont you remember i remember father telling us that but i have no memories of her i do i think titus frowned i dont and i have no memories of roma do you we were babies when we left we grew up in alexandria alexandria is our home was our home kaeso we were born romans we have always been citizens of roma and now we are truly romans again its what our father wanted thanks to claudius did i hear my name being spoken kkkindly i hope claudius was nearby stooping over to peer at the sculptors mark on a statue of hercules he straightened groaning a bit at fifty his back was suffer than it once had been and ambled towards them one of his toes had developed a blister from walking but he bore the pain with a smile the sons of lucius pinarius and their wives were taking their first tour of the city and it was his pleasure to act as their guide i was reminding kaeso of how grateful we should be for all youve done said titus i only wish i could have arranged for you and your father to return to roma long ago i thought it might be possible when tiberius ppput sejanus to death can that have been nine years ago how the time flies but getting rid of that treacherous viper didnt make tiberius any less unreasonable if anything uncle became more suspicious and fearful than ever two of my nephews he put to death for plotting against him locking them away and letting them starve to death even as he indulged his every appetite and not just for food what do you mean said kaeso in his declining years uncle decided to followed his impulses no mmmatter where they might lead his impulses said tiberius claudius glanced over his shoulder his young wife and the wives of the twins were taking a rest sitting on the steps of the temple of jupiter while their attendant slaves stood by the three women smiled and waved then went on with their conversation no one else was close enough to hear why had he brought up the subject of tiberius and his appetites the fact was claudius needed to unburden himself for years he had had no one to whom he could speak in an unguarded way not even his slaves who either could not be trusted or upon whom he did not wish to thrust the responsibility of keeping his secrets looking back he realized that there had never been anyone to whom he could speak with utter freedom except his dear friend and cousin lucius pinarius since the twins had arrived in roma claudius found himself confiding in them more and more as once he had confided in their father tiberiuss behaviour in his last years was truly shocking the mmman indulged every desire without the least restraint what must augustus have thought looking down from olympus what sort of desires asked titus curious to know more how i dreaded my visits to that debauched retreat of his at capri at least he had the sense to confine his excesses to his private island all those nnnaked children wandering about not just nubile boys and girls i tell you and not just slaves but freeborn children tiberius coined his own terms for them in bed they were his spintriae his tight little sphincters in his bath they were his little minnows uncle said there was no greater pleasure for an old man than to settle in a warm ppool and be nibbled and suckled under water by tiny mouths while he gazed up at the pornographic mosaics on the ceiling mosaics with pictures of people having sex titus laughed ive never seen such a thing what do you make of that kaeso kaeso shook his head claudius frowned a bit flustered by tituss lack of proper outrage but he was encouraged to see that kaeso appeared to share his disdain oh how tiberius loved his pppornography the whole place was like a museum of sex filled with the most salacious paintings and statues imaginable i thought to find escape in the library but the shelves contained nothing but smut scroll upon scroll of the most salacious stories especially written for tiberius by slaves acquired solely for their skill at spinning such tales bedtime stories he called them since most of his bedmates were too illeducated or too young to read tiberius had artists illustrate the texts so that he could use the pictures to show his partners exactly what he wanted them to do titus elbowed his brother what do you think of that kaeso i never saw such books at the great library in alexandria kaeso made a sour face claudius blinked but what started me on this dreadful subject ah yes my efforts to bring your father back to roma well eventually tiberius lost all interest in running the state he left that to his underlings and retired fulltime to capri but every so often when i could get uncle to discuss something other than the gratification of his pppenis i would bring up the case of your father i pointed out that lucius was my cousin and that sejanuss agents had kept him under surveillance for years and not once had he been heard to utter a treasonable sentiment or to practise astrology for that mmmatter i begged tiberius to rescind your fathers banishment but uncle was not a forgiving sort he wouldnt hear of it he wouldnt even listen to me except once when i made the mistake of mentioning that lucius had twin sons trying to wring some pity from him and do you know what tiberius said how old are they are they pretty by that time you were old enough to wear togas and i told him so whereupon he lost all interest and ordered me never to mmmention my cousin lucius pinarius again claudius sighed so we simply had to wait for tiberius to die how the people detested him by the end when word of his death at capri reached roma there was dddancing in the streets you should have seen the jubilation that swept through this city when my nephew was named his successor the only son of germanicus whom tiberius hadnt managed to kill his voice trailed away he blinked and twitched there were celebrations in alexandria too said titus back in egypt everyone says gaius caligula will make an ideal ruler the legions love him hes young energetic sure of himself yes very sure of himself as only a gggod can be muttered claudius averting his eyes at any rate amid all the celebration our new emperor expressed his willingness to hear pleas for amnesty including mine for your father it was granted but the wheels of state turn slowly you wouldnt believe the layers of bureaucracy in this city and of course your fffather needed time to settle his affairs in alexandria before he could leave in the last letter i received from him he was finally making preparations for the journey how happy lucius was that he had convinced the two of you and your wives to come along with him and then a fever took both him and acilia so sad but you two are here now along with those lovely wives of yours one always hears that alexandrian women are the worlds most beautiful artemisia and chrysanthe are proof but here whats this sunlight glinted across the gold amulet that kaeso was wearing on a chain around his neck with a bemused expression claudius reached out to touch it kaeso smiled its a fascinum according to our father though you wouldnt know to look at it he told us it was very old maybe even older than roma itself ah yes i thought it looked familiar by hercules i had forgotten all about it it was i who informed your father about this amulets history before you boys were born so when he died he pppassed the fascinum to you kaeso i can use it to tell the two of you apart i never knew twins who looked more alike im afraid youll need to learn some other trick to distinguish us then said kaeso fathers will didnt specify which of us should inherit it but since his estate was split equally between us weve agreed to share the fascinum sometimes i wear it sometimes titus does then twins can get along you have improved upon the example of romulus and remus ill wager your father never told you that it was i who came up with names for the two of you no its true when he learned that acilia had given bbbirth to twins he was in a quandary over which of you to give his own name since lucius had long been the traditional name bestowed on the firstborn male pinarius but the midwife made such a jumble of things that there was no way to tell which of you had come first besides you were so identical in every way it seemed unfair perhaps even unlucky to honour one of you with the firstborns name and slight the other so your father decided to break with tradition and name neither of you lucius he asked for my advice we decided to name one of you kaeso after a famous ancestor of yours from the fabius family a man who wore that very fascinum about four hundred years ago if my theory is correct what about my name asked titus that was in memory of my mentor the great scholar titus livius surely youve read his history of roma no not even the ppparts about the ancient pinarii claudius shook his head im sure i gave your father a copy long ago i think its among the books we brought with us from alexandria said titus i wonder if your father ever read it ah well neither he nor his father had much interest in the past but a man must honour his ancestors who else made us and how else did we come to exist id prefer to live for the future said kaeso with a faraway look fingering the fascinum at his throat and id prefer to live in the present titus laughed but speaking of the future how soon might we have the honour of meeting the emperor we should like to thank him in person not just for allowing us to return but for restoring the honour of our fathers name with our full rights as citizens and patricians restored someday we might even be able to gain admission to the college of augurs how that would please the shade of your father said claudius of course id be proud to oversee your studies and to sponsor one or bbboth of you for admission kaeso made a face its titus who dreams of becoming an augur not i i brought fathers old trabea and lituus with me from alexandria said titus but what about meeting the emperor claudius averted his eyes yes well if the emperor should summon you for an audience of course you must go but in the great press of affairs caligula is so generous to so many of his subjects its entirely ppossible he will forget all about this particular instance of generosity and if that should happen well perhaps its best if you dont remind him indeed it might be bbbest if you do nothing at all to call attention to yourselves titus furrowed his brow what do you mean cousin claudius how can i explain exile is a curse but it can also bbe a blessing despite his sorrow at being sent so far from the city he loved your father was fortunate to miss the terror visited on this city by sejanus and all the casual cruelties of tiberius then when my nephew succeeded tiberius it seemed that a new era was dawning a time of hope and fresh confidence i was eager for your father to return so was he ppperhaps we were too eager ppperhaps we should have been less optimistic and waited a little longer he shook his head it was caligulas father my brother germanicus who should have become emperor everyone says so my brothers military skills were firstrate his temperament was ideal germanicus was loved by the legions by the people even by the senate but not so loved by the gods who saw fit to take him from us the gods or else sejanus or livia or tiberius what does it matter theyre all dead now all dead kaeso put his hand on the older mans shoulder what are you trying to tell us claudius unlike his father my nephew was always a bit unsound claudius twitched he wiped away a bit of drool i suppose that sounds judgemental even absurd coming from the likes of me but its true as a bbboy little gaius was troubled with the falling sickness so was the divine julius said titus perhaps but i suspect caligulas case was rather more severe than that of julius caesar all through his youth he was struck by spells that rendered him bbbarely able to walk or to stand or even to hold up his head he would be dazed afterwards unable to collect his thoughts but he always recovered as he grew to manhood he seemed to outgrow the affliction and that gave us hope we certainly never had cause to worry about his sanity and now said kaeso claudius hesitated but once again he could not resist the need to unburden himself the change occurred suddenly overnight in fact it was caused by a love pppotion given to him by that horrible wife of his caesonia shes much older she was already a mother of three when they began carrying on if you ask me its unnatural for a young man to take an older partner it should be the other way around dont you think as it is with mmmyself and messalina quite agreed titus but you were telling us about the emperor yes well apparently caligulas lovemaking was a disappointment to caesonia a harlot of such vast experience so caesonia decided to remedy the situation by giving the boy an aphrodisiac the gossips say she fed him the substance the greeks call hippomanes a fleshy mass sometimes found on the forehead of a newborn foal kaeso wrinkled his nose it sounds disgusting does it work asked titus one mmixes it with wine and herbs to make it palatable said claudius its a wellknown aphrodisiac various scholars mention it but in all my research i can find no other case where it drove a man mmmad i suspect caesonia adulterated it with some other ingredient she deliberately poisoned him said titus no whatever ingredient she added was probably harmless by itself but when mixed with the hippomanes created a combination that was toxic that at least is my theory i have a suspicion that caesonia may have duplicated the very love pppotion that drove lucretius mad the twins looked at him blankly the pppoet lucretius he explained who lived in the days of the divine julius they say lucretiuss madness came and went in his lucid moments he was able to write his great work on the nature of things but eventually he was driven to suicide are you afraid caligula may kill himself said kaeso claudius shivered hugged himself and whinnied like a horse the twins feared he was having a fit but he was only laughing oh no kaeso that is not what im afraid of caligulas behaviour makes even the worst excesses of tiberius seem trivial the stories i could tell you but look heres messalina and your lovely wives the women rejoined their husbands in all of roma it was unlikely that one could find three more beautiful women standing side by side the twins had chosen wives who might have passed for siblings themselves artemisia and chrysanthe both had buxom figures and wore their thick black hair in long plaits after the egyptian fashion messalina was the youngest of the three but she affected a matronly look with her black hair pulled back from her face and pinned in an elaborate coiffure and a voluminous stola that covered her from head to foot and concealed her arms as well at a distance the loose stola concealed her condition seen closer her swollen breasts and protruding belly made it obvious that she was pregnant what have you lovely females been talking about all this time said titus glancing at messalinas breasts even as he took chrysanthes hand this and that his wife said hairstyles mostly artemisia and i look terribly provincial messalina promises to send the slave who dresses her hair to give us instruction on the latest roman styles dont complicate your bbbeauty too much said claudius youre lovely as you are he kissed messalina on the forehead and gently dotingly touched her just above the navel kaeso scowled and furrowed his brow titus pulled him aside and whispered in his ear whats wrong with you brother youve been in a foul mood all day that girl is young enough to be his granddaughter thats not our business try not to show your disapproval so openly back in alexandria were in roma now things are different here titus sighed back in alexandria his brother had taken up with some strange people and acquired some very intolerant ideas it was their fathers fault for having given his sons too much freedom when they were young both titus and kaeso had received traditional instruction at the academy near the temple of serapis and had pursued the usual curriculum of philosophy rhetoric and athletics but when the school day was done kaeso had spent his free time in the jewish quarter drawn there by a fascination with mysticism and the socalled scholars in the jewish quarter had filled his head with all sorts of bizarre ideas that were neither greek nor roman their father too busy with business had never sought to divert kaeso from these dubious influences that role would have suited a grandfather thought titus an older wiser man with patience and time to spare but fate had robbed them of their grandfather they had grown up knowing no grandparents at all a most unroman circumstance for young patricians but they were in roma now at last and they could ask for no better friend and guide than their cousin claudius shall we press on to the palatine said claudius we can see the hut of romulus the temple of apollo messalina rolled her eyes husband you cant expect them to see all of roma in a single day but what am i thinking you must be weary my dddear it was brave of you to come out at all i could hardly miss this opportunity to welcome your dear cousins messalina looked from face to face her eyes lingered first on kaeso then on titus but you mustnt overexert yourself ill fetch the lllitter and send you straight home the litter arrived borne by a team of brawny slaves two of them lifted messalina into the cushioned box claudius kissed her farewell then closed the richly embroidered curtains so that she could travel home in privacy as the litter was departing messalina parted the curtains with her forefinger and looked out her gaze fell on titus who gazed back at her claudius and the women were discussing the rest of the days itinerary and did not see but kaeso saw and heard everything the penetrating look that darted back and forth between his brother and messalina the way she narrowed her eyes and parted her lips and the grunt from titus followed by a sigh the curtain closed the litter receded from sight titus turned to face kaeso who scowled and shook his head titus raised an eyebrow and flashed a crooked smile we are in roma now brother ad kaeso shook the three ivory dice in his hand and tossed them onto the table the engraved pips that landed uppermost were two fours and a one rabbits for you brother too bad titus scooped up the dice and threw them the pips were all different a one a six and a three a venus throw for me i win today i shall wear the fascinum no one will see it under your toga anyway but it will be there nonetheless lying close to my heart on the occasion of our audience with the emperor weve waited a long time for this day kaeso three months had passed since their arrival in roma they had settled into a house on the aventine not far from the one in which they had been born it was not a particularly elegant house and it was too far down the hill to offer much of a view but it was large enough for the four of them and their slaves with room to accommodate new additions to the family while the twins put on their best togas their wives dressed in their finest stolas and put finishing touches to their newly styled hair it had not taken them long to adopt roman fashions though artemisia remained the more conservative of the two in deference to kaesos distaste for ostentation secretly she envied chrysanthes more daring coiffure which towered atop her head like a subura tenement carried in a pair of exquisitely crafted litters hired especially for the occasion the two couples set out for the emperors house on the palatine the januarius day was mild with pale yellow sunshine peeking through thin high clouds as they passed the ancient ara maxima the great altar of hercules titus insisted that they stop and get out at claudiuss behest he had at last started reading liviuss history an early chapter recounted the dedication of the ara maxima it seemed fitting to titus that on this of all days they should have a look at it the altar was made of massive stone blocks roughly hewn that looked very ancient a bronze statue of hercules stood nearby a magnificent figure bearing a club and dressed only in a headdress made from a lions skin at their approach a priest offered his services for a few coins the priest spilled some wine and burned some incense on the altar while titus said a prayer that their audience with the emperor would go well titus explained to artemisia and chrysanthe why the altar had special significance to the pinarii long before there was a city on the tiber and only shepherds and a few traders lived among the seven hills hercules paid a visit passing through with a herd of oxen a monster called cacus was living in a cave on the palatine just over there terrorizing the local inhabitants cacus made the mistake of trying to steal one of the strangers oxen he didnt know who he was dealing with and after a terrific struggle hercules killed the monster cacus on this very spot the pinarii were living here even then for livius tells us that it was a pinarius who established this place of worship the very first altar to a god in the whole region of the seven hills kaeso who had remained silent since they had stepped from the litters finally spoke hercules was not a god brother titus looked sidelong at his brother strictly speaking while he lived he was a demigod since jupiter sired him on a mortal woman but after he died he joined the gods in olympus kaeso snorted softly if you believe such nonsense kaeso titus ground his teeth this was not the first time his brother had expressed such atheistic sentiments but to do so in a public place where someone might overhear and in this of all places with its ancient sacred ties to their own family was beyond decency titus asked artemisia and chrysanthe to return to the litters then spoke to kaeso through clenched teeth you should learn when to speak brother and when to keep your thoughts to yourself why if jupiter overhears me will he strike me down with a thunderbolt he might do just that am i mistaken brother or has this impious attitude of yours grown worse since we arrived in roma i had hoped that coming here leaving the influence of those jewish mystics in alexandria behind would bring you closer to the gods i know that was fathers hope as well dont bring father into this why not when a man honours his father he honours the gods and vice versa you seem disinclined to do either the alexandrians have a long tradition of allowing all manner of outlandish and even dangerous ideas to be taught and weve seen the result one has the feeling the gods abandoned that city long ago but we are in roma now the heart of the world the centre of the worlds religion this is the home of our emperor who is also the pontifex maximus the highest of all priests the gods make roma their home when they choose to be on earth why because no other city offers them so many splendid temples to reside in or provides so many altars where the pious may sacrifice in their honour and in return roma above all other cities has been divinely blessed here in roma you must learn to keep unholy thoughts to yourself and to pay proper respect to the gods its not i who demand this but the gods no its you titus your gods demand nothing because they dont exist blasphemy kaeso even your jewish mystics in alexandria believe in the gods even if they favour one above all others didnt their god jehovah say to them you shall have no other gods before me you see kaeso i do know something about these ideas you picked up in alexandria though i cant imagine what sort of god demands his worshippers to spurn his fellow gods kaeso shook his head you know nothing about it titus ive tried to explain to you i know that when a man denies the gods hes asking to be punished by them kaeso sighed i suppose we shall meet one of your socalled gods today what do you mean they say caligula believes himself to be a god or a goddess on the days he dresses up as venus shall we fall to our knees and worship him kaesos tone was sarcastic but titus gave him a serious answer in fact before we enter his presence we may be required to make some acknowledgement of the emperors divine origins it wont kill you to murmur a prayer and burn a bit of incense shall we rejoin our wives and get on with it as the bearers made their way up the slope of the palatine chrysanthe tried to lighten tituss mood with inconsequential speculations would the emperor be accompanied by his wife caesonia what would she be wearing would their young daughter make an appearance titus occasionally grunted in response but was not listening the argument with kaeso had unsettled his nerves he fell prey to unwelcome thoughts for days ever since the summons had arrived titus had been telling himself that an imperial audience was a singular honour and a golden opportunity something to longed for not feared suddenly he felt nervous and uncertain about what to expect he had heard a great many strange rumours about the emperor caligula had once set sail for britannia on a mission of conquest then suddenly turned back and ordered his troops to collect seashells instead which he paraded before the people and the senate of roma as spoils of war claiming he had conquered the ocean itself a tavern keeper in the subura had told titus this tale and every man in the tavern had backed him up an architects wife at the market told chrysanthe that her husband had helped to build a magnificent marble stall and an ivory manger for the emperors favourite horse which caligula decked out in purple blankets and a collar of precious stones invited to dinner parties and addressed as consul these stories could almost be laughed at but others were more disturbing caligula had once arranged an oratory competition and made the losers erase their wax tablets with their tongues when caligula fell ill a man declared that he would gladly sacrifice his own life to save the emperors when caligula recovered he reminded the man of his pledge and forced him to commit suicide at a gladiator show the number of condemned men to be slain by wild beasts fell short of expectations and to make up the number caligula ordered some of the spectators to be thrown into the arena all these tales were widely told and attested to be true equally widespread was the rumour that caligula had slept with all three of his sisters openly practising incest and proudly claiming that he himself was the product of incest between his grandmother julia and her father the divine augustus titus did not know what to think claudius might have helped him make sense of such stories but titus and kaeso had not seen their cousin for over a month as messalinas delivery drew nearer claudius had become increasingly reticent and withdrawn finally confining himself to the imperial residence and accepting no visitors not even over the saturnalia holidays when the twins had received the summons to an audience with caligula titus had dispatched a message to claudius at once telling him the news and asking to meet hoping to receive his cousins advice in response claudius sent only a cryptic message may fortune be with you the litters arrived in the gravel forecourt of the imperial house where numerous other litters had been parked the courtyard was crowded with idle bearers as well as messengers and slaves whose masters had business within though the palace had been greatly expanded since the time of augustus the entry for guests was still the doorway flanked by laurel trees and the courtyard still displayed the armour of the divine augustus as they walked by titus dared to touch his fingers to the bronze breastplate the thrill of excitement at being in this place was so great that it almost dispelled his anxieties they had to present themselves to a great many retainers and pass through a great many doors on their way to being received by the emperor titus soon lost all sense of direction and had no idea where they were inside the sprawling complex at last they were shown into a small but exquisitely decorated room with a black marble floor red drapes and gilded furniture the mood was informal a servant announced the two couples then invited them to relax on couches opposite that of the emperor who reclined on his own couch with his wife caesonia as all the stories had indicated caesonia was of middle age but with her large breasts and sumptuous hips she exuded a certain overripe appeal her hennastained hair was coiffed to frame her face like a peacocks fan with a forefinger she idly toyed with her necklace of amber and lapis her unblinking gaze made titus nervous the sight of the emperor was reassuring at least at first at twentynine caligula was only seven years older than titus and kaeso but his fair hair was already beginning to thin a bit his features were plain but regular and his expression was mild almost vacant he looked quite normal titus thought except for his eccentric dress caligula appeared to be wearing not the boots for which he was named but a womans slippers and the feminine gown called a cyclas embroidered with purple and gold and made of silk in the days of the divine augustus legislation had been passed outlawing the wearing of silk by men yet here was the emperor himself wrapped in the stuff you will address him as dominus the retainer had instructed them in a whisper before they entered the room this was another way caligula differed from his predecessors both augustus and tiberius had explicitly rejected using as a title the word by which slaves addressed their master the conversation began well the twins thanked the emperor for lifting their fathers banishment caligula accepted their thanks and demonstrated his acquaintance with their family history and their current circumstances noting their success in the alexandrian grain trade despite the unfortunate treatment of their father by tiberius and so the wheel of time rolls on said caligula and here you both are visitors to the imperial presence as was your father before you welcome titus began to relax the emperor himself was treating them with friendship and respect what could be better he glanced sidelong and caught his brothers eye kaeso looked tense and anxious his brother needed to learn to relax and to enjoy the benefits that fortune had bestowed on them the audience was interrupted by the appearance of the emperors daughter little julia drusilla was followed by a harriedlooking nurse who wore the vestments of a priestess of minerva the girl ran shrieking to her father titus wondered if something was wrong with the child but caligula seemed unperturbed he opened his mouth and shrieked back at her then took her in his arms as the two of them screamed with laughter father and daughter seemed to be playing a noisy familiar game titus saw his wife and his sisterinlaw smile and take an interest as they tended to do in the presence of any child little julia drusilla was thoroughly disheveled with her golden hair mussed and her gown askew and once her laughter subsided her petulant mood returned with a look of alarm caligula noted a spot of blood on her tunic whats this he cried its another childs blood the priestess quickly explained she was playing with some other children and what happened asked caesonia sharply they looked at me funny so i scratched their faces the little girl made a fearsome face and mimicked the clawing of a cat i was afraid she might blind one of them whispered the priestess caligula examined the girls hands look at that she has blood under her tiny fingernails he sat back on the couch and clapped his hands good girl a little shelion you are well if ever there was any need for proof that the child is mine as was doubted by certain gossips now deceased theres your proof like father like daughter by all means if the other children should offend you dont stand for it scratch their eyes out theres quite a thrill in drawing blood isnt there little one yes papa run and say hello to my guests im sure the ladies want to meet you julia first approached artemisia who shrank back the little girl then turned to chrysanthe who managed a crooked smile and held out her hand julia stared at the hand for a moment then snarled and snapped at it chrysanthe pulled back her hand with a cry julia turned and ran laughing to her father who seemed as amused as his daughter at the womens discomfort he gave julia a parting kiss then sent the child and her nurse on their way caesonia looked at her guests and shrugged children such a distraction yet they bring so much joy does either of you have children yet artemisia blushed and looked to chrysanthe who had regained her composure no not yet but as my husband says perhaps the waiting has been a blessing since our firstborn can now be conceived here in the city of his ancestors so young and not yet mothers said caesonia so you both must be very tight still chrysanthes smile wavered im not sure what you mean caesonia giggled and crooked her finger at caligula who leaned close so that she could whisper in his ear while the imperial couple conversed in a hush kaeso leaned towards titus let me have the amulet he whispered titus frowned and shook his head he defensively touched the fascinum where it lay hidden under his toga he had won the toss of the dice that morning as kaeso was well aware but kaeso was insistent please brother give it to me why for protection from what cant you feel his presence who the devil himself titus rolled his eyes unable to believe that kaeso was spouting yet another of the impious notions he had picked up in alexandria and in the very presence of the emperor he gave a start when he realized that caligula was addressing him in a sharp voice tituss face turned hot a thousand pardons dominus i didnt hear you then listen more attentively titus pinarius i dont ask unimportant questions and i hate to repeat myself but i will ask again because caesonia wants to know are the two of you identical in every way titus raised an eyebrow we certainly have differences of opinion dominus i mean physically you fool caligula smiled baring a bit more of his teeth than seemed normal yes dominus were identical twins as you can see people remark on our similarity all the time truly identical in every way yes show us i beg your pardon show us caesonia wants to see and so do i i dont understand said titus his heart sinking i think you do stand up and take off your togas both of you titus and kaeso exchanged pained glances neither moved caligula sighed please dont be tiresome you really have no choice it is a god who asks this of you this is most improper said kaeso improper caligula seemed more amused than angry do you see the armed men standing over there beside the pillars why do you think theyre there well to protect the emperor said titus his mouth dry caligula laughed the emperor is a god and needs no protection those men are here to enforce the emperors will when those in the emperors presence are slow to obey him do i need to call on them now they will use whatever force is necessary titus glanced at the faces of the guards perhaps this was all a game a test of some sort he thought until he saw the looks on their faces his blood turned cold titus was so lightheaded that he could hardly stand he gestured for kaeso to do likewise when kaeso hesitated titus grabbed his shoulder and pulled him to his feet trying to maintain an air of unconcern as if he were alone in his own room titus began to unwind his toga normally a slave helped a master to put on his toga and to take it off as well tituss hands were clumsy the soft wool seemed determined to thwart him he tripped over the toga and almost fell before he managed to extract himself from it and in the process lost any pretense of dignity pulling the tunic over his head was easier he stood upright wearing only his loincloth caligula and caesonia stared at titus intently then turned their attention to kaeso who lagged behind eventually kaeso stood in only his loincloth next to his brother at the far ends of the two couches artemisia and chrysanthe were so still and quiet that they might have turned to stone go on said caligula we must see everything his face flushed his hands trembling titus undid his loincloth and let it fall except for his shoes and the fascinum at his breast he stood naked from the corner of his eye he saw kaeso drop his loincloth as well extraordinary caligula rose from his couch and examined them more closely peering at them as if they were statues or slaves for purchase it is said that the gods never make two pearls or even two peas in a pod so alike that a man cannot tell them apart and yet i would defy anyone to distinguish between the two of you what do you think caesonia all shrivelled up like that any two members might look alike i think we will have to see them in a state of arousal dominus this is not right said titus his voice cracking send away our wives at least but your wives are essential to the experiment caesonia stood facing the brothers she reached out and began to fondle them both at once titus gasped and closed his eyes though he would not have thought it possible he began to respond he felt the blood engorging his member and little thrills of pleasure from caesonias touch apparently kaeso had responded as well for caligula clapped his hands and laughed with delight still exactly the same identical in every respect can you detect any difference caesonia weigh them each in your hand measure the girth and the length examine them carefully for blemishes or other distinguishing marks titus opened his eyes caesonia looked very pleased with herself and with the effect she was having on them his head felt lighter than air and his legs were weak but there was no denying the pleasure she was inducing in him no difference at all caesonia announced ah but the hand delicate as it may be is an insensitive instrument compared to the lips and the tongue is that not true caesonia based on your experience dominus please titus begged his voice weak for the emperors wife to do what you suggest shut your filthy mouth shouted caligula his sudden rage made titus blanch yet he felt himself grow even suffer in caesonias hand how dare you suggest such a thing caesonia is mine and mine alone the very idea that she would lower herself to such an act with a mortal like you is disgusting dominus if i misunderstood you certainly did guards bring blindfolds for these two women and bring gags for their husbands to keep them quiet during the experiment dominus what experiment caligula rolled his eyes like a tutor with a stupid pupil we are going to see if your own wives can tell you apart of course first we shall blindfold the women then we shall stand the two of you back to back next we will spin your blindfolded wives around until they lose all sense of direction then push them to their knees finally your wives will show us if they can tell the difference using only their mouths between one twin and the other the events unfolded exactly as caligula desired moment by moment tituss fear and humiliation were matched only by his unflagging excitement at times he felt as if he had left his body and was floating above the scene a mere observer of the degrading spectacle taking place below drawing close to form a cordon around them the guards observed everything occasionally one of them snickered or grunted and several times when titus was slow to cooperate something sharp jabbed his throat or his chest or some exposed part of his body normally hidden from sight caesonia frequently giggled and whispered to the emperor who oversaw the experiment with childlike delight a curious fact struck titus after all his scrutiny caligula had failed to notice the one thing that distinguished him from his brother even in their nakedness the fascinum the little lump of gold felt alternately freezing cold and burning hot against tituss naked sweaty flesh it seemed at times to move and palpitate as if it were alive as titus reached a climax the experiment reached a conclusion blindfolded even their wives could not tell titus and kaeso apart an hour after their audience began titus and kaeso and their wives were allowed to leave the palace alive unmarked and to all appearances unscathed but as the elegant litters bore them back to the house they shared the women wept and the brothers kept their eyes downcast you should have given me the amulet when i asked for it said kaeso night had fallen their distraught wives had withdrawn to their bedrooms the sleepless brothers sat some distance apart in their moonlit garden shivering under heavy blankets titus shook his head and scowled amazed that this was how his brother should break the silence that had been uninterrupted between them since they had left the imperial house i should have given you the fascinum what possible difference would that have made it might have protected artemisia and me but it failed to protect any of us you fool a fascinum is meant to avert the gaze of the envious but the emperor is a god or something close to a god his gaze was too powerful caligula is not a god and that object is not a fascinum titus shook his head must you contradict everything i say brother there is only one god no stop this impious talk and the thing around your neck may well be a holy talisman but it isnt a fascinum what is it then have you ever actually looked at it carefully do so now titus lifted the chain over his neck and reached for a lamp the amulet glittered between his fingers i see a bit of gold probably alloyed with some baser metal to make it more durable even so its worn down to a shapeless lump not shapeless brother it has a shape describe it a bit taller than it is wide with little nubs projecting from each side you can see how once it was a phallus with wings you see it as a winged phallus brother because thats what youre looking to see but if you forget what youve been told and simply look at it what does it resemble titus shrugged a cross i suppose exactly a cross the crucifix upon which criminals and escaped slaves are hung to die titus made a face crucifixion is the most disgraceful sort of death who would make an amulet of a crucifix unless they wanted to bring a curse on the wearer instead of a blessing im not saying our amulet began as a cross titus perhaps it is ancient as ancient as our father thought and perhaps it did begin as a fascinum as claudius believes but it has become something entirely different time and divine will have transformed it i think it was transformed by a gradual wearing away over many generations how it happened here in this material world is of no importance what matters is the shape it has come to assume and what that shape symbolizes and what is that there are those who believe that the one true god the creator of all things manifested himself on earth as a man and that man was put to death on a cross in jerusalem during the reign of tiberius who believes such a thing your jewish mystics in alexandria theyre not the only ones oh kaeso dont say these things to me its too distressing weve all suffered enough today we suffered because we fell into the hands of satan himself satan the lord of evil i thought you believed there was only one god there is and he is all that is good but youve just told me theres a god of evil called satan satan is not a god only god is god titus covered his ears stop babbling kaeso how it happened i dont know titus but we have been given an amulet in the form of a cross a holy symbol because it was on a cross that our saviour jesus christ was killed is that the name of your god jesus christ how could he possibly be killed a god by definition is immortal are you saying there was ever only one god and now hes dead titus trembled and began to weep he fell from his chair onto his knees o hercules whose altar we founded o fascinus worshipped by our family before the city was founded o jupiter father and greatest of all the gods my brother has been most cruelly treated today his mind is unhinged let this madness pass from him quickly let him come back to his senses for the sake of his poor wife for the sake of us all kaeso stood his posture was defiant ive never spoken to you openly about these things brother because i feared this was how you would react someday i hope to bring you to the true knowledge of god which i received in alexandria and which is known even here in roma if only by a few the reward for enlightenment is eternal life brother and this titus still on his knees clutched the fascinum and shook his fist that was how this mad conversation began with your claim that the amulet might have saved you how might that have happened there must be a reason that this crucifix was given to us had i as a believer been wearing it the power of jesus christ might have shielded us from the hateful gaze of satan himself true believers have witnessed many such miracles but you just said that your god was dead in anger and disgust titus hurled the amulet at his brother here take it i never want to see it again the thing is useless not even worth the gold its made of keep it kaeso wear it every day if you like and see what good it does you terrible said claudius shaking his head tttruly appalling its brave of you ttitus to confide in me they were in claudiuss private apartment in the imperial complex some rumour about the twins ordeal must have reached him for when titus sent a message asking again for a meeting claudius responded at once his invitation was addressed to both brothers but kaeso had refused to come saying he would never set foot in any part of the palace again it was just as well that titus came alone since the day of the audience and the argument that followed the brothers had hardly spoken titus had intended to conceal the more humiliating aspects of their audience with the emperor but soon found himself telling the older man everything it will gggive you no comfort said claudius but you should know that i myself have been treated almost as shamefully by my nephew hes seen fit to kill many of those around him and not from fear or suspicion as tiberius and even augustus occasionally did he seems to do it from sheer spite hes spared me so far but hes made it clear that i could dddie at any moment he keeps me alive solely for the pleasure of making me squirm every now and then more than once hes reduced me to tears and made me bbeg for my life i speak of this to no one but im telling you titus because you have been so honest with me but why didnt you warn us cousin wed heard rumours about his eccentric behaviour but nothing prepared us for what happened claudius shrugged his unpredictable nature is a pppart of his madness sometimes he behaves with perfect decency i hoped you might be lucky i kept my distance for fear of attracting attention to you and if i had warned you of the danger would you have refused the audience that would have invited something even worse and believe me as awful as it was what caligula did to you was not the most horrible atrocity hes committed against an unsuspecting innocent titus shuddered hes like a monstrous child caligula was twentyfour when he was made emperor only a little older than you are now his youth seemed quite attractive after enduring tiberiuss unseemly dddecrepitude now it seems a curse caligula could rule for the rest of our lifetimes he could still be emperor when your grandchildren are grown claudius shook his head augustus and tiberius left us no mechanism for the removal of an emperor they ruled for life and we must assume caligula will do the same in retrospect perhaps such a young person should never have been made emperor for someone so young to be given so much power youre not talking about me are you my dear messalina stepped into the room her pregnancy was now in the eighth month her sheer gown more suitable for the bed chamber than the street showed off not only her round belly but also her greatly enlarged breasts titus tried not to stare at her but she swayed as she circled the room seeming deliberately to flaunt herself messalina you should be in bbed she sighed i cant spend every hour of every day lying down and im as hungry as a horse i thought caligula was hosting some sort of banquet today claudius nodded and explained to titus my nephew is hosting a private festival here step onto the balcony with me below them was a colonnaded walkway that led to a nearby courtyard surrounded by a portico and high shrubs its being held in that courtyard over there you can see a bbbit of the stage thats been assembled for the occasion the festivities should commence at any moment boys from the best families of greece and ionia will be singing a hymn which the emperor composed to his own divinity you can hear them practising he turned to messalina but darling you know why were not gggoing i was told that the emperor is out of sorts suffering from indigestion and wants to be attended only by his wife and daughter a good thing were not going if you ask me when augustus had indigestion we worried for his health when caligula suffers its our own lives we have to worry about the shame of it that onceproud romans should quake in fear when another man passes wind who told you the emperor didnt want us to come messalina put her hands on her hips causing her breasts to project before her didnt i say it was cassius chaerea the praetorian tttribune messalina grinned that prude whom the emperor teases so mercilessly she looked at titus archly caligula thinks its quite hilarious to give chaerea naughty pet names as if he were some old mans spintria honeymouth pleasurebottom that sort of thing she laughed well if you could see ironjawed grizzled old chaerea youd understand how absurd it is and knowing how chaerea is so squeamish about words for the daily password caligula deliberately comes up with the most obscene phrases he can think of so chaerea has to say naughty words over and over all day long and funniest of all is when caligula passes by and offers chaerea his ring to kiss and then at the last instant sticks up his middle finger and makes chaerea messalina dddarling enough of that claudius shook his head the child is so innocent she has no idea what shes saying now go back to your rooms my dear and rest if youre hungry tell narcissus to send for something messalina made a show of pouting but did as her husband had told her flashing a last lingering look at titus and brushing her fingertips over her swollen breasts as she departed titus tore his eyes from messalina and returned his gaze to the view from the balcony he pricked up his ears and frowned did you hear that claudius my ears are not what they were i dont hear anything exactly the singing stopped someones shouting are they sacrificing an animal why do you ask i thought i heard the formula that precedes a sacrifice you know when one priest says shall i do the deed and the other says strike now but this sounded odd somehow not like priests at all from the distant courtyard they heard a sudden uproar shouts the clanging of metal and then shrill cries claudius frowned whats going on over there a servant ran headlong from the courtyard followed by more servants and then a group of screaming young boys they rushed past on the walkway beneath the balcony some of them tripping and falling and getting up again claudius leaned over the balustrade whats gggoing on he shouted they all ignored him except a little boy who paused for a moment and looked up his eyes were wide with terror another boy bumped into him almost knocking him down and he hurried on what in hades muttered claudius he suddenly stiffened the servants and boy singers had all vanished a group of armed men came striding out of the courtyard their swords were drawn their faces were grim leading them was a praetorian tribune cassius chaerea whispered claudius titus sucked in a breath look at his sword the blade was covered with blood spatters of blood glistened on chaereas breastplate another tribune appeared walking quickly to catch up with chaerea cornelius sabinus whispered claudius his voice cracked carrying another bloody sword whispered titus he glanced at claudius who had gone pale and was gripping the balustrade with white knuckles tituss heart pounded chaerea saw them looking down from the balcony he came to a halt sabinus caught up with him the tribunes exchanged hushed words then together looked up at claudius and raised their bloody swords today we have a new password chaerea shouted the password is jupiter god of the thunderbolt god of sudden death more praetorians emerged from the courtyard they were in two groups each group carried a makeshift litter at first titus could make no sense of the lumpy shapeless forms on the litters then with a start he realized that they were corpses one of the bodies from the mass of disarranged hair and the elegant stola covered with bloodstains appeared to be that of a woman as the men drew nearer titus was able to see her face caesonias eyes were wide open her lips were drawn back and her teeth were clenched the other body was much smaller it was a little girl her golden hair was clotted with blood her face was unrecognizable her head had been crushed even at such a distance titus could smell the gore the sight made him nauseated caesonia and lllittle julia claudius swayed and steadied himself against the balustrade then pushed himself back and staggered from the balcony by hercules they intend to kill us all help me titus i bbbeg you hide me but they saluted you claudius they gave you the password they brandished their swords and mmmocked me didnt you see the look in their eyes coldblooded assassins womankillers childkillers once upon a time men like those murdered the divine julius and now theyve dared to mmmurder caligula if they mean to restore the republic theyll slaughter my whole family not just me but messalina and the unborn baby im a dead man titus titus did his best to calm him but claudius only became more hysterical he ran back and forth across the room unable to decide whether to stay or to leave his head began to twitch uncontrollably and he made no effort to wipe away the drool that ran from the corner of his mouth at last he ran to the door determined to flee then froze at the sound of stamping feet in the hallway claudius grabbed titus by the arm and pulled him back to the balcony he huddled behind the drapes at one end pulling titus close trying to conceal them both the stamping feet reached the doorway a group of men entered the room hes not here sir said a deep voice but the tribunes said they saw him in this room standing on that balcony well hes not here now we didnt pass him in the hallway think he jumped from the balcony ha shirking his duty quiet you fool use our eyes do you see what i see claudius and titus both looked down claudiuss feet were protruding beyond the hem of the drapes he drew them back but it was too late footsteps approached the drapes were pulled aside titus braced himself next to him claudius dropped quivering to his knees he began to babble unable to speak because of his stutter then covered his face with his arms and let out a shriek the soldiers drew back if they were amused or startled their emotionless faces did not show it having served caligula thought titus there was probably not much that could shock or titillate them the small company of praetorians threw back their shoulders and stiffly saluted hail dominus they shouted in unison claudius slowly lowered his arms he blinked and wiped the drool from his chin what did you cccall me titus helped him to his feet claudius was so shaky that he could barely stand he gave a start when more praetorians entered the room but the men kept their distance drew to attention and saluted hail dominus whispering a prayer of relief titus reached up to touch the fascinum but it was not there at such a moment a moment he would never forget a moment he would talk about to his children and their children he should have been wearing the fascinum of the pinarii what a fool he had been to spurn the amulet and give it to kaeso what a fool he had been not to trust in the gods and in his own good fortune one moment he had been plunged in despair a humiliated subject at the mercy of a mad emperor and then in the blink of an eye he found himself standing next to his late fathers dear cousin his own friend and confidant the new emperor of the world titus backed away from claudius leaving the emperor alone on the balcony he joined the soldiers and bowed his head respectfully hail dominus he shouted ad what do you think father whispered titus pinarius he stood in the vestibule of his house on the aventine before the rows of niches that housed the wax effigies of his ancestors among them was the death mask of his father which had been cast in alexandria its placement in the vestibule along with all the other effigies had been among their first duties when titus and kaeso moved into this house titus was wearing the trabea he had inherited from his father he held the elegantly carved ivory lituus that had been in the family for generations at twentyfour the same young age at which his father had been inducted titus had become an augur thanks to the sponsorship of his cousin the emperor claudius now at twentynine titus was an experienced and highly respected member of the college chrysanthe noting that the saffronstained wool with its broad purple stripe had begun to fade a bit had recently suggested that titus acquire a new trabea but he would not hear of it instead the best fullers in roma had thoroughly cleaned it and applied fresh dye so that the garment was as soft and bright as the first day his father wore it titus gazed at the effigy of his father it was a good likeness just as titus remembered him and he felt that his father approved when i wear this trabea i honour the gods titus said quietly but i also honour you father he felt a twinge of guilt and it was almost as if his father had spoken aloud but where is your brother kaeso he should be here as well titus could not remember the last time his brother had stood with him in this vestibule and paid homage to their ancestors as soon as he could after the incident with caligula about which no one ever spoke kaeso had moved out of the house he had taken the fascinum with him despite tituss request that they share it again but he had been happy to leave the wax effigies with titus kaeso seemed to care nothing at all about their ancestors not even about their father kaeso never sought any favours from claudius and spurned tituss repeated suggestions that he too should become an augur or secure some other respectable position worthy of his patrician status instead kaeso sold to titus his half of their interests in the alexandrian grain trade saying he had no desire for possessions what had become of kaesos share of the family fortune apparently he had dispersed it among fellow members of his cult of whom there were more than titus would have thought in roma kaeso and artemisia were living in a squalid apartment in the subura kaeso seemed unconcerned that he had descended into poverty and his behaviour and beliefs had become more bizarre with each passing year you look splendid said chrysanthe joining titus in the vestibule to see him off in her arms she carried their newborn son lucius the boy had a remarkably full head of hair for an infant and bore a striking resemblance to his grandfather to stand before the image of his father dressed in his fathers trabea with his wife and new son beside him this seemed to titus as fine a moment as a man could hope for why had kaeso turned his back on a proper life kaeso and artemisia did not even enjoy the blessing of a child and apparently this was not by chance but by choice why bring a new life into such a foul world kaeso had once said to him especially when this world is about to come to an end that had been another of their conversations that did not go well what sort of augury will you perform today asked chrysanthe some public event with the emperor present no nothing like that its a request for a private augury a family matter i imagine the house is over on the esquiline will you take the sedan she referred to the newly fashionable conveyance carried by slaves in which the occupant sat upright rather than reclining as one did in an oldfashioned litter no its a beautiful autumn day ill walk you should take one of the slaves for a bodyguard no need ill go alone are you sure walking down to the forum is one thing but through the subura no one interferes with an augur going about his official duties titus assured her he kissed his wife and his son and set out in fact he had chosen to go alone because he wished to pay a call without the risk that his wife would find out about it later from a looselipped slave on his way to his appointment on the esquiline he was going to visit kaeso passing by the circus maximus titus ducked inside to have a look at the largescale refurbishments that had been finished just in time for the recent secular games among many other improvements the tufa barriers at the starting area had been replaced with marble and the conical wooden posts at each end of the spine with pillars of gilded bronze only a few chariot drivers were practising on this day putting their horses through easy paces around the huge track how different it was to see the place empty instead of filled to capacity with eighty thousand cheering spectators crossing the forum he wore his trabea proudly and nodded to acquaintances in their togas and paused for a moment to watch the vestal virgins on their way to the temple of the sacred hearthfire beyond the forum a neighbourhood of respectable shops and eateries quickly gave way to increasingly lessreputable venues dogs and children played in the narrow streets outside gambling dens taverns and brothels tall tenements shut out the sunlight the stifled air grew thick with an assortment of unpleasant odours that titus could not remember ever smelling on the airy slopes of the aventine he found the fivestory tenement where kaeso lived the place looked as if it might fall down at any moment a long section of one wall made of crumbling brick and mortar was propped up with wooden planks the wooden stairway inside was rickety and missing some of the steps listening to the building creak and groan around him titus cautiously ascended to the uppermost floor and tapped on a thin door kaeso opened the door he was bearded now and wore a tunic so threadbare that titus could see the fascinum through the cloth the necklace upon which it hung was make of twine not gold kaeso greeted titus politely but without much warmth come in brother he said once inside titus shook his head unable to conceal his dismay at the squalor of kaesos living conditions sleeping mats were crowded together on the floor gathered in the next room were several disreputablelooking men and women whom he could only assume were sharing the apartment the members of kaesos cult seemed to celebrate poverty living communally and indiscriminately sharing what little they possessed one of the strangers a whitebearded man in a tattered robe joined them his eyes fixed on tituss trabea this fellow is a brother an augur kaeso smiled no brother hes not one of us this is my twin titus pinarius the stranger gave titus another look and laughed well i should have known yes i see the resemblance now shall we give you some time alone then the brothers and sisters will leave you for a while the men and women shambled out of the apartment to titus each one looked shabbier and more disheveled than the last the stairway creaked under their weight do we look that different now said kaeso when they were alone certainly to a casual observer the twins no longer resembled each other as closely as they once had kaeso had long hair and an unkempt beard and did nothing to make himself presentable while titus conscious of the public nature of his work and fastidious by nature was shaved by his barber daily and was regularly groomed by his slaves at the public baths when was the last time kaeso had visited the baths titus wrinkled his nose kaeso sensed his disapproval his tone was sharp so brother why have you come to see me titus was equally sharp brother you call me it seems youve found others more worthy of being called your brother when kaeso made no answer titus regretted his harsh tone does there have to be a reason for me to visit you brother we see each other so seldom i suspect you must have some cause to be here titus sighed in fact i do have a reason i suppose its too much to ask that you keep this to yourself the decree will become public soon enough but id rather it didnt get out that i gave anyone advance notice what are you talking about do you still call yourself a follower of christ its not what i call myself it is what i am titus shook his head you must know how much trouble your people have been causing in the city last month there was a riot in one of the jewish neighborhoods caused by the intolerance of certain jews who do not approve of those among them who follow christ all this squabbling among the jews can jews do nothing else in jerusalem people say there are stonings every day because these jews slaughter each other over the least religious disagreement if indeed any of them can be called religious since they refuse to acknowledge the gods the jews worship the one and only god as do i and the other followers of christ but if you are not a jew kaeso how can you be a christian brother i have explained all this to you before while there are some who argue to the contrary it is my belief that a follower of christ does not need to be a jew and therefore does not need to be circumcised titus winced dont tell claudius that hes convinced that all this fighting is strictly a matter of internecine squabbling among the jews with no romans involved thats why hes decided to ban the jews from the city thats what i came to tell you what kaeso was aghast where does he expect them to go back to judaea i suppose let them take with them all this squabbling about one god and circumcision and christ and leave the good people of roma in peace why are you telling me this titus because i would hate to see you and your wife mistakenly rounded up and deported to judaea you fool which just might happen if you insist on spouting impious ideas and keeping company with fanatical jews but surely if i offer proof of my roman citizenship that should be enough to protect you or you can always demonstrate that you havent been circumcised titus added with a shudder of disgust he looked sidelong at his brother you arent circumcised are you kaeso kaeso raised an eyebrow no brother in that respect we are still identical whether it was intended to or not the remark recalled to titus their audience with caligula he could think of nothing more to say it was kaeso who broke the uncomfortable silence thank you for telling me titus at least i can warn some of my jewish brothers about the emperors intentions and give them time to prepare it may lessen their hardship i thought you welcomed hardship titus surveyed the squalid surroundings the filthy sleeping mats the threadbare coverlets the scraps of food on the floor a cracked clay lamp that smelled of rancid oil kaeso shrugged in the kingdom of the wicked it is inevitable that men must suffer for a little longer anyway please kaeso dont start talking about the end of the world again its not too late for you titus if you act quickly the end is very near christ taught that his second coming would be sooner rather than later and to those who have eyes to see the signs of the approaching end of days are all around us the veil of this suffering world will be ripped away the heavenly city will be revealed if your socalled science of augury and that useless stick you carry had any power at all you would see this yourself dont insult me kaeso and dont insult the gods i came here as a favour to you i may no longer think of you as my brother but i honour the memory of my father and you are my fathers son with a highpitched squeal a rat scurried out of the bedding and over tituss feet so quickly that he didnt have time to jump back his heart leaped to his throat he had had enough i have to go now kaeso off to perform an augury every time you deceive others by waving that stick and counting birds you do the work of satan titus could barely contain his anger why had he bothered to come he turned his back on kaeso and left without saying another word the house where he had been called to perform an augury was on a quiet street in one of the better parts of the esquiline hill like many roman houses this one presented little more than a blank wall to the street but the entrance was quite elegant with white marble steps and an elaborately carved door titus had been promised a substantial fee and it looked as if the occupant could well afford it but from the moment he stepped inside titus felt uneasy the slave who opened the door for him gave him a wolfish leer which hardly seemed appropriate then vanished the vestibule had no niches for the ancestors but instead displayed a small shrine to venus with a little statue of the goddess surrounded by smoking incense peering into the house from the vestibule titus caught a glimpse of a laughing girl as she ran across the atrium the girl was blond and almost naked wearing only a sort of loincloth about her hips he was left alone in the vestibule for what seemed a long time at last a female slave arrived saying she would escort him to her mistress titus was almost certain it was the same girl he had seen run across the atrium now attired in a sleeveless blue tunica that fitted her rather tightly and left most of her legs exposed he followed the girl not sure what to think they passed through a beautifully furnished room decorated with statues of eros and venus the wall paintings depicted stories of famous lovers and some of the images were quite explicit the slave led him down a long hallway past several closed doors from the rooms beyond titus heard what could only be the sounds of people making love sighs groans whispers a slap and a highpitched giggle he had been told that this was a private residence could he possibly have arrived by mistake at a brothel this is the house of lycisca is it not he asked the girl it certainly is she said leading him into a dimly lit room decorated in shades of orange and red that is my mistresss name and here she is amid the deep shadows and the amber glow of lamps reclining on an elegant couch dressed in a gown so sheer that it appeared to be made of gossamer was the emperors wife titus was speechless he had seen messalina occasionally over the years but always in the presence of her husband and usually at some official event claudiuss sudden elevation had been followed a month later by the birth of their son britannicus and since then messalina had presented herself as a model roman wife and mother doting on her child wearing modest stolas presiding at the religious rites that celebrated motherhood and comporting herself at the games and in the circus in a manner above reproach so restrained was her demeanour that people had ceased to gossip about the difference in age between claudius and messalina though still in her twenties she was the exemplar of a staid roman matron the woman who lounged on the couch before titus seemed to be a very different person her face had been made even more beautiful by the application of subtle cosmetics her hair was swept into a vortex atop her head baring completely her long white neck which was adorned with a silver necklace hung with tiny pearls larger pearls hung from the silver clasps on her earlobes and the silver bangles at her wrists made a kind of music when she picked up a wine cup her gown covered her body with a silvery sheen concealing nothing sharing the couch with messalina was someone else titus recognized indeed almost anyone in roma would have recognized mnester who had been caligulas favourite actor and had continued to enjoy imperial favour under claudius the fairhaired greek was a ubiquitous figure at banquets and public ceremonies with his bright blue eyes and apollolike features his chiselled torso and long elegant limbs mnester was probably more famous for his good looks than for his theatrical skills though titus had once seen him perform a memorable ajax on this occasion the actor wore nothing but a loincloth that appeared to be made of the same sheer fabric as messalinas gown the two of them reclined head to head and passed the wine cup back and forth they both appeared to have drunk quite a bit of wine already unnerved by the way the two of them openly stared at him without speaking titus felt obliged to say something domina he began addressing the empress formally but she cut him off at once lycisca thats my name in this house lycisca i was inspired to take the name when i saw mnester perform in a play about actaeon did you see that performance titus i dont think so but you must know the story actaeon the hunter with his pack of hounds came upon diana bathing in a pool in the woods the virgin goddess didnt like having a mortal see her naked and didnt want him bragging about it so to keep actaeon quiet she turned him into stag she didnt intend what happened next in the blink of an eye the hunter became the hunted the dogs fell upon actaeon in a frenzy and tore him to pieces i always thought that was a bit harsh that a fellow should be destroyed just because he saw a goddess naked youd think diana might have invited him to bathe with her instead especially if actaeon was as young and handsome as all the statues show him to be or as handsome as mnester who drew tears from the audience with his performance even my husband wept and the name lycisca said titus trying not to stare at the way messalinas breasts rose and fell while she spoke causing the sheer fabric to appear transparent one moment opaque the next lycisca was the leader of actaeons hunting pack a halfwolf halfcanine bitch under this roof you must call me nothing else buy why would you call yourself such a thing lets hope you never find out titus pinarius now come here and join us on the couch she said patting a spot between them and share some of this fine falernian wine i came here to perform an augury messalina shrugged it seemed the best way to get you here sorry but we have no use for your lituus today perhaps you possess some other staff that might be of use to me her intention was all too clear titus felt an impulse to turn and leave the room at once he felt another impulse equally strong to pause and consider the opportunity that was being offered to him curious to see where it might lead he was not opposed to enjoying a bit of sexual pleasure when it came his way every man succumbed to temptation now and then though not usually with the emperors wife titus stalled for time by asking a question there are others in this house i heard a lot of moaning and groaning through the doors what sort of place is this its not a brothel if thats what youre thinking messalina laughed and the women here are not prostitutes some of the most highborn women in roma come to this house to enjoy a degree of freedom they cannot exercise elsewhere and the men who come here they are the sort of men whose company gives pleasure to those highborn women most of them are young handsome virile men like you perhaps you flatter me messalina lycisca very well lycisca but it occurs to me that if i were to stay here much longer i might commit an act that could be construed as disloyal not just to my emperor but to my cousin a man who has been a good friend to me mnester snorted that means hes afraid of being caught that was true but it was not the entire truth certainly titus felt a quiver of apprehension considering the consequences that might arise from betraying the emperors trust but he also felt genuinely grateful to claudius and even admired him despite his flaws as emperor the old fellow had proven to be a disappointment to many people he had ordered numerous executions and often showed poor judgement and was said to be easily led by those around him most notably messalina and his trusted freedman narcissus but all in all most people agreed claudius doddering as he might be was an improvement over the cruelties of tiberius and the madness of caligula certainly titus thought so claudius had done a great deal to help him and his family and had never harmed them the consequence you should worry about is the consequence of disappointing me said messalina does the name gaius julius polybius mean anything to you the literary scholar and friend of the emperor who was executed for treason that was the official charge the fact is polybius stood right where youre standing and refused to do what i wished later i told my husband he had made unseemly advances and i insisted that he be punished surely polybius protested his innocence when it comes to a choice between believing me or believing anyone else including even you titus pinarius my dear husband will side with me every time we can put it to the test if you insist but do you really want to risk suffering the fate of actaeon think how much more enjoyable it would be to lie beside me on this couch and sip a bit of wine its very good wine said mnester raising the cup in invitation torn by indecision titus continued to hesitate mnester laughed i understand your dilemma friend i tried to resist her myself at first to no avail like you my fear of offending claudius outweighed my desire for lycisca desirable as she is she made promises she made threats she used all her seductive wiles still i refused then one day claudius summoned me for a private meeting just the two of us he told me that his wife was complaining that i had refused to perform for her and that this had made her very unhappy he ordered me in no uncertain terms to do whatever she demanded must i submit to anything she asks i said yes anything so here i am merely doing my emperors bidding but claudius couldnt have known what you were talking about he couldnt approve of this no most husbands give themselves the freedom to seek pleasure outside their marriage and some husbands are enlightened enough to allow their wives the same freedom especially if the wife is much younger and possessed of strong appetites and has already produced a healthy heir little britannicus would be close to seven years old now thought titus there was nothing maternal in messalinas appearance at this moment are you suggesting that claudius wouldnt object if i were to join you i hardly think he would agree to such a thing if i asked him not if you asked him explicitly and performed the deed under his nose giving him no way to retain his dignity thats not how the game is played it all happens with a wink and a nod and out of sight dont you see the important thing is that messalina should be happy dont you want to make her happy titus mnester moved closer to messalina and slipped his fingers inside the sheer gown cupping his hand around one breast squeezing it so that the nipple pressed against the fabric messalina sighed shes very responsive whispered mnester ive never made love to another woman like her you really owe it yourself to join us titus the last of tituss resistance faded they were both young and beautiful and appeared to be completely without inhibitions the duty would hardly be onerous as long as titus could keep his thoughts from leaping to the all the fearsome outcomes that might ensue he was suddenly extremely aroused could it be that the element of danger even more than messalina was exciting to him well if i really have no choice he muttered taking a step forward and if claudius does not object he added not believing this lie for a moment he soon found himself between the two of them no longer standing but horizontal the couch was firm the cushions soft they took turns refilling the cup with wine and putting it to his lips they pulled off his shoes and his trabea and undid the loincloth underneath warm hands stroked his flesh someone was kissing him he was not sure which but the lips were soft and pliant the tongue eager it was messalina who kissed him mnester was doing something with his mouth elsewhere messalina pulled back so that titus could see isnt he beautiful she whispered i love him and i hate him for the same reason because hes prettier than i am from somewhere she produced a thin leather whip with an ivory handle with a crack that made titus jump she wielded it with surprising strength against mnesters broad shoulders he moaned but did not stop what he was doing if anything he performed more avidly making titus writhe with pleasure mnester is so pretty even claudius has been known to kiss him after a particularly fine performance said messalina do you know i think hes the only man my husband has ever kissed claudius has no interest in either men or boys the silly old fool messalina kissed titus again taking his breath away and what interests you titus pinarius no dont answer between the two of us mnester and i will discover everything that gives you pleasure after everyone had been satisfied and satisfied again there was a long languid hour of utter indolence as the three of them lay close together naked and silent and drained of desire it messalina who finally spoke dont you have a brother titus he was almost dozing it took him a moment to answer yes a twin brother yes i thought so i remember meeting the two of you when you first came to roma i could tell you apart though i knew you were the playful one you were certainly right about that said mnester sleepily titus smiled enjoying the praise but one never sees him about hes still alive isnt he your twin brother yes and still in the city yes titus shifted uneasily he was wide awake now then where are you hiding him titus you must bring him to meet me one of you is delightful two of you would be divine can you imagine mnester identical twins mnester made a growling sound titus squirmed a bit not liking the drift of the conversation actually were not as alike as we used to be kaeso doesnt look after his appearance hes rather unkempt these days a wild man all the better messalina purred i can catalogue the differences and similarities between the two of you titus was now acutely uncomfortable reminded for the second time that day of his longago audience with caligula that occasion had been a torment the stuff of nightmares todays tryst equally unexpected and to some extent coerced had delivered him to a state of bliss it was a curious thing how the same acts resulting in the same physical release could bring either misery or joy depending on the circumstances and the people involved messalina was quiet for the moment and titus deliberately tried to think of other things at the secular games he said thats where it was what are you talking about said messalina thats where i saw mnester play ajax at one of the plays put on during the secular games last summer ive been trying to remember ever since i stepped into this room and recognized him i could remember the performance but not the venue at least i was memorable murmured mnester more than memorable said titus you were brilliant i believed every moment that you were the worlds greatest warrior wearing that magnificent armour when athena put you under a spell i really thought you were sleepwalking and when you woke up covered in blood and realized youd killed a herd of sheep instead of your enemies well i had to laugh and shudder at the same time and your suicide scene truly you had me in tears mnester made a contented noise now that i think of it titus went on the whole festival was remarkable everything about the secular games was firstrate the gladiator matches the races the plays the banquets the concerts in the temples the pantherhunt in the circus maximus that was spectacular though i think i was even more impressed by the thessalian horsemen the way they drove that herd of bulls in a stampede around the track then dismounted and wrestled them to the ground amazing stuff i think those games were the highlight of claudiuss reign so far and why not they say the secular games are held only once in a lifetime and these marked the eight hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city quite a grand occasion he stopped abruptly mnester was kicking him under the thin coverlet he turned to see that mnester was frowning and shaking his head as if to warn titus away from the subject but it was too late messalina sat upright and crossed her arms her pretty face was twisted by a vexed expression the secular games that was where she made her move she said titus agrippina claudiuss niece the bitch mnester cringed and shifted toward the far side of the couch now youve set her off he whispered it was during the troy pageant messalina said were you there that afternoon in the circus maximus titus did you see the troy pageant no i missed that watching patrician boys dressed up as trojan warriors perform maneuvers on horseback was a pastime he considered more suitable for doting mothers and grandparents then you missed agrippinas triumph i was there of course with claudius and little britannicus in the imperial box before the pageant commenced i stood with britannicus and we waved to the crowd there was hardly any applause at all what were people thinking to pay so little honour to the wife and more especially to the son of the emperor eventually i sat down thoroughly disgusted in the box with us was agrippina claudius invites her to everything he says its his duty as her uncle since both her parents are dead and agrippina is a widow again raising her son alone after i sat claudius called on her to stand along with that spottyfaced brat of her little nero numas balls i couldnt hear myself think over the applause and the cheering it went on and on why all i could think was that people had been reading that insipid memoir of hers in which she paints such a puffedup portrait of herself and all her suffering have you read it titus no i havent he said strictly speaking this was true but titus knew most of the stories in agrippinas book because his wife had read it chrysanthe had been greatly inspired by the tale of a woman born into privilege but forced by fate to fend for herself and her young one at bedtime after finishing a chapter she had breathlessly repeated the stirring details for tituss edification messalina clearly had a different impression of agrippinas story youd think she was cassandra at the burning of troy the way she goes on about her woes daughter of the great germanicus and an irreproachable mother both struck down in their prime well everyones parents die sooner or later sister of caligula who turned against her confiscated her possessions and exiled her to the pontine islands where she was forced to dive for sponges to support herself of course she doesnt mention her incest with caligula or the fact that she plotted to do away with him widowed twice and forced to raise the divine augustuss one and only greatgreatgrandson all by herself though the suspicious death of her last husband left her very wealthy indeed poor longsuffering agrippina her campaign to endear herself to the people certainly seems to be working to judge by their reaction at the troy pageant and once the cheering started the spottyfaced brat stepped in front of his mother and began turning this way and that smiling and making gestures to the crowd what do you actors call it mnester milking the audience for applause mnester grunted trying to stay out of the conversation then agrippina announced that nero would be participating in the troy pageant despite the fact that he was only nine and the other boys were all older and down he went to put on his mock armour and take up a wooden sword and mount his pony more cheering though i must admit for a nineyearold he handled himself rather well on horseback born to ride muttered mnester messalina snorted what a little showman precocious claudius calls him as if that were a compliment some people find his affectations charming i think theres something repulsive about the boy and about his mother as well parading ones sorrows in public and seeking accolades from the mob is terribly vulgar dont you think her gaze demanded a response mnester gave titus another surreptitious kick and titus vigorously nodded his head its so obvious what the scheming vixen has in mind said messalina she thinks her little nero should be the next emperor surely not said titus claudius isnt getting any younger and nero will reach his toga day ahead of britannicus and the brat is a direct descendant of augustus of course so was caligula and we all know how that ended do you really think agrippina is thinking that far ahead of course the maudlin memoir the way she grooms nero and presents him in public her fawning deference to claudius her calculated role as the virtuous widow oh yes with agrippina everything is a means to an end she and that whelp of hers need to carefully watched mnester rolled farther away the coverlet slipped and exposed his meaty buttocks messalina abruptly picked up the whip with the ivory handle and gave him a cracking lash across his backside what are you smirking at i wasnt smirking lycisca mnester hid his face in a cushion and his whole body trembled titus thought he was quaking with fear until he realized that the actor was trying to hide his laughter you lout messalina gave him another lash please lycisca cried mnester though to titus it appeared that he made no effort to avoid the blow but instead raised his hips and wriggled them a bit so far messalina had spared titus the whip and though it was stimulating to see a naked wellbuilt fellow like mnester take a thrashing he did not care to receive one himself not even from messalina also he was tired if this was the prelude to more lovemaking titus was not sure he was up for it he need not have worried the conversation had put messalina in a foul mood and mnesters giggling had cooled her ardour she told titus to dress and when he was again in his trabea she handed him a little sack of coins whats this he said your fee isnt it customary to pay an augur for his services but i performed no augury nonetheless you performed and your wife will be expecting you to bring home a little something to add to the household coffers wont she now off with you will you want to see me again titus asked who knows no dont pout i hate it when men pout you were a raging stallion you were an elemental force of nature you made me melt with ecstasy honestly of course ill want to see you again but now get out titus left the house on the esquiline with mixed feelings an afternoon of debauched lovemaking was the last thing he had expected that day and to be paid for his services made him feel a bit like a spintria as people had taken to calling the male prostitutes of the city adapting the word that tiberius had coined still his performance must have been superior for messalina who clearly could have any man she wanted said she would want to see him again the autumn day was short shadows were gathering it was the hour for lighting lamps in the streets tripping lightly down the slope of the esquiline and passing through the subura titus passed the alley that led to the shabby tenement where kaeso lived what a dreadfully dull existence his brother led compared to his own eventful life ad days passed and then months and titus received no further summons from messalina he felt a bit piqued that she seemed to have forgotten him but it was probably for the best his afternoon as lyciscas plaything had been a novel experience but when he thought of the danger it took his breath away besides titus was quite happy with his home life no man had ever had a more loving wife than his chrysanthe it was from chrysanthe of all people that titus heard the rumour that explained why messalina had lost interest in him you wont believe what i heard from the neighbors wife this morning she said one day when titus returned home from performing an augury at a temple on the quirinal hill try me its about the emperors wife oh titus attempted to look only mildly curious everyone knows shes a wanton woman really ive always heard that messalina is a steadfast wife and mother chrysanthe made a rude sound that would describe the emperors niece agrippina but hardly his wife you are clearly in the dark about that woman husband as is your friend the emperor of course its no surprise that messalina should have taken an occasional lover claudius is so much older and based on the behaviour of previous members of the ruling family starting with the divine augustuss daughter it seems these imperial women are incapable of behaving decently but now messalina may have gone too far they say shes settled on a single lover the senator gaius silius that was how silius got himself appointed consul this year through messalinas influence titus had met the man he was young for a consul broad shouldered undeniably handsome vain and ambitious just the sort of man messalina might take for a lover go on the shocking thing is she calls silius husband can you imagine as if claudius didnt exist or soon might not exist how could the neighbours wife possibly know such a thing slaves talk chrysanthe said this was her standard explanation for the otherwise inexplicable transmission of certain rumours she raised her eyebrows they say claudius is so addled he truly knows nothing about it titus was briefly struck by the irony that chrysanthe who was young and had all her faculties had never suspected tituss infidelity the omniscient slaves had stayed quiet about that at least titus frowned chrysanthes news if it was true posed a dilemma could messalina seriously be thinking of doing away with claudius had she carried her playacting as lycisca to a stage beyond harmless dalliance to the point that she was considering murder and a palace revolt if so surely titus had an obligation to warn his old friend and mentor about messalinas seditious behaviour but how could he do so without compromising himself he would have to sleep on the matter titus lost no sleep that night over the question of messalina and her new husband he simply pushed the matter to the back of his mind why had he thought that some action was called for on his part if even the neighbours wife knew such a rumour then everyone knew it so it hardly fell to titus to run to claudius to warn him that his unfaithful wife might or might not be plotting against him the next morning titus received a summons to the imperial residence in the form of a message from the emperor himself the courier handed him a little wax tablet bound in elaborately decorated bronze plates and tied with a purple ribbon inside was written in a crabbed hand that must have been that of claudius himself come my young friend quick as asparagus i require a very private augury the reference to asparagus meant nothing to titus but he quickly put on his trabea and fetched his lituus it had been some time since titus had been inside the imperial residence as the courier led him through various rooms and corridors he noticed changes in the decor new mosaics on the floors freshly painted images of flowers and peacocks on the walls gleaming new statues of marble and bronze since claudius cared little about decoration titus assumed it was the hand of messalina that he saw at work he and the courier were made to wait in a room where two statues faced each other across a green marble floor the marble statue of messalina presented a familiar image there were several statues of her around the city all depicting her as a dutiful mother her body was wrapped in a voluminous stola with one fold draped over her head like a mantle with a serene expression she gazed upon the naked baby britannicus cradled in her arms across from the messalina was a bronze statue that titus had never seen before depicting a nude heroic figure gold covered the naked flesh while the greek helmet cradled in the left arm the upraised sword in the right hand and the nipples on the muscular chest were chased with silver the precious metals shone with fiery brilliance in the slanting rays of morning sunlight the shoulders were so broad and the hips so narrow that one might have thought the artist had taken liberties but titus could attest that the portrayal was accurate the inscription on the pedestal said ajax but the model had clearly been mnester beautiful isnt it said the courier stunning it must have cost a fortune the courier smiled theres an interesting story about that after caligula was gotten rid of the senate voted to have every one of the coins that bore his likeness taken out of circulation and melted down they never wanted to see his face again the bullion sat for a long time until the emperor gave instructions to use the silver and gold to decorate this statue the emperor is certainly fond of mnester but they say it was his wifes idea to make this statue is that right she said it was proper to use caligulas coinage to honour caligulas favourite actor i see the two statues had been situated so that they faced each other across the room the eyes of the two figures appeared to meet as if exchanging knowing looks it was cruel of messalina thought titus to flaunt her affair even in this covert manner in the very heart of the palace under her husbands nose and in front of his visitors at last titus was called for a thorough inspection was required of anyone entering the emperors presence not even women or children were exempt from the indignity of being searched for weapons and even the lowliest scribe was made to empty his stylus box titus had been through the process before and was ready to have his lituus examined and the folds of his trabea shaken but on this day the examination was more thorough than ever he was taken to a private room and politely asked by a hulking praetorian to remove his trabea surely thats not necessary it is said the praetorian and if i refuse youre here at the emperors request this is the prescribed procedure you cant refuse the guard crossed his arms titus saw that the man had positioned himself to block the door he felt a tremor of uneasiness as he removed the trabea he was reminded of his first visit to the imperial residence long ago and the audience with caligula he drove the memory from his mind with thoughts of how caligula had met his end bleeding from thirty stab wounds that was the reason after all for this indignity claudius had never forgotten the violent manner of his predecessors death and had no intention of meeting a similar fate once upon a time it had seemed that the emperor was invulnerable and untouchable protected by the gods the beloved augustus and the detested tiberius both lived to be old men and died in bed but the violent end of caligula changed all that his murder proved that an emperor could be made to bleed and to die just like any other mortal caligulas assassination rid the world of a monster but set a terrible precedent that was why claudius instead of rewarding the tribune cassius chaerea eventually had the assassin put to death no man could be allowed to kill an emperor and get away with it not even by the man who had benefited most by becoming the next emperor at last the indignity was done with and titus was allowed to dress clutching his lituus he was shown not into a formal reception room but into the emperors private study the shelves were crammed with scrolls and the tables covered with scraps of parchment maps genealogical charts and lists of magistrates were hung on the walls the dust in the air made titus sneeze claudius was fiftyeight but looked older his purple toga was askew the way one sometimes saw togas on old men who could not look after their appearance and had no one to do it for them there was a dark spot just above his chest while titus watched claudius clutched that bit of cloth and used it to wipe the spittle from the corner of his mouth he seemed fretful and distracted shuffling through piles of scrolls and glancing this way and that before looking at titus you must ppperform an augury for me titus certainly caesar this was the title claudius preferred to dominus what is the occasion the occasion claudius put his fist to his mouth and made a strange noise the occasion is a decision that i have to mmake can you tell me more no not yet but i can say this someone will dddie titus if i make the wrong decision people will die and for no reason or i could ddie i could die claudius gripped the folds of tituss trabea titus saw fear in his cousins eyes such as he had seen on the day of caligulas murder people have died already of course because of her because i was an old fool and believed everything she told me polybius with whom i spent many happy hours in this room reading bbbooks no one but the two of us had ever heard of and my good friend asiaticus whom i would have acquitted of treason except for her meddling and young gnaeus pompeius the last descendant of the triumvir stabbed to death in his bbbed in the arms of a bbboy all dead because she wanted them dead and when i think of the family members and old friends ive sent into exile because of her scheming oh titus you are lucky man that you never crossed her titus nodded his mouth dry but before i say another word you mmmust take the auspices im afraid to do it myself but i still dont understand the purpose of the augury you neednt know the gods know my mind they know what i intend to do you must merely ask if they favour my intentions yes or no here we can do it in the garden off the study theres a clear patch of sky to the north with claudius standing behind him titus marked a section of the sky for long tense moments the two men watched in silence until finally two sparrows appeared flying from right to left titus was ready to declare that the auspice was negative when from nowhere a hawk descended on the sparrows seizing one of them in its talons the hawk with its prey flew in one direction the surviving sparrow in the other from the empty sky a single sparrow feather drifted down and landed on the far side of the garden behind titus claudius sucked in his breath without question a favourable omen do you agree tituss heart pounded yes he finally said the gods favour your action what do you intend to do caesar titus felt his cousins hand on his shoulder and flinched claudius seemed not to notice his reaction thank the gods for the pinarii i could always unburden myself to your father and though the gods took him from me they gave me you in his stead claudius shambled across the garden and picked up the feather groaning as he bent and straightened there were flecks of blood on the vane for years ive bbbeen an utter fool allowing messalina and her lovers to make a cuckold of me i believed all her lies accepted all her evasions trusted her above all those who tried to warn me but now the truth has finally cccome out and its worse than anything i could have imagined messalina has behaved like a whore she kept a house on the esquiline under an assumed name and she ran the place like a bbbrothel allowing other highborn women to meet their lovers there staging all manner of orgies they say that once she gathered prostitutes from the subura and held a ccompetition to see who could satisfy the most customers in a night and she was the winner can you imagine the wife of the emperor took pppayment to have sex with any man who wanted her one after another what would greatuncle make of such a thing he turned to look at titus titus could think of nothing to say i see youre too shocked to speak titus no words can express your outrage im sure and what could you possibly say that would bring me comfort but i havent told you the worst of it yet messalina has entered into a bbbigamous marriage with the consul gaius silius they even held a ceremony with witnesses as if the marriage were a legal union blessed by the gods i suppose they intended to stage my funeral next titus at last found his voice but caesar how can you know these things claudiuss answer was the same as chrysanthes slaves talk he said and so dddo free men under torture does messalina know youve discovered her secrets a slave warned her she fled to her house in the gardens of lucullus the love nest she acquired from asiaticus when she tricked me into executing the poor fellow praetorians have surrounded the grounds she awaits her fate gaius silius dead by his own hand and her lovers yes her lovers her many many lovers claudius toyed with the feather pulling his fingers down the shaft to tatter the vane the blood on his fingertips he wiped on his toga where the purple wool absorbed it without a trace come with me titus i need at least one ppperson in the room whom i can trust one by one the lovers were paraded before claudius to make their confessions and receive his judgement claudius sat on a thronelike chair on a raised dais praetorian guards were stationed at either side of him and at various places around the room titus stood on the dais beside claudius and next to one of the praetorians a hulking brute who stank of garlic physicians claimed that eating garlic gave a man strength and to judge by the muscles on this specimen they were right claudiuss most trusted freedman narcissus oversaw the proceedings he was a quintessential imperial bureaucrat fussy about his appearance snappish with underlings wheedling but insistent with his master as each of the accused men was shown into the chamber it was narcissus who read the charges and conducted the interrogation some of the men complained that they had been blackmailed into submission by messalina others openly admitted that they had sought her sexual favours some begged for mercy while others said nothing it made no difference when the moment came for narcissus to ask the emperor for his judgement claudius looked each man in the eye and declared ggguilty most of the men were citizens and had the right to die by beheading the fastest least painful and most dignified form of execution but a few of the accused were foreignborn they could expect to be beaten to death strangled or perhaps thrown to wild animals there were also slaves among the accused most of them from the imperial household but some belonging to outsiders rather than charge them with committing adultery the idea that another mans slave might have copulated with the emperors wife was too scandalous to contemplate narcissus accused the slaves of colluding with messalina and assisting her conspiracy their punishment would be crucifixion theyll die like kaesos socalled god on a cross thought titus touching his breast and wishing he had the fascinum to protect him the number of messalinas lovers was staggering and the repetition of the process was numbing titus would gladly have fled but he had no choice but to see and hear everything his cousin wanted him to act as mute witness to an ordeal that was almost as painful and degrading for claudius as it was for the accused or was claudius playing a cruel game with him if narcissus and his agents had uncovered messalinas dalliances with all these other men how had they failed to identify titus at any moment titus half expected to hear narcissus call his name to feel the hands of the garlicstinking praetorian upon him and to be thrust before claudius to beg for his life could claudius be that devious he seemed to have become more simpleminded as he had grown older but perhaps that was merely the ruse of a truly ingenious mind titus looked sidelong at his cousin who was wiping a bit of drool from his mouth and tried to imagine him not as the rather sad fool he appeared to be but as a master manipulator claudius not only had outlived virtually everyone else in his family but had managed to become emperor was his survival the result of blind chance or careful design yet if any proof of claudiuss blindness was required surely it was the spectacle taking place before them as one lover after another was produced to demonstrate just how unaware claudius had been narcissus called out the name of the next man to face judgement bring forth mnester tituss heart skipped a beat claudius groaned mnesters golden hair was mussed and he wore only a brief sleeveless sleeping tunic as if he had just been pulled from his bed his eyes were wide with fright as he peered around the room titus took a couple of steps back and to the side concealing himself as best he could behind the hulking praetorian had mnester seen him already titus thought not he held his breath narcissus read the charges numerous counts of adultery with the emperors wife and taking part in a criminal conspiracy to kill the emperor claudius was close to tears mnester how cccould you but caesar you yourself ordered me to submit to her claudius looked baffled did i do you not recall i tried to resist her and i begged you to take my side but you ordered me to do whatever she commanded no matter how degrading you said those very words to me you must do anything she asks and as a result you can see for yourself how ive suffered mnester lurched forward and dropped to his knees titus gave a jerk for suddenly he was visible to mnester but the actor kept his face down and his eyes averted as he pulled his tunic over his head he was not wearing a loincloth naked he prostrated himself before claudius showing the lash marks across his broad back mnester was racked by sobs do you see how she mistreats me caesar many times i wanted to come to you and complain but i was too afraid of her afraid for my very life caesar mnester had not seemed very frightened when titus had last seen him naked indeed the actor had seemed an eager participant in everything that had happened but even though titus saw through the lie he was moved by the mans lament mnester was a superb actor and this was the performance of his life the tears that streamed from his eyes were real and so were the fiery red lash marks across the rippling muscles of his back claudius was unnerved he put one hand to his mouth and shook his head his eyes glistened with tears mnester glanced up titus saw the flash of hope in his eyes please caesar i have been foully used degraded humiliated made the plaything of a woman who had the power of life and death over me have pity on me i beg you banish me from roma send me to the wilderness but spare my life she used you yes muttered claudius just as she used me titus looked sidelong at claudius and saw that his cousin was completely dazzled by the performance titus saw the contrast between the two men and at the same time he grasped the connection between them the aging hunched emperor gazed raptly at mnester as if the handsome prostrate figure before him were the idealized personification of his own suffering was this not the highest achievement an actor could attain titus stepped farther behind the praetorian but not before mnesters eyes met his it was only a brief look but titus was certain that mnester recognized him and in the other mans eyes titus saw his own doom mnester began to raise one hand as if to point in accusation titus felt as if the floor lurched beneath him his face turned hot and his heart pounded remember the auspices titus whispered claudius twitched his head to one side whats that remember the auspices caesar the gods demand justice claudius slowly nodded his head he called narcissus to him and spoke in his ear narcissus crossed the room and spoke to the praetorians at the door mnester remained on the floor his face and chest wet with tears but with the faint intimation of a smile at the corner of his mouth it was the face of an actor at the end of a tragic play exhausted by the role and still immersed in the cathartic moment but ready to receive the accolades of the audience he thought he had won claudiuss pardon in the next moment he was made aware of his mistake praetorians surrounded him one of them produced a leather strap attached at both ends to an iron rod while two men held mnester to keep him from struggling free the strangling device was slipped over his head only two twists of the rod were required to sufficiently tighten the strap mnesters face turned a vivid shade of red then purple his eyes bulged mucus erupted from his nose his tongue protruded from his mouth the only noise he made sounded disconcertingly like the squeaking of a mouse the man holding the rod gave it another full twist every part of mnesters body convulsed so violently that the praetorians barely maintained their hold then mnester went limp his body was dragged from the room narcissus called a slave to clean the floor where mnester had emptied his bladder the slave used mnesters discarded sleeping tunic as a mop are there mmmore said claudius in a hollow voice yes said narcissus several more claudius shook his head no more today im tired and hungry as you wish caesar ill see that your dinner is made ready cousin titus will dddine with me titus suppressed a groan if youd rather be alone oh no i insist run along narcissus well catch up he turned to titus thank you cousin for what for helping me keep my nerve i almost lost it mnester had to be pppunished still caesar there was no need for you to witness the unpleasantness no mnester betrayed me he deserved to dddie but his acting gave me great pleasure over the years i owed it to him to witness his final performance at dinner titus was the only guest he said little it was claudius who filled the silence as he rambled from one topic to another from the military situation in britannia conquered but still undergoing pacification by the general vespasian to his anger at the jews and all the trouble their religious fanaticism was causing not just in their homeland but in roma and alexandria and every other city where their numbers were significant claudius seemed completely disconnected from the events of the day titus could think of nothing else a part of him remained braced for some terrible surprise he kept seeing mnesters face at the end if titus had said nothing would mnester still be alive titus had merely reminded claudius of the auspices why did he feel a need to justify himself everyone else manipulated claudius to gain his own ends titus had done so to save his own life narcissus announced that a messenger had arrived with news about messalina yes where is she said claudius his voice slurred by wine why is she not here for dddinner titus felt a sinking sensation claudius continued to eat chewing on a chicken bone he said well narcissus messalina is dead caesar claudius sat back looking baffled he blinked a few times gave a twitch of his head then shrugged he reached for his cup and drank more wine he picked up another piece of chicken narcissus waited ready to be asked for more information claudius said nothing eventually narcissus cleared his throat and recounted the details caesars agents surrounded her apartments in the gardens of lucullus her slaves offered no resistance she was given a knife and offered the opportunity to take her own life she announced that she would do so but she lacked the courage when she faltered one of caesars agents took the knife from her and finished the job messalina stabbed to death titus was stunned by the enormity of it claudius took a bite of chicken and chewed for a long time staring into the distance does caesar have any further orders asked narcissus orders yes tell the bbboy to bring more wine he turned to titus you are a good man cousin a man i can trust do you know i think i shall make you a senator your grandfather was a senator wasnt he we lost a few senators today and theyll need to be replaced how would you like that claudius nodded thoughtfully i shall make you a senator on one condition if i should ever think of mmmarrying again you must stop me you will put it to a vote and have me stripped of my office if i should ever so much as mmmention mmmarriage i give you and the other senators permission to kill me on the spot and put an old fool out of his misery after dinner claudius bade titus good night and retired the same courier who had fetched titus earlier reappeared to escort him out of the imperial house they passed through the room where titus had waited something was different the statues he said where are they what statues said the courier looking straight ahead the statues of messalina and mnester i dont recall any such statues in this room said the courier but you told me that story about how the coins of caligula had been melted down the courier shrugged and quickened his pace even the pedestals were gone and the green marble floor beneath had been polished to show no trace the images of messalina and mnester had vanished as if they had never existed ad the weather was mild for middecember a crowd of dignitaries and members of the imperial household stood around the perimeter of the auguratorium on the palatine the occasion was the fourteenth birthday of young nero the son of agrippina grandson of germanicus greatgreatgrandson of augustus and greatnephew and now adopted son of claudius titus pinarius was present wearing his trabea rather than his purplebordered senatorial toga and carrying his lituus he was to perform the augury for the young mans toga day his passage to manhood chrysanthe was among the guests looking beautiful as always and only slightly uncomfortable in the company of the romanborn matrons who would always think of her as an alexandrian she devoted most of her attention to their son lucius who at four was deemed by titus to be old enough and sufficiently well behaved to attend such a ceremony and watch his father at work while he waited to be called upon titus surveyed the crowd many of the women were dazzling in their finery but none stood out more than neros mother at thirtysix agrippina was still a strikingly attractive woman her hair was parted in the middle long curls streamed like ribbons on either side and were gathered by a purpleandgold fillet at the back of her head her stola was a garment of numerous layers and folds woven of a fabric of many colours her beaming smile showed her prominent canine teeth a sign of good luck many believed fortune had certainly smiled on agrippina in recent years despite his vow never to marry again after his humiliation by messalina claudius almost immediately married agrippina it seemed the widower felt incomplete without a strongwilled and beautiful woman to manipulate him claudiuss choice of a bride had scandalized the city since marriage between an uncle and a niece was incest to forestall the fears of the populace that some supernatural calamity might result claudius had called on titus to look for omens and precedents that favoured his marriage to agrippina and titus had obliged agrippina was grateful for this service tituss prestigious role at this days event was the latest proof of her favour fortune had not always smiled on agrippina the untimely deaths of her parents her humiliating exile under caligula the loss of two husbands she had endured all these trials and emerged triumphant she had even outwitted the machinations of messalina for most people now agreed that it was agrippina and her son who had been threatened by the jealousy of messalina and not the reverse it was said that messalina had once sent an assassin to kill nero in his crib but the man had been frightened off by a snake in the babys bed actually the skin of a snake placed there by his clever and vigilant mother agrippina had become a stirring exemplar of roman womanhood she had survived every setback and her marriage to her uncle claudius had made her the most powerful woman in roma also in attendance was the nineyearold son of claudius and messalina britannicus he was dressed in the oldfashioned longsleeved tunic still worn by many patrician boys his hair was long and unkempt he seemed a bit shy and standoffish observing the proceedings with a lowered brow and sidelong glances what sort of fellow would he grow up to be wondered titus trying to imagine a combination of his wildly different parents what must the boys life be like these days three years after the terrible death of his disgraced mother claudius had once been a doting father but it seemed to titus that he now neglected the boy no doubt britannicus reminded claudius of messalina how did claudius feel about a son who looked so much like the woman who had made a fool of him and had been put to death on his orders certainly agrippina had no love for britannicus she had not only persuaded claudius to adopt nero making him first in line of inheritance ahead of britannicus but had arranged for nero to be recognized as an adult a full year earlier than was traditional a young mans toga day was usually between his fifteenth and seventeenth years so that he could begin accumulating the honours and rewards of a public career this was clearly in service to her agenda of elevating her son but there was also a sound political argument for advancing nero as quickly as possible as long as claudius had no adult heir potential rivals might be encouraged to plot against him and if claudius should die an orphaned britannicus would be highly vulnerable while nero was just old enough especially with his mother behind him to act as a plausible ruler also to his advantage was the fact that nero was the direct descendant of the divine augustus neglected though he might be young britannicus was not alone with him was his constant companion a boy a year or so older titus flavius vespasian son of the general of the same name titus had been brought up alongside britannicus with the same teachers and athletic instructors the boys bright smile and outgoing personality presented a contract to britannicuss withdrawn almost furtive manner the elder vespasian was also present along with his wife who held their newborn son in his early forties vespasian was a veteran of thirty battles in the newly conquered province of britannia his victories had earned him a public triumph in which young titus had ridden alongside him in the chariot and he had been rewarded with a consulship the highest office to which a citizen could aspire with a large nose a mouth too small for his fleshy face and a heavy furrowed brow vespasian was not handsome he had the perpetual expression of a man straining to empty his bowels his family fortune had started with his father a tax collector in the province of asia but the flavians were otherwise obscure behind his back members of the imperial court complained of vespasians uncouth manners and flagrant social climbing to titus pinarius on the few occasions when they had spoken vespasian had seemed forthright and without pretense as befitted a military man it did not seem quite proper that vespasian should have brought his twomonthold infant to such a ceremony but clearly the general was eager to show the child off to everyone who greeted him he insisted on introducing the newest addition to the flavians my little domitian tituss gaze returned to the youth who was donning the toga of manhood that day he found nero to quite charming and surprisingly selfpossessed for his age at fourteen he was a connoisseur of painting and sculpture wrote poetry and loved horses he was tall but had an ungainly physique a boys longsleeved tunic had not been flattering to neros thick neck stocky trunk and bony legs he looked better in his purpleandgold toga his blonde hair glinted in the sunlight and his flashing blue eyes were wide taking in the scene nero enjoyed being the centre of attention standing beside him was the young mans adoptive father claudius looked more decrepit than ever the poor fellow had never been the same after his discovery of messalinas bigamy and the bloodbath that followed titus still felt a chill when he remembered how claudius had expected messalina at dinner on the very night that he ordered her death and on the morning that followed claudius sent messages to some of the executed men inviting them to play dice and complained when they didnt come he sent petulant messages accusing them of staying abed and being too lazy to reply sleepyheads he called them forgetting that by his order they had lost their heads altogether on the other side of nero stood his tutor lucius annaeus seneca a bearded man in his forties wearing a senators purplebordered toga seneca was an accomplished man of letters famous for his many books and plays messalina had talked claudius into exiling seneca but agrippina had arranged for his return and had charged seneca with giving nero the most refined education possible the ceremony commenced when the time arrived for the taking of the auspices all eyes turned to titus he began with a short speech about the subject of his augury whose full name since his adoption by the emperor was nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus as many of you know the name nero comes from an old sabine word meaning strong and valiant and those who have seen this young man perform on horseback and wield arms in the troy pageant know that he is worthy of his name said titus the appreciative applause for this pretty turn of phrase was cut short by a sudden outburst of crying from vespasians newborn titus frowned the babys wailing grew louder until at last his mother carried little domitian away vespasian who seemed unperturbed by the interruption wriggled his fingers at the departing infant titus loudly cleared his throat and proceeded with his lituus he marked a segment of the sky at midwinter with few birds in roma patience might be required for the observation but almost at once titus saw a pair of vultures they were quite far away circling above the private racetrack caligula had built for himself beyond the tiber on the vatican hill titus waited hoping to see more but eventually he felt the crowd grow restive he declared the auspices well and truly taken and announced that they were very good in fact the auspices had been only mildly favourable almost noncommittal claudius standing behind him and able to see what titus saw would have known this had he been watching but when titus glanced over his shoulder he saw the emperor staring at the ground there were more speeches and then nero was called on to parade before the assembly wearing his toga he did so with a swagger that was almost comical titus was reminded of messalinas derisive comment what a little showman no one laughed though it seemed to titus that vespasian might have smirked with his expression of perpetual constipation it was hard to tell at last the company retired to the imperial residence for the banquet passing the armour of the divine augustus in the forecourt and the ancient laurel trees that flanked the massive bronze doors just how old is the emperor chrysanthe asked titus after they had settled onto their couches and been served the first course of olives stuffed with anchovies she was gazing at claudius who shared a couch with agrippina across the room titus calculated in his head sixtyone i think why do you ask when we first came to roma ten years ago i thought he was old then but he was so much more alive remember how excited he was to show us the city now he seems withered like a tree thats had its roots cut and might fall at any moment all his drinking doesnt help noted titus as he watched a serving boy refill the emperors cup chrysanthe was right his cousin was more doddering than ever what a contrast agrippina presented she was positively effervescent smiling and laughing and entertaining everyone in earshot with a very witty anecdote to judge by the laughter she elicited nero reclined on his own couch nearby and gazed at his mother adoringly while titus watched agrippina gestured to nero obeying her request the young man pulled back a fold of his purple toga to bare his right arm coiled like a snake around his biceps was a golden bracelet agrippinas listeners nodded and made appreciative sounds whats that about asked titus hes showing off his snake bracelet explained chrysanthe half the children in the city wear a bracelet like that now though not made of solid gold inside that bracelet is the snakeskin that scared off an assassin sent by messalina when nero was in his crib he wears the bracelet to show gratitude and devotion to his mother and they say the snakeskin still protects him do you think we should have such a bracelet make for little lucius their son was in another room with his nurse eating with the other children perhaps said titus though it occurred to him that a more appropriate talisman for his son would be the fascinum of their ancestors why had he allowed kaeso to take it titus realized that he was clenching his teeth he drove thoughts of his brother from his mind refusing to let them spoil such a joyous occasion as the meal progressed and more wine flowed guests began to move about the room standing in small groups or sharing couches while they conversed titus worked his way to neros couch agrippina stood nearby as did seneca standing next to seneca was a woman about half his age his wife pompeia paulina teach my son all the poetry and rhetoric and history you want i told seneca but no philosophy agrippina was saying all those notions about fate and free will and the slippery nature of reality perhaps theyre amusing for people who have nothing better to think about but they can be nothing but a handicap to a person like my son who must be ready to assume such a heavy burden of responsibility its true said seneca he had grown a beard in exile and kept it on his return it made him look more like a philosopher than a senator poetry gives consolation to the powerful while philosophy gives consolation to the powerless said titus seneca smiled greeting titus pinarius though i suppose i should address you as senator pinarius now or address him as augur thats pinariuss special calling and the one he performed today was splendid said agrippina but you must excuse me while i attend to another matter theres to be an entertainment later and im told the flute player and the dancing girl have both gone missing titus watched her leave then turned to seneca and his wife speaking of entertainment is it true that nero will be singing a song which he composed especially for the occasion of course not seneca made a face nero composed a song to be sure its a meditation on the virtues of his greatgreatgrandfather the divine augustus entirely appropriate for the occasion but the song will be sung by a young freedman a trained performer is nero a poor singer then seneca and his young wife exchanged glances he had married paulina when she was very young and she had shared the years of his exile having no other student at hand it was said that seneca had taught his wife philosophy despite her youth paulina was probably the besteducated woman in roma neros voice is not unpleasant said paulina she was evidently being generous but his talent as a singer is irrelevant added seneca it would never do for a son of the emperor to perform as a mere actor before an audience the very idea is vulgar then i suppose i shall never have the pleasure of hearing nero sing said titus still ill look forward to hearing his composition when it comes to writing he certainly couldnt ask for a better teacher than you i was present at the recent gathering where your play about oedipus was read aloud such powerful language such unforgettable images thank you senator pinarius seneca beamed nero also appreciated that play his tastes are quite sophisticated but he still requires instruction in matters of propriety the boy wanted to recite the role of oedipus if you can imagine that the son of an emperor playing the role of an incestuous parricide ive tried to explain to him that emperors simply cannot be actors yet he still talks about taking a part in the new play im working on about thyestes i hope to have it ready for a recitation during the upcoming festivities attending neros election to the consulship doesnt a consul have to be at least twenty years old yes but there is no law that says a man cannot be elected at fourteen and enjoy the privileges of a consulelect until he reaches the age of twenty im sure we can count on your vote to ratify his selection senator pinarius titus nodded acquiescing to this slippery bit of constitutional logic seneca was a politician after all not just a philosopher anyway seneca went on during the play to celebrate his election i can assure you the consulelect will be in the audience not on the stage titus nodded a play about thyestes you say wasnt he the greek king tricked into eating his own sons seneca was about to bite into a pastry but lowered the delicacy from his lips yes thyestes brother king atreus baked the boys in a pie fed them to their unsuspecting father then showed their heads to poor thyestes but thyestes exacted a terrible revenge as they always do in these greek tales added his wife paulina gave titus a quizzical look thyestes and atreus were twins they say you have a twin brother dont you senator pinarius titus frowned after a long spell of not thinking about kaeso twice within an hour his brother had been called to his mind he changed the subject back to senecas work oedipus and thyestes such grim stories i draw inspiration from the old greek playwrights especially euripides despite the antiquity of his subject matter his outlook is remarkably modern the darkness and violence of his stories resonate with presentday romans then there is my own experience of life which has not been without tribulation i was forced into a premature retirement by caligula thanks to his insane suspicions i was brought back to favour by claudius and then sent into exile again for eight years thanks to messalinas scheming now im back again thanks to agrippina and ive been welcomed in the very heart of the imperial household agrippina is my deus ex machina my athena appearing at the last moment in the play descending from the sky to restore harmony to the cosmos the empress is your muse then my saviour certainly seneca cocked his head and then of course there are dreams dreams as a source of inspiration do you not dream titus pinarius titus shrugged hardly ever perhaps thats a blessing my dreams are very vivid full of noise and blood and violence louder and brighter and more startling than anything in the waking world sometimes i can scarcely stand my dreams i wake in a cold sweat then reach for the wax tablet at my bedside and scribble notes for a scene oedipus tripping blindly over the body of his mother or thyestes agape at the sight of his sons severed heads seneca raised an eyebrow do you know a dream has just come back to me id forgotten it until this moment i had it the night after claudius told me i would have the honor of tutoring nero odd how one can forget a dream completely and then it suddenly comes back i dreamed i appeared at the imperial house in this very room ready for my first day but when my young pupil turned to face me it was caligula what a shock and so nonsensical since nero is nothing like his uncle caligula was raised in army boots and had hardly any education while nero loves learning seneca shivered did you ever meet caligula facetoface only once said titus lucky you vespasian strolled over to join them his wife domitilla was beside him still carrying the newborn domitian who had quieted down paulina left her husbands side to have a closer look at the baby did i hear you mention the departed caligula vespasian said seneca eyed the general condescendingly yes i was telling senator pinarius a story about who doesnt have a caligula story to tell said vespasian the general was more used to talking than to listening i suppose my tale is pretty harmless compared to most caligula was emperor i couldnt have been more than thirty thats right because my titus had just been born and id just been elected aedile one of my responsibilities was keeping the city clean i thought i was doing a pretty good job until one day caligula summoned me to meet him on a muddy little back road on the far side of the aventine not a paved road mind you but a narrow dirt alley behind some warehouses he asked me why the street was so dirty because its made of dirt i said vespasian laughed caligula was not amused he was furious by hercules its a miracle i didnt lose my head on the spot he ordered his lictors to scoop up handfuls of mud and to cram it inside my toga until i was covered all over with mud and loaded with the stuff like a bursting wineskin then caligula laughed until he wept and off he went mind you later a soothsayer told me the incident was actually a good omen something about the very soil of my homeland being next to my skin and under the protection of my toga ha but these soothsayers can turn anything to a fellows advantage cant they he laughed then stopped himself oh dear is that a rude thing to say to an augur he laughed again louder ah but have you met my son titus senator pinarius he was just here with his friend britannicus oh there they are having a laugh with nero the boys were indeed nearby but they were no longer laughing something had gone wrong neros face naturally ruddy and prone to blemishes turned a darker shade of red and was twisted by a sudden fury he hurled his wine cup at britannicus the boy dodged and the cup went hurtling past vespasians nose startled the baby domitian began to wail again britannicus put on an exaggerated expression of shock but lucius domitius he said addressing nero by his birth name rather than his adopted name i merely wished you a happy birthday you will address me by my proper name brat cried nero his ringing voice penetrated every corner of the room the guests fell silent britannicus raised an eyebrow but how can i do that big brother earlier today the augur explained that nero means strong and valiant and you lucius domitius are weak and cowardly britannicuss friend titus stifled a giggle thats a lie you little bastard said nero what are you doing here anyway shouldnt you be eating in the other room with the children agrippina approached the boys to stop the row claudius remained on his couch and seemed hardly to notice what was happening britannicus left the room followed by a small coterie of freedmen and attendants the remnants of messalinas faction in the imperial household he carried himself with remarkable poise for a nineyearold young titus looked to his father vespasian nodded and the boy left the room with britannicus vespasian shook his head that britannicus willful and wayward just like his mother i should go after the boy perhaps i can persuade him to apologize to nero i managed to broker a peace between those celtic tribes up in britannia you know maybe i can do the same thing here he departed along with domitilla and the infant who continued to wail paulina returned to her husbands side agrippina joined them what am i going to do about that boy i suppose you mean britannicus said seneca but more to the point what are we going to do about nero he cant call the emperors son a bastard in public it wont do agrippina nodded and yet one does hear rumours about britannicus rumours said paulina agrippina looked sidelong at titus as if deciding whether to confide in him then went on not that the child is a bastard though we all know what a whore messalina was no there are some who believe that britannicus is the child of neither messalina nor claudius that their baby was stillborn and messalina substituted some other child in the crib eager to present claudius with an heir i ask you does britannicus look like either of his purported parents a changeling you mean seneca snorted thats the sort of thing that happens in old greek comedies when it happens in real life the results are far from comic agrippina turned to titus senator pinarius i make no secret of the fact that i favour astrology and know little about augury but i wonder in this case could augury be of help im not sure what you mean might there be a way to interpret the auspices so as to determine the true identity of a particular child your skills at divination are so great and claudius has such complete confidence in you agrippina peered at him intently unnerved by her scrutiny titus glanced at claudius his cousin had sunken deep into his couch and was gazing slackjawed at his wine cup then titus looked at the young nero who was over his tantrum and was flirting with one of the younger female guests claudius was the past nero was the future agrippina seemed to be asking for tituss help on behalf of the young man who would almost surely be emperor one day perhaps sooner rather than later tituss first loyalty would always be to his calling as an augur to strive for the correct interpretation of the will of the gods but could he not do that and please agrippina at the same time to determine whether a given individual is a changeling traditional augury might be of little use said titus carefully but there are other forms of divination to which one might draw the attention of the emperor who is interested in all forms of prognostication cousin claudius recently charged me with compiling a list of every omen and portent reported in italy and together we review that list at regular intervals only yesterday in ostia a pig was born with the talons of a hawk such an occurrence is invariably a message from the gods freakish weather swarms of bees rumblings in the earth strange lights in the sky all require careful interpretation i have a secretary who closely examines the registry of deaths looking for any unusual patterns on a given day perhaps every man who dies in roma has the same first name for instance youd be amazed at all the connections you begin to see when you look for them remarkable said agrippina but how does one correctly decipher these signs titus smiled the judgement of an augur begins with training but grows with experience ive spent many years studying manifestations of the divine will he looked at nero noting his large head and prominent brow tell me has a physiognomist ever examined britannicus not to my knowledge said agrippina nor to mine said seneca their branch of science is very specialized based on precepts laid down by aristotle and pythagoras they examine the face and the shape of the head for indications of a persons destiny physiognomists talk mostly about the future but perhaps they can see the past as well if there is as you suspect something untoward about the origin of britannicus the truth might yet be revealed to the emperor yes i think the first step to discovering the truth might be to summon a physiognomist i know an egyptian practitioner ah but here comes your son nero having sufficiently charmed the young female guest gathered the folds of his purpleandgold toga and approached them brothers he said rolling his eyes as if to explain his altercation with britannicus you have a brother dont you he asked titus a twin seneca told me yes titus sighed yet again kaeso was being forced into his thoughts are you identical twins asked nero the young mans curiosity appeared to be entirely innocent but titus still cringed in appearance at least when we younger otherwise were so different that i should like to think he was a changeling titus glanced at agrippina why do we never see him said nero youre always coming by to see the emperor in his study yet we never see your twin my brother is this was not the first time kaesos unsavoury behaviour had caused titus embarrassment yet he had never come up with a good way to explain his brothers complete withdrawal not just from public life but from decent society how could anyone in the imperial household possibly understand kaesos bizarre beliefs and perverse behaviour what excuse could titus make this time for kaeso should he say that his brother was insane a drunkard crippled by illness my brother is seneca finished the sentence for him a christian titus turned pale how did you know seneca laughed the tutor of the emperors son must know a great many things senator pinarius agrippina frowned how can a roman patrician be a christian i thought that was the name for a sect of the jews so it is said seneca but here in roma as in many other cities around the empire they have recruited others to join their cult mostly slaves one presumes the christians actually welcome slaves and you can imagine why the less reputable sort of slaves find such a cult attractive christworship is yet another activity they can carry on in secret behind their masters backs but they are not all slaves im told there are a few roman citizens among the christians they teach that this world is a terrible place dominated by evil men indeed they believe that roma and all it stands for is evil but they also think this world will soon end to be replaced by another world in which their dead god shall come back to life and rule for eternity a suitable religion if one can call it that for disgruntled slaves but hardly for citizens of the city whose destiny is to maintain order in the world and uphold respect for the gods it sounds seditious said nero if these christians hate roma so much let them go back to dusty judaea and await the end of the world there didnt claudius banish the jews that edict proved to be impractical said seneca it was shortlived and only haphazardly carried out but it did serve as a warning to the jewish sects in the city to keep the peace they no longer stone each other in public much less riot in the streets theyve learned to keep their feuds to themselves at least here in the city as a result you dont hear much about the christians these days and that includes this mysterious christian brother of senator pinarius said nero but of titus pinarius i suspect we will be seeing much more in the years to come nero bestowed on titus his most charming smile ad on the day in late march that news reached roma of the death of the young emperors mother titus pinarius lit candles in the vestibule of his house and whispered a prayer before each of the wax masks of his ancestors thanking them for his good fortune long ago his late cousin claudius had scolded him for knowing so little of his familys past a man must honour his ancestors claudius had said who else made us and how else did we come to exist since that time titus had devoted himself to studying his ancestors discovering all he could about them learning from their examples and paying homage to them like a dutiful roman trying to make his own life something of which his forebears would be proud at the age of fortyone titus was more prosperous and well regarded than ever and glad to still be alive it had not been easy in the six years since claudius had died navigating the treacherous politics of an imperial court split between a ruthless mother and a young son struggling to break free of her but now agrippina was dead in some ways her death was a more profound event than the death of claudius for claudius seemed to fade gradually away while agrippina still had her wits about her and might yet have regained control of nero and the court what a woman she was and how little she allowed her womanhood to limit her ambitions titus recalled the incident when armenian envoys had pleaded their cause before nero and agrippina emerged from behind the screen where she customarily remained hidden and actually seemed about to mount the emperors tribunal and preside along with him while the whole court was paralysed with alarm seneca hissed at nero to intercept his mother and so a scandalous scene was averted agrippina the world would not be the same without her a new age would begin so deeply did titus feel the impact of the news that he found himself unable to contemplate the activities of a normal day only some unplanned and irregular activity would be suitable to such a strange day following this impulse he decided to discharge an onerous duty that had long been weighing on him on this day he would visit his brother once every year or two he forced himself to see kaeso to offer his brother yet another chance to return to a normal respectable way of life titus felt he owed that duty to the shade of their father if not to kaeso who always refused him he left his house with a small retinue as befitted a senator of his standing there was a scribe with a wax tablet to take down memoranda there was another slave who was versed in all the streets and byways of the city so that titus need never wonder where the closest tavern or silver shop or eatery might be there was another slave who knew the names not just of every senator and magistrate in the city but of every person titus was likely to meet no matter how important or inconsequential so that titus need never search his memory in vain for a name or a title and of course there were a number of brawny bodyguards wellbehaved fellows whose sheer size was so intimidating that they seldom had to use force to defend their master or to clear a way for him through a crowd the day was typical of late march bright and springlike one moment blustery and overcast the next titus found the changeable weather invigorating and walked with a spring in his step agrippina was dead the news had not taken titus completely by surprise recently nero had summoned titus to consult him about omens regarding his mothers and his own immediate future the young emperor said nothing of what he had in mind but he was clearly desperate to finally rid himself of agrippina thank the gods it was nero who trusted and consulted titus at that precarious stage of the power struggle and not agrippina like many in the court titus had walked a tightrope between mother and son for years afraid to offend either party or to irrevocably throw his lot with one or the other the story of agrippinas demise had played out like a comedy of errors according to rumours nero had tried on more than one occasion to poison her but each time agrippina had either been forewarned or had taken an antidote to save herself then the ceiling had fallen in above her bed surely not by accident and agrippina escaped being crushed only because she happened to have been lying next to the headboard then saying that he wanted to patch things up with her nero invited agrippina to his seaside villa at baiae to celebrate the feast of minerva there he presented her with a splendid pleasure barge and persuaded her to take a cruise on the bay despite the blustery weather but this was not an ordinary ship one of neros engineers had devised it to collapse on itself and sink without a trace a circumstance that could be blamed on the choppy waves or a sudden squall but surely not on the young emperor the ship duly collapsed and sank but agrippina who had once supported herself by diving for sponges was such a strong swimmer that she made her way to shore nero decided that his desperate mother like a wounded tigress needed to be disposed of straightaway in the beach house where the bedraggled agrippina took refuge assassins arrived and did away with her once and for all an astrologer had once told agrippina that her son would become emperor but that she would have to pay for his greatness with her own life agrippina had flippantly replied let him kill his mother then so long as he is emperor so it had come to pass walking along the riverfront and through the forum titus let himself be distracted by the sights and sounds of the city despite the constant tension and turmoil within the imperial household for roma and the empire the last few years had been a golden age seneca had taken charge of the actual running of the empire and had done a splendid job taxes had been reduced even as the services of the state had been improved neros love of music and poetry his youthful enthusiasm his theatrical personality and his love of spectacle pervaded the culture he had devised extraordinary entertainments for the populace made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they were bloodless though gladiator games were still a part of many holidays and festivals nero had decreed that no one should be put to death in the arena not even criminals roma thrived it seemed to titus that the world had never known a better moment and now that the discord in the imperial house had come to an end with agrippinas death who could say to what glorious heights nero might ascend titus left behind the gleaming marble and travertine monuments of the forum and entered the subura with its narrow filthy streets he was glad to have his retinue around him especially his bodyguards as a younger man he had dared to walk through the subura at all hours alone and unarmed but those days were long past yet even here he thought conditions had improved since nero had taken power thanks to the general prosperity of the empire and senecas efficient city administration it occurred to titus that the general wellbeing of the world made his brothers hateful attitude towards existence all the more perverse and inexplicable how could kaeso detest the world so much when there was such joy and beauty in it and of all places on earth surely roma was the most beautiful though as he stood before the tenement where kaeso lived titus had to admit that this was a gloomylooking place even worse than his brothers last residence if titus had been reduced to living in such squalour and like kaeso had to make his living as a common labourer backbreaking work for a man of fortyone perhaps he would hate the world too titus left his retinue in the street gave the bodyguards permission to play dice and ascended the stairs to the highest floor why did kaeso always live up so many flights of stairs the stairway itself was littered with debris and filth a discarded shoe broken bits of pottery a childs wooden doll with its limbs missing and at one landing not one but two rats whom titus interrupted in the act of copulation how could kaeso stand to live in such a place titus knocked on the door he heard movement within in such places the walls were so thin that one could hear everything kaeso opened the door he smiled broadly greetings brother kaeso was as illgroomed as ever a birds nest could have been concealed inside his bushy beard but in high spirits titus took this for a good sign perhaps their meeting would go well he noticed that kaeso was wearing the fascinum on a bit of twine around his neck greetings brother he said come inside artemisia briefly looked in from the other room and perfunctorily greeted him then disappeared how plump and plain she looked without makeup and with her hair unwashed chrysanthe was holding up much better despite having given birth to their son and three daughters poor artemisia had not even become a mother because her husband saw no point in bringing new life into the world you seem happy kaeso l am may i ask why you wont like the answer probably not but try me i am happy because the end of the world is very close now very close perhaps it will happen within the year titus groaned and this idea makes you happy of course its what we long for to shed the trapping of this foul place and be reunited with christ to see the naked face of god revealed in all his glory titus sighed and how will the world end kaeso how could such a thing even happen what fire could be big enough what earthquake terrible enough what tidal wave high enough to wipe out all of creation will the stars come crashing down will the sun burn out and the moon explode like a dandelion the very idea of the world ending is nonsense the one god is omnipotent he made all of creation in six days and he can destroy it all in the blink of an eye if this god is omnipotent and if there are no other gods to stand in his way why does he not simply fix this world to his liking likewise in the blink of an eye and put an end to the evil and suffering you say is all around us what sort of god is this you worship who plays a cruel waiting game with his worshippers you simply dont understand titus its my fault i lack the power to explain it to you if you would come to one of our gatherings there are men far wiser than i no kaeso senator titus pinarius will not be seen at a gathering of christians the idea was so ludicrous titus laughed out loud you mock me brother but of what are you so proud of your special status in the world your friendship with the emperor you were friends with the last emperor too yet you did nothing said nothing when cousin claudius was murdered titus felt the blood drain from his face you dont know that claudius was murdered of course i do everyone knows ask your senator friends or ask my neighbours the niece he took in his incestuous marriage violating even roman standards of decency put poison in his mushrooms and when that failed to act quickly enough agrippina called for a physician to treat him and the physician put a feather down claudiuss throat to make him vomit but the feather was dabbed with an even more potent poison and that was the end of poor claudius did you even mourn for him brother titus was taken aback that the common people had some vague notion of how claudius had met his end did not surprise him but kaeso knew the actual details and if kaeso knew then everyone in the city must know perhaps titus thought that was not such a bad thing if people believed that agrippina was a poisoner that would make her violent death more acceptable once they learned of it no one knows for certain if that feather had poison on it or not said titus it may be true that agrippina as a devoted mother took extreme measures to promote her son her son who turned his hand to murder with just as much enthusiasm or will you claim that young britannicus met a natural end he was poisoned as well wasnt he only a few months after neros ascension the poor boy and did you as claudiuss friend and cousin lift a finger to protect claudiuss orphaned son the jab was well aimed far from protecting britannicus titus at agrippinas bidding had done his share to promote the notion that the boy was a changeling so as to discredit any claim he might have to rule i had nothing to do with either the death of claudius or the death of britannicus said titus but you know who murdered them i f they were murdered titus my poor deluded brother you move among these people as an egyptian snake handler moves among serpents they may not have bitten you yet but their venom has poisoned you nonetheless neros venom has seeped into you polluted you you dare to call nero a snake in five years that remarkable young man has done more for this city than any emperor since augustus if you ever left this hovel and took a walk through the decent neighbourhoods of roma where decent people live youd see how happy those people are those are the people who dont want the world to end because nero has made this world a better place and what do all neros earthly achievements count for when you consider that he murdered his own mother titus was stunned he himself had only just been informed of agrippinas death by a messenger who came directly from baiae how can you know about agrippina living in this hole a nobody among nobodies a dark suspicion struck him is there some network of spies among the christian slaves does that network reach even to the imperial house hold kaeso laughed you think all christians are jews slaves outcasts or beggars if you only knew the truth titus there are people of every rank among us even fine upstanding roman ladies not all can aspire to jesuss example of poverty but all can look forward to the day when we shall be redeemed and united in the afterlife then there is a network of christian spies even in the imperial household titus recalled something nero had once said that the christians might be seditious titus had long ago decided that his brothers obsessions were maddening but harmless but could it be that the christian cult was more sinister than he had thought tell me something kaeso every so often i come across some bit of information about your cult whether i want to or not someone recently drew my attention to a purported holy text which contained a quotation from christ himself when i read it i found it so alarming i memorized it if any man comes to me and hates not his father and his mother and his wife and his children and his brother and sisters and even his own life he cannot be my disciple did your god actually say such a terrible thing kaeso nodded a follower of christ must be ready to reject all the attachments of the material world in favour of spiritual rebirth you dont have to explain the words to me i understand them well enough said titus in disgust a bit of light happened to reflect off the fascinum drawing tituss attention to it you dare to wear the fascinum of our ancestors you who do nothing to honour our ancestors who profess to despise all they accomplished and handed down to us you who would profess to hate our father and to hate me merely to please your god kaeso smiled and touched the fascinum this amulet is not what you think it is titus it is a symbol of christs suffering and a promise of his future resurrection of the resurrection of all who believe no kaeso its a link to the past a talisman handed down to us from a time before roma was founded you would pervert it into something else entirely with your hatred of the gods and your hatred of roma the gods you worship are not gods titus if anything theyre demons though i tend to believe that in fact they do not exist at all that they never did exist fool atheist the gods have always been and always will be they are of the world and in the world they made the world they are the world if mortals fail to comprehend them it is because we are so small and they are so vast what a tiny world you imagine the plaything of a single god who wants his worshippers to be as poor and stunted and miserable as he is can you not see the beauty the majesty the mystery of the gods all around you yes they baffle and confound us and their will is difficult to discern but i do what i can i practise the rituals of our ancestors who were here before us and encountered the gods before we did i revere their wisdom you spurn it you never visit my house you never come to pay respect to the wax effigies of the pinarii you turn your back on our ancestors you are disrespectful impious unworthy to be called a roman but i dont call myself a roman titus i call myself a christian and what you call the wisdom of our ancestors means nothing to me i have no use for the sins and follies of the past i look ahead to the bright perfect future a future in which you will be utterly forgotten because you have created no descendants all memory of you will vanish kaeso because you have broken the link passed down from one generation to the next the only immortality a man can achieve is to be remembered to have those who come after him recall his accomplishments and speak his name with honour just as you imagine men of some future age will speak of nero the fratricide the matricide and if youre lucky theyll mention that senator titus pinarius was neros friend the friend of a motherkiller is that your idea of immortality brother titus stared at the fascinum he could barely resist ripping it from his brothers neck i came here today out of respect to our father i feel a duty to his shade to do what i can to look after you but this is the final stroke kaeso i wont come to see you again ad titus stayed true to his word he did not call on his brother again when next the brothers met two years later it was because kaeso came to call on titus titus was in his study completely absorbed in an old text on augury given him years ago by claudius when a slave tapped on the door frame to get his attention what is it said titus without looking up you have a visitor master titus looked up squinting a bit reading had begun to tire his eyes a complaint not uncommon for a man of fortythree do i know you im hilarion master the new doorkeeper ah yes titus peered at the boy who seemed hardly old enough to serve as a doorkeeper there were so many slaves in the household these days titus couldnt keep them straight chrysanthe insisted that they were all needed to run the place but it seemed to titus he would soon need to buy a larger house just to accommodate so many slaves to be sure he was at all times well attended and never had to do anything for himself slaves tended to his chamber pot in the morning carried his things to and from the baths washed him massaged him shaved him dressed him took his dictation fetched whatever he needed carried messages to friends and business associates taught his children read aloud to him when his eyes were tired did all the shopping prepared and served his food sang to him during dinner and turned down his bed at night slaves tended to his sexual needs as well after more than twenty years of marriage and four children he and chrysanthe seldom performed the act any more but he loved her and had no intention of taking another wife so he felt no compunction about using the comeliest slaves when he felt the urge they never seemed to mind since titus was not the sort to take pleasure from violence or abuse and he took his enjoyment discreetly never in a vulgar public way that caused a slave shame or embarrassment not all masters were so considerate who is it said titus the visitor says hes your brother hilarion sounded doubtful titus stared into the middle distance for a long moment show him in no wait ill go to the vestibule to meet him titus rose and walked through the house past the lush garden with a newly installed marble statue of venus across the reception hall with its newly laid mosaic floor and into the vestibule sure enough there was kaeso looking like a ragged beggar off the street he was standing facetoface with the wax effigy of their father have you come to pay your respects at last said titus kaeso jumped a bit taken by surprise and looked at him blankly if you wish to burn a bit of incense before his effigy and perhaps say a prayer i would be happy to join you said titus and im sure our ancestors would be delighted he gestured to the other effigies in their niches you know thats not why ive come said kaeso quietly i have no idea why youve come said titus he noticed that kaeso was wearing the fascinum the effrontery to flaunt his possession of the family talisman in front of the ancestors titus took a deep breath determined to be civil i have a request to make of you said kaeso he sounded almost meek titus nodded curtly im expecting visitors soon a senator receives so many callers asking for favours but i suppose i have time to see you now follow me to my study as he led his brother through the house he wondered what kaeso must make of the place since kaeso had moved out years ago titus had made continual improvements investing in costly furnishings and exquisite works of art his study was one of the loveliest rooms of all with beautiful images from the metamorphoses of ovid painted on the walls and custom bookshelves made of oak a mosaic on the floor depicted prometheus giving light to mankind the naked titan carried a giant fennel stalk containing a glowing ember stolen from the fiery chariot of sol with a circle of awestruck mortals surrounding him titus imagined kaeso must be quite impressed but his brothers only reaction was to shake his head and mutter so many slaves you have slaves all over the house we passed at least ten between the vestibule and this room did we i hardly notice them except when i need one and cant find him titus laughed kaeso looked grim would you like some wine titus was determined to treat his brother no differently than any other visitor he clapped his hands a passing slave girl at once stepped into the doorway awaiting instructions titus smiled at her she was a lovely young redhead one of his favourites what was her name eutropia euthalia no wine said kaeso quickly it would cloud my thinking i need to be able to speak clearly titus gestured to the girl to move on whats this about kaeso what do you know about the murder of a city prefect an exconsul named lucius pedanius secundus titus sat in an oldfashioned folding chair an antique the dealer claimed had originally belonged to cato the younger kaeso remained standing it was not unusual for titus to sit while his visitors stood pedanius was killed by one of his own slaves said titus a nasty business slaves rarely kill a master but when they do it always causes a stir people still speak of the spartacus revolt when slaves all over italy turned on their owners and committed one atrocity after another farms were burned citizens were crucified women were raped and murdered that was over a hundred years ago said kaeso a hundred and thirtytwo years ago to be precise and such a tragedy has not occurred again in the last century because extreme measures were taken at the time and extreme measures continue to be taken whenever any crime is committed by a slave against his master the alternative is chaos why are you asking about this matter kaeso do you know the facts of the crime as a senator ive been briefed on all the details titus pressed his fingertips together he should have asked the girl to bring some wine whether kaeso wanted any or not talking about scandal made a man thirsty an unseemly affair it seems that pedanius had owned the slave a man called anacletus for many years and anacletus had risen in the household to a high station after many years of obedient service pedanius agreed to allow anacletus to purchase his freedom but the slave wanted more than that the fellow was in love with a pretty new slave boy in the household and wanted to be allowed to purchase the boy and take him with him pedanius in a generous mood agreed but then pedanius changed his mind apparently he took another look at the new slave and decided he wanted the boy for his own pleasure the next thing you know master and slave were rivals for the boys affections an absurd situation for any citizen and there the trouble started pedanius not only reneged on his promise to free anacletus but he took to sleeping with the boy every night and then titus hesitated to continue with the seamy details they would be common knowledge soon enough one night anacletus obtained a knife and holding a lamp to light his way he snuck past the night watchman and broke into his masters bedroom he says he only meant to threaten pedanius but he caught them in the act pedanius was unfazed apparently he made quite a show of flaunting his power over the boy showing anacletus that he could and would do anything he desired with a boy who was after all his property this drove anacletus into a fury he stabbed pedanius to death while the boy screamed and wept disgusting muttered kaeso all of it disgusting so theres no doubt about the slaves guilt none whatsoever anacletus will be put to death of course hell be crucified and the boy the boy witnessed the crime and did nothing to stop it the law is very clear and the night watchman he egregiously failed in his duty of course he must die and the rest of the household slaves what will become of them as i said the law is very clear all the slaves in the household of pedanius must be interrogated under torture thats happened already and then be put to death surely not protested kaeso i know that our ancestors enacted such terrible penalties but surely the law is more lenient nowadays such a crime is so rare its rare precisely because the law is so harsh all the more reason when such a crime occurs that the full penalty of the law must be exacted the common law dates from time immemorial but it was codified by the senate under augustus kaeso shook his head do you know how many slaves are in the house hold of pedanius no i do there are over four hundred of them four hundred titus titus pursed his lips that is a great many slaves to be crucified all at once i hadnt known there were quite so many some of them are old titus some of them are children i suppose titus shifted uneasily in the chair antique furniture was always so uncomfortable no wonder cato was famous for a foul temper titus was parched why had he not told the girl to bring some wine can you remember such a slaughter of a household of slaves happening in roma ever in our lifetime said kaeso no i suppose not these crimes usually happen in the countryside or in some distant province and i suppose the number of slaves involved is usually not quite so large think about it titus for a crime of passion committed by a single slave four hundred human beings must die people who were elsewhere going about their work or probably fast asleep completely unaware of what was happening surely that doesnt make sense to you titus if they werent aware of anacletuss intentions then they should have been thats what the law says the statute is clear it is the responsibility of a slave at all times and under all circumstances to protect his master with his own life if necessary from any harm from outside the household or from any other slave within the household but anacletus acted alone there was no plot how could the other slaves have prevented the crime i will admit sometimes on a casebycase basis the law does not perfectly fit every situation but the law is the law and must be obeyed bend it in one case and the next time a slave wants to kill his master hell be thinking he can get away with it that makes no sense at all titus what is your interest in this matter anyway no dont tell me there must be some christians among those four hundred slaves kaeso took a deep breath yes i have brothers and sisters in the house hold of pedanius ah you can drop your pretense of moral outrage then you simply dont want to see your fellow cult members receive their just punishment am i right but what do you care about their earthly fate isnt the world coming to an end at any moment thats cruel titus surely you must be moved by the suffering of so many innocent people have you ever thought what it must be like to die on a cross the law how can you countenance such cruelty and call it justice simply because this is the way our ancestors did it how can the gods you worship endorse such wickedness do you feel no pity no shame at the injustice of it do you not feel some impulse to do whatever you can as a senator as friend of the emperor to alter the course of events is that why youre here kaeso to petition me to take action as a senator to pervert the course of justice is there nothing you can do titus shrugged theres to be a discussion in the senate tomorrow i suppose the logistics of staging four hundred crucifixions will require special planning if nothing else then you could make a proposal for leniency i suppose i could if i were so inclined and if i didnt think the other senators would laugh me out of the senate house surely not every senator will be in favour of the strict penalty of the law surely some of them possess a shred of mercy if not the senators then perhaps nero might be persuaded or perhaps your omnipotent god might be persuaded to save his followers how about that kaeso is he not allknowing and allpowerful why dont you petition your god to change the law he could do it in the blink of an eye dont mock god titus then go pray to him kaeso and leave me out of this kaeso trembled with anger have you considered that pedanius got what he deserved taunting a slave with false promises raping that boy while the slave watched stop there kaeso if you mean to suggest that the murder of a citizen by a slave could ever be justified under any circumstances leave my house at once i will not have that sort of talk under my roof i wont have my family and my slaves exposed to such an obscene notion clenching his jaw kaeso left the room without another word titus sat in silence for a long time staring at nothing his throat was parched he raised his hands to clap them then saw that the slave hilarion was already standing in the doorway watching him with an inscrutable expression titus slept uneasily that night he was up before cockcrow he left chrysanthe sleeping and went to the garden he had no appetite and it was too early to go to the baths he sat on a stone bench in the vague light before dawn everything around him was indistinct the house was quiet even the slaves were still asleep except for the watchman who stayed up all night and he was probably asleep as well what a joke it was to trust ones safety to a watchman if there was no one to watch the watchman and make sure he was vigilant the watchman of pedanius had slept through his masters murder it had been a long time since titus had simply sat alone in silence with no distractions and no one around him not even a slave waiting out of sight for his summons the senate would meet later that morning after its members had time to go the baths to groom themselves and put on their togas or more precisely after they had been groomed and dressed by their slaves titus decided to attend the session he decided that he might even take part in the debate something he rarely did if he intended to speak he should probably prepare some notes he thought his first impulse was to rouse one of his secretaries dictate his thoughts and let the fellow put his random ideas into some sort of order an old slave called antigonus was good at that sort of thing then it occurred to titus that he might be saying some things in his speech that he did not care to share with a slave since the punishment of the slaves of pedanius would be the subject of the debate what a peculiar circumstance that a senator should wish to hide his thoughts from a slave titus fetched a lamp himself and figured out how to light it from the sconce that stayed lit all night he rummaged in his study until he found a wax tablet and a stylus and squinting under the dim light began to scribble some notes within moments his hand began to cramp he had not written anything with his own hand in a long time he was also uncertain of some of his spellings when a man always dictated to a trained scribe he did not need to know how to spell writing something worthy of being delivered in the senate house without a slave to transcribe and edit was rather hard work he realized but it was also quite absorbing as he found himself rubbing out awkward sentences and reworking them coming up with new ideas that needed to be inserted inside other ideas and rearranging the order of his arguments before he knew it dawn had broken and the house had come to life around him slaves were scurrying up and down the hallway some of them clearly surprised to see their master awake so early the smell of breakfast farina wafted from the kitchen titus was suddenly very hungry and in the mood for something sweet he called to one of the girls and told her to bring him a bowl of steaminghot farina with honey and dates and pine nuts you know how i like it he said after breakfast he summoned his usual retinue of slaves and headed for the baths often he patronized a small establishment on the slope of the aventine above the circus maximus the place was old and small and a bit drafty but conveniently close to his house but on this day titus decided to go to the baths of agrippa he was in the mood for a bit of luxury and spectacle and the baths of agrippa always provided that as well there was plenty of space in the galleries to do a bit of work in case he wanted to polish his notes a bit more the baths were out on the field of mars a fair distance from his house he considered taking a sedan or a litter but decided to walk instead titus did not want to become one of those effeminate fellows who never stepped outside his house without being carried by slaves as he strode through the markets along the tiber and then through the busy neighbourhood around the old circus flaminius and the theatre of pompeius it seemed to titus that there were a great many people headed the other way towards the forum and that they all looked rather serious there was a mood in the air an atmosphere of tension his bodyguards noticed it too titus saw them draw more closely together looking this way and that with more than their usual wariness titus could not think what was happening and forgot all about it once he arrived at the baths he never ceased to marvel at the grandiose beauty of the place with its high ceilings splendid marble columns and galleries of famous paintings and statues the sheer luxury of the hot plunge the cool plunge the warm plunge and then a thorough massage did much to rejuvenate him after his restless night he watched the swimmers in the long pool for a while narrowing his eyes at the glimmer of the morning sun reflected off the water and feeling its warmth on his face he nibbled some dried figs and almonds and sipped a muchwatered cup of wine and forgot all his cares for a while he even forgot his speech and did no more work on his notes when he was finally ready to be dressed in his toga he saw by the sundial next to the long pool that if he did not hurry he would be late for the taking of the auspices not his duty on this occasion and the opening of the days business in the senate he decided to hire a sedan and told the bearers to move at a fast pace his bodyguards trotted alongside but the other slaves lagged a bit they would catch up and wait outside the senate house in case titus needed them the ride was so smooth that he was able to take out the wax tablet and review his notes taking a sedan was not such an indulgence he decided if one used the time to do a bit of work the bearers took the most direct route between the north side of the capitoline hill and the temple of venus built by the divine julius before titus knew it they were approaching the senate house from the back side he looked up from his notes distracted by a strange noise that came from the direction of the forum it sounded like the roar of the ocean or the crowd at the circus maximus as the sedan rounded a corner titus saw something he had never seen before the area before the steps of the senate house was thronged with people there were hundreds of them perhaps even thousands there was no reason for them to be there this was not a festival day and there was no public ceremony requiring their attendance what were all these people doing here the sedan came to a stop at one end of the steps hitching up his toga titus ascended a few steps then turned to take a closer look at the crowd it was made up mostly of men of the common sort illgroomed and dressed in drab tunics the citizen rabble of roma he looked at their faces they did not look happy some of them seemed to be drunk but that was inevitable in any large gathering some were clustered in smaller groups talking among themselves or listening to a speaker what were they talking about why did they appear so angry and agitated titus threw a few coins to the sedan bearers who disappeared at once wait for me here at this spot he told his bodyguards feeling an unaccustomed uneasiness usually he allowed his bodyguards to loiter around the forum while he was in the senate house rather like dogs let off a leash but on this day he wanted to know that they would be exactly where he had left them when he came out halfway up the steps he ran into a fellow senator gaius cassius longinus under claudius as governor of syria cassius had amassed a great fortune his learned commentaries on the law had established him as the senates leading expert on all matters judicial still titus could never forget that cassiuss ancestor and namesake had been one of the assassins of the divine julius cassiuss eyesight had begun to fail he was often in a foul mood and today was no exception titus who was much junior to cassius in the senate usually would have given the older man a nod and no more but he could not resist asking cassius if he knew anything about the crowd before the senate house cassius squinted at the throng and scowled theyre here to plead for mercy for those slaves he said really there are so many of them are there then its a blessing that i can barely see them im told theyve been arriving all morning and more are arriving every moment you know our ancestors saw this sort of thing all the time mobs gathering to demonstrate in the forum whenever there was a debate in the senate sometimes the mobs would riot sometimes it was like this every day in the republic especially towards the end can you imagine the chaos titus gazed out at the crowd so this was an oldfashioned roman mob they look unhappy but theyre not that badly behaved not yet cassius shuddered what i find so appalling is the reason theyre here when their ancestors broke a few patrician heads for plebeian rights or rioted at the behest of the gracchi brothers to help the small landowners or even when they burned down the senate house after the rabblerouser clodius was killed at least they were fighting for their own selfinterest as citizens but this shameless assembly of freedmen and citizens are here to argue for the benefit of slaves its disgusting imagine during the spartacus revolt if the rabble had gathered to tell the senate stop what youre doing perhaps this gladiator fellow has a point its not quite the same thing said titus cautiously isnt it the law is the law and these people are here to spit on the law for the sake of slaves nero should summon his praetorians and drive them all into the tiber i think there might be too many of them to do that said titus truly outside the circus maximus he had never seen such a large gathering was he imagining it or had the crowd grown more unruly in the last few moments he gathered the folds of his toga and hurried up the steps he was just in time to join his fellow senators on the crowded porch for the taking of the auspices they were favourable though titus thought the augur was being rather generous in his interpretation of a crows flight then the senators filed inside pausing to light a bit of incense and say a prayer at the altar of victory before filling the tiers of seats that faced each other across the long chamber there was a large turnout titus thought there must be more than senators present once all the senators were seated nero arrived followed by seneca and a retinue of scribes and secretaries he strode up the length of the hall to take his chair on the dais at the far end to titus it seemed that the young emperor did not walk with his usual selfconfident swagger had the sight of the gathering outside unnerved him as much as it had the senators titus also took note of the emperors appearance nero had grown a beard or at least a partial beard something no emperor had worn before him the hair was trimmed to leave only the growth beneath his jaw while his cheeks and chin were cleanshaven the effect was to provide a golden frame for his square face even more striking was the emperors costume since the death of agrippina neros mode of dress had grown more eccentric on this occasion he was outfitted in his customary purple and gold but his garment was not a toga but a gown of the sort either a man or woman might wear at home in the evening and on his feet were what looked like slippers rather than proper shoes the garment left much of neros arms bare gone titus noticed was the golden arm bracelet encasing the lucky snakeskin that nero had long worn to honour his mother after agrippinas death nero had declared that he could no longer stand the touch of the bracelet on his skin indeed could not stand even to look at it and had thrown it into the sea from the terrace of his villa at baiae the emperor no longer has his amulet thought titus and nor do i wishing as he often did that he still possessed the fascinum of his ancestors he could have used a bit of luck on this day the preliminary business of the senate was dispensed with quickly so that the members could deal at once with the pressing issue of the murder of lucius pedanius secundus and the punishment of his household slaves the facts of the case were read aloud by a scribe the mans delivery even when reading the most salacious details was completely without emotion but at various points some of the senators made rude mocking noises to be killed by a slave was shocking but also shameful and to have it happen under such circumstances a rivalry over yet another slave was the stuff of scandal if pedanius had escaped death he would have been a laughing stock instead he was a victim of the most frightening crime imaginable a deliberate act of violence perpetrated in his own house by one of his own possessions the texts of the relevant laws were then read aloud the statutes were just as titus had remembered and recited to his brother the day before if a slave should murder his master all the slaves in the household must be interrogated under torture and punished with death without exception the slaves had already been interrogated now they were confined under guard in the house of pedanius to await the judgement of the senate meanwhile in preparation for immediate executions crucifixes were being prepared along the appian way outside the city nero on his dais said nothing and merely observed the proceedings as he often did when the senate was carrying out its routine business the members were invited to rise and address the question at hand on this occasion was the law to be carried out fully and faithfully without amendment or mitigation without waiting to be called on many of the senators simply shouted their opinions and a general clamour filled the hall titus heard cries of kill them now at once and the law is the law but he also heard a substantial number of voices shouting too harsh and mercy and there should be exceptions nero covered his ears as if the cacophony caused him pain he gestured to seneca who stepped forward and called for order will anyone speak formally in favour of rescinding or mitigating the penalty said seneca there was a hubbub in the hall and a great many heads turned but no one stood seneca was opening his mouth to speak again when titus loudly cleared his throat and rose to his feet seneca looked at him in surprise do you wish to speak senator pinarius i do all eyes turned to titus his face grew hot he felt lightheaded his palms were suddenly sweaty if he wasnt careful the wax tablet containing his notes would slip right out of his hands he realized that his hands were empty the tablet where was it titus looked around and saw it nowhere had he been holding it earlier during the taking of the auspices he couldnt remember could he have left it in the hired sedan titus felt completely at a loss meanwhile the eyes of the entire senate were boring into him the room was utterly silent he would either have to sit down without saying a word and look a complete fool or he would have to speak without his notes could he do that he had pored over them so intently surely he could remember at least the major points if not all the elegant phrases he had labouriously worked out titus cleared his throat again and took a deep breath caesar he began nodding to nero and my esteemed fellow senators we are all aware of the crowd thats gathered outside our front door i must say it took me quite by surprise when i arrived here i think its taken us all by surprise ive never seen anything like have you no but ive never seen a herd of giraffes either shouted one of the senators what has either to do with the law this was met with scattered guffaws and a few cries of hear hear well said titus feeling flustered once upon a time the common people had their own assembly and they did have some say in the making of laws titus realized that he was straying far from his notes what sort of talk is this someone shouted seditious talk someone said rabblerousing titus raised his hands to quiet the clamour im merely saying that something has stirred up all those people every one of you in this chamber is stirred up as well perhaps we should at least state the case of those who are asking for mercy so that we can examine the argument clearly there that was better he thought feeling that he had quieted his listeners and regained their full attention he noticed that a scribe was taking down his words no doubt using the shorthand famously invented by ciceros secretary tiro given the circumstance of this atrocious crime he went on who can doubt that the vast majority of slaves in the household of pedanius are completely innocent of any wrongdoing this appears to be a crime of passion not a conspiracy involving other slaves and hatched over time unless a slave was actually in the room or at least close enough to overhear what was happening how could that slave possibly have prevented the crime there is also the fact that in such a large household four hundred or more slaves there must be a great many who are old and infirm or young and frail or women some of whom may be pregnant shall all those slaves die despite their innocence what if a slave is blind what if he is deaf or mute and what if a slave is blind deaf and mute shouted someone then put him to death for sure since hes no good to anyone shouted another prompting a gale of laughter unless hes as pretty as that boy pedanius was diddling said someone else this went too far the offending senator received boos and angry looks senators shouted titus trying to regain their attention i have asked myself why has this proceeding elicited such an unprecedented response from so many common citizens i think i know some of the reasons first there has been no crime like this in recent memory nor has there been the prospect of a slaughter of slaves on such a massive scale at least not here in roma if such crimes occurred and such massive punishments were exacted it must have happened at a farm or country villa where those slaves were unknown to anyone outside their own household but this household of slaves is different they reside here in the city where they live and work and move about freely these slaves must be known not only to fellow slaves in other households but to shopkeepers and artisans and all sorts of citizens who have dealings with them some are errand boys and messengers some are seamstresses and hairdressers some are cooks and cleaners some are bookkeepers and scribes highly educated and valuable slaves deserving a degree of respect some are near the age of death some are newborn just beginning life some are in the prime of life at the peak of their usefulness and value some are pregnant and about to bring forth new life these victims of the law are not a faceless crowd but are human beings known to their neighbours and so we cannot be surprised if there are murmurs throughout the city that the law is too harsh when there is such an outcry even here in the senate can no exception to the law be made well thought titus that was not so hard after all he felt rather pleased with himself in his fantasies this was the point at which the entire chamber erupted in applause even from those who opposed him but admired his courage for taking a stand instead after a few scattered cries of hear hear and some desultory murmurs of assent the end of his speech was met by a silence almost as deep as that which preceded it gaius cassius longinus rose to speak caesar and esteemed fellow senators he said often have i been present in this assembly when demands were made to alter or dilute or do away entirely with the customs and laws of our ancestors in every single instance those changes were for the worse yes in every instance the laws made by our ancestors were superior to the innovations proposed to replace them yet often ive kept my mouth shut and let the majority have its way wishing not to become known as one of those stalwarts of the law who grows wearisome by always exalting ancient precedent i was holding my fire if you will for a time when my voice truly would be needed to prevent a terrible error by the state that time is now an exconsul has been deliberately murdered in his house by one of his own slaves not one of the other slaves did a thing to prevent this crime though the law is clear that this was their duty vote to spare them if you like but if a city prefect is not safe in his own home who among us will be who will have enough slaves to protect him if the four hundred of pedanius were not enough who can rely on a slaves help if even the threat of death is not enough to make a slave help you i have sat here in silence and listened to the account of the facts in this matter which impute various unseemly behaviours on the part of pedanius i ask you since the dead man cannot speak for himself how and from whom where these facts obtained from the two slaves present at his murder of course the killer himself and the killers young paramour no doubt this evidence was obtained as the law prescribes under torture but i think we can discount their story as an utter fabrication concocted to blacken the name of their victim and to elicit sympathy for themselves next we will be hearing that this murder was justifiable homicide and pedanius got what he deserved dust has been thrown in your eyes senators and not by a skilled advocate but by slaves shame on you we also hear the argument that the other household slaves could not have known that their master was threatened i dont believe this for a moment do you seriously think that a slave plotted to killed his master without uttering a single rash or menacing word beforehand to someone in the household even if this insanely jealous lover kept silent about his intention how did he obtain a knife without anyone noticing and wondering what he meant to use it for how did he penetrate to his masters bedroom past the watchman and carrying a lamp mind you without anyone seeing but even if some of the slaves suspected that their master was in danger you may say surely most of the slaves were ignorant of the fact perhaps but i say that every slave in that household whatever his degree of complicity is irrevocably contaminated by the crime even a slave born into the household that very morning is contaminated and must be destroyed like a rabid dog imagine a slave growing up knowing that his first master was brutally murdered by one of his own kind and that slaves like himself went unpunished would such a slave have an understanding of his place in the world and of the immutable respect he owes to his owner would you want that slave in your household growing up with the knowledge of a murdered master in his head inevitably spreading that knowledge to others i think not some of you act as if we are encountering such a crime for the very first time and must come to some momentous decision never made before even if a similar crime occurred in the past you argue this case is somehow unique and requires our special consideration nonsense there is nothing new here no novel and unprecedented situation that must be debated and settled our ancestors saw situations no different from this dealt with those situations in the best possible manner and handed their precedents down to us are you so ungrateful that you spurn their gifts are you so vain that you consider yourselves wiser than they our ancestors were distrustful of their slaves even though those slaves were born on the same estates sometimes even in the same house as their masters lifelong familiarity did not reduce their suspicion of their slaves or induce them to treat those slaves with greater leniency the situation we face today is far more perilous nowadays our huge households are filled with slaves from all over the world those slaves speak all sorts of languages who knows what they say behind our backs they practise all sorts of religions or none at all they form all sorts of cliques among themselves and even join foreign secret cults without our knowledge we must be on our guard inside our own households now more than ever the only way to deal with this motley rabble is by intimidation and a strict adherence to the law innocent people will die you say but the law has long recognized that the suffering of individuals is justified by the benefit to all when a roman legion suffers defeat and every tenth man is clubbed to death for shame brave men may die along with cowards but by such strict measures our ancestors built armies that have conquered the world those same ancestors gave us the law which we discuss today think long and hard before you trifle with it dismiss the law and who knows what terrible consequences will follow uphold the law and your children will sleep more safely in their beds tonight titus had dreamed of a rousing ovation but it was cassius who received it amid the cheering and applause titus overheard a nearby senator comment to another and thats why cassius is the best jurist alive the finest master of the law since cicero said the other senator rebuttals were invited no one stepped forth the senate voted by dividing the chamber those in favour of upholding the law without mitigation were to sit in the seats to the emperors right those who wished to make some exception to the law were to sit on the emperors left titus who was already to neros left stayed where he was the senators he had just overheard rose to their feet at once and crossed the chamber as did cassius whose poor eyesight required him so seek assistance numerous admirers rushed forward to claim the privilege of helping him there was a great deal of movement back and forth with groups of senators lingering in the middle of the room engaged in lastmoment discussions as always titus was amused to see which senators remained undecided until the last possible moment standing in the middle of the chamber and looking anxiously from side to side to see which way the vote was trending it was the same senators every time the ones who had no opinions of their own and invariably voted with the majority once they could determine which side the majority had taken when everyone was finally settled there was no need for a count although a substantial number of senators had voted for leniency far more than titus had expected after cassiuss rousing speech the clear majority was in favour of the law without exception all the slaves in the household of pedanius were condemned to death by crucifixion preparations had already been made and the sentence would be carried out that very day nero had stayed out of the argument it was his prerogative to speak at any time but though he had listened attentively he had said nothing but after the session was formally closed and the senators began to rise from their seats a messenger ran to the dais and whispered in neros ear whereupon he rose to feet seneca banged a staff on the floor all eyes turned to the emperor senators said nero i am told that the crowd outside has grown more numerous and that many among them are now brandishing torches and clubs it seems they have been informed of your judgement and they are not pleased but the announcement hasnt yet been made said a senator near titus who told them probably one of the imperial slaves said another theyre constantly running in and out of the chamber shouting was audible from the forum even though the senate house doors were closed when the bronze doors were opened moving slowly on their massive hinges the muffled clamour from outside rose to a roar titus followed the other senators onto the porch he was shocked by what he saw the crowd had grown much bigger the forum was a sea of angry shouting faces men stood alongside statues on their pedestals and on the steps and porches of every building in sight the crowd had even overrun the venerated speakers platform the rostra where men waving torches sat astride the famous ships beaks that projected over the crowd at the sight of the senators emerging from the senate house the crowd surged forward rushing halfway up the steps before neros praetorian guards formed a cordon to stop them they shouted shook their fists and brandished clubs some farther back in the crowd dared to throw stones at the praetorians who raised their shields to protect themselves the clatter was deafening titus anxiously scanned the crowd and was relieved to see that his bodyguards were right where he had left them but he would not rejoin them yet titus had no intention of attempting to pass through such an angry mob it was a sad day when wearing a senatorial toga in the heart of roma could make a man feel like a target this is madness whispered titus this is exactly the sort of behaviour a speech like yours encourages said senator cassius drawing alongside him thats absurd said titus these people werent present in the chamber to hear my speech nor were they present to see the result of the vote yet they knew of it quickly enough slaves talk and knowing that there are senators who sympathize with their cause indeed are willing to argue for it on the floor on the senate however recklessly only encourages such people to think they may obtain what they want by agitation whats to be done asked titus since this rabble lacks the selfdiscipline of their betters they can be dispersed only by force nero apparently thought otherwise while the senators continued to huddle on the porch seeing no safe way to leave an imperial herald pushed though their ranks and took up a position at the top of the steps he blew a horn repeatedly until the mob grew quiet enough for him to be heard such heralds were chosen for their ringing voices this one was able to project sufficiently to fill the vast space so that his words echoed back from buildings across the way citizens caesar has proclaimed an edict listen well amid the hush there were shouts of nero nero will show mercy caesar will save us from the unjustness of the senate was such a thing possible nero had the power to override the senate on many matters but would he choose to do so on this occasion in the ancient days of the city when roma was ruled by kings it was said that the monarch often took the side of the common people against the rich nobles kings had as much cause to fear the nobility as did commoners so kings and commoners made natural allies would nero take this opportunity to reach out to the people over the heads of the senate and make himself the hero of the rabble could even nero afford to flout the law and make enemies of so many in the senate when the herald spoke the crowds hopes were dashed the senate has debated the issue which concerns you the senate has reached it judgement the law will be upheld the sentence will be carried out caesar admonishes you for this unseemly and threatening behaviour this gathering is declared unlawful you are hereby ordered to disperse at once the mob reacted with howls of protest more stones were hurled some landed near the herald who quickly retreated more torches were passed though the crowd and set alight the sight of so many flames was alarming what were these people thinking to use fire as a threat an open flame was a force no man could control fire could sweep anywhere destroy anything if its power was unchecked in the last years of the republic the senate house itself had been incinerated by an angry mob the divine augustus had rebuilt it in greater splendour was it now to be burned again scanning the crowd titus suddenly spotted a familiar face hackles rose on the back of his neck it was kaeso his brother was part of the mob no not a mere participant but some sort of ringleader kaeso was brandishing a torch in the very faces of the praetorians protecting the senate steps waving with his other arm and yelling encouragement to those around him titus shook his head just as he had harboured the false hope of receiving the accolades of his fellow senators for making a fine speech so he had been looking forward to telling kaeso what he had done to let his brother know that he was not such an unfeeling fellow after all in fact that he had done something rather courageous especially considering his position in society what a change that would have been to receive some approval even praise from kaeso but here was kaeso spoiling things as always not just taking part in the demonstration but yelling louder than anyone else and making a spectacle of himself titus cringed what if one of his fellow senators noticed kaeso in the crowd took a good look at him and despite the shaggy beard and wildeyed expression noted his resemblance to titus and realized who he was if the other senators knew that his brother was one of the leaders of the mob titus would be mortified suddenly his brother looked back at him kaesos reaction at seeing him exactly matched that of titus on seeing kaeso he blanched looked shocked and appalled then disgusted and angry the twins stared at each other for a long moment as if looking into a distorting mirror then as neither could bear to look at the other a moment longer at the same instant they turned their gazes elsewhere soon the tramp of marching feet echoed through the forum having failed to quell the mob with his edict nero had summoned more praetorians from their garrison outside the city as the ranks of grimfaced soldiers converged with swords drawn many in the crowd panicked and fled at once others pulled back reluctantly throwing rocks as they withdrew a few dared to stand up to the praetorians wielding their bludgeons and torches titus looked for kaeso but he had disappeared in the surging crowd to reinforce the praetorians nero also called up the vigiles the troop of trained firefighters first organized by augustus the vigiles also acted as night watchmen and sometimes apprehended runaway slaves they wore leather helmets instead of armour and carried firefighters pickaxes not swords but their discipline made them more than a match for the shopkeepers and labourers in the crowd a few heads were broken and some blood was spilled but soon the mob dispersed while the vigiles extinguished the abandoned torches scattered around the forum the praetorians regrouped and headed for the house of pedanius where the slaves were being kept under guard within the hour the slaves were driven to the place of execution outside the city with praetorians lining the entire route to forestall any interference normally the crucifixions would have been a public event the larger the crowd the better for the purpose of moral instruction but once the slaves were outside the walls the praetorians closed the appian gate and diverted all traffic from the appian way the crucifixions were carried out with no spectators the work went on through the day and into the night the next morning with praetorians still patrolling the area the appian gate and the appian way were reopened for traffic for travellers arriving from the south their first view of the citys outskirts was the grisly display of roman justice that lined the road from within the city a steady stream of citizens came to witness the fate of the slaves of pedanius some gawked speechless some muttered angry words some wept the crucified bodies remained on display for many days most of the senators found time to go and take a look at their handiwork including gaius cassius longinus who cursed the failing eyesight that prevented him from beholding the full splendour of roman justice titus pinarius did not go to see the crucifixions he tried to forget everything that had happened that terrible day in the senate house ad before dawn on a warm morning in the month of the divine julius in his house on the aventine hill titus pinarius awoke with the smell of smoke in his nostrils hilarion he called chrysanthe stirred beside him whats happening im sure its nothing my dear go back to sleep young hilarion appeared at the door the former doorkeeper had become one of tituss favourite slaves that was why titus called for hilarion by name rather than simply clapping his hands to summon whichever slave was nearest over the last three years or so since the pedanius affair titus had made a point of actually looking at his slaves learning to tell them apart paying attention to their idiosyncrasies and even learning all their names every slave owner in roma had taken a closer look at his human possessions in the aftermath of pedaniuss murder and titus had made a conscious decision to treat his slaves with more care he told himself this was not a sign that he was growing soft with age he was only fortysix after all he was simply being prudent did not a welltreated horse or dog return the investment of its masters kindness with better and longer service why should it not be so with the people one owned among his slaves titus had taken special notice of hilarion the young man was not only presentable being easy to look at and always well groomed but was quickwitted and uncannily deft at anticipating his masters needs titus had taken to calling on hilarion for almost everything and so waking with the smell of smoke in his nostrils it was hilarions name that sprang to his lips yes master hilarion spoke softly in deference to his dozing mistress do you smell it too titus whispered yes master smoke its not coming from inside the house i woke some of the other slaves and we checked everywhere its not from closeby either i sent two of the messenger boys to circle the neighbourhood and they saw no signs of fire thats a relief good for you hilarion that was very responsible of you thank you master still theres definitely smoke in the air i think the smell is getting stronger i think youre right master did you go on the roof not yet master hilarion averted his eyes the young man seemed to have a fear of heights ah well no slave was perfect bring the ladder to the garden titus rose from his bed groaning as he stretched his limbs i shall climb up myself chrysanthe keeping her eyes shut murmured make one of the slave boys do it i think not my dear if theres something to be seen i want to see it with my own eyes but im sure ill see nothing go back to sleep the climb up the ladder even by the dim light of dawn did not frighten titus but the possibility of slipping on a loose or broken tile did he trod very cautiously across the roof feeling the dry wind on his face the wind came from the east and carried the smell of smoke the sunlight just breaking over the distant hills to the east illuminated a small cloud of smoke that appeared to be rising from the far end of the circus maximus down in the valley between the palatine and the aventine as the cloud rose it was tattered and dispersed by the wind but lower down it was dense and black and within it titus fancied he could see the glow of flames and bits of whirling cinder what was burning there was a shopping arcade at that end of the circus with a large fabric storehouse chrysanthe sometimes visited burning wool and linen would account for such a dense volume of smoke rising from such a small area ascertaining the source of the flames reassured him the fire was a long way off and undoubtedly the vigiles were already moving to contain it what wisdom and foresight the divine augustus had displayed when he established the vigiles before that there had been only privately operated fire brigades in the city composed of slaves hired out by their masters to fight fires that system had never worked very well the slaves had little incentive to risk their lives and not everyone could afford to pay the exorbitant fees demanded by the brigade owners augustus levied a tax on the sale of slaves to establish the staterun vigiles put military men in charge of their training and induced slaves to take on the hazardous duty by offering them freedom and citizenship after a sixyear term of service climbing carefully down from the roof titus decided to get on with his day he would send some slaves to keep watch on the fire but unless there was some unexpected development he would simply try to ignore the acrid smell he would have a quick bite to eat then bathe at his local establishment but no those baths were located not far from the source of the flames so perhaps that was not a good idea he would hire a sedan and go to the baths of agrippa instead out on the field of mars the air would almost certainly be clearer titus had a number of letters to dictate to business associates in alexandria and that was best done after a relaxing soak in the hot plunge there were also arrangements to be made for young luciuss upcoming toga day how was it possible that his son was almost seventeen but even at the baths of agrippa the smell of smoke was strong and everyone was talking about the fire titus who had seen the source overheard so many obviously false rumours that he dismissed them all but on his way home he saw that the fire was now producing a great deal of smoke the black cloud filled a quarter of the sky hilarion greeted him with alarming news far from being contained the fire had spread to the circus maximus engulfing the entire eastern end the flames had begun to work their way up the slope of the palatine and were threatening the imperial residence titus happened to know that nero was away from roma down at his villa at antium at least the emperor was safe titus found chrysanthe in their bedroom he was going to tell her to begin packing her more valuable jewellery but she was already doing so he ordered hilarion to fetch a specially designed trunk from the storage room and bring it to the vestibule tending to the task himself titus began to take the wax masks of his ancestors from their niches wrapping each one in linen and stacking them carefully in the trunk lucius appeared can i help father of course son said titus glad to see the boy take an interest in his ancestors lucius took the mask of his namesake in his hands looking from the mask of his father to the face of his son titus smiled to see how closely lucius resembled his grandfather are we leaving the house father i dont think it will come to that still it never hurts to be prepared titus meant what he said he was not seriously worried at least not yet but already in the back of his mind he was calculating the time it would take to reach their country house on the far side of the tiber it was usually only half a days journey but the roads might be crowded with others fleeing the city there thats the last of the ancestors carefully packed away he said now i think i shall go and take a look at the fire myself may i go with you father said lucius titus hesitated his impulse was to say no but lucius was nearly a man after all in some families he would already have received his manly toga titus could hardly order him to stay at home with his mother of course son youll come with me and together we will see what there is to see taking only a pair of bodyguards with them father and son set out smoke was thick in the air stinging their eyes and making titus cough the streets were full of people some seemed to be going about their normal business conversing and even laughing as if nothing untoward was taking place many more were heading away from the fire towards the tiber looking anxious common people pushed carts piled high with their meager possessions groaning under the weight slaves carried litters and sedans normally used for passengers but instead loaded with trunks and precious objects one of the most bizarre sights was a gilded litter carried by an elegantly outfitted troupe of nubian slaves in which the passenger was a bronze statue of aphrodite reclining young lucius laughed aloud at the strangeness of it people were on their knees praying before the ara maxima a huge throng had gathered in front of the temple of fortune where harriedlooking priests were trying to calm the wailing women on the temple steps titus and lucius passed a cart loaded with scores of round leather boxes no doubt the capsae contained the prized scrolls of some devoted bibliophile titus had not even thought of what would become of his small library in a fire did he own enough capsae to stuff them all into if he needed to carry them to safety some of his books were quite old and valuable like the history of livius that had been a gift from claudius to tituss father the entrances to the circus maximus were open so they went inside and ascended the steps to the highest tier of seats in the curve at the far western end a number of others had done the same thing it was as if they were spectators at a play staged by vulcan himself the far end of the circus was a bowl of flame that reached as far as the spine down the middle of the track to their left much of the slope of the palatine above the circus was aflame including a small part of the imperial complex the fire had also engulfed the farthest slope of the aventine with a gasp titus realized that his local baths the place he had considered visiting that morning must be completely lost to the fire he thought of the little man who always greeted him at the entrance and the egyptian slave boy who performed massage and flirted so outrageously with the customers had they been trapped by the fire what if titus had gone there earlier this morning would he still be alive a hot wind blew down the length of the circus maximus stinging tituss eyes and filling his mouth with the taste of ash he wiped his hand across his face and saw that his fingers were black with soot titus had seen enough and was ready to leave but lucius pointed to a distant group of vigiles who could be seen at work on the aventine a small group of spectators inside the circus had gathered leaning over the upper parapet of the viewing stands to watch them father lets go see we should head back your mother will be worried but others are watching it must be safe please in truth titus was curious himself to see the vigiles at work they walked along the upper parapet until they reached the crowd and could go no farther it was just as well this was as close to the flames at the end of the circus as titus cared to go leaning over the parapet they had a clear view of the vigiles below flames had just been sighted on the roof of a building of three stories just across the street from the circus the vigiles were using all their tools to fight the fire before it could claim the building a portable pump with a tank of water had been rolled as close as possible while two of the men aimed the huge metal nozzle four others worked the seesaw pump that sent a jet of water streaming all the way to the roof of the building more vigiles calling on citizens to help them had formed a bucket brigade to continuously replenish the tank with water from a neighbourhood fountain farther away another group of vigiles was attempting to demolish a building already lost to the flames a ballista of the sort the legions used to hurl missiles essentially a huge crossbow with a handcranked ratchet to set the tension was used to launch threepronged iron hooks attached to chains aimed with uncanny precision one hook after another landed inside a window frame and caught fast when five of the hooks were in place the vigiles formed teams seized the chains and heaved in unison the burnedout wall gave way and collapsed with a shower of sparks the vigiles dropped the chains took up picks and axes and ran to break up the fallen debris what theyre doing must be incredibly dangerous said lucius but look there farther up the hill arent they actually setting a fire with their prefect barking orders at them some of the vigiles took up firebrands lit them from the smoldering embers of the demolished building and set fire to a long narrow onestory building at the periphery of the conflagration i think that must be whats called a fire break said titus if they can destroy that building quickly you see the gap theyll create may put an end to the fires progress as least in that direction lucius nodded fascinated by both the fire and the techniques used to combat it could i join the vigiles someday titus laughed and quickly looked around thankful that no one in the crowd seemed to have overheard tradition and the law said that lucius was almost a man but he still had some boyish ideas about the world the vigiles are all slaves and freedmen lucius such labour is not for freeborn men not even those of the lowest social rank but who commands them like that fellow there shouting orders men of the equestrian class are eligible to serve as prefects of the vigiles but no patrician would ever stoop to such a prefecture if youre looking for adventure for a young man of your social rank theres always a military career but soldiers dont put out fires they burn down cities on purpose titus pursed his lips yes sometimes fire is a weapon used by the legions but im sure the troops are trained to put out flames as well when the enemy uses fire against us he thought of an example when your manytimesgreatuncle the divine julius was trapped with his army in cleopatras palace at alexandria the egyptians tried to burn him out they set fire to a warehouse attached to the great library i imagine caesars men were responsible for putting out that fire before it spread out of control lucius nodded thoughtfully he gazed at the vigiles below just a group of slaves and freedmen then still one has to admire their bravery and their skill not long after noon the wind abruptly ceased the cinderfilled smoke rose straight into the air like a vast column thanks to the calm air and the hard work of the vigiles the fires appeared to be under control at least on the aventine titus decided not to leave the city before he went to bed he instructed hilarion and several other slaves to keep watch through the night and to wake him at once if the need arose that night he and chrysanthe made love something they had not done in a long time perhaps it was the air of crisis that aroused him and her as well for she seemed to enjoy herself immensely certainly the act relieved a great deal of tension and helped titus fall asleep he had a strange dream he was taking an augury on the palatine but there were no spectators the whole city was empty he was watching for birds when suddenly one by one every cloud in the sky burst into flame like tufts of white fleece set afire the flaming clouds began to loose raindrops of fire on the city setting everything alight that was when chrysanthe and lucius woke him titus bolted upright drenched with sweat he found it hard to breathe and his throat was sore the air was thick with smoke father come to the garden look at the sky he followed his wife and son wondering if he was still dreaming for in the middle of the night the starless sky was aglow with a dull red illumination titus climbed the ladder to the roof with lucius following him from his rooftop he witnessed a horrific sight the entire circus maximus was in flames the long valley between the aventine and the palatine was a lake of fire indeed below a certain level the entire city appeared to be a sea of flames with the hills rising like islands from the conflagration even on the hilltops here and there he saw spots of flame or the glow of orange embers amid the charred remains of areas already burned the imperial complex on the palatine was almost entirely engulfed why was i not awakened sooner he shouted i told hilarion to wake me at once if the fire grew worse they say it happened very quickly father the fire seemed to spread everywhere all at once we must leave immediately and pray were not too late the trunk with the wax effigies and other essential valuables packed and loaded onto carts earlier in the day were wheeled into the street by his strongest slaves his three young daughters were roused by their mother by the time they were all ready to leave everyone was in a near panic titus summoned the slaves and gave them instructions they were all to come with the family each carrying something of value except for two of the youngest and strongest bodyguards you two will stay here as long as possible if the flames fail to reach this street it will be your job to protect the house against looters if the flames do come and if vigiles are here to fight it you will help them save this house but master said one of the slaves what if the house catches fire and theres no one to help and we have no choice but to flee titus realized that both slaves were hardly more than overgrown boys illequipped to make such a decision hilarion will stay with you hell decide if youre to leave or stay do you understand hilarion has authority to give you orders while im gone titus looked at hilarion and felt an unaccustomed twinge of some unpleasant emotion was it guilt before he could think about it hilarion stepped forward and took his masters hand thank you master you honour me with your trust titus nodded but found it difficult to look the slave in the eye he gathered the household and set out the route titus intended to take was blocked and they were forced to double back and seek another the dark streets filled with terrified people were lit only by a dull vermilion glow from the sky amid the chaotic crush of bodies titus overheard an outrageous statement a man nearby said it was set by the emperor you know it was neros own agents who started the fire and then kept starting more fires all over the city titus grabbed the man by the arm thats a filthy lie its the truth said the man i saw it happen with my own eyes uniformed men in leather caps demolished the wall of a granary using some sort of battering ram a good stone wall that would never have caught fire and then they deliberately set fire to the contents i know arson when i see it what you saw were the vigiles you fool setting fire to a warehouse full of highly flammable grain before the greater fire could reach it and cause the grain dust to explode tearing down walls and setting small fires is a part of the vigiles work setting fires to stop a fire how stupid do you think i am shouted the man this fire was set by neros men ive seen the evidence and so have plenty of others as for the vigiles you talk about theyre doing nothing to stop the fire theyve joined in the looting there was no time to argue titus roughly shoved the man aside and pressed on the streets were like something from a nightmare littered with rubble and overturned carts abandoned children huddled in corners and wept confused elders wandered aimlessly looking lost there were also a great many dead bodies blocking the way some had died from inhaling smoke perhaps for their bodies were unmarked others had died from burns and others appeared to have been trampled by the crowd finally titus and his household reached the nearest bridge across the tiber the area in front of the bridge that funnelled into the narrow roadway was jammed with people animals and carts it would take a long time to cross some people in desperation were swimming across the river instead at last titus and his household set foot on the bridge with the crowd pushing them forward he counted heads by some miracle they had all managed to stay in a group even the oldest and weakest of the slaves but not everyone in his family was accounted for he called to his son lucius you know the way to the villa you can lead the others there cant you of course i know the way father but what are you talking about youll lead us there titus sighed no i have to go back chrysanthe heard him and spun around dont be ridiculous husband what could you possibly have forgotten thats worth going back for ill join you later tonight or perhaps in the morning dont worry about me the gods will look after me titus stopped in his tracks the crowd surged past him carrying his household onto the bridge and quickly out of sight it was a struggle to move against the current he was jostled and poked and cursed at and several times he was almost knocked down at last he cleared the thickest part of the crowd and was able to move more freely he made his way to the forum here the flames were haphazard with some buildings alight and others as yet unscathed had the holy hearthfire which must never go out been transferred to a sacred vessel by the vestals and taken to safety as in the days when the gauls invaded the city how strange to worry about a fire going out in the middle of an inferno above the forum the whole palatine appeared to be aflame the auguratorium the ancient hut of romulus the temples the houses of the rich the imperial residence was everything destroyed the catastrophe was beyond comprehension he pressed on and reached the subura there were large areas here where the flames had not yet reached what a conflagration that would make if all these towering tenements built so closely together should catch fire he tried to remember the streets that would take him to kaesos latest residence but found himself lost in the darkness and the unfamiliar maze of alleys what a fools mission he had undertaken what mad impulse had driven him back into the city to look for his brother what were the chances he could possibly find kaeso amid so much confusion titus rounded a corner and came upon a large area where a tenement had recently been demolished in the open space a small group of people had gathered and were watching a burning building nearby in the middle of the group were kaeso and artemisia holding hands while all the other people around were in frantic motion kaeso and his friends stood perfectly still with their faces turned towards the fire they seemed to be in a kind of trance some stood in silence with linked hands others clapped or sang or shouted prayers to their god some seemed to be weeping with joy the end has come the end has finally come praise god cried one of the women raising her hands this is judgement day roma has been judged and found wanting cried a man in a tattered tunic with a long white beard fools call on their false gods to save roma but i say god has cursed roma god has damned roma praise god and all his works and of all his works this is the mightiest to smite this wicked city and destroy it some passersby overheard the mans ranting and were outraged they shook their fists shouted curses and threw stones at the christians then hurried on titus strode into the gathering he walked up to kaeso his brother had a blissful expression lit by the flames he did not notice titus at first finally he lowered his eyes and looked at his brother in surprise titus why are you here kaeso looked perplexed then smiled have you come to join us at last i came to see that you were alright kaeso kaeso grinned and nodded words cant describe my joy at what seeing the city of our ancestors burned to the ground this is the end of the world titus the day weve been waiting for longing for dont be absurd come with me before its too late too late those words have no meaning now this is the end of all things the end of time itself praise god suddenly the burning building collapsed the christians let out a collective sigh of ecstasy at the awesome sight but as showers of cinders and bits of flaming debris swept towards them they retreated in confusion even kaeso gave a start and staggered back from the fiery blast the golden amulet at his breast glittered bright red in the firelight like a flaming cross without thinking titus reached out grabbed the fascinum and gave it a hard yank the twine necklace snapped titus turned and ran back the way he had come clutching the talisman in his fist desperate to return to the bridge and be reunited with his family let kaeso perish in the flames if that was his desire titus would not allow the fascinum of his ancestors to be lost in the conflagration for days the fires continued to rage from his country estate on the far side of the tiber titus could see the distant glow of the flames at night during the day he could see great columns of smoke eventually the glow grew dimmer and the smoke diminished had the fires been extinguished the news he received from neighbours and passersby was confusing and contradictory the fires had been contained but continued to burn in isolated areas the fires had spread all the way across the field of mars to the tiber consuming the whole city so that nothing was left to burn the fires had been put out several times but someone kept setting more fires it was impossible to know what to believe was his house still standing if the house was lost hilarion and the two slaves should have come to join him but they had not was the house destroyed then and were all three slaves dead at last titus decided to venture back to the city lucius wanted to come with him feeling anxious and uncertain about what he might find titus was glad to have his son for company they took bodyguards with them who knew what degree of order prevailed in the city as they neared the tiber the smell of smoke grew stronger that was not a good sign but no vast clouds of smoke loomed over the city there was very little traffic on the road and they crossed the bridge with almost no other people in sight it was as if roma had been completely abandoned but this was a temporary illusion the fire had not reached the waterfront leaving the wharves and warehouses intact and here and there they saw sailors and dockworkers going about their business nor had the fire consumed the capitoline hill above them the great temple precinct including the most ancient and sacred temple of jupiter appeared to be unscathed titus had intended to head directly to the house but lucius suggested they scale the capitoline first from its summit they could see virtually the entire city and ascertain the state of things titus acquiesced in part because he dreaded finding his house in ruins and was willing to postpone the discovery a little longer long ago when he first came to roma titus had stood on the capitoline and gazed out over the city marveling at the view now he stood with his son in the same spot and was aghast at the extent of the damage to be sure while small fires still burned in a few scattered locations in most places the flames had been extinguished and the extent of the damage was not as great as he had feared the worst of the devastation was on the aventine and the palatine and in the low area between the palatine and the esquiline much of the forum was undamaged the field of mars had largely escaped the ravages of the fire and only a few areas of the subura had been destroyed looking towards the aventine he could not tell whether his house still stood or not some parts of the neighbourhood looked blackened and charred but others appeared unscathed when titus had first stood on this spot to take in the view kaeso had been beside him where was his brother now titus touched the fascinum at his breast and whispered a prayer to jupiter greatest and most powerful of gods that his brother was still alive and since the world had not ended as kaeso had so joyfully predicted that he had seen the foolishness of his beliefs and was ready to repent of his atheism and return to the worship of the gods they descended from the capitoline and headed to the house as they drew nearer they saw that some houses had been burned and others had not the caprice of the fire followed no discernible pattern they rounded a corner and titus saw the house of his nearest neighbour the place was a pile of smouldering rubble his heart leaped to his throat he could hardly breathe he took a few more steps and his own home came into view the house still stood the wall adjacent to his neighbour had been scorched and blackened but there was no other sign of damage lucius cried out with joy and ran ahead he reached the entrance hesitated for a moment then disappeared were the doors standing open surely hilarion had the sense to keep them shut and bolted titus quickened his pace before he reached the house lucius reappeared the boy looked stunned titus reached the entrance and saw the cause of his sons distress the doors had been smashed and ripped from their hinges in the vestibule lay two mangled bodies by their tunics titus recognized the two young bodyguards he had left to protect the house he walked slowly through the house from room to room speechless his home had been ransacked every portable object of value left behind when the family had fled had been taken vases lamps rugs even some of the larger pieces of furniture gone was the antique chair in which cato the younger had once sat what the thieves could not take they had destroyed the marble statue of venus in his garden had been overturned and broken into pieces an act of wanton desecration floor mosaics had been shattered as if beaten with a hammer wall paintings had been smeared with excrement in the room where titus slept the bed he shared with chrysanthe had been destroyed the wooden frame broken and the bedding ripped apart it was as if the rampant destructiveness of the fire had infected the looters with an insane desire to cause as much damage as possible or was this the envy of the poor for the rich allowed by chaos to manifest itself unchecked titus was appalled at the hatefulness of those who had done such a thing to his home he had never realized that he lived among such people he thought of the angry mob that had gathered outside the senate house when the fate of pedaniuss slaves was decided were those the sort of people who had done this perhaps men like gaius cassius longinus were right to be so suspicious and disdainful of the roman rabble titus entered the slave quarters these small rooms furnished with simple pallets for sleeping were largely unmolested there was little of value in them to be stolen or damaged from the next room he heard a faint scuffling sound it occurred to him that the thieves or some other vagrants might have taken refuge in this part of the house he was about to call for the bodyguards to join him when a familiar face peered around the corner it was hilarion the young slave looked at first fearful then relieved then ashamed he ran to titus and dropped to his knees forgive me master the day after you left men broke into the house we had no way to stop them there were too many they killed the bodyguards they would have killed me too if i hadnt managed to hide myself please master dont punish me hilarion of course i wont punish you but why didnt you come to the country estate and bring me the news you told me to stay here master and it was a good thing i did because that night the neighbours house caught fire i ran and found some vigiles and they managed to stop the flames from spreading to this house there was always the chance the fire might come back so i couldnt leave oh master ive been so frightened here all alone especially at night theres been so much violence people killed boys and women raped horrible crimes titus pulled the slave to his feet you did very well hilarion thank the gods youre still alive they managed to find a bit of food in the pantry titus sat with lucius and hilarion in the garden the sight of the broken venus made him lose his appetite titus stood im going for a walk alone but father surely you should take one of the bodyguards with you said lucius no theyll stay here with you and hilarion i am a roman senator a patrician and a blood relation of the divine augustus i will not be so intimidated that i cannot take a walk around my city without armed men to protect me titus strode to the vestibule and left the house he wandered through the city awed by the scale of the destruction in oncefamiliar areas he became hopelessly lost streets had been filled with rubble and landmarks had vanished on a slope of the esquiline he came upon a troop of vigiles working to put out one of the remaining fires the vigiles were covered with mud and soot and looked utterly exhausted yet still they laboured what a foul slander that anyone should have accused such men of arson and looting as twilight began to fall there was a terrible beauty in the way the blanket of clouds reflected the sombre glow of the stillsmouldering city as if the sky were a vast mottled bruise above the wounded earth roma was like a beautiful woman who had been terribly scarred she was still recognizable however damaged and still beloved titus would never abandon her above him on the esquiline a slender tower rose like a finger pointing to the sky the tower was located in the gardens of maecenas one of the imperial properties where nero sometimes resided the gardens appeared to have escaped the devastation it was the hour of twilight and all was still from the tower titus heard the music of a lyre and a man singing the voice was thin and reedy but strangely poignant the song was about the burning of troy troy most glorious of the ancient cities more beautiful than memphis or tyre which the greeks had conquered by deceit and burned to the ground troy from which the warrior aeneas had fled to italy and founded the roman race troy had burned now roma burned the song seemed to come from a halfforgotten dream the melody slowly strummed upon the lyre cast an eerie spell titus suddenly realized that it was the voice of nero he heard stepping back and gazing up titus saw a figure in purple and gold standing at the parapet of the tower strumming a lyre and gazing at the city the young emperor had returned to roma and found the smoldering ruins of troy nero reached the end of a verse the music stopped there must have been others with him on the parapet for the silence was followed by quiet applause and voices urging him to sing another verse nero obliged titus listened enthralled but one of the vigiles his face black with soot put his hands on his hips and spat on the ground this fire is the most terrible thing to happen to roma since the gauls sacked the city the man muttered and what does the emperor do he sings a pretty song cant hit a note can he titus had no idea what the man was talking about to him the song was unspeakably beautiful strange and mysterious unbearably sad yet filled with hope it did not matter that nero was not a great singer he had the soul of a great poet what a contrast nero presented to kaeso who had stared at the flames and grinned like an idiot nero responded with a lament that would wring tears from a god gazing up listening raptly to each word of neros song transported by each note titus clutched the fascinum in his hand glad to have it back in his possession at last at that moment he felt that all his ancestors were watching him just as all the gods were surely watching nero ad with his wife and son beside him titus pinarius stood before the wax effigies of his ancestors in the vestibule of his house as he looked from facetoface and recited each of their names to honour them chrysanthe lit small candles and lucius set one candle in each niche were his sons hands shaking they were all nervous and excited about the days upcoming events titus was thankful that he had taken the wax effigies when he fled the city unlike the objects the looters had stolen or destroyed the masks of the ancestors were truly irreplaceable returning them to their niches had been the first step in restoring the house to its former glory titus had not yet found a skilled artisan to repair the floor mosaics such artisans were in tremendous demand but the wall paintings had been meticulously cleaned the broken statue of venus had been reassembled and patched and painted so that one could hardly tell it had been damaged and many of the stolen or destroyed furnishings had been replaced he had even found an antique folding chair almost identical to the one cato had owned in the months since the fire thanks to a great deal of hard work and at considerable expense tituss household had gradually returned to normal many people in roma had not been so fortunate titus had looked after the images of his ancestors and they had looked after him of that he had no doubt that was one of the reasons he honoured them on this special day when the emperor was about to pay him and his family a great honour titus wore his senatorial toga with a purple stripe his son also wore a toga a garment he was still not used to his wife was in her finest stola a gown of beautifully embroidered ocher linen her hair was arranged in the style made fashionable by the emperors strikingly beautiful young wife poppaea sabina with multitudes of ringlets framing her face the ceremony was concluded they retired to the garden to await the days events nothing in the garden was as beautiful as chrysanthe thought lucius feeling proud as he often did of the choice he had made for a bride so many years ago nor was anything in the garden as fragrant as chrysanthe you smell of rose petals and milk he whispered in her ear she smiled credit the emperors wife poppaea has made it fashionable for the best women in roma to bathe in milk and will you become a jewess like the empress asked titus teasing her it was widely known that poppaea had shown favour to the jews in roma and had regularly received their scholars and holy men some claimed she had secretly converted to the religion no more than you have become a christian said his wife teasing him back she gestured to the fascinum which titus was wearing to mark the special occasion titus did not find this jest particularly funny it seemed to him that kaeso must have altered the amulet in some way to make it look even more like a cross nevertheless titus wore the fascinum openly and proudly refusing to hide it inside his toga there was a knock at the door followed by a flurry of excitement in the house even the slaves were excited and with good cause it was not every day that the emperor himself came calling hilarion rushed into the garden theyre here master are they coming in i think not master the man at the door says youre to come out and join them then we mustnt keep them waiting titus took his wife by the hand and allowed his son to lead the way the retinue in the street was even larger than titus had expected there were secretaries and scribes a troop of praetorians several senators in togas and even a colourful group of actors and acrobats in the middle of the retinue carried by some of the brawniest slaves titus had ever seen was a large litter set on gilded poles and decorated to look like a giant swan a hand adorned by many rings pulled back a purple curtain smiling broadly nero made a gesture of welcome sitting next to him was the beautiful poppaea her blonde hair done up in an elaborate fashion that titus had never seen before portable steps were produced chrysanthe entered the litter first followed by titus and lucius they settled amid plush cushions across from the emperor and his wife titus felt chrysanthe tremble and he took her hand poppaea smiled at this gesture of intimacy and likewise took one of neros bejewelled hands in hers were not pressed for time i thought we might take a little tour of the city on the way to our destination said nero certainly said titus theres so much construction going on all over roma i cant keep up with it actually titus was well aware of almost every building project in the city but the tour would be a treat for chrysanthe and lucius and he was enormously flattered by the emperors offer to spend time with his family nero smiled my greatgreatgrandfather famously said that he found roma a city of bricks and left her clad in marble i found a city of scorched marble but shall leave her covered in gold as they were carried aloft through the city nero proudly pointed out the rapid progress that had been made on reconstructing various temples and public structures the rebuilding of the circus maximus was one of the largest projects it would be some time before it was ready to reopen but nero had plans to make it more splendid and beautiful than before there were also curiosities to be seen up on the palatine the ancient hut of romulus had been spared by the fire and though most of the oldest parts of the imperial residence had been burned the laurel trees flanking the original entrance had survived and remain intact surely thats an omen father declared lucius overcoming his shyness in front of the imperial couple especially poppaea whose beauty could have intimidated any man it certainly is said titus those trees appear to be indestructible immune to both fire and lightning i believe those two laurel trees will survive as long as there are descendants of the divine augustus this comment was clearly appreciated by the imperial couple who gave each other a loving glance poppaea though not showing it yet was rumoured to be pregnant her first child with nero a daughter had died in infancy nero had been griefstricken now there was again hope for a new generation directly descended from the divine augustus and an heir for the emperor who was not yet thirty so many beautiful old houses were lost said nero pressing his fingertips together while he gazed at the passing view but the fire displaced not just the wealthy who lived on the palatine but a great many other people as well im told many of those citizens lived in appalling squalor stacked atop one another with hardly enough room to turn around well we shall build shiny new tenements for them better than those rattraps they lived in before that will take time of course for now sadly many of the homeless are still in temporary shelters on the field of mars and at my own gardens across the tiber to give the citizens work ive hired a veritable army of bricklayers and day labourers for construction projects all over the city to feed their families ive repeatedly lowered the price of grain and to make sure such a catastrophe never occurs again ive introduced new building codes that the experts assure me will reduce the danger of fire buildings set farther apart limitations on their height requirements to keep firefighting implements such as picks and buckets on the premises that sort of thing oh look there he said pointing to an aqueduct covered with scaffolding were also repairing and extending the aqueducts that were damaged there must be cisterns and fountains to ensure an adequate water supply to fight any fire that may occur in the future caesars swift and steady response to the crisis has been an inspiration to us all said titus ah now were passing through the very heart of what will become the new imperial complex said nero grinning with excitement this entire side of the palatine has been cleared and claimed for the new imperial apartments and down there in that cleared area that used to be crammed with hideous old buildings there will be a rather large lake entirely enclosed within the imperial complex wont that be charming a private lake in the heart of the city surrounded by vineyards and gardens and a little forest stocked with wild deer so that poppaea and i may retreat for a stroll in the countryside or even go hunting without ever stepping outside the imperial palace much less the city walls of course the lake will have a practical purpose as well it will serve as a reservoir a source of water in the event of fire the creation of the artificial lake was well under way hundreds of workers were raking and shovelling great piles of excavated earth shaping them into the rolling hills that would become the manmade woodland surrounding the lake along here on this side of the lake there will be a vast pavilion with a covered walkway a mile long said nero the rooms will be very spacious and finished with the best of everything imported marbles fine statuary ivory screens and the most sumptuous fabrics you must see the sketches the designers have made for me the ceilings will be decorated with gleaming gems and motherofpearl so that at night by lamplight it will seem that the starry sky itself has descended to gaze with envy at such splendid rooms and gold there must be a great deal of gold everywhere we shall cover the whole facade with tiles of golden glass so that it dazzles the eye the only colour that truly pleases me is purple and the only metal is gold how i love the weight of it and the mellow colour like sunlight on water like that lovely little golden amulet youre always wearing senator pinarius titus touched the fascinum and smiled a gift from my ancestors yes i know curiouslooking thing said nero he flashed a quizzical smile then returned his attention to the construction work going on around them when the time comes there shall be a grand ceremony to mark the day that poppaea and the baby and i move in i think i shall call it the golden house what do you say to that senator pinarius a splendid name for a splendid house the only house fit for a person such as myself to live in mused nero ah weve come to the site of the grand courtyard this will be the main entrance for visitors who come from the forum the sacred way will terminate at a stairway that ascends to the door of the golden house therell be other entrances of course including augustuss old entry on the palatine flanked by those ancient laurel trees but that will be a sort of back door the grand courtyard is going to be enormous surrounded by a portico with hundreds of marble columns you cant really appreciate the enormity of it now cluttered as it is with all these workmens shacks the centerpiece will be that colossal bronze statue going up in the middle depicting myself we havent yet decided in what guise i should appear poppaea thinks i should pose as hercules but zenodorus the sculptor thinks i should be sol wearing a crown of sunbeams when its finished the statue will be over a hundred and twenty feet tall the largest statue since the colossus that once stood at rhodes and unlike that statue this one will be covered in gold can you imagine the splendour of it on a sunny day people will be able to see it from miles away and the closer they come the more dazzled theyll be on a sunny day it will be positively blinding truly caesar the new colossus will be a stupendous monument said titus amazed anew not just at the extent of neros imagination but at the enormity of his expenditures a great deal of private property had been seized by the state to allow for the massive expansion of the imperial palace and a great many temple treasuries from all over the empire had been appropriated to pay for construction and to provide decorations in this ambitious enterprise titus had played an invaluable role auspices had to be taken to seek divine approval for many of neros actions and religious ceremonies had to be conducted to propitiate the gods whose treasuries were depleted titus had faithfully served as neros augur just as he had once performed the same duties for claudius he had volunteered to do so and had performed eagerly and with unswerving loyalty since the night he had been transfixed by neros song about the burning of troy titus has become one of the emperors most fervent adherents the emperor was thankful for his loyal service the invitation to titus and his family to accompany the emperor and his wife in the imperial litter was one of neros ways of thanking him i am grateful as always to play any part however small in caesars grand enterprises said titus unfortunately senator pinarius not everyone seems to feel as you do said poppaea she had been quiet throughout the tour and had even been looking a bit bored no doubt she had heard nero speak the same words many times before titus who had met her on several occasions but had never spoken to her privately was not quite sure what to make of poppaea who always seemed distant and selfabsorbed and tended to speak in riddles nero was not her first husband previously she had been married to neros friend otho rumour had it that the three young people had become so intimate that they formed as one wag put it a threeheaded love monster but ultimately nero wanted poppaea all to himself he forced otho to divorce her appointed otho governor of lusitania to get him out of roma and made poppaea his wife her remark probably referred to the increasingly widespread rumours of a conspiracy against the emperor despite neros energetic response to the crisis and his optimistic plans for the future a simmering discontent reached across all classes the fire had been followed by a pestilence that had killed tens of thousands of people especially among the homeless poor and the loss of so many religious and historical treasures had thoroughly demoralized the populace neros vast building projects were intended to replace those lost treasures but among the wealthy there was a fear that his profligate spending would precipitate a financial crisis hostile senators were said to be plotting against him and among the common citizens vile rumours claimed that nero himself had deliberately started the fire so that he could claim vast tracts of ruined real estate for the imperial house and rebuild the city to suit himself unfortunately and with obvious regret nero had found it necessary to banish a number of senators whom he suspected of disloyalty among these had been gaius cassius longinus the senator who had made an impassioned speech to crucify the slaves of pedanius nero had ordered him to remove from his ancestral effigies the wax mask of the cassius who had assassinated the divine julius a perfectly reasonable request titus thought the senator had refused cassiuss exile to sardinia had caused an outcry among his colleagues who argued that pity should be shown to a jurist of such renown especially since he was now completely blind next to him titus heard chrysanthe groan and then he saw the reason on a scorched wall all that remained of a destroyed building a message had been scrawled in black paint strong and valiant he killed his mother and set my house on fire more and more frequently in recent days titus had seen such ugly graffiti on walls and in latrinae all over the city fortunately a group of men was in the process of painting over this message and adding their own titus craned his neck to see what they were writing but as the litter moved on all he could make out were the words christians and burn my loyal freedmen hard at work said nero pulling at the rings on his fingers i dont even have to ask them they go about the city and clean up such slander wherever they see it gossip is a terrible thing muttered poppaea it certainly is agreed chrysanthe nodding sympathetically but on this day all those nasty rumours will be put to rest and the true culprits will be brought to justice said nero regaining his good humour the people will see that their emperor is dedicated to protecting roma and destroying those who harm her i shall give them a show they will never forget they proceeded towards their destination the imperial gardens on the far side of the tiber where caligula had built a large racetrack for his private amusement at the foot of the vatican hill nero used the track frequently for he loved to race chariots and seneca had convinced him that it was unsuitable for the emperor to race in public since the circus maximus was not yet rebuilt nero had decided to open the circus vaticanus to the public it was one of the few spaces large enough to accommodate the spectacular entertainments he had devised for the punishment of the condemned arsonists as the litter bearers carried them across an undeveloped area of the field of mars titus saw the sea of makeshift shelters where much of the populace was living these dwellings were little more than leantos built from scrap lumber or makeshift tents stitched together from bits of cloth on this day no one stayed inside the shelters excited by the impending spectacle everyone in roma seemed to be heading in a great mass towards the imperial gardens across the tiber as the litter passed through the crowd with the praetorians clearing the way people flocked to have a look at the emperor and his wife there were cheers and shouts of hail caesar and hail the beautiful poppaea but some in the crowd shrugged and turned away or gave the imperial couple hostile looks or even muttered curses poppaea frowned and whispered in neros ear he called to the one of the praetorians to tighten the cordon around the litter then unhooked the chains holding back the drapes so that they could proceed in relative privacy the gauzy drapes allowed nero and his guests to see out but appeared opaque from the outside a new bridge crossed the tiber allowing direct access from the field of mars to the vatican meadows at neros orders the bridge had been built with amazing speed for the purpose of allowing the homeless of roma to cross easily from the city to the shelters provided for them on the far side on this day the new bridge served as a means for the multitudes of roma to attend the spectacle in the circus vaticanus already such a crowd had gathered that the bridge and the area before it were packed with people but the praetorians quickly cleared a path for the litter to pass through and cross the river spread across the vatican meadows was a veritable city of makeshift shelters some people even appeared to be living in the trees beyond the meadows they came to the formal gardens that had been planted by caligula these were entered through an iron gate the praetorians pushed back the crowd so that nero could pass the gardens to either side of the wide gravel path were splendid with beds of roses and other fragrant flowers and fine statues including a particularly striking fountain in which the nude diana stood ankledeep in shimmering water while the unfortunate actaeon transformed into a rearing stag was attacked by his hounds they arrived at the circus the permanent viewing stands built of travertine were elegantly appointed but quite small these had been supplemented by the erection of temporary wooden stands that completely encircled the track and could accommodate tens of thousands of spectators the stands were already about half filled and more people were arriving at every moment the litter came to a halt before the travertine structure adjoining the circus nero and his party stepped out the emperor and poppaea abruptly disappeared titus was not sure where they went while titus and his family were escorted directly to the imperial box titus was flushed with excitement he could see that his wife and wideeyed son were equally elated never before had the pinarii been invited to be the personal guests of the emperor at a public entertainment not only would they view the proceedings side by side with the emperor but they would be seen beside him in his company perceived to be among the most elite of the imperial circle this was an important day for the pinarii not just for titus and his immediate family but for all who had borne the name pinarius in the past or would bear it in the future the box was lined with purple draperies bordered with gold and surrounded by a cordon of praetorians titus and his family were the first guests to arrive and were shown to couches at one corner of the box a slave offered them a choice of wines and set out a tray of delicacies for them directly before them in the centre of the spine that bisected the oval racing track loomed a towering egyptian obelisk made from solid red granite the obelisk had been brought to roma by caligula from the city of heliopolis in egypt the four sides were strikingly plain without hieroglyphs a gilded ball was set atop the obelisk balanced on the very tip the obelisk was a landmark visible from many places in the city titus had previously seen it only from a distance and was awed by its height the vestal virgins and members of various priesthoods had been seated in the front rows to the left of the imperial box to the right of the box was a large section reserved for senators out in the arena to warm up the crowd musicians played while acrobats tumbled walked on their hands and formed human pyramids laughter and applause swept through the stands but many people continued to talk and move about while waiting for the main event more guests arrived in the imperial box leading the party was seneca since the death of agrippina he had become more powerful than ever though titus had heard rumours of growing discord between the emperor and his chief adviser the strains of dealing with the aftermath of the fire were taking a toll on everyone arriving with seneca was his wife paulina now that he was in his sixties and she was nearly forty the gap in their ages was not as striking as it once had been also with seneca was his handsome nephew lucan was two years younger than nero and their shared love of poetry had made them close friends like nero lucan had bloomed early at the age of eleven he had created a sensation with his first poem about the combat between hector and achilles and at twentyfive he was the citys most famous poet on this occasion he wore an augurs trabea nero had seen fit to induct lucan into the college well ahead of the prescribed age just as previous emperors had done for titus and his father lucan was accompanied by his wife polla argentaria was almost as famous as her husband thanks to the verses he had written praising her she was the daughter of a wealthy senator and like senecas wife had received an unusually extensive education for a woman argentaria was said to be her husbands muse and amanuensis and perhaps even his collaborator as she tirelessly helped him revise and perfect his verses gaius petronius was next to arrive the emperors arbiter of elegance was not quite forty and had flecks of silver in his hair titus found it impossible to put his finger on what set the man apart from all others petronius wore a toga about which there was nothing extraordinary and his grooming while impeccable was not in any way unusual still the man cast a spell by his very presence perhaps it was the effortless grace with which he moved or his inscrutable expression even when he was most serious there were flashes of amusement in his pale grey eyes titus felt privileged to be in such illustrious company but he also found it rather stressful since he had difficulty keeping up with the conversation which revolved largely around the three mens literary projects and was full of puns and allusions and double entendres many of which titus couldnt decipher lucan he gathered was about to publish the next volume of his epic poem about the civil war between caesar and pompeius a work full of violent action and scenes of epic grandeur seneca who had been reading the work in progress thought that his nephew sided perhaps too much with pompeius and the republican cause against the divine julius a point of view sure to stir controversy petronius was working on something very different a long work in which his narrator recounted a series of erotic misadventures and comical disasters all related to heighten the irony in the most elegant and rarefied prose knowing how nero relied on petronius for advice on all matters to do with good taste titus asked him if he was responsible for staging the spectacles they were about to witness petronius narrowed his eyes i contributed very little caesar devised most of the entertainments the emperor threw himself into this project as he enters into all his endeavours with extraordinary energy and enthusiasm but what about you seneca what are you working on these days when youre not out mining gold to build the emperors new house seneca smiled ive finally finished the play about pasiphae he noted the blank look on luciuss face do you know the tale young pinarius im afraid not admitted lucius titus winced his sons education reflected on himself pasiphae was the wife of king minos of crete said seneca she was cursed by neptune to crave intercourse with a bull what woman has not said petronius chrysanthe blushed lucius giggled nervously and titus himself was startled by the comment but the others seemed to find it quite amusing just so conceded seneca with a wry smile but pasiphae did something about it she ordered the inventor daedalus to construct an effigy of a heifer so realistic that even a bull would find it convincing then she concealed herself inside the mock heifer and seduced the bull into gratifying her nine months later pasiphae gave birth to a child with a bulls head the minotaur who but seneca would bring such material to the stage said petronius it was impossible to tell whether his tone was respectful or sardonic has the emperor read it yet the emperor is always my first reader and invariably the most astute im happy to say that caesar seemed quite fascinated by the tragedy of pasiphae ah here he is now they rose to their feet as nero entered the box with poppaea beside him people in the crowd saw him enter and a thrill ran up and down the stands but the response was mixed just as earlier titus had heard shouts of hail caesar in the streets so many in the crowd now shouted accolades but there was a low grumbling as well and scattered hisses nero escorted poppaea to her seat then stepped forward and raised his hands with his fair hair and purpleandgold robes he was visible and instantly recognizable to everyone in the circus the crowd fell silent for a moment it appeared that nero might address the crowd indeed nero had wanted to deliver the opening speech but seneca had persuaded him not to do so there were simply too many problems that might arise when an emperor directly addressed such a large and unpredictable gathering instead nero gestured to a public crier who stepped forward with his powerful trained voice the man was able to make himself heard from end to end of the circus while he spoke titus could see that nero moved his lips along with the crier like a proud author in the theatre mouthing lines spoken by an actor senators and people of roma you are here today at caesars invitation welcome but if you have come expecting a mere entertainment you may be surprised at what you are about to witness today you will not see charioteers race you will not see gladiators fight to the death you will not see wild animals hunted you will not see captives of war made to reenact a famous battle for your amusement you will not see actors perform a comedy or a drama what you will see is an act of justice carried out under the open sky so that all the gods and the people of roma may witness the proceedings the criminals you will see punished today are guilty of arson and murder they have conspired against the roman state they have plotted the destruction of the roman people even those not directly guilty of setting fires must be punished their notorious hatred of the gods of mankind and of life itself makes them a menace to us all because of the fire many of you are still without proper homes because of the fire many of you lost your most cherished possessions because of the fire many of you lost loved ones whose cries of anguish still ring in your ears our city the most beloved by the gods of all cities on earth has been devastated the gods themselves weep at the destruction of roma and the suffering of the roman people thanks to the vigilance of your emperor the arsonists who perpetrated this misery have been apprehended they call themselves christians the name comes from christus the founder of their sect a criminal who suffered the extreme penalty at the hands of pontius pilatus one of our procurators in judaea during the reign of tiberius thanks to pilatus the insidious superstition propagated by this christus was checked but only for a short while because it quickly broke out again not only in judaea the first source of this evil but in many places across the empire even here in roma lurking among us the followers of christus have plotted our destruction thanks to caesars vigilance the christians were apprehended under interrogation they revealed their accomplices and confessed their crime more than confessed it they proclaimed it without remorse the christians are proud of what they did they are gratified by your suffering the crowd erupted in boos and jeers initially titus had been dubious when the mass arrest of christians began they struck him as an ineffectual group of layabouts but when he remembered the jubilant reactions of the christians watching the flames it was not hard to imagine that some of them had deliberately started the fire such a crime was almost unthinkable but the fanaticism of all the jewish sects was well known and the unyielding atheism of the christians and their loathing of all things roman was particularly virulent that their abhorrence of the gods had led them to such a monstrous crime was shocking but perhaps not surprising the jeering of the crowd continued until nero himself gestured for silence the crier continued but what punishment you may ask could possibly fit so terrible a crime for offenses so hideous so foul so wicked what retribution can possibly be adequate that is what we are here to see senators and people of roma this is a holy day we call on the gods to pay witness to what happens in this place what we do we do in honour of the gods and in gratitude for the favour they have shown us the crier stepped back lucan stepped forward from the folds of his trabea he produced a beautiful ivory lituus while the young poet took the auspices titus felt a twinge of envy wishing he had been chosen for the honour but as high as titus had risen in the emperors favour he knew he could not compete with lucan with whom nero felt a special intimacy because they were so close in age and shared such a deep love of poetry the auspices were favourable the emperor pulled a white mantle over his head to assume his role as pontifex maximus stepped forward and raised his hand every head in the circus was bowed as nero uttered the invocation to jupiter best and greatest of the gods the spectacle commenced at gladiator games and other public events the punishment of criminals was often part of the programme but usually only a very small part worked into the proceedings by making the condemned fight against gladiators or act as bait for wild animals on this occasion the punishment of criminals because there were so many of them and because their crime was so great would make up the entire programme the stagers with nero guiding them had faced great challenges both logistical and artistic how could so many criminals of all ages be made to suffer and die in ways that were not only sure and efficient but also meaningful and satisfying to those who were watching from a cell beneath the newly erected stands a large number of men women and children were driven to the racetrack they were dressed in rags most looked confused and frightened but some had the same serene glassyeyed stare as titus had seen on the faces of the christians watching the fire they seemed oblivious of what was about to happen or perhaps they even looked forward to it so many muttered chrysanthe leaning forward oh this is only a small portion of the arsonists said nero there are many more to come the punishments will go on for quite some time how could we have had so many of them among us wondered lucan what drew these terrible people to roma in the first place and how did they seduce decent romans to join their ranks all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world eventually find their way to roma and inevitably attract a following said petronius as a flame attracts insects as a whirlpool attracts flotsam so roma attracts the vermin and filth of the world yet a flame is beautiful said nero once the charred insects are brushed aside and a whirlpool is beautiful once the flotsam is flushed away just so roma will be beautiful again once it has been purified of these vile criminals he gazed raptly at the arena below next to him poppaea also sat forward in eager anticipation while it might be true that she had played hostess to jewish scholars and wise men she detested the christians as jewish heretics if nothing else lucan looked sidelong at titus my uncle tells me that you had a brother who called himself a christian titus stiffened it was inevitable that the subject would come up and he was prepared for it i have no brother he said stiffly selfconsciously he touched the fascinum that nestled amid the folds of his toga from storage rooms under the stands an army of stagehands produced a multitude of crosses and laid them on the sand the christians were made to circle the racetrack driven with scourges then were seized and thrown on the crosses while they screamed in terror their hands and feet were nailed in place then the crosses were set upright into holes that had been dug ahead of time suddenly the circus was filled with a forest of crucifixes the crowd jeered at the christians spectators with strong arms and good aim competed to pelt them with stones and other objects some in the stands had brought eggs especially for this purpose these crucifixions are in imitation of the dead god they profess to worship who likewise ended up on a cross explained nero in a hushed voice while this batch hangs from the crosses they will witness what happens to their accomplices more christians were driven into the arena their arms were bound and they were wrapped in bloody animal skins but their heads were uncovered so that their faces could be seen and their screams heard at the two far ends of the circus packs of vicious dogs were released the animals sniffed the air within moments they began racing towards the christians the dogs had a long way to go the christians staggered first one way then the other trapped between the packs bounding towards them from both sides the crowd went wild people jumped to their feet with excitement anticipating the moment the hounds would reach their prey nero smiled this was exactly the reaction he had hoped for the dogs attacked without hesitation and tore their victims to pieces the barking and screaming and the sight of so much blood and gore excited the crowd to an even higher pitch some of the christians provided considerable sport as they squealed and whimpered for mercy and darted this way and that trying to elude the dogs those among the christians who died with a degree of dignity muttering prayers or even singing songs ignited the fury of the crowd such behaviour made a mockery of justice how dare such criminals continue to taunt their victims even as they were punished more christians were driven onto the racetrack more hounds were released each death was as bloody as the last but the crowd began to grow restless bored by the repetition nero had anticipated this at his signal a new phase of the spectacle began to revive the spectators interest various familiar stories were reenacted using the christians as props for the story of icarus boys with wings attached to their arms were driven to the top of a portable tower and made to jump off one after another they plummeted to earth and lay twitching on the sand those who survived were carried to the top of the tower and thrown off again to illustrate the story of laocoon and his sons tanks filled with deadly eels were wheeled onto the sand and groups of fathers and sons were thrown into the water where they died screaming and thrashing for titus the most striking of the tableaux was the tale of pasiphae perhaps because seneca had just related it a naked christian girl was first paraded around the track while the crowd jeered and shouted obscenities then she was forced inside a wooden effigy of a heifer by some trickery the animal trainers induced a white bull to mount the effigy the device was constructed to amplify the girls cries rather than muffle them her bloodcurdling screams could be heard from one end of the circus to the other the crowd was transfixed eventually her screams stopped when the bull was finished the trainers led it away a few moments later from a concealed compartment in the bottom of the effigy a naked boy wearing a calfs head jumped out and performed a lively dance the minotaur people cried shes given birth to the minotaur the crowd went wild with applause and cheering nero beamed with pride such tableaux one after another took place all up and down the length of the circus eventually for a climax men with torches appeared and all the christians who lay lifeless or near to death on the sand and all the wooden props were set afire though the crucifixes were left untouched the sight of the flames was alarming as was the stench of the smoke some in the audience reliving the trauma of the conflagration wept with grief others laughed uncontrollably there were gasps and shrieks from the crowd but also cheering and applause the christians were convicted arsonists and the legally prescribed punishment for arson was death by fire as the scattered flames died down and night began to fall sturdy poles twice the height of a man were erected in the spaces between the crucifixes the poles had been soaked in pitch as was evident from their strong smell obviously another spectacle involving fire was about to be presented the crowd reacted with cries of mingled dread and fascination to the top of each pitchsoaked pole a kind of iron basket was affixed large enough to hold a human body thus far titus had watched the spectacle with grim detachment the auspices had been unequivocally favourable for this event titus had watched closely as lucan performed the augury and that was a clear indication that the gods were pleased watching the gruesome punishments of the arsonists gave titus no pleasure but it was his sombre duty as a citizen and as a friend of the emperor to witness the event titus felt the need to empty his bladder the moment seemed opportune as there appeared to be an interlude before the next event so he rose and excused himself looking over his shoulder nero told him where to find the nearest latrina and then giggled as if at some secret joke titus left the imperial box glad that the spectacle had put the emperor in such a buoyant mood the latrina was in a small building some distance from the stands a few other men were inside talking about the spectacle as they went about their business they were in general agreement that while some of the punishments had been too repetitious others had been quite remarkable there was an enthusiastic consensus that the rape of pasiphae had been by far the most impressive of the tableaux not something you see every day quipped one man unless youre a god like neptune and can make such things happen with a wave of your trident or unless youre nero titus headed back to the stands the sky had grown darker the stars were coming out torches had been placed here and there to light the grounds as he neared the stands a pair of praetorians abruptly blocked his way whats that said one of them the man was big and brutish but had perfect teeth which glinted in the torchlight he pointed at the fascinum at tituss breast isnt that a cross like some of those christians wear what i wear around my neck is none of your business said titus curtly he tried to step past the two men but they barred his way youll come with us said the praetorian with perfect teeth i most certainly will not can you not see that i wear a senators toga im returning to the imperial box sure you are a christian in the emperors box each of them grabbed an arm and together they led him despite his efforts to resist to a small room under the newly built wooden stands a third praetorian apparently their superior sat at a table piled high with scrolls problem he asked an escaped christian sir said the praetorian with perfect teeth this is ridiculous snapped titus whats your name christian said the officer my name is pinarius senator titus pinarius the officer consulted a list ah yes we do indeed have a pinarius among those scheduled to be punished in the circus today a male citizen age fortyseven this must be him titus clenched his jaw all day he had avoided thinking about his brother telling himself he had no brother that would be kaeso pinarius not titus now i recognize you said the officer you were one of the first arsonists we arrested you certainly look different now how did you manage to clean yourself up like that and escape from the cell and where in hades did you get that toga ill bet you murdered a senator to get your hands on that this is absurd said titus i am a senator an augur and a friend of the emperor the praetorians laughed titus felt a sinking sensation the situation was getting out of hand he told himself to remain calm let me explain something he said speaking though gritted teeth i have a brother a twin brother who is a christian the praetorians only laughed harder an identical twin shouted the praetorian with perfect teeth thats rich with your imagination you should be writing comedies for the stage not setting fires said the officer who abruptly ceased laughing and looked grim such a preposterous story only confirms what i suspected what do you fellows think how do we treat a lying murdering christian the praetorians roughly shoved titus back and forth between them yanked at his toga until they pulled it off him then ripped his undertunic until it hung in tatters and he was left wearing nothing but his loincloth when one of them reached for the fascinum titus tried to fight back but he felt like a child flailing at giants the praetorian with perfect teeth struck him hard across the face jarring his teeth and leaving him dazed and unsteady and with the taste of blood in his mouth they grabbed him by the arms pulled him out of the little room and began taking him somewhere else in the open space behind the stands they passed two men in senatorial togas titus tried to raise his arms but the praetorians restrained him help me he shouted the senators glanced at him one of them muttered filthy arsonist the praetorians struck titus across the face to silence him and shoved him to a gate the gate opened and titus was forced into a dimly lit enclosure above him he could hear the murmur of the crowd all around him echoed the creaking of the wooden stands as people moved about overhead as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he saw that the cell was quite large and full of people most of them in rags or wearing little more than he was they were filthy and unkempt and stank of urine and sweat he passed among them staring at their faces some were trembling with fear and muttering prayers with their eyes tightly shut others were oddly calm speaking to their companions in low reassuring voices in such a wicked world death is a release to be longed for said a man with a long white beard titus had seen him once in kaesos rooms even a death under circumstances as horrible as this is better than life in such a world death will deliver us to a better place a harried stage manager scurried by followed by a group of praetorians i am trying to maintain order here i am trying to keep to the emperors schedule of events the man shouted now i need you fellows to divide the prisoners into groups titus ran toward the man listen to me he said a mistake has been made i shouldnt be here the man started back as if a wild dog had jumped at him before titus could say another word one of the praetorians raised a shield and used it to shove him back by a flicker of torchlight titus caught a glimpse of his reflection in the highly polished metal he was shocked at what he saw staring back at him was a nearly naked man with a crazed look in his eyes his face bruised his lips bleeding how quickly his dignified untouchable identity as a roman senator had been stripped from him titus looked this way and that desperate to find someone to whom he could explain his situation suddenly he was facetoface with kaeso he had never before seen his brother look so wretched like titus kaeso wore only a loincloth the body titus saw before him was familiar but distorted like a mockery of his own covered with bruises and wounds and bloody patches kaeso had been beaten and tortured from his gaunt appearance he had been starved as well there was nothing aloof about his manner as was the case with some of the christians kaeso looked utterly broken and unnerved titus saw a pitiful frightened man as the arrest and interrogation of the christians had proceeded and the day of their punishment approached titus had forced himself not to think about his brother he had told himself so many times that he had no brother that he almost believed it now kaeso stood before him a shadow of the man he once had been but still undeniably the son of lucius pinarius tituss twin brother titus felt an unbearable sadness remembering their boyhood together in alexandria and the years before they became strangers to each other how had they grown so far apart how had kaeso ended up among these mad deathworshippers its alright brother whispered kaeso i forgive you tituss sadness faded he felt a quiver of anger what had he done to require forgiveness why did kaeso always have to be so smug and selfrighteous he tried to think of something to say but there was no time suddenly a line of praetorians was between them forcing kaeso into one group and titus into another with the praetorians barking orders at them the people in kaesos group were forced to put on tunics soaked in pitch then their arms were tied behind them a door opened from the arena came the roar of the crowd the stage manager screamed at the prisoners to hurry into the arena quickly quickly quickly guards with spears herded them through the opening titus suddenly realized that his meeting with kaeso had not been accidental the gods had given him a last chance to save himself he stepped away from his group and tried to get the attention of the stage manager were twins thats my twin brother look at us do you see there are two of us but its my twin brother whos the christian not i im not supposed to be here the stage manager gave him an exasperated look and rolled his eyes one of the guards used the butt of his spear to knock titus to the ground kaeso managed to break away from the group and ran to titus stinking of pitch with his arms bound behind him he dropped to his knees beside his brother give me the crucifix he whispered please titus its the only thing that can give me strength to face the end lying on his back titus clutched the fascinum at his chest and shook his head titus i beg you titus im about to be burned alive please brother grant me this one small favour reluctantly titus removed the necklace and put it over kaesos head even as he did so he knew it was wrong to give it up he reached desperately to grab the fascinum and take it back but a guard pulled kaeso to his feet and the fascinum eluded tituss grasp kaeso was the last of his group to be herded onto the track titus scrambled to his feet through the opened door he saw that the prisoners were being lifted up and placed in the iron baskets atop the pitchsoaked poles guards carrying torches ran onto the track and stationed themselves by the poles ready to set the human torches alight as titus watched kaeso was driven to the nearest of the poles he was the last to be lifted into a basket titus caught a glimpse of something bright and glittering at his brothers breast the fascinum then averted his eyes he could not bear to watch he heard a low murmur run though the crowd a rush of indrawn breath like wind passing though tall grass this was followed by a cheer that started at one end of the circus then gradually rose to a roar from the stands above came the deafening noise of spectators stamping their feet in excitement titus stepped to the doorway and peered outside at the far end of the circus a lone charioteer had driven onto the track he was dressed in the leather racing outfit and helmet of the green faction favoured by the emperor the charioteer was driving his white steeds at a slow canter as he waved to the crowd there were charioteers whose popularity rivalled that of the most famous gladiators but what charioteer could be so high in the emperors esteem that nero would select him to play this majestic even godlike role as the charioteer drove past each human torch he raised his arm pointed an accusing finger at the prisoner and the torch burst into flames the effect was uncanny as if the charioteer had the power to cast thunderbolts as more torches were lit the arena grew brighter and titus at last saw what the crowd in the stands had already perceived the charioteer was nero as the emperor continued his slow progress he drew nearer and nearer to the doorway where titus stood and to the pole on which kaeso had been hoisted with a gesture from nero the torch next to kaeso was set alight kaeso would be next suddenly titus felt hands on him the guards had seen that he was at the opening and were pulling him back summoning all his strength titus managed to break free he ran onto the track he slipped on a slick wet spot and tumbled forward scrambling to his feet he touched something and screamed in revulsion it was a mangled human ear he staggered to his feet and looked at himself wherever his naked flesh had touched the ground he was covered in a gritty paste of sand and blood he heard the guards shouting behind him and ran how different it was to be here on the arena floor rather than in the imperial box he had watched the days proceedings from the stands with a mixture of grim determination and exalted privilege comfortably remote from what was taking place in the arena below now he found himself in a bizarre landscape of towering crucifixes and human torches surrounded by flames and carnage the blood urine and faeces of dogs and humans littered the sand everywhere he looked he saw fingers and toes and other scraps of flesh left behind by the ravenous hounds a nauseating stench filled his nostrils and hot smoke burned his lungs above the roar of the crowd he heard the screams of those set alight the crackling of burning bodies and the moans of the crucified with the guards at his heels titus rushed headlong towards nero he reached the chariot and threw himself on the ground basking in the approval of the crowd his eyes glittering in the firelight nero registered no surprise at tituss sudden appearance he grinned broadly then threw back his head and laughed he pulled at the reins to stop the horses and waved at the guards to draw back he stepped from the chariot strode to the spot where titus lay gasping on the sand and stooped over to pat him on the head never fear senator pinarius he said caesar will save you weeping with relief titus clutched neros spindly legs thank you thank you caesar the spectators assumed this exchange was part of the entertainment they applauded and roared with laughter at neros satirical demonstration of clemency amid such overwhelming carnage nero is merciful merciful nero someone shouted and the crowd took up the chant nero is merciful merciful nero nero is merciful merciful nero the chant mingled with the shrieking of the human torches titus trembled so violently that he thought he might fly to pieces he wept uncontrollably he had no choice but to remain on his knees he could not stand nero shook his head and clucked his tongue poor pinarius did you not realize your predicament was all a practical joke titus stared up at him baffled a practical joke pinarius that ridiculous family heirloom you insist on wearing gave me the idea where is it by the way dont tell me youve lost it titus pointed mutely to kaeso trapped in the basket atop the nearby pole nero nodded i see you gave it to your twin how appropriate petronius always said it was in very poor taste for you to wear something that looked like a crucifix since everyone knows you have a christian brother how amusing i thought if pinarius should find himself among the christians you you planned for this to happen well not all of it i had no idea youd run out to greet me like this but how perfect truly this is one of those rare fortuitous moments that sometimes happen in the theatre when everything comes together as if by magic but i could have been killed i could have been burned alive oh no you were never in danger i instructed the guards to lay in wait and apprehend you outside the latrina you had to go there sooner or later but not to harm you well no more than they had to to convince you to go with them youve had quite a scare havent you but inducing terror is one of the functions of the theatre aristotle himself says so terror and pity which you will feel soon enough was it not delicious to feel the hot breath of pluto on you and then when all hope was lost to escape unscathed i fear your arsonist brother shall have a different fate cupping tituss chin nero directed his gaze to kaeso with his other arm nero mimed the act of hurling a thunderbolt the pole on which kaeso was trapped burst into flames titus was unable to look away he watched horrified spellbound stupefied never before had he felt the presence of the gods as powerfully as he did in that moment what he felt was beyond words almost too intense to bear this was the place unlike any other where the characters in a tragedy arrived this was the moment of utmost revelation so terrible that a mere mortal could barely endure it what titus felt was wonderful and horrible bursting with meaning and yet utterly absurd it was nero who had brought him to this moment nero who loomed above him smiling serene godlike to have devised this moment nero was without question the greatest of all the poets or playwrights who had ever lived among humankind titus felt again now magnified beyond measure the awe he had experienced when he heard nero sing of burning troy truly nero was divine who but a god could have brought titus to this supreme moment nero gazed down at him and nodded knowingly and when this is done pinarius when the smoke clears and the embers die down we shall retrieve that amulet of yours from your brothers ashes and you must wear it every day yes every hour of every day so that you may never forget this moment ad you are a man now my son you are the heir of the pinarii sometimes the passing of the fascinum has taken place at the death of its wearer sometimes while the wearer is still alive it is my decision to pass it to you now from this moment the fascinum of our ancestors belongs to you titus pinarius was repeating a ceremony that had been enacted by countless generations of the pinarii since a time before history he lifted the necklace with the fascinum over his head and placed it around the neck of his son titus was fifty lucius was twentyone but the mood in the household was not jubilant chrysanthe averted her eyes their three daughters wept hilarion lowered his face and the other slaves followed his example even the wax masks of the ancestors brought into the garden to witness the ceremony seemed melancholy the garden itself was full of colour and fragrance surrounding them with roses and flowering vines like every other part of their splendid new home on the palatine the garden was remarkably spacious and exquisitely maintained a place of beauty and elegance especially on a warm day in the month of junius as one of the emperors most loyal subjects always ready to take the auspices to give him trusted advice and to encourage his endeavours titus had prospered greatly in the last few years thanks to neros generosity he had acquired a considerable fortune and owned properties all over italy the old house on the aventine had begun to seem cramped and antiquated it was a proud day when the pinarii moved into a newly built mansion only a few steps away from the palatine wing of neros golden house titus made ready to leave the house he wore his trabea the same one he had worn long ago when he first joined the college at the invitation of his cousin claudius but the lituus he selected was his secondbest the ancient ivory lituus he had inherited from his father he decided to leave behind are you sure i cant come with you father said lucius there were tears in his eyes no son i want you to stay here your mother and sisters will need you lucius nodded i understand goodbye father goodbye son they embraced then titus embraced and said farewell to each of his three daughters the youngest was ten the eldest sixteen how like their mother they all looked chrysanthe and hilarion followed him to the vestibule hilarion opened the door for him chrysanthe took his hand her voice was choked with emotion is there no chance titus shook his head who can say who knows where the gods will lead me this day he kissed her then drew back and took a deep breath quickly not daring to hesitate he strode out of the house and into the street the last member of his household he saw was hilarion who looked after him from the doorway titus paused and turned back youve served me well hilarion thank you master how old are you hilarion ive never been entirely certain master titus shook his head and smiled however old you are you still look like a boy to me still i suppose if you were a freedman this would be the time for you to think of starting your own family you know that ive left instructions to lucius that you should be manumitted in the event hilarion nodded yes master i know thank you master of course i would expect you to continue to serve lucius hell need a slave a freedman he can trust someone loyal like you with intelligence and good judgement ill always be loyal to the pinarii master good titus cleared his throat well then shall i close the door now master yes hilarion close the door and bar it the door closed titus heard the heavy bar drop into place he turned and walked quickly up the street he passed no one the street was deserted perhaps that was a good sign he reached the nearest entrance to the golden house the one he was accustomed to using almost every day but found it blocked by a massive bronze door titus had never seen the door closed before invariably at any hour he had found the entrance open and guarded by praetorians today there were no guards in sight he raised the heavy bronze knocker on the door and let it drop the sound reverberated up and down the street there was no response he used the knocker several times selfconscious about the noise he was making no one answered he would have to try another entrance probably the closest was the original entrance to the old imperial house the one built by augustus which was now essentially the back entrance the farthest from the grand vestibule of the golden house at the south end of the forum titus had not used that entrance in a long time not all of the rebuilt palatine was taken up by the golden house or by private residences his route took him through an area of shops and taverns that normally catered to a very exclusive clientele the shops were all closed and shuttered but one of the taverns was open and seemed to be doing a good business especially for so early in the day passing by titus heard the drunken patrons inside singing a song motherkiller wifekicker whos sicker than nero burned his city killed his baby crazy maybe nero suddenly a group of men rushed by they looked panicstricken one of them titus recognized as a fellow senator a staunch supporter of the emperor like himself but the man was wearing a common tunic instead of his senatorial toga the man recognized titus and grabbed his arm what in hades are you doing in the street pinarius you should be home with your family or better yet get out of town dont you have a country estate to go to the man hurried on without another word titus saw more people coming up the street they were brandishing clubs and chanting a slogan titus did not stay to hear what they were saying he quickly headed in the opposite direction he passed through empty streets and came to a small square with a public fountain a marble statute of the emperor stood nearby titus groaned someone had put a crude stage wig on the head tilting it askew and tied a sack and a sign around the neck the sign read this actor has earned the sack titus shuddered the sack was the sort into which a convicted parricide was sewn up before being thrown into the tiber to drown it had come to this when had it all gone wrong was it when nero tired of senecas advice dismissed his old tutor and replaced him with the coldblooded insanely suspicious prefect of the praetorian guards tigellinus things had certainly taken a turn for the worse after that or was it when the senatorial conspiracy against nero came to light the bloodshed that followed tore the city apart but what choice did nero have but to ruthlessly suppress the plotters to be sure nero might have flung his net too wide the senator piso and a handful of others were certainly guilty but what about seneca petronius lucan and so many others who had made the court of nero such a vibrant place all were gone now either executed or forced to commit suicide their deaths had been as memorable as their lives and were already the stuff of legend petronius held a lavish banquet then cut his wrists and bound them up so that he could slowly bleed to death while he conversed with his closest friends he was said to be as witty and outspoken as ever that night thumbing his nose at nero by dictating a letter in which he listed all the emperors sexual partners and the intimate details of their couplings his final act as the arbiter of elegance was to seal the letter and send it to nero shortly after the punishment of the christians lucan fell out with nero and was forbidden to publish more poems nevertheless verses attributed to him were widely circulated in which he accused nero of starting the great fire when he was arrested for conspiring with piso lucan was pressed to name accomplices and shamed himself by implicating his mother then took his own life while he bled to death he recited the words of a dying soldier from his poem about the civil war my eyes are opened wide by deaths mark you who go on living do so in the dark the gods keep you blind so that you may endure but i see the truth death is the cure seneca whom many suspected of wanting to replace his protege as emperor spoke bitter words when neros praetorians came for him is this how all my efforts to educate him end all my teaching for this he killed his brother and his mother and now he kills his tutor senecas wife decided to die with him they cut their wrists and lay side by side but death was slow to come seneca took poison hemlock in emulation of socrates but that did not work either finally he was placed in a hot bath to quicken his bleeding and was suffocated by the steam when nero was told that paulina still lived he declared that she had done nothing to harm him and ordered that her wrists should be bandaged paulina survived following the dictates of her husbands will she cremated seneca without funeral rites tigellinuss investigation of the conspiracy became so farflung that titus began to fear suspicion might fall even on him but no one was more loyal to nero than titus the emperor never doubted him as each conspirator was convicted nero confiscated the guilty mans assets by roman law traitors always forfeited their property to the state still the confiscations caused a great deal of grumbling people said that nero convicted wealthy men simply to lay his hands on their estates it was true that nero needed all the money he could get the lavish construction of the golden house and the massive rebuilding of monuments and temples all over roma had sent the emperor deeply into debt people complained when he proposed that the resurrected city should be called neropolis but had he not purchased the right to rename it money that was the problem thought titus if nero still had money he might yet be in control of the city the senate and the empire but all neros money was gone the treasury was empty when titus realized the severity of the situation he had offered to donate his own property to the public coffers a token of his gratitude for all the blessings nero had showered on him nero only laughed even tituss considerable wealth was a pittance compared to neros debts a drop of water in the ocean trouble in the provinces had also taken a toll the bloody uprising of boudica in britannia earlier in neros reign had been summarily dealt with but the revolt that had been going on in judaea for the last two years was more vexatious nero had appointed vespasian to put down the jewish rebellion resistance along the coast and in the northern part of judaea had been quelled but the city of jerusalem a hornets nest of fanatics had so far resisted the roman siege it was in jerusalem that the cult of the christians had originated titus recalled why was that part of the world such a breeding ground for dangerous ideas and so resistant to roman rule there had also been a revolt led by vindex the governor of gaul ostensibly against neros exorbitant taxes the revolt had been suppressed but not before vindexs slanders about neros personal life incited a great deal of prurient speculation across the empire titus sighed as crushing as events in the public sphere had been the pisonian conspiracy the rise of tigellinus and the loss of seneca the decimation of neros inner circle the vast expenditures required by the rebuilding of the burned city the troubles in britannia and judaea and gaul perhaps the most pivotal event of all was the death of poppaea sabina was that when the trouble really began poor nero with his own eyes titus had seen the emperors remorse after the death of poppaea nero had been drinking heavily that night the imperial couple were heard shouting at each other nero flew into a rage no one witnessed what happened but the physician who examined poppaea later told titus that only a kick in the belly could have caused the bleeding that killed both her and her unborn child nero was inconsolable instead of cremating poppaea in the roman way he had her body filled with fragrant spices and embalmed some said that this was in deference to her peculiar religious beliefs but titus thought it was because nero could not bear to see her beauty consumed by flames it was purely by chance one day that titus noticed a boy who might have been poppaeas double the boys name was sporus and he was a servant in the imperial household when titus drew neros attention to the uncanny resemblance nero was instantly infatuated but his attraction was not merely sexual or even romantic nero seemed to think that sporus was linked in some mystical way to poppaea that his dead wife had returned to him in the form of a boy this strange notion became such an obsession that nero induced sporus to undergo castration nero declared that by an act of divine will he had transformed the boy into a girl he called his creation sabina which was poppaeas cognomen in a ceremony that exactly duplicated his wedding with poppaea nero took sporus now sabina as his wife such a thing could never have happened when agrippina or seneca held sway titus took the auspices and tigellinus performed the ritual and from that day forward nero dressed sporus in poppaeas gowns and treated the eunuch in every way as his wife seeing the two of them quarrel at a banquet and then make up and dote on each other titus was sometimes startled by the illusion that poppaea was still among them it seemed to titus that neros transcendence of male and female was yet another manifestation of the emperors divine nature neros appetites were not to be proscribed by the presumed limitations of the mortal body the godemperor could remake a boy into a girl and could even after a fashion resurrect the dead but not everyone possessed tituss delicate insight inevitably cruder minds made the unconventional relationship the butt of jokes if only his father had taken such a wife went one there would never have been a nero titus gazed for a long moment at the desecrated statue of nero beside the little fountain he climbed onto the pedestal intending to remove the ridiculous wig and the parricides sack then heard a group of men coming towards him they sounded drunk and were singing another verse from the ditty he had heard from the tavern performed in greece and took a crown winning clown nero fit for gods is the golden house or fit for a louse nero the men carried clubs of some sort titus could tell because he heard them banging the clubs against the walls of the buildings they passed titus jumped from the pedestal and hurried on it was no use now raking over the past trying to understand how nero had landed in such a mess titus tried to remember the good times the golden house was surely the greatest architectural wonder of the age even if parts of it were still unfinished nero had dared to build a house truly fit for a god to live in a place so beautiful that every vantage point offered a delight to the eye and each of its hundreds of rooms invited visitors to indulge in boundless luxury what parties nero had held there presenting the best and most beautiful performers from every corner of the world offering the most sumptuous banquets and making available the most refined and esoteric of sensual pleasures pain is for mortals nero had said pleasure is divine to be a guest in the golden house was to be a demigod if only for a night the good times in the golden house had been unforgettable but no times had been better than the days of neros grand tour through greece away from the censorious gaze of fusty roman senators and their wives the emperor had performed publicly in the legendary theatres of greece playing the great roles oedipus medea hecuba agamemnon always with titus to take the auspices before his appearances some churlish critics complained that the emperors skills as a singer and actor were mediocre at best despite the many prizes he won vespasian who went along on the tour actually fell asleep during one of neros recitals only a select few like titus were able to appreciate the full range of the emperors brilliance wherever nero appeared the theatre was filled to capacity everyone wanted to see an emperor on the stage for the classic dramas nero declaimed while holding a tragic mask in the ancient greek style for more modern productions when the other actors went barefaced for proprietys sake nero still wore a mask not of a character but of his own face the effect to titus only heightened the drama how strange it was to see a mask of the emperor and to know that the emperor himself was behind it and how strikingly the whole logic of the theatre was reversed by having an emperor on the stage normally the audience felt invisible with the power of their collective gaze focused on one man but who in the audience could feel invisible when the emperor himself might be gazing back at him spectators became spectacle actor became observer theatre had begun as a sacred institution and once upon a time plays were religious rites nero had restored the sanctified power of the theatre making it a truly transcendent experience over and over again titus was awed by the godemperors genius titus at last arrived at the entrance he was seeking the original forecourt built by augustus the armour of the divine augustus was still in place as were the original bronze doors and the marble lintel above them with its relief carving of a laurel crown but to tituss dismay the two laurel trees that flanked the doors which had been there since livia had planted them and had miraculously escaped the great fire were naked and withered he reached for one of the branches the brittle black wood snapped off in his hand a comment titus had once made to nero and poppaea echoed in his head i believe those two laurel trees will survive as long as there are descendants of the divine augustus now the trees were dead titus shuddered more unnerved by the sight of the withered trees than by the roving gangs in the streets the huge bronze doors were shut titus pushed on one of them it was very heavy and at first refused to budge but at last he managed to push it open just far enough to slip through the gap what had once been the vestibule of augustuss modest home was now a garden open to the sky there were cherry trees and grapevines roses and other fragrant flowers and shrubberies shaped to look like animals beyond this garden lay a meadow planted with grass where an artificial stream cascaded down to rocky waterfalls hallways and rooms lay beyond and then more gardens and more rooms as he rambled through the house seeing and hearing no one titus was sometimes inside and sometimes outside to pass from interior to exterior was a kind of magical act in the golden house so perfectly did its design bring the two together inside titus often felt that he was in the heart of nature surrounded by lush paintings of greenery shimmering green mosaic floors bubbling fountains and high windows open to the blue sky outside titus often felt as if he were in the most beautifully furnished room imaginable surrounded by marble columns and ivory lattices sumptuous draperies and furniture made of stone and elegantly wrought metal and strewn with plush cushions decorating both the gardens and the room were a great many statues nero had plundered the whole empire to find enough pieces to decorate his vast house from delphi alone he had taken statues some depicted the gods and some mortals some were quaint and some erotic some were remarkably realistic and others boldly heroic some were new and some old but all were freshly painted so convincingly that they looked as if they might move or speak at any moment the painters who had decorated the golden house were the best in the world along with the statues virtually every wall was painted as were the enormously high ceilings to create borders and frames the painters had used geometric patterns and medallions and images from nature leaves shells flowers while they filled the larger spaces with illustrations that depicted the great stories of mankind and the gods the colours were incredibly rich and vibrant the compositions were exquisite there were so many rooms hundreds of them that titus as often as he visited had never been in the golden house without finding himself in a room he had never seen before filled with paintings entirely new to him each more beautiful than the last equally dazzling were the floors and walls covered in marble and the soaring marble columns there was rich green marble from sparta yellow marble veined with black from numidia and regal porphyry from egypt but these were only the more common types there were colours and patterns of marble in the golden house that titus had never seen anywhere else brought to roma in great quantities and at enormous expense from all over the world many of the floors inside and out were decorated with mosaics beautiful pictures were framed by multiple borders made from dizzying geometric designs the mosaics showed sailors catching fish harvesters at work in fields of grain gladiators in the arena charioteers in the circus scholars in their libraries women dancing priests offering sacrifices children at play the tiles shimmered catching the light at many different angles so that the images seemed to live and breathe beneath ones feet as titus moved from garden to garden from building to building from room to room he was struck by the utter stillness the entire palace seemed deserted the quiet was unnerving at last after descending the stepped terraces on the forum side of the palatine he entered a building and heard a noise from the next room before titus could decide whether to conceal himself a lion came striding towards him through the doorway nero kept an extensive menagerie in one of the gardens at the far side of the golden house at the foot of the esquiline evidently the beast keepers had fled along with everyone else and someone had left the cages open the big cat paused for a moment it stared at titus twitched its whiskers and flicked its tail it was a magnificent specimen with a fine tawny pelt and a magnificent mane titus stood frozen to the spot he felt a bead of sweat trickle down his spine he reached reflexively to touch the fascinum which was not there he had given it to lucius the lion cocked its head shook its mane then appeared to reach a decision it sauntered straight towards him titus resisted the urge to run he had seen condemned criminals run from lions in the arena the result was never good it occurred to him that he might try shouting at the animal to see if he could frighten it but he found himself unable to speak the lion reached him tilted its head forward and rubbed its face against tituss thigh the beast emitted a noise that titus first took for a growl then realized was a purr the lion looked up at him with large eyes then rubbed its face against his other thigh his hand trembling titus dared to touch the lions mane the creature stuck out its long rough tongue and licked his hand slowly titus turned and backed through the doorway keeping his eyes on the lion the creature watched him with a quizzical expression but made no move to follow it threw back its head opened a mouth full of sharp fangs and yawned as soon as he was out of the lions sight titus began to walk very quickly and then to run rounding a corner he collided with a pair of middleaged household slaves the first people he had seen since he had entered the golden house the male slave tumbled onto his backside and dropped the bulging sack he was carrying the sack burst open there was a great deal of clanging as silver cups and plates and serving implements went flying across the marble floor the female slave steadied herself and clutched the bulging makeshift sack she was carrying which appeared to be a bedsheet gathered at the corners the woman stared at titus her eyes wide titus caught his breath before he could speak the female slave blushed a deep red and blurted out polished we were taking them to be polished all the scattered pieces had come to rest except for a small plate with a ringing noise of metal against marble the plate rolled on its edge in an everdecreasing spiral at last it tipped to one side and settled with a rhythmic clatter the pieces of silver gleamed brightly on the floor unsullied by the least hint of tarnish titus ignored the slaves obvious lie where is everyone he asked the woman shrugged gone their separate ways and your master where is the emperor we saw him in the grand courtyard a while back sitting at the foot of the colossus its straight ahead i know where it is said titus he hurried on behind him he heard the two slaves squabbling as they gathered up the scattered silver entering the grand courtyard whether for the first time or for the hundredth inevitably produced a sensation of awe and vertigo everything was beyond human scale the surrounding portico was suitable for giants with soaring marble columns that alternated between black and white as did the oversized marble paving stones underfoot zenodorus had convinced nero that simple black and white would make the most striking yet at the same time the most harmonious showcase for the gigantic gilded statue that stood in the centre of the courtyard towering higher than any other object in sight from the neck down the naked statue with its ideal physique certainly did not resemble nero who had a protruding belly and spindly legs but zenodorus had done a splendid job of capturing neros face which was instantly recognizable even at a great distance the statue represented the emperor in the guise of sol with sunbeams radiating from his head titus spotted four tiny figures at the base of the colossus one of them recognizable by his purpleandgold robes was nero who seemed to be lying flat on his back he was also singing if it could be called that emitting long notes that echoed across the vast courtyard of the three other figures one apparently male was pacing back and forth while the other two a male and a female stood close together talking all three stopped what they were doing and looked up as titus approached peering at him with trepidation eventually titus drew close enough to recognize epaphroditus neros personal secretary and sporus with whom he had been conferring the pacing figure was one of neros most trusted freedman phaon the three of them recognized titus and sighed with relief at their feet lay nero two metal plates fastened together by leather straps lay across his chest he was holding a note for as long as he could practising a lungstrengthening exercise his breath smelled of onions when nero was in training for a singing contest he ate a special diet consisting of olive oil for his throat and onions to clear his nose and open his lungs titus looked up at the colossus and then down at the prostrate nero how large one was and how small the other the note nero was singing went on and on until at last his lungs gave out and he drew a deep breath defying the metal plates on his chest when his lungs were full with his chest raised high in the air nero began to sing another note higher than the last titus looked at neros companions epaphroditus was a highly educated greek freedman clean shaven with a touch of grey at his temples as a reward for his key role in uncovering the conspiracy of piso epaphroditus had been made neros personal secretary and chamberlain of the court no one knew more about the daytoday operations of the golden house than epaphroditus and within the immensely complex imperial bureaucracy nothing of consequence could be accomplished without his knowledge and approval he was a student of philosophy and famous for remaining calm in a crisis sporuss hair and makeup and elegant stola made him look uncannily like poppaea so did his posture as he stood with one foot slightly in front of the other hands on hips and chin held high but when sporus turned his head titus saw that the eunuch had an ugly bruise across one cheek sporus saw titus looking touched the bruise and averted his face pacing rapidly back and forth the freedman phaon seemed to be at his wits end he was younger than epaphroditus but his rise under nero had been rapid for his loyal services nero had rewarded phaon with many choice properties including an estate near the city off the road to nomentum the longheld note trailed into silence as neros lungs were once again exhausted titus thought the emperor might pause in his exercises to give him some sign of acknowledgement but instead nero took a deep breath heaving against the metal plates and produced another note this one very low titus heard someone running towards them even before he turned to look he knew from the irregular footsteps that it must be epictetus a slave owned by epaphroditus epictetus was lame in one leg and walked with a limp compelled to run he assumed an awkward loping gait the slave was barely old enough to grow a beard which he wore long and untrimmed in the manner of philosophers and pedagogues epictetus reached them and struggled to catch his breath he was not used to running nero appeared to take no notice he finished the note and began to fill his lungs again caesar said epaphroditus the slave may have news perhaps you should take a break from your exercises nero rolled his eyes up to look at epaphroditus he undid the leather fasteners holding the metal plates which fell to the marble paving stones with a clatter he sprang to his feet his eyes glittered he grinned broadly titus did not know what to make of the emperors ebullient mood perhaps it was a side effect of his breathing exercises well then what news said nero has someone chopped off the old goats head yet the old goat he referred to was servius sulpicius galba the governor of spain who was marching on roma with his legions galba was in his sixties tall blueeyed craggyfaced and completely bald in many ways he was the exact opposite of nero a parsimonious military man with a dislike of pomp and ostentation and a reputation as a ruthless disciplinarian when caligula was murdered some in the senate had favoured galba then an energetic military man in his prime as his successor but galba had declined to put himself forward and loyally served claudius then as neros authority had crumbled with no one from augustuss family in line for succession galbas supporters convinced him that his time had come his open bid for power and the news that he was marching on the city had caused chaos in roma epictetus leaned on his walking stick he reached down to massage his lame leg ive come from the senate caesar theyre debating what to do about galba i listened to some of the speeches yes nero raised an eyebrow the news is not good caesar what do you mean is there no one who supports me some but your supporters were drowned out by the rest the sentiment for galba is strong nero shook his head and what about my praetorians what is tigellinus doing to deal with the situation tigellinus is loyal to me and the praetorians are loyal to tigellinus epictetus exchanged uncomfortable looks with his master epaphroditus pursed his lips and spoke we dont know where tigellinus is caesar ive sent messengers and the messengers cant find him we dont know the messengers dont come back caesar we talked about all this yesterday yes yes i remember well if tigellinus has run off where is his fellow prefect nymphidius sabinus epaphroditus looked to epictetus who reluctantly spoke again nymphidius has openly declared his support for galba the praetorians seem willing to follow his lead what impossible nymphidius is a kinsman of poppaea he would never betray her what can he be thinking nero looked at sporus and appeared confused titus frowned had the emperor come to believe that the eunuch was literally his dead wife nero abruptly began to weep my praetorians so brave so loyal how have they been corrupted what is to become of neropolis with no one to defend it what will become of the golden house nero turned his back on them drew back his shoulders and took a deep breath when he turned back his smile had returned its a good thing that ive been strengthening my voice one way or another i shall be called on to use it he looked from one long face to the next why do you all have such sour expressions why are you staring at me like that we are waiting to hear what caesar plans to do next said epaphroditus isnt it obvious i must appear before the common people the citizens of neropolis for whom ive built new homes and baths and theatres my beloved children upon whom ive showered so many lavish festivals and entertainments the people love me theyre grateful for all ive done for them they delight in the beauty and joy ive given them as an artist its only the senators who hate me all those little galbas with their narrow minds and their spiteful jealousy and their hatred for beauty and culture what do you think should i send out criers to call a public meeting ill dress myself all in black and mount the rostra to address the people ill tear my hair weep and wail remind them of all the love ive shown them plead for their help in my hour of need i shall have to call upon all my skills as a tragic actor perhaps i shall model my performance on antigone or andromache i shall move them to terror and pity terror and pity that will rally the people to my side i think said epaphroditus speaking carefully that the mood in the city is far too uncertain to be sure of the peoples reaction to such an address what hes trying to say is that the mob is likely to tear you limb from limb said sporus speaking at last he stood apart from the rest and kept the bruised side of his face turned from them even the intonation of his voice was uncannily like that of poppaea nero blanched then stiffened his jaw and glared at sporus who stared back at him nero blinked first he swallowed hard tear me limb from limb he whispered very well if i cant count on the people to protect me then ill negotiate with the senate not directly of course caesar does not deal directly with his inferiors he furrowed his brow then looked at titus and smiled youre awfully good at this sort of thing pinarius i remember that day you spoke before the senate on behalf of all those slaves it took nerve to do that you were so eloquent so passionate if you were to speak for me titus flushed his mouth was dry caesar the slaves for whom i begged mercy were all crucified he said nero blinked ah yes so they were well i suppose the negotiations can be done by letter you can frame the terms for me epaphroditus what if i were to agree to step down as emperor without protest and in return the senate makes me governor of egypt the egyptians love the greek culture handed down to them by the ptolemies the egyptians would appreciate my talents thats where i should go to alexandria theyll love me there what do you think sabina he turned to sporus how would you like to sail up the nile with me on a barge as cleopatra did with the divine julius sporus kept his face in profile staring into the middle distance epaphroditus assumed a pained expression caesar even if the senate could be persuaded to grant you the prefecture of egypt which i doubt i find it highly unlikely that galba would agree to such an arrangement the nile grain trade is essential to the roman economy and the prefecture of egypt has always been under the direct control of the emperor yes yes i see your point said nero well then what if i simply ask for safe passage to alexandria i dont have to be the governor i suppose i can make my living as an actor or playing the lyre epaphroditus grimaced caesar cannot seriously suggest but i would no longer be caesar shouted nero more exasperated than angry thats the point i would be free of all these endless tedious rules of decorum i would be my own man at last or do you doubt that i could support myself by my talents is that your worry are you forgetting all the garlands and prizes i won in greece almost two thousand epaphroditus no other performer in the history of the world ever achieved such a thing and it wasnt just the judges who loved me do you remember how they applauded me at olympia and the ovation i received at the isthmian games sweet memories nero sighed and wiped a tear from his eye i should think the alexandrians would be quite excited to receive the most famous actor in the world into their midst the whole city will turn out for my debut what should i perform something to please the locals i think what is that play where odysseus is shipwrecked and finds helen living in a palace up the nile we could perform it on the actual locations but which of the leading roles would suit me best everyone loves wily odysseus but helen is the one who flees from a burning city and finds herself in a strange land a goddess among crocodiles so perhaps i should play helen sporus let out a shriek of nervous laughter and slapped his hand over his mouth epaphroditus groaned epictetus fretfully rubbed his lame leg the freedman phaon recommenced his nervous pacing titus averted his eyes and found himself gazing up at the colossus from such a low angle the immense statue was hardly recognizable as a human figure it loomed like a weird monstrous image from a nightmare nero observed their reactions and frowned he was quiet for a long moment then threw up his hands very well then ill abandon my art and rely on state craft shall we proceed directly to the last resort ill go to the parthians as a suppliant why not i shall give myself up to the only other empire on earth that can rival that of roma the greeks and persians used to do that sort of thing didnt they when one of their leaders was deposed hed flee across the border and throw himself on the mercy of his enemy who better than a foreign rival to understand and sympathize with my plight if im lucky the parthians may even help me return to power that would make me beholden to a foreign king not an ideal circumstance but if it means i can return to the golden house ill do it what do you think epaphroditus titus expected the chamberlain to deliver another pained objection but epaphroditus seemed to take this notion more seriously than the others if caesar is finally ready to leave roma and the golden house for some safer destination then yes i would advise caesar to consider approaching the parthians but theres very little time we have no reliable intelligence about galbas position he may be only days away the senate even now may be voting on a resolution to proclaim galba emperor and if nymphidius and the praetorians decide to support such a move they may take action at any time action said nero epaphroditus cleared his throat caesar i am thinking of the fate of your uncle the words sent a chill through them all the death of caligula at the hands of treacherous praetorians had been much on everyones mind lately but such a journey would require a great deal of preparation said nero tapping a forefinger against his lips do you remember the size of my retinue when we travelled through greece you kept advising me to cut back epaphroditus yet we found it was impossible for me to travel with fewer than a thousand attendants feeding and providing accommodations for all those people but that was because you were performing almost every night and providing banquets to the festival organizers said epaphroditus the journey were now contemplating would be a very different affair the fewer the people who accompany you the better indeed it may be advisable for caesar to travel incognito incognito unknown said nero i dont like the sound of that think of it as a role caesar think of wily odysseus on the occasion of his homecoming when he assumed the guise of a lowly vagrant to outsmart the suitors of penelope nero nodded thoughtfully ah yes i see your point dressed in tatters even caesar will be invisible to his enemies suddenly he broke into song and to odysseus in his rags athena came why do you fret here is your home and there your lady and your son as fine a son as any son could be while the emperor sang lines from homer titus took epaphroditus by the arm and spoke in his ear has it come to this is there no choice but to flee the chamberlain grunted ive been trying to steer him to this choice for days so far hes refused to leave the golden house he says hed rather die and he seems to mean it at least sometimes yesterday he actually sent for one of his favourite gladiators to put an end to him but the man disappeared when he heard what caesar wanted then he called for some poison which he apparently obtained behind my back but the slaves ran off with the stuff rather than bring it to him but is it possible to flee said titus are there horses available is there a ship for him at ostia not at ostia not any more but it might be possible to cross the mountains and make our way down to brundisium and hire a ship there taking the route pompeius took when the divine julius crossed the rubicon he would need to be incognito as i said we would all need to disguise ourselves if caesar can be made to see the necessity and if he can endure the hardships but is his life truly in danger has it come to this titus suddenly felt as nero must have felt pushed to the limit and desperate to defy epaphrodituss unassailable logic i realize that caligula was killed by praetorians but those were conspirators who plotted in secret and claudius later put those conspirators to death would anyone dare to do the same to nero they wont have to plot in secret caesars fate is being discussed openly in the senate right now and do you seriously believe the senate would dare to impose a death sentence on the rightful emperor the heir of augustus would a majority of senators vote to set such a precedent epaphroditus shook his head the problem is that we have no precedent for an emperor to voluntarily relinquish his position augustus tiberius caligula claudius all of them died in power yes caesar has his adherents among the senators and some of those men are attempting even now to negotiate a way for caesar to cede his office to galba without bloodshed but the prospects are slim even if the debate should produce an acceptable outcome caesar should flee to some safe haven in the meantime eureka cried nero abruptly abandoning his song if i may quote archimedes we know how he ended mumbled phaon still fretfully pacing in a pool of blood on the beach at syracuse nero did not hear it occurs to me that we are overlooking the obvious i should make my appeal not to the senate not to the people but directly to the legions epaphroditus sighed unfortunately caesar we have lost the allegiance of the troops in gaul and of those in greece as well you may recall that we discussed this earlier i mean the legions under galba the ones marching this way from spain epaphroditus cocked his head and raised an eyebrow just because those troops are obeying orders from a rebel commander said nero that is no reason to assume that the soldiers themselves no longer love their emperor what if i were to make my appeal directly to them yes what if we gather a theatrical troupe go out to meet the legions put up a stage and i deliver the performance of my life when they see me next to that shrivelled corpse galba the choice will be obvious what do you say nero looked from face to face no one responded but his enthusiasm was undaunted the soldiers will want to see me play a warrior naturally what do you think would they prefer to see me as hercules or as ajax hercules is more majestic of course but ajax is more tragic and thus more sympathetic and its a better singing role nine times out of ten its the voice that wins over the audience ah but as hercules i could kill the nemean lion as you know epaphroditus ive been training for that performance for quite a while the last time i rehearsed with the tame lion everything came off without a hitch the beast was practically licking my nose it will be a shame to kill it but its the authenticity of such a performance that makes it so riveting i pretend to wrestle the lion i release a bit of fake blood to make it look as though ive been scratched across the back and the face the spectators gasp convinced that i may be mauled to death at any moment and then in a glorious turnabout i slay the creature and raise my arms in triumph killing it with my bare hands would be best but i dont think even that tame beast would allow me to crush it between my arms i suppose i shall have to use a club well what do you all think i invoke the divine spirit of hercules place my life in his keeping engage in a deathdefying struggle and then right before the soldiers eyes i kill the most dangerous creature on earth well does anyone here seriously think those soldiers are going raise a hand against me the others exchanged uncertain glances the idea was absurd and yet neros enthusiasm was compelling could such a mad gamble actually turn the tide of events titus cleared his throat there may be a problem he said quietly i think the lion youre referring to may have escaped escaped cried nero i saw such a creature wandering though the golden house he licked my hand sporus nodded someone opened all the cages in the menagerie this morning zebras and monkeys are wandering all over the place crocodiles are loose in the lake then we shall have to catch the lion and put it back in its cage insisted nero where is the lion trainer and how many stagehands will we need to transport the stage props and put on a show oh and there must be someone to help me select my wardrobe caesar i think we should revert to your previous idea said epaphroditus quietly but firmly we must escape the city at once the fire in neros eyes flickered then went out his shoulders slumped he let out a low moan and lowered his face sporus sighed and smiled sadly he stepped to nero and moved to embrace him nero jerked back and slapped the eunuch across the face sporus touched his stinging cheek and broke into tears he staggered back the slave epictetus rushed to him almost falling but managed to catch him and steady him with an arm around his shoulders phaon abruptly stopped pacing epaphroditus is right we must flee the city at once no more hesitation no more crazy ideas but where will we go said nero quietly to start we can go to my estate off the road to nomentum said phaon its only a few miles past the colline gate nero brightened that will take us right by the praetorian barracks when the soldiers see me we can gauge their reaction almost certainly but caesar will be incognito epaphroditus reminded him ah yes nero was crestfallen again he seemed to hesitate epaphroditus groaned phaon threw up his arms epictetus was still comforting sporus pinarius cried nero startling them all its up to you now titus shook his head caesar i dont understand youve taken the auspices for me on many occasions you must take them once again shall i stay or shall i go we must seek the judgement of the gods titus reached into his trabea and brought forth his lituus he was afraid nero would see that it was his secondbest but the emperor seemed not to notice within the vast courtyard titus had a great deal of open sky to choose from he stepped a little away from the others into the long shadow cast by the towering colossus and delineated a portion of the heavens with his lituus the simple dignity and the lifelong familiarity of the act calmed him and steadied his nerves he remembered who and what he was a citizen of roma a patrician the descendant of one the citys most ancient families blood kin to the divine julius and the divine augustus an augur trained to divine the will of the gods the son of lucius pinarius and the father of lucius pinarius the bearer for most of his life of the ancient fascinum the friend and confidant of the emperor titus watched the sky he saw nothing not a bird not a cloud not a leaf carried on the faint breeze the gods were mute to titus it seemed that the silence of the heavens was itself a message the gods had abandoned nero titus felt a chill followed by a flush of anger then a surge of pride the gods in their fickleness might betray their favourite but titus never would he turned to nero you must do as epaphroditus and phaon suggest you must flee the city at once nero gazed at the terraces and rooftops of the golden house then looked up at the colossus he squinted the light glinting off the radiant crown of gilded sunbeams was blinding youll come with me pinarius it was a question not an order titus was touched of course caesar and you epaphroditus and you phaon and of course you sabina dear sabina nero opened his arms wide sporus hesitated for a moment then extricated himself from the encircling arm of epictetus he walked to nero with eyes downcast and allowed himself to be embraced nero tenderly touched his fingertips to the bruises on the eunuchs face and stroked his golden hair epictetus went to the slave quarters to fetch clothing the others retired to a private chamber off the courtyard behind a screen nero stripped off his purpleandgold robes and removed his jewelencrusted slippers titus took off his trabea epaphroditus and phaon shed the elegant robes that marked them as freedmen of the imperial household sporus with a womans modesty went to another room to remove his stola and makeup and to let down his hair epictetus arrived with their clothing nero made a face at the sight of the patched tunic the faded cloak and the flimsy shoes he was expected to wear and seemed about to change his mind then he laughed i shall pretend were doing plautus the pot of gold perhaps with myself as the downtrodden slave comedy is a stretch for me tragedy is my strength but an artist must be willing to expand his repertoire the coarse woolen tunic felt scratchy against tituss skin he shuddered at the thought that nero was being subjected to the indignity of wearing such clothes but took strength from the emperors indomitable sense of humour sporus appeared in a plain tunic and with the makeup scrubbed from his face and the pins removed from his hair he looked as much like a boy as a girl despite his long blonde tresses epictetus put a hooded cloak over the eunuchs shoulders sporus pulled the hood over his head concealing his hair and obscuring his face epictetus brought horses from the stable the best had been taken already and others had wandered off tituss heart sank at the sight of the nag he was expected to ride but nero laughed mounts to suit our disguises he said who would recognize the worlds greatest charioteer sitting astride such a pathetic creature still caesar i think you should hide your face said epaphroditus epictetus produced a cloth and tied it around neros head pulling it low over his forehead to shadow his eyes youll have me wearing an eye patch next said nero epictetus had also brought daggers for each of them when the slave handed one of the weapons to nero careful to select the best the emperor stared at the dagger with a strange expression then threw it to the ground and refused to look at it again epaphroditus gave orders to epictetus to stay behind and listen for news of galbas progress and the outcome of the senates debate as soon as you know anything of importance follow after us as quickly as you can come yourself no one else can be trusted the slave shambled off limping badly nero barked out a laugh a lame messenger surely this is a comedy for no tragic playwright would resort to such a stale device well let us be off they mounted their horses such as they were and set out with phaon leading the way titus decided to bring up the rear he had to wait for sporus who lingered behind looking over his shoulder at epictetus until the limping slave disappeared from sight the streets were deserted except for a few skulking loners and roving groups of drunkards whom they saw at a distance titus frequently looked over his shoulder but saw no sign that they were being followed behind them the colossal statue of nero dominated the skyline but grew smaller and smaller as they made their way to the colline gate a few soldiers were manning the wall but paid no attention to the ragged group as they rode out of the city the route took them past the praetorian garrison outside the walls discipline had vanished outside the garrison soldiers sat on the ground in small groups some in full armour and others stripped to their tunics talking drinking and throwing dice the men looked up as neros little entourage passed by but took no notice suddenly the earth beneath them shook tituss mount shied and whinnied the soldiers sitting on the ground felt the tremor more acutely than the party on horseback some of them scrambled to their feet only to be thrown down again by the violent shaking as abruptly as it had begun the earthquake ended titus regained control of his mount he saw that sporus was having trouble with his horse and rode alongside to help him one of the nearby soldiers cursed numas balls look at the dice i swear the ones i just threw were all different but now theyre all ones another soldier laughed what a fool you are marcus do you think the gods sent an earthquake just to turn your venus throw to dogs that was a sign from the heavens alright but it wasnt meant for you who for then for nero i reckon theyve had enough of that scoundrel maybe that tremor sent that huge statue of him tumbling to the ground and the rest of the socalled golden house with it quiet gnaeus you talking about the emperor not emperor for much longer i reckon the soldier drew the edge of his hand across his throat and made a slicing noise titus looked at nero who was still struggling to calm his mount the emperors face was obscured by the rag around his head but for an instant titus glimpsed neros eyes wide with alarm and knew that he must have overheard galbas emperor now or as good as the soldier went on addressing his comrades i say screw the motherkiller and screw that pretty boy whose balls he cut off ha youd like to i bet someone yelled and the men all laughed nero regained control of his mount phaon rode on leading them at a quicker pace a little later they met a roughlooking group of twenty or so men on horseback heading towards the city neros party pulled to one side of the road to allow the larger group to pass the horses were as gaunt as their own and the men were even more shabbily dressed one of them taking phaon to be their leader called to him what news from the city phaon did not answer well stranger said the man is nero still alive the emperor lives phaon said good then were still in time to join the hunt the man and his companions laughed some brandished daggers others held up clubs and lengths of rope they say therell be good sport when the senate outlaws nero and all his rotten crew you fellows are riding the wrong way youll miss the fun nero swayed on his horse as if he might faint titus reached out to steady him with a hand on his shoulder the group passed by phaon set out again leading them onwards they came to the anio river coming towards them across the bridge was a single praetorian guard from his sleek horse the satchels he carried and the fact that he rode alone titus took him to be a messenger just as the praetorian cleared the bridge and passed them neros mount took fright at a dead body that lay by the road the corpse was fresh blood streamed from a wound on the head that gang heading into the city must have just killed him whispered titus appalled the emperors horse reared nero managed to control the beast but the cloth around his head came undone and fell to the ground the praetorian pausing to see what was the matter took a look at him and went pale the young soldier looked utterly confused for a moment then stiffened gave nero a salute and shouted caesar nero gazed back at him reflexively raising his arm to acknowledge the salute the praetorian reined his horse he stared at the body on the ground then at nero and his ragtag entourage then again at the dead body ride on praetorian said nero his voice shook the man hesitated if caesar needs assistance ride on i said the praetorian kicked his heels against his mount and departed hes headed towards the garrison said epaphroditus we should have asked to see the messages he carries he might have news about galba he recognized me said nero his voice shrill we should have killed him theres not a man among us capable of taking on an armed praetorian said sporus under his breath nero looked down at the dead body the man had been of middle age and was well dressed if that wretched gang murdered him did they do it just to rob him or did they kill him because he spoke up for me were not far from my estate caesar said phaon we should ride on at once they crossed the bridge phaon led them off the main road and onto a narrow wooded path saying he thought it best if they approached the estate from the back way and took shelter in one of the remote outbuildings so that even his slaves wouldnt know they were there eventually they came to the doorless windowless back wall of a building turning around to take in the view titus saw why phaon had chosen this property as one of his rewards from the emperor the site was pleasant secluded and quiet with a lovely view over the wooded plains of the tiber the skyline of the city could be seen in the distance despite the earthquake the colossus still stood its radiant crown glinting in the afternoon sunlight looking at this distance like a childs toy phaon told them to stay behind while he took a look around the corner of the building after a moment he returned its as i thought he said this is the old disused slave quarters its some distance from the rest of the estate up the hill but the ground has been cleared from here on and the front of the building is completely exposed theres no way to enter through the front door without the risk of being seen by someone from the main house higher up i need to rest cried nero phaon thought for a moment this is an old building the walls are thin we can break through the back wall it may take a while and we might make some noise in case someone hears and comes to have a look its best if they dont see you caesar theres an old sandpit just over there with shade if caesar would like to rest there no not a pit i wont be underground not yet while the others found a loose plank and pulled at it nero wandered down the hill to a little pond he knelt scooped up some brackish water and sipped it titus heard him cry out is this my special water in the golden house the emperor was used to drinking only distilled water cooled in snow nero sat on the ground from the expression on his face titus might have thought he was weeping but no tears ran down the emperors ruddy cheeks it was almost as if nero were feigning despondency like a mime practising a facial expression the plank came loose and without too much effort they managed to make a hole in the rear wall phaon went through to have a look then gestured for the others to follow nero went first getting on all fours to crawl through the passage they found themselves in a dusty little room with only a few stools for furniture and a sack stuffed with mouldering old straw for a bed a short hallway led to a little vestibule not surprisingly for slave quarters the door had no lock on the inside not even a bar that could be dropped into place a small window covered by a tattered cloth provided light looking through a hole in the cloth titus saw a dirt courtyard a grassy slope and a bit of the main house farther up the hill how elegant the place looked with its redtile roof and its yellowmarble columns surrounded by stately cypress trees and blooming rose bushes and hedges pruned in the shapes of obelisks cubes and spheres nero sat on the bed with his back against the wall he began to weep in earnest sobbing until his face was wet with tears weep with me sabina he cried lament for me and tear out your hair like a good wife sporus obligingly began to sweep the filthy floor with his unbound tresses and to make a keening noise caesar theres no need to give up hope said epaphroditus quietly not yet you think i weep for myself but i dont said nero i weep for those who will never see me on the stage what an artist the world is losing titus sat on one of the stools he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes exhausted his consciousness came and went the afternoon wore on but time seemed to come to a stop the whole world contracted to the dismal little room in which he found himself phaon produced some bread and water nero sipped a bit of the water but did not eat he told them that they should begin to dig a grave for him so as to hide his body from his enemies otherwise theyll cut off my head and take it back to roma to prove to everyone im dead dont let them cut off my head epaphroditus that will not happen caesar i swear to you that will not happen better yet you must burn me bring water to wash my corpse gather firewood to make the pyre not yet caesar whispered epaphroditus wearily closing his eyes not yet rest sleep if you can night will come and then another day titus dozed he was awakened by a stirring in the room the others were crowded together at the window gazing out in alarm the room was dim it was the last hour before sunset titus joined the others and peered with bleary eyes beyond the torn curtain long shadows lay across the dirt courtyard in front of the building slanting sunlight pierced the clouds of dust stirred by a lone horseman by his long full beard titus saw that the horseman was epictetus before anyone else could react sporus rushed to the front door opened it and went outside the eunuch ran up to epictetus while he was still on horseback the two exchanged words from the window titus strained to hear what they were saying but he could not make out the words epictetus dismounted his bad leg failed him and he fell grimacing he got to his feet looked about for a place to tie his mount then clutched his leg stumbled and fell again meanwhile sporus ran inside how did he find us asked phaon he asked at the main house the slaves knew nothing but someone suggested he try this building what news said epaphroditus sporus looked at nero and seemed afraid to speak what news cried nero the senate took a vote yes neros voice was shrill they declared galba emperor nero gasped and me what of me the senate declared you to be a public enemy sporus averted his eyes they say they say youre to be put to death in the ancient manner the ancient manner said nero thats was what epictetus told me what in hades does that mean what does it mean epaphroditus cried nero epaphroditus did not answer it was titus who spoke his voice sounded hollow in his ears the ancient manner refers to a specific means of execution devised by our ancestors the victim is paraded before the people and publicly stripped nero let out a cry when he is naked his neck is fastened in a twopronged pitchfork so that he can be driven this way and that or held in place continued titus men with rods beat him until no nero trembled from head to foot his eyes were wide with terror strangely titus did not share the emperors fear he felt something very different he was experiencing the extreme sense of wonder and revelation that had come to him when he heard nero sing of troy above the burning ruins of roma and again when he was made to witness his brother set aflame caesar do you not see this is the fate the gods have intended for you all along what are you saying pinarius what greater role could there be for the greatest of all actors you will be the fallen hero the godemperor made to suffer the most terrible and disgraceful of deaths your execution will take place with all roma watching everyone in the city will see you naked everyone will see you suffer and bleed everyone will see you soil yourself and weep and beg for mercy everyone will see you die no one will ever forget the end of nero your public execution will be the crowning per formance of a lifetime nero stared back at him his mouth agape for a moment he seemed to seriously consider what titus had said he slowly nodded then he shuddered and staggered back shaking his head and waving his hands before his face madness what you say is madness pinarius suddenly nero froze he looked down at his right arm and gripped it with his left hand where is it he shrieked what caesar said epaphroditus my bracelet where is the golden bracelet my mother gave me the amulet that holds my lucky snakeskin do you not remember said epaphroditus caesar cast it away long ago caesar declared it was hateful to him after the death of his mother nero gazed at epaphroditus baffled then gave a start from the dusty courtyard came the sound of rumbling hoofbeats they gazed out the window the men arriving on horseback were armed praetorians they must have followed epictetus whispered phaon he set about gathering up the stools and bits of debris from the hole in the wall stacking everything he could find against the door in an effort to block it the praetorians quickly dismounted some of them seized epictetus as he tried to limp away from them one of them studied the building for a moment then drew his sword and began to walk towards the entrance sporus pulled at his hair and wailed his shrill cries caused hackles to rise on the back of tituss neck he gazed at nero suddenly he saw not a god not a genius but a mere mortal pitiful and afraid nero ran to epaphroditus give me your dagger quickly epaphroditus handed him the knife nero held the point to his breast then hesitated he looked at the others will one of you not kill yourself first to give me courage sporus continued to wail the others stood frozen to the spot from the vestibule they heard the praetorian bang the pommel of his sword against the door jupiter what an artist perishes in me cried nero he pushed the dagger into his belly but he could not drive it all the way blood stained his coarse tunic as he fell to the ground he writhed in agony help me he whimpered epaphroditus knelt beside him his eyes glistened with tears but his hands were steady he rolled nero onto his back and pulled the dagger from his belly he placed the dagger above neros heart gathered his strength and drove the blade deep into the flesh nero convulsed blood flowed from his mouth and his nostrils the praetorian pushed open the door scattering the stools stacked against it he paused for a moment in the vestibule to let his eyes adjust to the dim light then rushed into the room titus recognized the young messenger they had met at the bridge the shocked expression on his face made him look almost childlike the praetorian pulled off his cloak and threw it over neros bleeding wounds he knelt beside the emperor too late nero gasped taking the soldiers hand too late my faithful warrior the emperor writhed vomited more blood clenched his teeth and then suddenly went stiff his glassy eyes were wide open his mouth was fixed in a bloody grimace so awful that even the praetorian shuddered and everyone in the room looked away everyone except titus who stared spellbound at the agonized face of nero to titus the horror of the moment was exquisite beyond bearing even seneca at his goriest had never contrived a scene to rival this neros end had been unspeakably tawdry and pathetic watching titus had been moved to uttermost terror and pity even in the instant of death nero had played the actor making his face into a mask that could have made a strong man faint nero had been right and titus had been wrong a public execution in the ancient manner would have been gaudy and overstated an unseemly waste of neros talents before an audience unworthy of his genius instead neros end had been a private performance played out before the eyes of a privileged few titus felt honoured beyond measure to have witnessed the final scene of the greatest artist who had ever lived titus looked at the others in the room epaphroditus phaon and sporus were mere freedmen and courtiers and might yet hope to escape execution but titus was a senator and as an augur he had declared divine approval for neros every action with nero dead titus had no doubt that he would be tried and executed if that were to happen his family would be disinherited disgraced and driven from roma only if titus were to die by his own hand might his wife and son and daughters hope to escape retribution titus gripped epaphroditus by the wrist make a vow epaphroditus swear by neros shade if you survive this day promise me youll do all you can to look after lucius my son overwhelmed by emotion and unable to speak epaphroditus could only nod more praetorians came rushing into the little room their swords drawn before they could reach him titus pulled out his dagger and plunged it into his chest part iii lucius the seeker ad lucius pinarius sighed if only otho were still alive and mperor you were able to twist otho around your little finger sporus wearing an elegant silk robe made only a grunt for an answer she for lucius always thought of sporus as she and sporus preferred to be addressed as a woman stretched with feline grace on the couch next to lucius side by side the two friends gazed up at the elaborate scene painted on the ceiling its vivid colours softened by the slanting winter sunlight the scene depicted the abduction of ganymede by jupiter the naked beautiful youth was clutching a toy hoop in one hand and a cockerel jupiters courtship gift in the other while the king of the gods stood with muscular arms spread ready to make himself into an eagle to carry the object of his desire to olympus is there a prettier room in all the golden house said sporus i love these apartments dont you id love them more if i were only a visitor and epaphroditus would agree to let me to return to my own house and family said lucius hes only doing what he thinks is best for you he made a promise to your father to look after you i witnessed the vow if epaphroditus says youre safer living here then you should be glad he still has these apartments despite all the changes and gladder still that he has space for you besides if you were no longer here i should grow awfully lonely without you lucius lucius smiled a year and a half ago we hardly knew each other a year and a half ago many things were different nero still lived imagine that a world grand enough to contain nero in it nero was too big for this world galba was too little galba might still be emperor if he had paid the praetorians what he owed them galba was a bore declared sporus a miser and a bore his reign was seven months of misery for everyone including himself the soldiers were right to kill the old fool and right to make otho emperor in his place it was almost as if nero had come back to us sporus sighed once upon a time back in the golden days otho and nero were best friends you know their parties and drinking bouts were legendary nero told me otho was like an older brother to him though he flattered himself if he thought there was any physical resemblance otho was so good looking and what a body he had it was poppaea who came between them otho was married to her nero had to have her poor otho was forced to divorce poppaea and head off to spain and when the soldiers got rid of galba otho was their choice to succeed him because the people were already nostalgic for nero and otho was the closest thing to nero they could find he was only thirtyseven he could have ruled for a long long time he took neros name he restored the statues of nero that had been pulled down he announced his intention to complete the parts of the golden house still under construction on an even grander scale than nero intended the bricklayers and artisans in roma loved hearing that said lucius in every way otho seemed ready to rule just as nero had done and ready to love as nero had loved sporus sighed and nodded yes dear otho because i looked like her of course i remember the first time he saw me it was in these apartments he came to see epaphroditus with some question about the household staff otho saw me across the room he looked as if hed been struck as if he might fall i could see his knees trembling his tunic was short enough to show his knees otho loved to show off his legs and with good reason he had the legs of a mountaineer as smooth and firm as if theyd been carved from marble thighs like tree trunks calves like please sporus thats enough about othos legs lucius laughed sporus smiled it didnt take us long to get acquainted you dragged him straight to your bed you mean it was his bed we slept in though i dont recall sleeping it was like the night the divine julius met queen cleopatra in alexandria love at first sight or lust perhaps sometimes lust comes first and love later in private he called me sabina just as nero did sporus frowned sometimes i wonder what my life would have been like if i hadnt looked so much like her what a strange destiny the gods laid out for me ah well it doesnt bear thinking about a wistful expression crossed the eunuchs face lucius had seen it before and epaphroditus had once explained it to him that is the look sporus gets when she thinks about her longlost testes otho had reigned for only ninetyfive days many of those days had been spent away from roma mustering troops and preparing for the invasion of aulus vitellius the governor of lower germania who had been proclaimed emperor by his own troops otho took to the field against vitellius in northern italy but before the campaign could begin in earnest otho killed himself why everyone in roma had asked that question otho had every chance of winning against vitellius but instead chose to die in his tent on the eve of battle his friends said that otho killed himself to save roma from civil war lucius could hardly imagine such an act of selfsacrifice especially from a man who had been hailed as a second nero but the story was repeated so often and so fervently that othos suicide for the sake of roma had already become the stuff of legend otho might have hoped to give the city a respite from bloodshed and upheaval but his death and the unopposed succession of vitellius accomplished just the opposite the new emperor arrived in roma at the head of a licentious and bloodthirsty army and the city became the scene of riot and massacre gladiator shows and extravagant feasting to reward his victorious legionaries vitellius disbanded the existing praetorian guard and installed his own men under galba and otho a few brave voices in the senate had spoken up for a return to republican government vitelliuss reign of terror silenced all opposition physically the new emperor was the opposite of the statuesque otho he was grotesquely obese apparently he had not always been unattractive rumour had it that the young vitellius had been one of tiberiuss spintriae at capri where his services to the debauched emperor had advanced his fathers career titus found it hard to imagine vitellius as a pleasingly plump boy when gazing at the man in his late fifties the death of otho had left sporus without a role in the imperial household as she had done in the confusion after neros death and under galba sporus again looked to epaphroditus for protection that was how lucius and sporus had been thrown together lucius was already residing with epaphroditus seldom stirring beyond his suite of rooms trying to draw as little attention as possible to himself or to the personal fortune he had inherited from his father there was plenty of space in epaphrodituss apartments to accommodate both lucius and sporus but the two wards inevitably found themselves spending time together they were about the same age lucius was twentytwo and sporus a bit younger otherwise they had little in common yet they never quarreled and often talked for hours sharing gossip laughing at each others jokes and reminiscing about the dead not only luciuss father and otho but all the others who had passed into oblivion in the tumult that had begun with neros death so far lucius had remained beneath the new emperors notice and so had sporus epaphroditus told them that this was a good thing but inevitably they grew restless shut up in epaphrodituss apartments now change was again in the air according to epaphroditus vitellius might not be emperor much longer the general vespasian vastly enriched by his war against the jews and anticipating even greater riches from the sack of their capital jerusalem had been proclaimed emperor by his troops in the east and by the legions on the danube while vespasian and his son titus remained in the east commanders loyal to him were marching on italy another struggle for control of the empire was imminent the mood in the city had become increasingly unsettled and anxious there was a sense that anything might happen and fear of a bloodbath astrologers had predicted the end of vitellius vitelliuss response besides ordering every astrologer in roma to be killed on the spot was to throw one lavish party after another there were even rumours that nero had not died after all that he had staged his death as a hoax and the heir of augustus would return at any moment at the head of a parthian army sporus and epaphroditus knew better of course though neither of them would tell lucius exactly what had transpired in the last moments of neros life which has also been the last moments of his fathers life the emperor chose the moment and the method of his death and he died with dignity was all that epaphroditus would say and so did your father who bravely decided to follow him into death lying back on the couch lucius gazed up at the painting of the broadshouldered jupiter and the slender but elegantly muscled ganymede who looked a bit too mature and developed to be carrying a boys hoop i can see why ganymede is a smooth as a baby said lucius but youd think a brawny fellow like jupiter would be shown with a bit more hair on his chest wouldnt you yet the painters never seem to show hair on a mans chest and neither do the sculptors is it true that otho didnt have a hair on his body sporus laughed true otho had not a hair on his body or on his head when he took off that hairpiece otho wore a hairpiece you never told me that he made me take a vow to tell no one even if he should die in battle well he didnt die in battle did he he chose to abandon me by his own hand so ill tell you anyway yes otho wore a hairpiece it was a very good one i must admit it fooled you obviously sporus laughed as for the rest of him even i have more hair on my body than otho did he went to great lengths to remove every strand he shaved here plucked there and in certain delicate areas he used a wax poultice to depilate himself he was so vain about his physique you see when he was naked he wanted nothing to obscure the sight of all those muscles and of course he liked the touch of silk against his hairless flesh what a wardrobe the man had this robe im wearing belonged to otho sporuss voice trailed off lucius thought of another thing that epaphroditus had said that is the look of sporus remembering those who have died and left her behind there was a quiet knock at the door epictetus entered for a long time lucius had been confused by the lame slaves furtive almost cringing demeanour whenever he was in sporuss presence epaphroditus treated epictetus with respect acknowledging and even deferring to his young slaves immense erudition and allowed epictetus considerable freedom to do and say whatever he pleased epictetus was no cowed underling yet around sporus he behaved awkwardly and averted his eyes even his limp became more pronounced eventually lucius realized that the slave was in love with sporus and painfully aware that his love could never be requited sporus had been the consort of two of the most powerful men on earth she could hardly be expected to take notice of a lame slave who hid his homely face behind a shaggy beard to be sure epictetus was clever epaphroditus declared that he had never known any man who was better read or more thoroughly versed in philosophy which was quite remarkable considering that epictetus was the same age as lucius but what good was all his learning to epictetus when the object of his affection was more interested in muscular legs and depilating poultices than in stoic discourse theres a visitor in the vestibule said epictetus glancing at sporus and then at the floor epaphroditus is out for the afternoon said lucius the visitor will have to come back later i failed to make myself clear said epictetus daring to look up again the visitor is here to see sporus sporus sat upright me no one ever comes to see me any more a friend of othos perhaps no he comes from the emperor vitellius said epictetus his calls himself asiaticus sporus raised an eyebrow not a big muscular fellow rakishly handsome struts like a gladiator but grins like a spintria epictetus frowned that might describe him who is this asiaticus asked lucius how do you know him i dont know him said sporus but it looks as if i soon shall really lucius you dont know the stories about vitellius and asiaticus im afraid not what a sheltered existence your father imposed on you sparing your delicate ears from the gossip of the court nero loved telling tales about vitellius and his stud horse the relationship between those two made neros bedroom antics seem quite tame my ears are open said lucius rolling onto his stomach and propping his chin on his fists quickly then asiaticus was born a slave no different from any other slave until in adolescence a certain appendage became rather prominent when vitellius saw the boy standing naked on the auction block one day he didnt buy him for his brains like a racing master whod acquired a new stud vitellius took him home and tried him out right away vitellius was happy with his purchase but as you know in these relationships its not always clear who is the master and who the slave and desire isnt always mutual asiaticus grew tired of vitellius and who could blame him they say vitellius is actually rather skilled at lovemaking but really can you imagine having that mass of quivering flesh on top of you or under you i should imagine since i suspect that to be his preferred position anyway at some point young asiaticus had quite enough and ran off vitellius wept and tore out his hair he was heartbroken then one day vitellius was down in puteoli and who should he come across at a little stand on the waterfront flirting with the sailors and selling cheap wine hardly better than vinegar but asiaticus vitellius burst into tears and moved to embrace him but asiaticus was off like an arrow vitelliuss men gave chase knocking down half the market stalls along the waterfront and finally caught asiaticus and brought him back in irons a happy ending the lovers were reunited lucius laughed something tells me theres more to this story much more so its back to roma where all goes well for a while this time its vitellius who decides hes had enough of asiaticus the insolence the lying the thieving the cavorting behind his masters back vitellius stamps his feet and rants and pulls out his whip but eventually he makes good on a longstanding threat and sells asiaticus to a new master a fellow who keeps a travelling band of gladiators again the lovers are separated vitellius thinks hes seen the last of asiaticus whos gone from spilling seed in his masters bedroom to spilling blood in the arena standing in the doorway epictetus cleared his throat the man is just outside still waiting dont worry i wont keep him much longer said sporus well to make a long story short one day vitellius is invited to be the guest of honour at games being put on by a local magistrate in some country town who should be scheduled for the final match but asiaticus vitellius goes pale when the love of his life enters the arena but he puts on a brave face and tells himself hes long since gotten over that scoundrel and would be happy to see him suffer an agonizing death then the match begins and things go badly for asiaticus from the start hes wounded once twice and ends up flat on his back with his opponents sword at his throat the crowd screams for his death and the magistrate is ready to give the signal when vitellius leaps to his feet and cries out spare him spare my sweet asiaticus vitellius buys him back on the spot paying an outrageous sum and down in the gladiators quarters the two are reunited imagine the tears and kisses and whispers of forgiveness i know this sounds like a tawdry greek novel but i swear i didnt make it up epictetus cleared his throat again and the rest of the story said lucius vitellius took asiaticus with him when he went to govern germania he ruled there the way hes ruled in roma wild banquets and gladiator shows to amuse the local chieftains while his soldiers raped and plundered the citizenry to make amends for having made him a gladiator vitellius freed asiaticus and gave him an official post asiaticus turned out to be rather useful apparently living by wits and brawn had trained him to be just the sort of factotum a governor like vitellius needed few were the troublemakers asiaticus couldnt bully or seduce into submission and now hes here in roma helping his old master run the show not just a freedman any longer but a respected member of the equestrian order no said lucius yes not long after vitellius became emperor some of his fawning supporters urged him to elevate asiaticus to equestrian rank since he possessed the requisite wealth vitellius laughed and told them not to be ridiculous that the appointment of a rascal like asiaticus would bring disgrace to the order when asiaticus got wind of this you can imagine his reaction quick as asparagus vitellius threw a banquet where he presented asiaticus with the gold ring to mark his new status as an equestrian hell make the fellow a senator next lucius laughed then frowned and now asiaticus has come to call on you this cant be good no im eager to have a look at him said sporus epictetus tell my visitor he can come in now have one of the serving girls bring suitable refreshments even as epictetus nodded and turned he was confronted by a figure coming through the doorway the visitor pushed epictetus aside and swaggered into the room in luciuss experience men who craved the company of youths tended to look for the greek ideal of beauty the sight of asiaticus surprised him the man had a round head set atop a squat neck and an almost piggish face an upturned nose heavy lips and squinting eyes even allowing for a coarsening of his features due to debauched living it was hard to imagine that he had ever possessed the kind of beauty the old greek masters immortalized in marble nor was he any longer a boy there were flecks of grey in his wiry black hair his equestrians tunic with its narrow red stripes running up and over each massive shoulder seemed barely to contain him leaving his brawny arms and more of his hairy thighs exposed than was decent and straining to contain the breadth of his bulllike chest on his left hand pushed onto a thick stubby finger lucius saw the gold equestrians ring that had been placed there by vitellius lucius rose from the couch he drew back his shoulders asiaticus gave him a glance then settled his gaze on sporus he twisted his lips into a smirk you must be sporus said asiaticus his voice was not what lucius had expected either tinged with what luciuss father had called the gutter accent of uneducated slave and freedmen and you must be asiaticus sporus continued to recline on the couch with one hand she smoothed a fold of her silk gown over her hips this is for you asiaticus stepped forward and held forth a scroll whats this sporus untied the ribbon a new play written by the emperor himself by jupiter another one who thinks hes nero muttered epictetus from the doorway the rape of lucretia by the son of king tarquinius and the subsequent fall of the last dynasty of kings read sporus the title is certainly a mouthful though the play seems hardly more than a sketch short and sweet said asiaticus its mostly action the emperor doesnt want to bore his audience audience is there to be a performance are we invited sporus cast a quick wideeyed glance at lucius then smiled graciously at asiaticus the audience will consist of the emperors closest friends and advisers men of high rank and exquisite taste will you be there said lucius he kept a straight face sporus covered her laugh with a cough asiaticus stared at lucius for a moment then grinned oh yes ill be there and so will you young pinarius and so will your host epaphroditus the emperor wouldnt want either of you to miss sporuss performance performance sporus brightened did i not explain youll play lucretia i sporus sprang to her feet and perused the scroll with greater interest therell be a rehearsal tonight for the performance at the banquet tomorrow tomorrow but i cant possibly you dont have that many lines asiaticus stepped closer lucius was struck by how slender and delicate sporus looked facetoface with asiaticus who was only a little taller but massively broader if you forget a line dont worry i shall be there to whisper it in your ear like this asiaticus drew closer and blew into sporuss ear sporus flinched and stepped back you did i not explain im to play sextus tarquinius the son of the king the villain who rapes lucretia sporus took another step back she opened the scroll with both hands interposing it between herself and asiaticus i see you and i are to act in the emperors play together performing opposite each other exactly ill leave you now try to get those lines into your pretty head and do whatever else you need to prepare yourself well stage a private rehearsal for the emperor tonight while he dines asiaticus looked sporus up and down the smirk vanished replaced by a vacant slackjawed expression that lucius found even more disturbing then he swaggered out of the room this is ridiculous said lucius ridiculous sporus stood erect do you think me incapable i didnt spend all that time at neros side without picking up some knowledge of acting here epictetus you and i will read the play together and youll help me with my lines as asiaticus had noted the socalled play was quite short it could hardly be intended as the main part of an evenings entertainment it was more likely a vignette to fill out the programme vitelliuss parties typically included dancing boys and girls and gladiators fighting to the death along with declaiming poets and comic actors the story required little in the way of background everyone in the audience would know the tale already when a friend of the kings son boasted of his wifes virtue the reckless sextus tarquinius felt obliged to take it from her arriving while her husband was away he took advantage of lucretias hospitality and raped her unable to bear her shame lucretia used a dagger to kill herself when her body was shown to an angry crowd in the forum king tarquinius and his wicked son were driven from roma and the republic was founded epictetus quickly scanned the text he wrinkled his nose in disgust hardly more than a vulgar mime show he declared according to the stage instructions the rape takes place right on stage and so does lucre tias suicide seneca saw fit to include all sorts of shock effects in his plays noted sporus thyestes eats his roasted children right in front of the audience and oedipus gouges out his eyes they use hidden bladders and pigs blood if vitellius thinks hes another seneca hes completely deluded said lucius taking his turn at scanning the text this dialogue is utter drivel sporus shrugged still if this is the sort of thing vitellius likes its a chance for me to please him lucius shook his head i didnt like asiaticuss manner what an oily fellow yes he wasnt quite what i expected either said sporus men seldom are still he has a certain beastlike appeal if you imagine him outfitted as a gladiator ill let you get on with it then said lucius glad that sporus had chosen epictetus to practise with her and not him asiaticuss visit had put him in a foul mood he needed to take a walk epaphrodituss apartments were off the long portico that fronted the meadows and the manmade lake at the heart of the golden house perhaps he would walk all the way around the lake he fetched a cloak though for such a mild winter day he probably wouldnt need it as he made ready to leave he heard sporus and epictetus declaiming their lines who is at the door it is i sextus tarquinius your husbands friend and the son of the king but my husband is not home tonight i know but would you deny me your hospitality open your door to me lucretia let me in lucius smiled epictetus seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing despite his avowed disdain for the material it occurred to lucius that the slave might be taking a certain vicarious pleasure in playing such a role opposite the unobtainable object of his affection it also occurred to lucius that sporus might be imagining yet another return to imperial favour why not nero had married her otho had made her his mistress vitellius might be oblivious to her charms preferring a more beastlike partner to use sporuss word but asiaticus had blatantly displayed his attraction and asiaticus was a powerful man lucius sighed as he left the apartments he heard a last exchange of dialogue no unhand me brute i am faithful to my husband yield to me lucretia i will have my way with you epictetus declaimed with such vigour that his voice broke he cleared his throat then spoke again sounding rather chagrined and then the stage directions say that we struggle a bit and then i tear your gown at sundown a group of praetorians arrived to escort them to the emperors private quarters sporus walked ahead of the others conscious of her special status lucius and epaphroditus followed epictetus came along as well ostensibly to attend to his master they were shown to a large octagonal banquet room the walls were of dazzling multicoloured marble and there was a splashing fountain at the entrance lucius had never seen the room but it was obviously quite familiar to sporus who must have spent many happy hours in this room first with nero then with otho lucius heard her sigh as she gazed about assessing the changes wrought by vitellius and his wife galeria who was said to find neros taste too understated a great many statues decorative lamps bronze vases ivory screens and woven hangings had been crowded into the room filling the spaces against the walls and between the dining couches the only part of the room not cluttered with precious objects was a raised dais against one wall the daiss sole decoration was a largerthanlife marble statue of nero who was depicted in greek dress with a laurel crown on his head it appeared that this dais was to serve as the stage for the play since the dining couches where arrayed before it in a semicircle all the couches were empty except for two in centre of the front row upon one reclined the emperors wife galeria and their sevenyearold son germanicus upon the other couch occupying the entire space lay the emperor a molossian mastiff almost as big as a man lay curled before his couch the dog sprang up and growled when lucius and the others entered then came to heel when its master made a shushing sound as vitellius roused himself and stood lucius pondered the considerable energy required to set in motion such an imposing mass of flesh the emperor was very tall with big arms and a huge belly and the flushed face of a heavy drinker as he took a few steps towards them he limped slightly vitelliuss lameness was said to be the result of a longago chariot accident in the days of his debauched youth caligula had been driving vitellius held a sword clutching the handle in his right fist and fondling the blade with the fingertips of his left hand the pommel was ornately decorated and the blade was covered with gold lucius let out a little gasp when he realized what he was seeing the sword of the divine julius one of vitelliuss followers had stolen caesars sword from its sacred place in the shrine of mars and presented to vitellius when he was first proclaimed emperor vitellius carried it in place of the traditional dagger that his predecessors kept on their person as a symbol of the power of life and death they wielded over their subjects he kept it always at his side like a lucky talisman he even slept with it beneath the folds of his toga lucius touched his own talisman the fascinum he had been given on the last day of his fathers life like his father he wore it for special occasions and in times of danger vitellius stared openly at sporus unlike asiaticus he did not leer his gaze was curious but not lustful if anything to judge by the way he curled his upper lip he was disgusted by what he saw so youre the one who gave up his balls to please nero eh ah well plenty of boys have lost their balls for less reason than that vitellius slowly circled sporus fondling the sword in his hands then along came otho he took a fancy to you as well i suppose he looked at you and thought theres a bargain the works already been done rather like a quality piece of real estate already refurbished by the previous owner the emperor completed his circuit and stood before sporus looming over her she stared up at him for a moment then lowered her eyes that otho vitellius clucked his tongue never knew what to make of the fellow so amenable avoided confrontation at all costs supposedly he was neros best friend but when nero wanted his poppaea otho gave her up without a fight i certainly wouldnt give up my wife just because a friend asked for her would i my sweet the empress galeria reclining next to her son smiled sweetly she was vitelliuss second wife and considerably younger than her husband she was wearing one of poppaeas gowns a magnificent confection of redandpurple silk to which she had added a great deal of silver embroidery and strings of pearls her son reclined beside her staring vacantly at sporus germanicus was large for his age lucius could see that the boy resembled his father with his chubby cheeks and fleshy limbs and realized with a shiver that germanicus was probably the age his father had been when tiberius inducted him into the debaucheries at capri the boy was said to have a stutter so severe that he could hardly speak at all as long as nero reigned otho seemed quite content to live in exile continued vitellius fondling the sword and gazing at sporus never joined in any of the plots against the man who stole his wife not even after nero kicked poor poppaea to death he glanced over his shoulder at galeria if anyone kicked you to death my dear i would certainly take steps to avenge you galeria laughed quietly germanicus made a braying noise perhaps otho was just biding his time said vitellius waiting for his chance it did seem that he was going to have the last laugh at least for a while he ended up living here in neros golden house having his way with neros new version of poppaea poppaea with a penis if you like he stepped closer to sporus towering over her but along i came and poof otho vanished like a candle in the wind in the taverns they sing a song about him gave up his wife gave up his life all without strife i cant have any respect for a fellow like that i wonder what sort of lover he made how did he compare to nero poppaea could have told us but poppaea is dead perhaps you can enlighten us eunuch but not yet we have a play to rehearse the emperor clapped his hands lucius and epaphroditus were shown to couches and offered food and wine epictetus stood behind his master the fare was exquisite but with praetorians stationed against each wall lucius did not find the atmosphere relaxing little germanicus made a great deal of noise when he ate snorting and drooling and chewing with his mouth open vitellius took sporuss hand and escorted her onto the dais with his sword he gestured to the statue of nero this is one of the statues that was pulled down after neros death then restored by otho if you look closely you can see where the head was reattached to the neck its fitting the statue should be here because tomorrows banquet will be in honour of nero first there will be a sacrifice at his tomb on the hill of gardens followed by gladiator games and then a feast for everyone in the city only very special guests will be invited to the banquet in this room vespasians supporters were marching on the city lucius thought and the response of vitellius was to invoke the spirit of nero and to treat the people of roma to yet another feast the man knew only one way to rule by throwing parties the graver the crisis the grander the party the highlight of the menu will be a dish of my own devising said vitellius i call it the shield of minerva if i am remembered for nothing else a thousand years from now i hope that men will still speak of this dish no vessel of pottery large enough to contain it could be fired so a gigantic shield made of solid silver has been cast for the presentation the shield will be carried into the room by a group of slaves upon it will be arranged an exquisite confabulation of pike livers pheasant brains peacock brains and flamingo tongues all sprinkled with lamprey milt the total cost will be more than a million sesterces my guests will have seen and tasted nothing like it in their entire lives while we eat we must be entertained for the occasion i wrote a little play about lucretia when i began to consider whom to cast in the title role it was asiaticus who suggested you sporus i swear that fellow can go for years without expressing a single intelligent thought and then he produces a stroke of genius to honour neros memory who else but neros widow could play the role of lucretia are you ready to show me what you can do sporus nodded i shall do my best to please you caesar oh you shall please me i have no doubt vitellius smiled the props will all be imaginary except for lucretias distaff and spindle and her bed the stagehands will bring those on at the proper time a piper will play whenever the scene changes and to underscore the more dramatic moments the emperor descended from the dais and reclined on his couch the rehearsal commenced a chorus of three actors stepped onto the stage first to declaim the prologue the chorus then became the entourage of sextus tarquinius played by asiaticus who engaged in a debate with an actor playing lucretias husband concerning which man had the more virtuous wife to settle the argument the husbands decided to drop in on their wives unexpectedly the chorus became the female attendants of sextuss wife who was caught gossiping and drinking wine with her slaves the chorus then became the female slaves of lucretia when the husbands dropped in they found her spinning and overheard her deliver a soliloquy about the duties of a wife sporuss first lines were a bit shaky lucius thought but she seemed to gain confidence as she went on the chorus vanished lucretias gloating husband sang his wifes praises vexed sextus ordered him to leave the city on a military mission then delivered a speech expressing his fury at the man who had made a fool of him and declaring his intention to destroy lucretias virtue sextus paid a call on lucretia the hour was late the slaves were all abed lucretia spinning by candlelight looked up at a sudden noise who is at the door sporus cried with a convincingly nervous quaver it is i sextus tarquinius your husbands friend and the son of the king said asiaticus in a booming voice standing behind his master epictetus snorted quietly trying not to laugh out loud lucius likewise bit his tongue asiaticus was a terrible actor though physically he fit the part had vitellius written a comedy or a tragedy it was hard to tell how would the audience react the next day besotted by wine and stuffed with the delicacies from the shield of minerva the emperors guests would be thinking as much about the actors as about the play titillated by the novelty of seeing vitelliuss stud and neros eunuch bride together on the stage the rehearsal continued with the determined sextus forcing his way into lucretias bedroom he knocked aside her spindle he threw her onto the bed above them loomed the statue of nero lucius recalled the stage directions which read he tears her clothes and has his way with her she resists and weeps perhaps sporus and asiaticus were merely acting but to lucius it seemed that the activity on the stage suddenly looked quite real and became more so as the mock rape continued sporus seemed quite genuinely to struggle asiaticus seemed genuinely to overpower her handling her very roughly even slapping her face sporus let out a cry that did not sound like acting epictetus stiffened epaphroditus hearing the slaves indrawn breath and sensing his agitation shook his head and raised his hand but epictetus could not be still he began to move towards the stage epaphroditus seized him by the wrist vitellius was excited by the scene so was germanicus who screeched and clapped his hands at the display of violence father and son both sat upright and leaned forward on their couches vitellius toyed nervously with the sword of the divine julius and began to direct the action come on asiaticus you can do better than that tear her clothes as it says in the script dont just pretend i want to hear the fabric rip yes thats it and again but not too much we mustnt see that the eunuch has no breasts its the sound that will thrill the audience now slap her face again gather her hair in your fist pull back her head and give her a good hard slap oh harder than that this is lucretia youre violating the bitch who made a fool of you by parading her virtue this is every patrician lady with her nose in the air who ever said no to you you despise her selfrighteousness you want to see her disgraced humbled completely humiliated i want to hear her squeal like a pig asiaticus thats better louder the music must be louder too and more frantic the piper who stood offstage was performing a piece called lucretias tears one of neros bestknown compositions he played louder and faster held down on the bed by asiaticus sporus made such a plaintive cry that epictetus pulled free of his master and began limping towards the stage one of the praetorians immediately blocked his way lucius watched in dismay as asiaticus knocked sporus about and turned her this way and that throwing back his head and laughing asiaticus positioning sporus on all fours facing the audience he hitched up her tattered gown exposing her thighs and pretended to mount her from behind he was clearly enjoying himself grinning broadly as he raised his hand to slap the eunuchs buttocks sporus looked so terrified that for a moment lucius thought an actual rape was taking place before his eyes but no when asiaticus after a great deal of thrusting and grunting finally feigned a climax and drew back smirking and sticking out his tongue and sporus dishevelled and shaken crumpled to the bed lucius could see that the act was simulated after all vitellius applauded mimicking his father germanicus likewise clapped his hands and made a braying noise galeria toyed with the pearls on her gown and looked bored very good said vitellius very good indeed very much what i had in mind but tomorrow night i want it to last rather longer than that asiaticus i know how excited youll be but draw it out as long as you can take your time enjoy yourself relish the punishment youre inflicting on lucretia and you must be much more violent i know youre capable of that remember that you are the brutal merciless sextus tarquinius and this is the rape of lucretia her suffering is every schoolboys fantasy also make sure you hold the eunuchs face to the light at the critical moment so that we can have a good look at her when she gasps and cries out let my guests see for themselves what nero and otho saw when they mounted the creature alright then on to the next scene asiaticus left the stage sporus lay motionless on the bed hiding his face on with it i said vitellius impatiently slapped the flat side of the sword against the palm of his hand yes yes youre miserable quite convincing so miserable that you reach for the dagger under the bed go on reach for the dagger sporus looked up with a dazed expression she straightened her twisted gown pushed back her dishevelled hair and reached under the bed the dagger was a stage device made of soft wood sporus stared at it her brow became twisted and her jaw trembled a trickle of blood from her swollen lower lip ran down her chin can you not remember the lines barked vitellius t have been violated i have been violated sporus whispered staring at the dagger louder i have been violated sporus shouted after a moment she went on speaking in a hollow dull voice i cannot bear the shame the kings son had taken his vengeance on me for no other crime than my virtue i call on the gods to witness my suffering avenge my death with the fall of the house of tarquinius no good youve learned the lines but you speak without conviction and your voice keeps trailing away this is the pivotal moment of the play this is how everyone will remember you dont you care youll have to do better than that tomorrow night well then we know what happens next if you need courage look up at that statue and think of nero what was it the last praetorian to desert the golden house said to nero when he begged the man to stay is it so hard to die then ha good words to keep in mind these days sporus clutched the mock dagger in both hands and pointed it at her breast staring at it alright then said vitellius enough of this lucretia is dead the audience is thrilled her lifeless body remains on the bed during the rest of the play while her griefstricken husband rouses the people to revolt sextus tarquinius gets his comeuppance and the chorus delivers the final lines you neednt stay for this part eunuch you and your friends are dismissed go back to your quarters and practise your lines her gown torn and her hair in disarray sporus managed to stumble across the stage and step down from the dais the praetorian who had been blocking epictetus stepped aside and allowed him to join her lucius and epaphroditus rose from their couches and made their way across the room as they stepped into the hallway asiaticus suddenly blocked their way he seized sporuss chin in a vicelike grip and flashed a lascivious grin did you enjoy that he said i know i did sporus tried to draw back but asiaticus held her fast tomorrow night we do it for real for everyone to see not in front of an audience whispered sporus of course in front of the audience thats the whole point exciting isnt it here feel how excited i am just thinking about the things ill do to you while everyone watches asiaticus pressed one of her hands between his legs and whispered in her ear feels like a dagger doesnt it and when im done with you tomorrow night when you reach under the bed youll find a real dagger waiting for you not a toy he thrust his tongue into sporuss ear she wriggled and squealed he bit her earlobe sinking his teeth into the flesh sporus pulled free she ran weeping down the hallway lucius and his companions stood speechless asiaticus threw back his head and laughed vitellius called to him from the banquet chamber asiaticus leave the eunuch alone youll have your way with that disgusting creature soon enough get back in here we need to rehearse your exit speech the praetorians who escorted them back to epaphrodituss apartments did not depart but took up stations in the hallway outside sporus resisted all attempts to comfort her she withdrew to her bedroom and closed the door on a terrace overlooking neros meadows and the lake epaphroditus sat and covered his face with his hands epictetus muttered and paced tugging at his beard can this really be happening said lucius does vitellius really expect its quite clear what he expects said epaphroditus tomorrow night before an audience sporus will be publicly raped the consort of two emperors degraded like the lowest prostitute then shell be given a dagger to commit suicide for the amusement of vitellius and his friends seneca and nero are responsible for this said epictetus how do you arrive at that conclusion epaphroditus looked up at him wearily vitellius is merely taking their work one step further seneca debased the whole idea of stage plays with those obscene dramas he wrote playing up the prurient interest and the meaningless horror making hopelessness and horror the whole point of the play nero took the tradition of execution as a public spectacle and raised it to what he and his depraved friends considered art burning people alive and inducing bulls to rape young girls while the audience in the stands applauded and cheered now vitellius intends to make his vile fantasies take place on a stage while his friends stuff themselves with pike livers and pheasant tongues is there no way to prevent this from happening lucius said perhaps sporus can flee the city epaphroditus shook his head the praetorians stationed outside the door are there for a reason if you look below this terrace youll see more guards vitellius has no intention of letting his lucretia run off before tomorrows banquet lucius left them on the terrace and went to sporuss room through the door he heard her weeping he called her name she did not answer but after a while the weeping stopped he called her again and heard only silence lucius pushed against the door it was locked but the lock was flimsy intended only to keep slaves from entering when they were unwanted he pushed against the door with his shoulder the lock gave way and he stumbled into the room sporus lay on the bed no longer in disarray but dressed in one of her finest garments a gown of green silk with gold embroidery inherited from poppaea her hair had been combed and pinned makeup hid the bruises on her face her hands lay crossed on her breast she no longer looked distraught but seemed composed too composed lucius realized on the floor beside the bed lying on its side was an empty silver cup sporus stared at the ceiling with glassy eyes her words were slurred lucius youve been such a good friend to me these last few months he knelt beside the bed sporus what have you done dont pester me with questions lucius theres no time but im glad you came glad it was you not one of the others because i have to tell you something i need to confess what are you talking about i was responsible for what it was my fault nero died no sporus you dont know what youre saying listen to me lucius it was my fault nero died and my fault your father killed himself lucius drew a sharp breath i was responsible for everything for all the horrors since nero died all my fault lucius picked up the empty cup what did you drink sporus why is it making you say such things i know what im saying lucius its been so hard to keep it a secret all these months i dont understand you werent there lucius at the end with nero and your father you didnt see or hear youve only been told what happened by epaphroditus but he doesnt know the truth epictetus must know but hes never told anyone because he loves me but you should know sporuss voice was very weak lucius leaned closer putting his ear to her lips when epictetus arrived from the city with news i ran out to meet him while the others stayed inside then i took the message to nero before epictetus could do it i told nero a lie i told him the senate had voted to put him to death but thats what happened no the message epictetus brought was that the senate had failed to vote they were still deliberating they balked at the prospect of putting augustuss heir to death there was still hope for nero praetorians had been sent from roma to bring him back but only so that the senators could address him facetoface to try to come to some resolution they wanted to negotiate but that was not the message i gave to nero i lied i made him think there was no hope left but why sporus because i wanted him to die sporus convulsed on the bed her brow was suddenly covered with beads of sweat she gasped for breath only later after neros body was brought back to roma did the senate pass the resolution calling for his death but that was after the fact they did it just to please galba to make him think they had taken the initiative to make him emperor dont you see thats why there are so many rumours that nero must still be alive all those senators couldnt understand why nero would kill himself when they were ready to negotiate they think he must still be alive that his death was a hoax that hell yet return and have his revenge sporus gripped his arm but nero is dead lucius i saw him die with my own eyes and i saw your father die he wouldnt have killed himself if nero hadnt done so first it was my fault i didnt understand that so many people would die because of what i did to nero but why sporus why did you want nero to die i hated him at the end i think i loved him once i dont know i was always so confused by what he did to me by what he wanted from me who am i lucius am i the boy your father noticed one day in the golden house and took to meet nero am i poppaea or am i lucretia why do they all want me to be someone else sporus convulsed again and grimaced her eyes glittered like broken glass i caused nero to die that means i caused all the suffering that followed i created vitellius dont you see ive brought about my own destruction would you hold my hand lucius i cant see any longer i cant hear im cold if you hold my hand it means you forgive me lucius took sporuss slender hand in his her flesh was like ice she shuddered and went rigid she opened her mouth wide trying to draw a breath a rattling sound came from her throat the fascinum slipped from inside luciuss toga and dangled before her she reached for it and gripped it tightly pulling him closer her grip slackened the fascinum slipped from her fingers the light went out of her eyes lucius stared down at her for a long moment then looked around the room on a dresser nearby he saw the mirror she must have used when she combed her hair and put on her makeup a round silver mirror with an ebony handle the mirror had belonged to poppaea poppaea and sporus had looked in the same mirror and had seen the same face reflected there he held the mirror to sporuss nostrils no trace of mist fogged the polished silver sporus was dead epaphroditus sent a messenger to inform vitellius of the death asiaticus came to confirm the news he left in a fury the praetorians keeping watch on epaphrodituss apartments withdrew the next day the citywide feast in honour of nero went on as scheduled even without the presentation of vitelliuss play at his banquet his guests were impressed for many days the shield of minerva was the talk of the city until news arrived that vitelliuss troops to the north had been destroyed and vespasians forces were marching unopposed on roma from the terrace of epaphrodituss apartments lucius watched and listened to the signs of panic in the golden house various residents installed by the emperor friends relatives supporters sycophants were hastily gathering whatever precious objects they could carry and making ready to flee epaphroditus joined lucius on the terrace vitellius is preparing an abdication speech he sent a messenger to ask me to help him draft it and will you i sent the messenger away without a reply lucius frowned abdication no emperor has ever done such a thing the man who becomes emperor dies as emperor nero considered abdication i suppose thats why vitellius wanted my advice though my efforts to help nero abdicate were fruitless lucius nodded but made no reply he had not told epaphroditus or anyone else what sporus had confessed to him they heard the sounds of a scuffle and looked over the parapet in the courtyard below two welldressed women were fighting over an antique greek vase the vessel slipped from their hands and shattered on the paving stones the enraged women flew at each other apparently said epaphroditus vitellius will ask for safe conduct out of the city for himself and his wife and child along with one million sesterces from the treasury one million sesterces so little the cost of his precious shield of minerva the flavians vespasians relatives in the city will attend the speech if they give their approval a bloodless transition of power may yet be accomplished below them the women tumbled on the ground one of them grabbed a shard from the broken vase and slashed the others cheek lucius looked away sickened by the sight of blood lucius and epaphroditus stood amid the crowd at the south end of the forum before them a vast flight of marble steps led up to the main entrance to the golden house with its highly ornamented facade of golden tiles and coloured marble beyond the entrance above the roofline lucius saw the head and shoulders of the towering colossus of nero gleaming dully against the leaden december sky the gigantic statue formed a backdrop that threw everything before it bizarrely out of scale how small vitellius looked standing at the top of the steps to address the crowd with that gigantic head looming behind him the man who had seemed so large when lucius encountered him in the octagonal dining room now appeared no bigger than an insect a trifling creature that could easily be crushed on the palm of ones hand even the ranks of praetorians flanking him looked tiny look over there epaphroditus pointed to a group of men in togas who had just arrived and were making their way to the front of the crowd see how everyone falls back to make way for them the flavians vespasians relatives were surrounded by a vast entourage of slaves freedmen and freeborn supporters their arrival elicited various emotions from the others in the forum fear hope resentment curiosity look there in the centre said epaphroditus the one all the others defer to though hes only nineteen years old thats vespasians younger son domitian the older son titus is his fathers righthand man in judaea but domitian is in charge of things here in roma lucius spotted the young man who had the typical features of a flavian with his round face prominent nose and ruddy complexion domitian was notoriously vain about his luxurious head of chestnut hair which he wore longer than was currently fashionable for young romans even as lucius watched domitian reached up and swept both hands through his wavy mane combing it back then gave a practised toss of his head to make his tresses fall into place what a preener lucius laughed maybe so but hes a young man whose time has come the flavians all feel it this is their moment apparently not everyone in the crowd agreed as vitellius stepped forward to speak voices rose from the crowd crying stand firm caesar stand firm the flavians responded with their own shouts abdicate step down leave the city now vitellius seemed to hesitate was he reconsidering his decision he exchanged glances with galeria who stood nearby with little germanicus beside her he called asiaticus to his side while the two of them conferred the competing shouts from the crowd grew louder and more vociferous step down stay where you are abdicate hold firm caesar stay the course asiaticus stepped back vitellius still did not speak he crossed his fleshy arms and peered down at the crowd numas balls what is he waiting for whispered lucius the shouts grew more vehement and more threatening give way to vespasian you fool get out of the city now while you can to hades with the flavians cut off their heads and send them to vespasian with a catapult vitellius came to a decision he turned to asiaticus and said something asiaticus turned to the prefect of the praetorians and pointed at the flavians in the crowd below no whispered epaphroditus this cant be happening what is vitellius thinking the praetorians drew their swords and rushed down the steps the flavians had come prepared for a fight almost all of them carried daggers or cudgels inside their togas vitelliuss supporters were also armed amid the screams and shouts lucius and epaphroditus looked for a way to escape but the crowd surged around them knocking them this way and that they were soon separated screams came from all around and from underfoot men were being trampled to death by the mob lucius frantically searched for epaphroditus without success but some distance away he caught a glimpse of domitian his long hair was now in disarray hanging in tangles over his eyes and making him look like a wild man domitian was shouting but amid the uproar lucius couldnt make out his words the flavians rallied to shield him on all sides from the corner of his eye lucius caught sight of epaphroditus who had reached the steps of a nearby temple and was fleeing inside for safety he looked again at domitian who was waving a sword with one hand and pointing with the other lucius still couldnt hear him but the gesture was unmistakable domitian was signaling a retreat the battle was going badly for the flavians an elbow struck him hard in the back lucius staggered forward he turned and saw asiaticus the mans face was covered with blood whether his own or someone elses lucius couldnt tell he brandished a bloody sword either fight or get out of the way pinarius lucius managed to stagger to the edge of the crowd and looked up at the entrance of the golden house vitellius was peering down pressing his fingertips together as he assessed the progress of the battle galeria stood beside him shaking her head germanicus was jumping up and down clapping his hands in excitement above and beyond them loomed the gigantic statue of nero crowned by sunbeams his face looked utterly serene do you realize where we are said epictetus the slave stroked his long beard and gazed at the amazing collection of precious objects that cluttered the vast room galerias doing no doubt then limped across the black marble floor and onto the broad balcony he shaded his eyes against the bright milky sunlight this must be the place where vitellius watched the temple of jupiter burn the day he unleashed his guards on the flavians you can see the whole of the capitoline hill from here the ruins are still smouldering they were high on the palatine hill in a part of the imperial complex lucius had never before visited this wing had originally been built by tiberius and was later refurbished and incorporated into the golden house by nero between epaphrodituss apartments and these chambers they had encountered not a single armed guard except for a few looters seen at a distance and some panicstricken slaves the only people they had encountered were a gang of street urchins who had broken into a storeroom and gorged themselves on vitelliuss private stock of wine lucius had been briefly alarmed when the boys brandished daggers and shouted threats then fell in a drunken heap on the floor giggling helplessly lucius and epaphroditus joined epictetus on the balcony over on the capitoline the columns of the temple of jupiter still stood but the roof was gone and the walls had collapsed smoke rose from the jumble of charred beams and fallen stones the flavians thought theyd be safe there barricaded inside with jupiter to protect them said epaphroditus at worst they must have thought vitellius would surround the temple and hold them for ransom that would have been a logical thing for him to do to keep vespasians son and the other flavians hostage while he bargained for his own survival im sure they never imagined that vitellius would set the temple on fire his own men balked at the order they say vitellius took a torch and some kindling and started the fire himself so vitellius did what nero was accused of doing he set fire to his own city said lucius thank the gods the fire didnt spread said epaphroditus in this chaos thered be no one to put it out who knows whats become of the vigiles theyre probably rioting and looting like everyone else in the city said epictetus he reached down to rub his bad leg it seemed to lucius that the slaves limp was growing worse and that he was often in pain yet he never said a word of complaint epaphroditus gazed at the ruins while the temple went up in flames vitellius came here to watch the spectacle and enjoyed yet another banquet the burning of the temple and the slaughter of the flavians was just another entertainment for him the fire went on all night as did the screams from inside i heard domitian was killed in the fire along with the others said lucius i heard otherwise said epictetus one of vitelliuss scribes swore to me that he saw domitian escape from the flames disguised as a priest of isis the mantle of his linen robe fell back for a moment and showed his hair thats how the slave recognized him but before the scribe could tell vitellius domitian lost himself in the crowd so the slave kept his mouth shut vitellius thinks domitian is dead he almost certainly is said epaphroditus i wouldnt put much store by the scribes story disguised as a priest of isis indeed its rather farfetched not as farfetched as an emperor of roma setting fire to the temple of jupiter said epictetus to that his master had no answer vitellius must regret that decision now said lucius whats that line from seneca such a deed once done can never be called back epaphroditus nodded yesterday he sent the vestal virgins out to meet the approaching army to plead for peace they came back emptyhanded then he assembled the senators made a tearful speech and offered the sword of the divine julius to them one by one to show his willingness to abdicate no one would accept it not one of them had the courage to take that sword and put an end to vitellius said epictetus bitterly like the rest of us the senators are waiting to see how the thing plays out said epaphroditus the last of vitelliuss troops have defected he may have some supporters left but theyre hardly better than street gangs vespasians men crossed the milvian bridge this morning the advance guard must be in the city already today is the holiday of saturnalia said lucius but instead of slaves and masters changing places and everyone getting stinking drunk we have a conquering army and the lowest rabble in roma in a competition to ransack the city look over there at the shopping arcade on the far side of the forum you can see dead bodies in the street and a woman being raped on a rooftop whispered epictetus and over there towards the subura some sort of street battle is going on people are watching from the tenement windows theyre actually cheering as if they were spectators at a gladiator show probably gambling on the outcome said epictetus the view from the balcony was like a scene from a nightmare the more they watched the more violence and bloodshed they saw chaos seemed to have spread everywhere lucius leaned over the parapet and saw with alarm that a group of armed soldiers was directly below them we should leave the golden house he said anyone found here will be subject to retribution from vespasians troops well hardly be safer in the streets said epaphroditus well take a cue from domitian and disguise ourselves as priests of isis epaphroditus raised an eyebrow well put on common tunics to make ourselves less conspicuous i fled the golden house once before in such a disguise with nero that day had a bad ending what choice do we have its madness to stay here well make our way to my familys house on the palatine its not far hilarion will have barricaded the door but well find some way to get in finding tunics to wear was not difficult finding a way to leave the golden house proved more challenging vespasians men seemed to have converged on all the palatine entrances at once from every hallway that led south east or west they heard shouts and sounds of fighting they turned and headed north taking one flight of stairs after another heading for the courtyard of the colossus if they left by the main entrance they would almost certainly be seen when they descended the broad steps to the forum but lucius hoped that amid such grand spaces three men in simple tunics might escape notice he touched the fascinum at this throat then tucked it inside his tunic to hide the gleam of gold they reached the courtyard with the colossus of nero looming over them they hurried along the covered portico to the grand vestibule they rounded a corner only to discover that soldiers had already arrived at the entrance the soldiers glanced at them but took little notice they were busy trying to break down a small door just inside the main entrance that leads to the doorkeepers quarters said epaphroditus what do they want in there its been barricaded from the inside shouted one of the soldiers reporting to a superior officer but my men will break down the door any moment the hinges gave way the door was pulled outwards and thrown into the vestibule pieces of furniture a couch a mattress a chair had been stacked against it these were pulled out into the vestibule as well the way was clear the first soldier through the doorway was met by a huge dog the snarling molossian mastiff leaped onto the mans chest knocked him to the ground and sank its fangs into his throat blood was suddenly everywhere some of the soldiers slipped on it the dogs victim unable to scream with his throat torn open made a strange hissing sound the growling mastiff refused to release him even when one of the soldiers poked a sword at its ribs the officer pushed the men aside raised his fist and struck the dogs head with the pommel of his sword killing it with a single blow the soldier on the ground was already dead the soldiers rushed into the doorkeepers quarters a few moments later they brought out a man dressed as an imperial slave the man was very tall and immensely fat his hair was filthy and he had not shaved for several days but lucius recognized vitellius at once who are you what are you doing here asked the officer epictetus began to step forward epaphroditus pulled him back im the doorkeeper said vitellius trying to pull free from the soldiers who gripped his fleshy arms the motion caused a jingling noise the officer ripped open vitelliuss tunic underneath his protruding belly an equally protruding girdle was cinched around his hips the officer poked at it with his sword the girdle burst open and golden coins poured out some of the soldiers fell to their knees scrambling for the coins the officer laughed grovel for those coins if you want to men but i think we have something far more valuable here this is the emperor vitellius no thats not true vitellius was drenched with sweat he quivered from head to foot he presented such a pathetic sight that the officer was suddenly doubtful lucius stepped forward epaphroditus moved to stop him but lucius shook him off this is vitellius he said who are you and how would you know said the officer im lucius pinarius the son of senator titus pinarius but that doesnt matter this craven mass of flesh is aulus vitellius and i can prove it how theres something strapped to his leg so there is men undo those wrappings i suppose you can tell me what well find lucius pinarius vitelliuss most precious possession a relic he stole from the shrine of mars something he has no right to something he would never willingly be parted from its a sword sir announced one of the men but not a regular sword the blades covered with gold the sword of the divine julius the awestruck officer took the blade from the soldier so you are vitellius deny it again and ill slice open your throat he pressed the edge of the sword against vitelliuss neck vitellius looked at the blade crosseyed i have a secret he said a secret i can only reveal to vespasian do you understand oh i think we understand said the officer tie his arms behind his back ill put the noose around his neck myself the torn tunic clung to vitelliuss flesh but the girdle had fallen away so that only the folds of fat hanging from his belly shielded his genitals from view the men laughed at his jiggling nakedness and the way he limped as they pulled him down the steps towards the forum the officer elated by his catch paid no more attention to lucius or his companions lucius felt that he had done enough and seen enough but epictetus would not be denied the chance to see what happened next lucius and epaphroditus followed the lame slave who followed the soldiers pulling vitellius down the sacred way word spread quickly a mob gathered to watch cheering and shouting hail imperator as if they were witnessing a grotesque parody of a triumphal procession through the forum hold up your head shouted the officer look at the people when they salute you he pressed the point of the divine juliuss sword under vitelliuss chin forcing him to hold his head high criminals were taken to be punished in the same way with their heads forced back so that they could not hide their faces the point of the sword repeatedly jabbed the soft flesh streams of blood trickled down vitelliuss throat and ran over his fleshy chest the mob pelted him with dung and garbage and hurled insults look how ugly you are as fat as a pig and see how he limps one of his legs is bent arsonist pig youre a dead man now they arrived at the capitoline hill vitellius was dragged up the gemonian stairs to the tullianum the traditional place of execution for the enemies of roma while vitellius blubbered and wept and begged for mercy a fire was kindled have you no respect he cried out i was your emperor in a fit of loyalty one of vitelliuss former soldiers broke from the crowd and rushed forward with his sword drawn he stabbed vitellius in the belly meaning to put a quick end to him the soldier was attacked by the mob and thrown down the stairs vitelliuss wound was bound up to stop the bleeding men whose relatives had died in the temple conflagration were invited to heat irons and press them against vitelliuss body at first he thrashed and screamed each time he was burned but eventually the strength left his body and his screams turned to blubbering squeals then to moans others preferred to prick him with knives making small cuts so as not to kill him too quickly the torture went on for a long time in the crowd lucius saw domitian the son of vespasian was alive after all for a long time domitian stayed back and watched showing no emotion finally when it seemed that everyone who wished to inflict punishment on vitellius had been allowed to do so domitian stepped forward a soldier grabbed vitelliuss hair and pulled his head back shaking him until he opened his eyes vitellius gazed up at domitian and opened his mouth stupefied the officer who had taken the sword of the divine julius handed it to domitian who gripped it with both hands while soldiers held vitellius in place domitian swung the sword vitelliuss head flew through the air and tumbled down the gemonian stairs the crowd cheered clutching the bloody sword domitian was lifted onto the crowds shoulders the head of vitellius was placed on a pike and paraded through the forum the body of vitellius so burned and bloody that it was hardly recognizable as human was dragged by a hook through the streets and thrown into the tiber lucius and his companions made their way to his house on the palatine where hilarion and luciuss mother and sisters shed tears of joy at the sight of them lucius tossed and turned all through the long midwinter night unable to sleep at the first glimmer of dawn he put on a tunic and left the house the dim chilly streets were deserted he passed the ancient hut of romulus and descended the stairs of cacus he stood for a while before the great altar of hercules thinking of his father and trying to make sense of all that had happened since his father had died he walked aimlessly for a while then he found himself at the river front he followed the tiber downstream walking past the granaries and warehouses at the foot of the aventine hill he came to the old servian wall and walked beside it all the way to the appian gate he set out on the appian way walking away from the city the rising sun sent slanting rays of red light across the tombs and shrines that lined the road casting deep shadows a short distance up the appian way silhouetted by the rays of the sun a cross had been erected near the road crucifixion was the means of executing slaves amid the chaos of the previous day who had bothered to carry out a crucifixion lucius stepped closer a man with a gladiators build was nailed to the cross lucius saw no movement heard no sound it could take days for a man to die on a cross the gods had blessed this victim with a speedy death lucius looked at the mans face despite the uncertain light and the grimace that contorted the features titus recognized asiaticus the freedman of vitellius asiaticus had been a member of the equestrian order legally immune from crucifixion those who had killed him in such a manner deliberately meant to degrade him lucius glanced at asiaticuss hand the gold ring had been taken from his finger lucius saw something in the grass nearby he stepped closer it was the lifeless body of a child dressed in a shabby tunic and a threadbare cloak the head was twisted at an unnatural angle the childs neck had been broken lucius circled the body and looked at the face it was vitelliuss son germanicus the boy must have been fleeing the city in disguise with asiaticus as his protector the sunlight grew stronger the grey shapeless world began to take on color and substance but lucius still felt surrounded by darkness vitellius had been the most despicable man lucius had ever met asiaticus had been a vile creature and lucius certainly had felt no affection for vitelliuss son yet none of these deaths gave him pleasure his reaction was the opposite witnessing the end of vitellius had filled him with horror discovering the dead bodies of asiaticus and germanicus made him feel a dull ache of sorrow why did he feel so empty and so unsatisfied sporus had been his friend now the death of sporus was avenged was that not what lucius wanted and yet sporus herself had not been innocent in the long chain of horrors leading to this moment if her confession was true she had been responsible to some degree for the death of luciuss father and luciuss father had not been innocent either as a senator and an augur titus pinarius had been complicit in the acts that had led so many to clamour for the death of nero the events of the previous day were as appalling as anything lucius had ever witnessed yet as far as he could see the chain of crimes and atrocities that had led to this day had no beginning and would have no end he realized that he was clutching the fascinum he held it so that it caught the sunlight the gold glittered so brightly that it hurt luciuss eyes to look at it did the god fascinus exist had he ever existed luciuss glimmer of doubt was followed by a quiver of superstitious fear the protection of fascinus might be the only reason why lucius was still alive and not hanging on a cross like asiaticus lucius was alive but towards what end what was the point of living in such a world he returned to the road and walked back to the city ad your father was a very religious man said epaphroditus indeed i never knew a man more pious in his respect for his ancestors or more devout in his belief in the revelation of divine will of course like his own father titus became an augur at a very early age younger than you are now i imagine how old are you lucius thirtytwo lucius pinarius sipped wine from his cup epaphroditus always served very fine wine and the shady garden terrace of his house on the esquiline hill had a splendid view of the city it was a cloudless day in the month of augustus the heat was relieved by an occasional breeze from the west having kept his fortune intact throughout the tumult that followed the death of nero epaphroditus had retired from the imperial service happy to recede into anonymity in the relatively quiet decade of vespasians reign lucius too had done little these past ten years at least in the eyes of society he had not even married and started a family and while he possessed numerous properties and business interests he had no proper career his mother lived with one of his sisters all three of whom were married and running their own households living alone lucius avoided politics and public service and pursued simple pleasures like sitting in his friends hillside garden enjoying good wine and taking in the view thirtytwo exclaimed epaphroditus where do the years go well it seems you have reached an age at which you might consider following in the footsteps of your father and grandfather become an augur you mean for a start nowadays the augurate is usually a reward from the emperor to men who have given long years of service to the state but there are always exceptions especially for those with hereditary ties to the priesthood i know that you never established any relationship with the late vespasian but now that his son titus has succeeded him its a new day in roma the men around titus are closer to your own age if you were to seek the emperors favour lucius shook his head i used to watch my father perform auguries i never felt drawn to the art this was not the first time they had discussed augury why did epaphroditus keep bringing up the subject probably because lucius would not speak his true thoughts aloud luciuss feeling about his father were very mixed the more lucius learned about nero the more he wondered at his fathers unshakable loyalty to the man as a freedman epaphrodituss service had been compulsory but what had drawn titus pinarius to nero was it merely the opportunity for advancement and wealth had he not been appalled when his own brother was put to death by nero kaeso the uncle lucius had never known was another source of consternation how had a pinarius a relative of augustus and the descendant of one of the citys most ancient families become a christian lucius wished he had been given the chance to talk to his uncle kaeso instead of being kept away from him had his father made a genuine effort to understand kaeso or to bring him back to the worship of the gods since both men were dead lucius would never know the truth of their relationship lucius took pride in his familys ancient heritage but felt deeply puzzled by the preceding generation he would never say a word against his father especially to epaphroditus but the idea of following in his fathers footsteps did not appeal to lucius granted lucius you may feel no particular affinity for augury but consider the benefits the priesthood would give you a vocation a focus for your talents a connection with others of your class fortunately i need none of those things lucius flashed a wry smile the last time i sat here in your garden epaphroditus you put forth very similar arguments only then the subject was family and marriage you said i should finally take a wife and make some sons to enjoy the tax exemptions if for no other reason but i have no worries about money my father left me a very wealthy man yes i could fritter away my time in the socalled service of the state either as a priest or a magistrate but why should i bother and i could marry a fine patrician girl and produce some fine patrician sons but again why bother the state is the emperor the emperor is the state the rest of us are like grains of sand on a beach interchangeable indistinguishable inconsequential a roman citizen has no importance whatsoever no matter how much some of us would like to pretend otherwise epaphroditus drew a sharp breath he looked around the garden to make sure there were no slaves to overhear lucius you must be more careful about what you say even to me that kind of talk is not only defeatist but dangerously close to sedition lucius shrugged you prove my point if a citizen has no more freedom of speech than a slave why serve the state how old did you say you were lucius thirtytwo epaphroditus shook his head a dangerous age for a man old enough to feel that he should be in charge of his destiny and to chafe against the constraints of living under an absolute ruler but perhaps not yet old enough to discern the fine line that a man must tread if hes to survive the whims of fortune by which you mean the whims of the imperial family roma could have fallen into worse hands than those of the flavians epaphroditus expressed the prevailing consensus vespasian had been a competent and levelheaded ruler his reign made smoother by a vast infusion of wealth provided by the sack of jerusalem which had filled the roman treasury with gold the enslavement of the jewish insurgents had provided thousands of slaves to build romas roads and grand new monuments nero and his immediate successors had failed largely because they ran out of money vespasian had never had to worry about that increasingly confident as his reign progressed vespasian gradually abandoned the fiction steadfastly maintained by the dynasty of augustus that the emperor and senate were equal partners with the emperor merely the first among citizens by the time of his death from natural causes there was no doubt that vespasian was absolute ruler of the state he became so confident of his popularity that he put a stop to the practice begun by claudius of searching every person admitted to the imperial presence for weapons he also abandoned claudiuss practice of staffing the bureaucracy with imperial freedman making state service a professional career open to citizens of merit or at least ambition in the last ten years there had been a radical shift in the way people thought about the good old days of the longago republic where once people sentimentalized the republic and senators spoke wistfully of its return it was more common now for people to refer to the era of caesar and pompeius as the bad old days when unbridled competition between ruthless warlords resulted in bloody civil war the year of four emperors that followed nero had been a throwback to the end of the republic a reminder of the chaos that could reign when there was no clear successor to command the legions and run the empire how much better it was to bow to an emperor whose legitimacy was beyond question and to enjoy the stability of a ruling dynasty if vespasian had a vice it was greed the emperor and his favourites had shamelessly exploited their positions to accrue enormous wealth treating the roman state as a moneymaking scheme for insiders vespasian famously put a tax on the citys latrinae claiming a share of the money made by the sale of urine to fullers who used it to clean wool thus the saying even when you piss the emperor takes a percentage a year after vespasians death people still wondered at his dying words oh damn i think im becoming a god the senate duly voted to honour him in death as the divine vespasian his elder son titus succeeded him he had served under vespasian in judaea taking part in the plunder of jerusalem and the enslavement of the jews titus had been an active partner in his fathers reign his fathers henchman some called him since as prefect of the praetorian guards he ruthlessly protected his fathers interests but as emperor titus had so far displayed an even milder temperament than his fathers with the transition of power the new dynasty was firmly established making it clear that roma was destined to be ruled by hereditary kings even if no one called them that epaphroditus returned to the subject of luciuss future if you have no inclination for augury or state service perhaps its not too late for you to consider a military career i dont know anyone more skillful with a bow and arrow last year at your etrurian estate i saw you bring down a charging boar with a spear not every man can do such a thing that took nerves as well as skill i suspect you could handle yourself quite well on a battlefield lucius shook his head i learned to use weapons because i own land in the countryside and hunting amuses me it also puts meat on my table but why should i wish to kill my fellow mortals to defend roma lucius laughed no one serves in the military to defend roma roma is not under attack men join the legions to head for the outskirts of the empire and look for fresh lands to plunder its all about looting isnt it all the successful emperors looted something and brought the booty back to roma for glory then if one finds it glorious to kill strangers and rape their women and then brag about it if i wanted to loot i could become a magistrate and collect taxes that would be far less dangerous for me and would kill my victims much more slowly one wants to keep them alive so they can keep paying taxes epaphroditus shook his head our emperor collects taxes to make the state function for the benefit of us all consider the grand public projects like that monstrosity thats ruined the view lucius referred to the massive structure that now dominated the skyline of the city from all directions but especially as seen from epaphrodituss garden the architects called it an amphitheatre two semicircular theatres put together to form a complete circle it was by far the largest and tallest building in roma in the days of the first emperors the valley between the caelian esquiline and palatine hills had filled up with tenements after the great fire nero razed the charred tenements and made the area into his private hunting meadow in the heart of the golden house complete with a large manmade lake determined to get rid of the golden house bit by bit vespasian started by filling in the lake and clearing the meadow on the huge flat site that resulted using money looted from jerusalem to purchase materials and jewish slaves captured in the war for labour vespasian began constructing an immense elaborately decorated amphitheatre the divine augustus had first expressed the idea of building such a structure in the middle of the city for the presentation of gladiator combats hunting exhibitions and other spectacles vespasian would make augustuss dream a reality construction went on throughout vespasians reign but he did not live to see it finished it was left to titus to complete the structure from epaphrodituss garden the enormous scale of the flavian amphitheatre was somewhat deceptive due to its proximity to the giant statue of nero seeing the huge amphitheatre next to the colossus played tricks with the viewers grasp of perspective the towering statue was no longer enclosed by a courtyard vespasian had demolished the grand entrance of the golden house but left the statue intact for a while the colossus had been surrounded by scaffolds and from epaphrodituss garden one could hear the sound of artisans wielding hammers and chisels and crowbars when the scaffolding came down the face of the colossus no longer resembled that of nero henceforth it would simply be the sun god sol monstrosity said epaphroditus i think the flavian amphitheatre is not only an amazing feat of engineering but also quite beautiful to look at ill admit i was dubious when the foundation was laid and one began to realize just how big it would be but once it began to take shape and the decorations and architectural details were filled in i thought to myself i shall never tire of looking at that its been a joy sitting here in the garden day by day season after season watching the thing go up i havent even minded the noise though i suppose therell be even more noise once the thing opens in a year or so imagine the roar of fifty thousand spectators its quite impressive on the inside as well one of the architects is an old friend of mine and let me have a look you feel as if youre in a gigantic bowl with all those rows upon rows of seats rising around you theres never been anything like it lucius was not convinced how will so many people get in and out without waiting for hours on end and once theyre inside how will they avoid being crushed to death the engineers have planned for that the place has eighty entrances vomitoria theyre called and each has a number people will enter and exit by the vomitorium specified on their ticket the stairways corridors and landings are architectural marvels in themselves since it was built on the site of neros lake the area was already plumbed so theres no lack of running water the place has over a hundred drinking fountains and the two largest latrinae ive ever seen marvellous fifty thousand romans can all take a piss at the same time epaphroditus ignored him the arena is immense able to accommodate whole armies of gladiators or navies using the plumbing that maintained neros artificial lake the arena can be flooded and drained at will the challenge will be staging spectacles large enough to fill the space lucius and epaphroditus sat in silence for a while watching the slaves and artisans scurry like insects inside the massive network of scaffolding that surrounded the amphitheatre more construction was going on at a vast bathing complex not far from the amphitheatre and on a huge triumphal arch that would serve as a ceremonial gateway between the amphitheatre and the forum the gigantic stone plaques being installed on the arch could be seen even from epaphrodituss garden the images celebrated the victory of vespasian and titus over the rebellious jews and the sack of jerusalem the jewish slaves working on the arch wore ragged loincloths and glistened with sweat the sun had moved and with it the patch of shade lucius moved his chair and epaphroditus nodded to the serving girl who brought more wine the breeze had died the day was growing quite hot these antisocial ideas lucius where do they come from epaphroditus shook his head i worry that someone in our little circle of friends has been a bad influence on you but which one the stoic the poet or the sophist lucius smiled you certainly cant blame epictetus how could a stoic ever be a bad influence i cant say the same about martial or dio ah but here they all are arriving together a slave showed the three newcomers into the garden chairs were rearranged to take advantage of the shade more cups and more wine were brought epictetus was no longer a slave epaphroditus had freed him some years ago and the two had become close friends his limp had grown more pronounced he never went anywhere now without a crutch to lean on in all the years he had known him lucius had never once heard the man complain about his infirmity epictetus was a living example of the stoic philosophy he embraced which placed great value on the dignity of the self and a graceful acquiescence to those things over which the self had no control in the years since his manumission he had gained a considerable reputation as a teacher epictetus looked the part his long beard was flecked with the first touches of grey and he wore the customary garment of philosophers the greek cloak called a himation dio of prusa also wore a beard and a himation he was a greek sophist a writer who popularized philosophical ideas with clever essays and discourses at forty he was a few years older than epictetus the third visitor about the same age as dio was also a writer though of a very different sort the spanishborn martial was a poet among the most fervent admirers of his work was the new emperor martial was cleanshaven and immaculately groomed and dressed formally in a toga as befitted a poet paying a visit to an important patron of the arts after they each had a cup of wine and exchanged casual conversation about the weather could anyone recall a month of augustus so hot epaphroditus got to his feet and stood before the object that he had invited them to see a new statue had been installed in the garden occupying a spot at the very centre with the flavian amphitheatre as a backdrop the statue was covered by a large sheet of canvas first said epaphroditus let me say that obtaining this statue was not easy the new amphitheatre has claimed the best available work of every sculptor from the pillars of hercules to lake maotis count all those niches and archways in the amphitheatre facade and imagine a statue in every available spot thats a great many statues but this is the one i wanted and i got it i wont tell you how much i paid for it but when you see it i think youll agree it was worth whatever i paid and more please keep us in suspense no longer martial laughed let us see this masterpiece in marble epaphroditus nodded to two slaves waiting nearby they pulled the billowing canvas up and away from the statue extraordinary whispered epictetus splendid said martial do you recognize the subject asked epaphroditus its melancomas of course said dio was it done from life yes melancomas modeled for the sculptor just a few months before he died this is the original not a copy the hands that molded this marble were guided by eyes that beheld melancomas in the flesh the statue and the man himself occupied the same room in the same moment the painting was also done from life so the delicate colours of the flesh and the hair are as accurate as possible what you see before you may be the most truetolife image of melancomas that exists you can understand why i was so excited to obtain this piece during his brief but remarkable career the greek boxer melancomas had become the most famous athlete in the world the lifesize statue depicted a naked youth with his broad shoulders thrown back his brawny chest lifted and one muscular leg firmly planted before the other his shapely arms were extended before him wavy blond tresses framed his strikingly handsome face which expressed serene concentration as he used one hand to wind a leather strap around the other the statue was so realistically rendered and coloured that it seemed almost to breathe epaphroditus had chosen to install it not on a pedestal but at ground level so that instead of looming above them melancomas seemed to be standing among them the effect was uncanny melancomas had become famous for his unique fighting technique he hardly touched his opponents and on a few occasions won matches without landing a single blow using remarkable dexterity and stamina he could duck punches and dance around his opponents until they fell from exhaustion his bouts became legendary men came from great distances to see him compete there had never been another boxer like him an equal claim to fame had been his extraordinary beauty some said that melancomass face was the reason why so few blows were ever landed against him seeing such perfection no man had the heart to spoil it five years ago when titus then thirtythree presided at the augustan games in neapolis he took melancomas for a lover when the boxer died suddenly and unexpectedly titus had grieved and so had many others you wrote an elegy for melancomas did you not dio said epaphroditus the sophist needed no further encouragement to quote from his work he rose from his chair and stood before the statue when melancomas was naked nobody would look at anything else the human eye was drawn to his perfection as iron is drawn to the lodestone when we count the vast number of his admirers and when we consider that there have been many famous men and many beautiful men but none was ever more famous for being beautiful then we see that melancomas was blessed with a beauty that we may truly call divine dio inclined his head the others rewarded him with applause i saw melancomas myself on a few occasions he went on truly the statue does him justice what a dazzling throwback he was what a splendid anachronism why do you say that said lucius because nowadays the ideal of male beauty has become so very confused i blame the persians and their influence just as they gave the world astrology which has found its way into every corner of our culture so they introduced to us an ideal of male beauty very different from that handed down to us by our ancestors melancomas embodies the old ideal as long as there are young men like him we are reminded of that perfection which the old greeks quite literally put on a pedestal capturing it in stone for the world and for their descendants to witness and aspire to they believed that nothing in the world was more beautiful than the physical splendour of the masculine form which found its most sublime embodiment in the young athlete a runners legs and backside arms fit to throw a discus a lean and wellproportioned torso a face that radiates calm intelligence and the potential for wisdom such a youth is a model for other youths to aspire to he is a worthy protege to whom older men are drawn because he offers such great hope for the future the ideal offered by the persian is quite different they find women more beautiful than men and as a result they think the most beautiful young men are those who look most like girls they find beauty in pliable eunuchs and boys with slender limbs and soft bottoms more and more you see this taste for feminine beauty embraced by the greeks and romans as a result fewer and fewer young men aspire to the old ideal instead of hardening their muscles with exercise they pluck their eyebrows and put on cosmetics so a specimen like melancomas a youth whose splendour can be compared to the most famous of the old statues stands out all the more he is the exception that proves the rule our standard of male beauty now sadly is the persian standard and to think titus actually had the fellow said martial gazing at the statue over the brim of his cup and pursing his lips no wonder my dear patron was so heartbroken when the young man died frankly id settle for a boy onetenth as pretty as melancomas if the boy would simply show up have you been stood up again martial lucius smiled this was the poets perennial complaint yes again and this boy was so promising lygdus his name was he picked the place he picked the time and never appeared i was abandoned but not seduced left to consort with my left hand yet again the others laughed no matter how abstruse or rarefied the arguments put forward by the philosophers martial could be always counted on to bring the conversation back down to earth but can a boy be too beautiful asked dio can beauty pose a danger to its possessor especially the persian style of beauty what sort of danger said martial im thinking of writing a discourse on the question using as my subject the eunuch whom nero married sporus he was called his story fascinates me you knew sporus didnt you epaphroditus yes said epaphroditus quietly so did lucius epictetus also knew her the three of them exchanged thoughtful glances good perhaps the three of you can give me further details to advance my argument everybody knows nero castrated the youth and took him for a wife precisely because of the boys resemblance to the beautiful poppaea nero dressed sporus in poppaeas clothing made hairdressers style his hair in the fashion of the day and surrounded the boy with female attendants just as if he were a woman otho was drawn to sporus for the same reason his resemblance to poppaea and then came vitellius who drove the poor eunuch to suicide out of a desire to exploit the boys beauty for his own depraved amusement what a strange and finally tragic path the boys life took all because of his resemblance to a beautiful woman had the boy been plain or had he been beautiful in the manner of melancomas one imagines his life would have been very different lucius looked at epictetus to see his reaction the stoics face was turned away from the others as if something at the far corner of the garden had drawn his interest when epictetus turned back his face showed no emotion martial laughed sporus was pretty but had an ugly end vitellius was ugly and had an uglier end perhaps you should write a discourse comparing those two dio dio shook his head as a rule i avoid discussing the lives of our emperors even those who came to a bad end my object is to deliver morals not debate politics but havent you heard said martial our enlightened new emperor has declared free speech for all no subject or person is offlimits not even titus himself allow me to quote my patron it is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way since i do nothing that deserves censure and falsehoods are beneath my notice as for emperors dead and gone they can avenge themselves if anyone should slander them if in fact they are demigods and possess divine power did you write that speech for him asked lucius i most certainly did not said martial titus is quite capable of writing his own speeches and what he says he means therell be no more payments to those who turn in others for seditious talk as happened under his father we all know vespasian had an army of paid informers and there are whole rooms in the imperial library filled with dossiers about perfectly innocuous citizens i suspect theres a file on every one of us here but titus has pledged to burn those documents and to put the informers out of work hell even punish the most notorious of them who maliciously spread lies about innocent men lucius sighed the subject shifts to politics at last i thought politics bored you said martial yes but only one thing bores me more talk about pretty boys the others laughed no hear me out said lucius every one of us here is a bachelor true but we are not all boylovers i think i must suffer from the emperor claudiuss complaint my father who knew him quite well told me for a fact that cousin claudius was aroused only by girls or women he had no interest in boys or men the beauty of melancomas would have been lost on him a discussion of male beauty no matter how grandiose would have bored him to tears martial laughed as it bbbores you lucius i think your cousin claudius simply never met the right bbboy our reigning emperor certainly doesnt suffer from claudiuss complaint observed dio titus buried his first wife divorced the second and despite his reputed dalliance with the beautiful queen of the jews and with brawny melancomas here he seems to like eunuchs best of all is it true martial that titus keeps a whole stable of pretty eunuchs in the palace its true each is prettier than the other a fact which provides yet more evidence for my thesis regarding the triumph of persian standards said dio youd think the emperor would seek another melancomas instead he surrounds himself with castrated boys lucius laughed and threw up his hands do you see whats happened the conversation veered briefly to politics then circled directly back to sex the subject is eunuchs who have no sex said martial enough declared their host to please lucius pinarius we will talk about something else surely there must be some other topic worthy of discussion in a world so enormous we could talk about the world itself suggested lucius did you know that the general agricola has discovered that britannia is an island its true the land mass to the uttermost north doesnt go on forever as people thought it ends in a stormy frigid sea dio laughed that information might be of some interest if anyone had a reason to go to britannia id much prefer to travel south epictetus youve hardly said a word didnt you just come back from campania yes i took a brief trip down to herculaneum and pompeii and then across the bay to baiae i may have found a rather lucrative position in the home of a very wealthy garum maker his villa is built right next to the manufactory which stinks of fermenting fish but the house has a spectacular view of the bay and the brat ill be teaching is not a complete barbarian but how could you bear to leave the city asked martial granted campania isnt roma said epictetus but anyone whos anyone in roma has a second home on the bay so interesting people are always coming and going the social scene is the same as in roma but along with dinner parties they have boating excursions and banquets on the beach some people live there yearround like your friend pliny you dropped in on him as i suggested said martial good old pliny a bit of a bore but always good for a drop of wine and a bed for the night i didnt find him boring at all in fact he told me about some rather odd things going on down there what sort of things said lucius strange phenomena said epictetus oh pliny loves that sort of thing said martial collects every odd fact in the world and puts them in a book hes rather worried about the earthquakes theyve been having youll have to get used to earthquakes if you move to campania noted epaphroditus there were a couple of big ones back in neros reign you must remember epictetus you were there with me when nero performed for the very first time in public in neapolis an earthquake struck the theatre in the middle of his song the ground surged like a stormy sea but nero just kept singing no one dared to get up afterwards he told me that he considered the earthquake a good omen because the gods were applauding him by shaking the ground the moment he was finished everyone got up and ran for the exits and no sooner was the place emptied than the whole building collapsed and what did nero do he composed a new song an ode of thanks to the gods since they saw fit to stave off the catastrophe until after he finished his performance and not a single person was injured ah nero epaphroditus wiped a nostalgic tear from his eye epictetus responded to the story with a brittle smile now that he was a freedman he no longer needed to pretend to share his former masters fond memories of nero but he was discreet enough to keep his opinions about the late emperor to himself yes earthquakes are common in campania he said but lately theyve been having two or three tremors every day it was nerverattling let me tell you and earlier this month a great many springs and wells in the vicinity ran dry sources of water that have always been reliable in the past pliny says that something must be happening deep in the earth it has people worried they say he lowered his voice they say that gigantic beings have been seen walking through the cities by night they skulk in the forests they even fly through the air giants said lucius titans one presumes the gods of olympus defeated them aeons ago and imprisoned them in tartarus the deepest caverns of the underworld the people in campania are afraid the titans have broken free and made their way to the surface that would explain the tremors and the divergence of the subterranean water channels these titans are always seen coming from the direction of mount vesuvius arent there caves at the summit of vesuvius said lucius i know theres a circular valley with steep sides at the top the rebel slave spartacus camped there with his army of gladiators epaphroditus cocked his head youve been reading titus livius lucius nodded i take down the scrolls i inherited from my father and dip into his history every so often epictetus continued to the locals vesuvius is best known for the vineyards and gardens on the slopes the soil is amazingly fertile but yes spartacus did hide his army there in the early days of the great slave revolt its a substantial mountain visible for miles around and far out to sea but not too difficult to scale because the slope is so gradual at the top theres a kind of hollowedout depression a desolate rocky flat place surrounded by steep craggy walls a perfect place for spartacus to make his camp since its hidden from sight and the walls form a kind of natural parapet all around it occurs to me that the summit of vesuvius is not unlike the new amphitheatre over there if you imagine the amphitheatre set atop a great mountain with the slopes coming up to its rim though of course the crater atop vesuvius is much larger among the rocks there are fissures that appear to have been singed by flame as if they once spat fire you see that sort of phenomenon still active in places all around campania but on vesuvius the fuel long ago gave out and the fissures closed up unless theyve opened up again because these titans are breaking out said martial epaphroditus shook his head i wouldnt put too much store in these supposed sightings of titans its my opinion and i suspect pliny would agree that the titans have long been extinct certainly they once existed occasionally excavating deep holes for foundations or canals people find bones so enormous they can only have belonged to the titans but the fact that one finds only bones would indicate that such beings must be extinct i should think that makes their appearance now all the more disturbing said lucius epictetus just told us that people have reported seeing these giant creatures in the cities in the woods even in the sky all these rumblings in the earth may be the portents of some terrible event epaphroditus gave him a quizzical look lucius knew what he was thinking despite his disavowal of any interest in augury lucius had just expressed a belief in divination without realizing it he had slipped a hand inside his toga and was touching the fascinum of his ancestors he often wore the talisman though never outside his clothes where it could be seen there was a sudden gust of wind it was not the mild westerly breeze that had provided some relief from the heat earlier in the day but a stronger warmer wind from the south the light changed as well though there was not a cloud in the sky the sun abruptly grew dim then dimmer still the sky grew dark the five friends stopped talking and exchanged uncertain glances an eerie silence descended the labourers at the amphitheatre stopped working the whole city was suddenly quiet epaphroditus began to cough so did lucius he moved to cover his mouth and found himself looking at the back of his hands they appeared to be covered with a fine white powder like marble dust he looked up and blinked the same white powder clotted his eyelashes he puckered and spat tasting ashes in his mouth pale dust fell from the sky not in drifts but evenly and steadily everywhere at once like snow falling in the mountains without a word all of them rose from their chairs and made their way to the shelter of the portico that bordered the garden on three sides as they watched the dust continued to descend the light of the sun was reduced to a faint glow the fall of dust was so thick that they could no longer see the amphitheatre what is it whispered lucius i have no idea said epaphroditus ive never seen anything like it its like something from a nightmare said dio from somewhere beyond the garden walls a voice cried out its the end of the world the shrill cry of panic ignited others from the neighbours all around they heard shouts of alarm the cries sounded strangely muted and far away the fall of ash grew so heavy that they could see nothing at all beyond the garden it was as if the world around them had utterly vanished at the centre of garden dust piled high atop the wavy hair of the statue of melancomas frosting his ears and covering his muscular shoulders and arms with a thick mantle of white ad what a year what a terrible terrible year said epaphroditus first the fiery eruption of vesuvius and the complete loss of pompeii and herculaneum whole cities buried as if they never existed a year to the day after the fall of ash on roma epaphroditus was again playing host to lucius and the others in his garden and then the outbreak of plague here in roma the plague that claimed your mother lucius chrysanthe was such a lovely woman she died before her time lucius nodded acknowledging his friends words of condolence his mothers death had been quick but not painless chrysanthe had suffered a great deal racked by fever and coughing up blood lucius had been with her at the end along with his three sisters he was not close to his siblings it was the first time in years that they had all been together that plague epaphroditus continued was caused so everyone assumes by that bizarre dust that fell on us after vesuvius erupted there must have been something toxic in that dust remember for a couple of days until word of the disaster at pompeii arrived we had no idea what the dust was or where it came from people thought the firmament itself was crumbling signalling the end of the universe who could imagine that a volcano could throw up so much debris they say the ash from vesuvius fell as far away as africa egypt and even syria then yet another disaster while the emperor was down in campania comforting the survivors that terrible fire broke out in roma three days and nights of conflagration that seemed to strike precisely those areas that were not burned during the great fire under nero the devastation extended from the temple of jupiter on the capitoline just repaired after the arson of vitellius all the way to theatre of pompeius on the field of mars and agrippas lovely temple called the pantheon which was totally gutted lucius pinarius nodded sombrely cities lost plague and fire in roma truly its been a terrible year and yet here are the five of us all alive and well the six of us if you count melancomas dio cast an appreciative glance at the statue melancomas will be here long after the rest of us are gone said epaphroditus terrible disasters agreed martial but no one can fault the emperor titus made quick restitution to the citizens in campania and began rebuilding the remaining cities around the bay then turned to restoring the burned areas of roma and without raising taxes mind you or making special appeals to the wealthy he did it all himself even stripping his own properties of ornaments to redecorate the temples and public buildings like a true father of the roman state to combat the plague titus did all that any man could seeking counsel from the priests and offering the appropriate sacrifices to the gods the emperors leadership in these times of crisis cannot be faulted said epaphroditus still people are badly shaken and fearful of the future which is why the opening of the amphitheatre could not have come at a more propitious time said martial they turned their gaze to the massive structure across the way the last of the scaffolds had been removed the curved travertine walls gleamed in the morning sunlight the niches formed by the multiple arches were filled with brightly painted statues of gods and heroes colourful pennants streamed from poles affixed to the rim the open space between the amphitheatre and the new baths was thronged with people on holiday this was the opening day of vespasians great dream the flavian amphitheatre are we ready to set out said lucius i think so said epaphroditus should i bring along a slave of course said martial well be there all day the slave can fetch food for us alas if only he could go to the latrina for us as well but there are still some tasks that cannot be delegated to a slave where will we put him said epaphroditus i imagine its like the theatre said martial theres bound to be a section at the back of the tier for everyones slaves you have the tokens said epaphroditus martial held up three tiny clay tablets upon which were stamped numerals and letters for yours truly the poet charged with witnessing the inaugural games and composing an official tribute in verse three excellent seats in the lowest tier were right next to the imperial box just behind the vestal virgins take good care of your ticket youll want it for a souvenir only three said lucius im not going said epictetus nor am i said dio but why not lucius i havent attended a gladiator show since i became a freedman said epictetus i certainly dont intend to see this one simply because it promises to be bigger and bloodier than any thats come before and you dio perhaps youve never noticed lucius but philosophers are seldom seen at gladiator shows unless they wish to stand up and address the crowd about the evils of such spectacles i dont think even our freespeechloving emperor would welcome such an interruption on this occasion but the gladiators wont even appear until later in the day said martial before that therell be a whole programme of spectacles i am well aware of the typical entertainment offered at such events said dio there will be the public punishment of criminals by various ingenious means intended ostensibly for the edification of the crowd but take a look at the faces in the stands are the spectators uplifted by the moral lesson or titillated by the humiliation and destruction of another mortal and there will undoubtedly be animal exhibitions these too are educational or so we are told since they give us a chance to see exotic creatures from far away places but the animals are never simply paraded for our perusal theyre made to fight one another or hunted down by armed men and killed yes yes lucius i know youre a hunter yourself so you appreciate an exhibition of fine marksmanship but again is it the hunters skills the spectators applaud or the sight of an animal being wounded and slaughtered and all that bloodshed is merely prelude to the gladiator matches where human beings are forced to fight for their lives for the amusement of strangers since at least the time of cicero there have been those of us who object to the spectacles of the arena which debase rather than elevate their audience the fact that such games have now been given a grander venue than ever before may be cause for the poet to celebrate but not the philosopher but dont you want to see the building said lucius you yourself have called it a monstrosity im not in love with it as epaphroditus is the thing is too big and too garish for my taste still theres never been a place like it and this is the opening day all of roma will be there all the more reason for a philosopher to stay away said dio its one thing when a city holds its gladiator shows at some rustic spot outside the gates in a natural setting where theres no pretense about whats taking place men sitting in the dirt watching other men kill each other but to take these blood sports and display them in a palatial setting surrounded by beautiful statues and fine architecture as if killing were simply another artistic endeavour to be appreciated and enjoyed by sophisticated people that in itself is offensive no man who considers himself a philosopher can lend his presence to such an event epictetus and i will find something better to do youre welcome to join us lucius ha martial waved back the philosophers and put his arm about luciuss shoulder you wont lure pinarius away from the most exciting event of the year to go sit on a hilltop and listen to you grumble about your bunions and how they must have been sent by the gods to test your endurance he pressed one of the tokens into luciuss hand now take that my friend and hold on to it tightly and dont let any philosopher talk you out of using it come along then everyone whos coming they parted ways in the street outside the house lucius watched the philosophers walk up the hill epictetus used his crutch dio took small steps and walked slowly to match the younger mans pace lucius felt an urge to join them but martial grabbed his toga and pulled him in the opposite direction the open space around the flavian amphitheatre was thronged with people a small crowd had gathered to watch a mime troupe perform a parody about a brawny gladiator and a senators wife who lusted after him behind her husbands back street vendors moved through the crowd offering goodluck charms freshly cooked bits of meat and fish on skewers little clay lamps with images of gladiators and tickets for excellent seats so crudely stamped that they had to be counterfeit long lines began to form at the entrances radiating outwards from the amphitheatre but there was no waiting at the gate to which martial led them the finely dressed men and women going in were clearly of a higher class than the citizens in ragged tunics queuing up at the other gates once through the entrance they found themselves in a finely appointed vestibule with a marble floor and elegant furniture the railings had ivory fittings and the walls were exquisitely painted with pictures of gods and heroes it reminds me of the golden house said epaphroditus see that mosaic of diana in front of the steps im almost certain that was lifted stone by stone from the anteroom to neros bed chamber it makes sense that the flavians would have stripped the golden house to decorate their amphitheatre said lucius but surely the entire structure isnt decorated this elaborately of course not said martial this is the section for important people magistrates visiting dignitaries vestal virgins and friends of the emperor such as yours truly only the best for my companions and look just as i promised theres a splendid buffet laid out for us right here in the vestibule and free wine what a privileged existence is the life of the poet they mingled in the vestibule for a while eating and drinking until a horn sounded and a crier came through the room calling for all to find their seats the men in togas and the women in elegant stolas began to drift to a marble stairway that led up to bright daylight lucius and his friends followed the crowd epaphroditus had described the scale of the amphitheatre and the way it was laid out epictetus had compared it to the circular valley now vanished at the summit of vesuvius but no amount of mere description could have prepared lucius for what he beheld from the top of the steps for a moment his mind could not take it in as the sound of fifty thousand people created a single dull roar so the sight of so many people in one place registered as a kind of blur an undifferentiated mass of humanity in which no individuals could be perceived but little by little as he stood on the landing he began to regain his bearings and his mind began to perceive what was near and what was far lucius had never experienced anything like that first moment inside the flavian amphitheatre that instant alone so disorienting that it was almost frightening yet so unique and thrilling was worth the excursion dio and epictetus were fools he thought to deprive themselves of such an experience which was surely to be had in no other place on earth he realized that he was standing not in full sunlight but in brightly filtered shade and looked up to see awnings like sails that extended from the uppermost parapet all around the building as he peered upwards squinting he saw that men were working the complicated rigging adjusting the angle of the awnings to block the sunlight martial pulled at his toga stop gawking like a bumpkin youre holding up the crowd come along they found their seats the great bowl of the amphitheatre encircled them below jugglers tumblers and acrobats of both sexes wearing scanty but brightly coloured costumes were already in the arena some were so close that lucius could see their faces others were small in the distance the scale of the place confounded him somewhere nearby a water organ was playing a lively tune have we missed the beginning of the show oh this isnt the show said martial this is just a trifle to keep the crowd amused while they file into their seats numas balls look how high theyve strung that tightrope can you imagine walking across that thing with another fellow on your shoulders it always gives me the shivers when they perform without a net why are the seats in front of us empty because the vestals havent yet arrived theyre often the last to show up at any public event even after the emperor ah but here he comes now titus and his retinue began to file into the imperial box the emperor was forty but looked younger thanks to his genial expression and a full head of hair not yet touched by grey he had married early and been widowed then remarried and almost as quickly divorced his second wife whose family was too closely associated with the pisonian conspiracy against nero he had not remarried since for female consorts he was flanked on one side by his grown daughter julia and on the other by his younger sister flavia domitilla several of his favourite eunuchs also attended him beautiful and exquisitely dressed creatures who at a glance seemed neither female nor male they exemplified what dio called the persian ideal of beauty the last members of the imperial family to enter the box were the emperors younger brother domitian with his wife and their sevenyearold son at twentyeight domitian looked almost as old as titus thanks to his dour expression and the fact that he had lost much of his hair gone was the glorious chestnut mane that had made him so conspicuous amid the flavian entourage during the last days of vitellius while titus smiled and waved enthusiastically to the crowd domitian hung back looking glum the brothers were known to have a stormy relationship after vespasian died domitian had publicly complained that their fathers will specified that the brothers should rule jointly but that the document had been deliberately altered the implication was that titus himself had tampered with it some people believed domitian but most did not for one thing vespasian had always favoured his elder son for another he had expressed the opinion that one of the reasons why caligula and nero had come to a bad end was the fact that they rose to power at too young an age domitian was twelve years younger than titus and clearly lacked his brothers experience no one was quite sure of the proper etiquette in the new amphitheatre as the emperor continued to wave many in the crowd rose to their feet and waved back some cheered and applauded others remained seated epaphroditus was among those who stood and clapped his hands now there you see the head of an emperor he said to his companions they looked at him quizzically have i never told you the story of agrippina and the physiognomist i think i should have remembered that said martial it sounds quite naughty its not that kind of story long ago when nero was a boy and his mother was desperate to make him claudiuss heir agrippina called on an egyptian physiognomist to examine the head of claudiuss son britannicus do you know lucius i think it was your father who suggested the examination lucius shrugged ive never heard the story perhaps because it had a rather embarrassing outcome the egyptian was unable to draw any conclusions from britannicuss head but since britannicuss constant companion happened to be present the man took a look at his head as well that boy was none other than vespasians son titus the physiognomist declared he had never seen a head more fit to rule over other men people forgot about that incident for a long time but as you can see the egyptian turned out to be right where was domitian when this examination took place said lucius oh he was a baby hed only just been born what could be easier to read than a babys head since it has no hair said martial although domitian probably had more hair then than he does now there was a stirring in the crowd around them the vestal virgins had arrived and were taking their seats in the front row no one had been sure whether to stand for the emperor but everyone did so for the vestals they walked with such grace and poise that their linen mantles seemed to float atop their heads as the six women passed by lucius looked at their faces he had seen the vestals at public events but had never been this close to them before the badge of their office was the vitta a redandwhite band worn across their foreheads their closely shorn hair was hidden by a distinctive headdress called a suffibulum and their linen gowns obscured the shapes of their bodies so that all one could really see of them were their unadorned faces they were of various ages some old and wrinkled but some no more than girls vestals began their mandatory thirty years of service between the ages of six and ten and most remained vestals until they died it seemed to lucius they kept their eyes straight ahead and deliberately avoided making eye contact until one of them turned her head as she passed and looked straight at him the vestal was beautiful the fact that every feature except her face was hidden only accentuated her beauty two green eyes flashed beneath delicate eyebrows of dark blonde her full lips favoured him with a faint smile lucius felt a quiver run down his spine like a trickle of warm water her name is cornelia cossa whispered epaphroditus in his ear how old is she let me think she was only six when she was inducted into the sisterhood in the eighth year of neros reign that would make her twentyfour shes beautiful everyone says so the acrobats and jugglers dispersed the official ceremonies commenced with a series of religious rites an augury was taken and the auspices were declared highly favourable the priests of mars paraded around the arena chanting and burning incense an altar was erected in the centre of the arena the priests sacrificed a sheep to the war god and dedicated the amphitheatre in his honour the blood of the sacrificed animal was sprinkled in all directions onto the sand of the arena a proclamation by the emperor was read aloud in which he paid homage to his father whose military success architectural genius and love of the city had given birth to the amphitheatre the structure in which they had all gathered was the divine vespasians posthumous gift to the people of roma jewish warriors filthy naked and shackled with chains were driven at sword point around the arena by armed legionaries as a reminder of the great victory that had brought peace to the eastern provinces of the empire and secured the treasure that had paid for the amphitheatre the new baths and many other improvements all over the city vespasian had joined the gods but his legacy in stone the flavian amphitheatre would endure for all time the proclamation went on for some time luciuss mind began to wander he noticed that martial had pulled out a stylus and a wax tablet and was busy scribbling he assumed that his friend was taking down the words of the proclamation but the notes he was able to read had nothing to do with what they were hearing martial saw him scanning his notes random impressions he whispered you never know what might become a poem look at all these people how many races and nationalities do you think are represented here today lucius looked around them i have no idea nor do i but it seems to me the whole world is here in microcosm look at those blackskinned ethiopians over there and that group over there what sort of people have blonde hair and wear it twisted into knots like that sicambri i think theyre called a germanic tribe that lives at the mouth of the rhine river and before we took our seats in the vestibule i saw men in arabian headdresses and sabaeans from the red sea who wear black from head to foot and i smelled cilicians smelled them the women and boys and even the grown men of cilicia wear a very distinctive perfume made from a flower that grows only on the highest peaks of the taurus mountains youd know that pinarius if youd ever had a cilician boy he was interrupted by a shushing noise one of the vestals had turned around in her seat and was glaring at them she was old and wrinkled with a severe expression that intimidated even martial the vestal sitting next to her also turned and looked up at them it was cornelia cossa her calm smile and radiant beauty was in such contrast to her fellow priestess that lucius laughed out loud then regretted doing so at once fearing he had offended her but if anything cornelias smile widened a bit and there was a twinkle in her eye as she returned her attention to the crier who was reading the proclamation did you see that whispered martial she looked right at you lucius shrugged what of it she looked at you the way a woman looks at a man martial you are incorrigible go back to sniffing your cilician boys at last the various proclamations and invocations were finished the flavian amphitheatre was officially opened the spectacles began the first event was the scourging of the informers titus had promised to round up the worst offenders liars and scoundrels who made a living off the public purse by accusing innocent men of conspiring against the emperor or defrauding the state such creatures had been a blight on every reign since that of augustus no matter how sensible and confident an emperor might be at the beginning of his reign with each year that passed he and his ministers invariably grew more susceptible to baseless rumours and more fearful of imaginary enemies the hardheaded vespasian had been no more immune to poisonous slander than had his predecessors by the end of his reign many a man had suffered punishment based on groundless suspicion and many an unscrupulous informer had grown rich titus intended to make a clean break with the past the crowd murmured in anticipation as a large number of men were driven at spear point into the arena most wore togas and looked like respectable businessmen and property owners they were stripped first of their togas then of their tunics so that they wore nothing but loincloths like slaves though one seldom saw slaves as fat as most of these men in groups of ten the men were secured by the neck with twopronged pitchforks and forced to stand in place while they were beaten with whips and rods the beatings were severe bits of flesh and showers of blood were scattered across the sand even when the men collapsed to their knees they were forced by the pitchforks to hold their heads up do you see whos delivering the punishment said martial titus chose a corps of officers made up entirely of nomadic gaetulians from north africa why the gaetulians said lucius for one thing theyre outsiders with no connection to the victims or to anyone else in the city more importantly theyre famous for their cruelty it certainly seemed to lucius that the gaetulians enjoyed their work so did the audience many of the victims more used to handing out such treatment to slaves than to receiving it reacted with a great deal of screaming and blubbering the more undignified the victims behaviour the more boisterous was the crowds reaction rather than tiring as the punishments proceeded the gaetulians were urged on by the cheering of the spectators and grew increasingly violent the later victims were more severely beaten than the first ones to even the punishment and to the delight of the crowd the first victims were scourged again many of the informers lost consciousness or could not stand after being scourged and had to be dragged from the arena a few of them died from the punishment not from scourging but from shame whispered martial taking notes those who survived would be sent into exile to live out their days on remote islands or in the worst cases would be sold into slavery at public auction more punishments followed the victims were all condemned criminals guilty of a capital offense murder arson or theft of sacred treasure from a temple the organizers of the games outdid themselves in the creation of special tableaux for the various ordeals staging several of them at once around the vast arena so that there was always something dramatic or suspenseful to engage the spectators the punishments were based on myths and legends with the victims playing parts like actors the fact that each victims suffering and death were not imaginary but real made their performances all the more riveting to watch in one of the tableaux the naked victim was chained to an elaborate stage set made to appear as a craggy cliff a crier proclaimed that the victim was a murderer who had killed his own father the audience booed and hurled curses at him he was a muscular man of middle age with a bristling beard a suitable candidate to play prometheus the titan who gave fire to mankind in defiance of jupiter to remind the audience of the story dancers dressed in animal skins circled the shackled titan waved torches and chanted a primitive song of thanksgiving the song was suddenly drowned out by a stage device hidden inside the rock face which loudly reproduced the sound of thunder at this sign of jupiters wrath the worshippers of prometheus dispersed in panic as soon as they were out of the way two bears were unleashed the animals headed straight for the bound prometheus who began to scream and struggle frantically against his chains bears epaphroditus wrinkled his nose everyone knows prometheus was tormented by vultures every day they tore out his entrails and every night he was miraculously healed so that the ordeal was endlessly repeated martial laughed the trainer who can induce vultures to attack on command will be able to name any price i suspect well see a lot of bears today the emperors beast trainer tells me that bears are by far the best choice when it comes to attacking human victims hounds are too common elephants too squeamish lions and tigers too unpredictable bears on the other hand are not only terrifying but extremely reliable these come from caledonia the northernmost part of the island of britannia the bears who converged on the helpless prometheus lived up to their trainers expectations they concentrated their furious attack on the mans midsection ripping out his entrails just as the vultures were said to have done in the ancient story martial voiced the opinion that the bears had been trained especially to attack that part of the mans body epaphroditus suspected that honey had been smeared on the mans belly the victims screams were bloodcurdling at length the bears trainer appeared and shooed them away the stage set was wheeled about in a circle so that the gory sight of the disembowelled prometheus could be seen by everyone in the stands then the dancers reappeared pirouetting and lamenting before prometheus waving their torches so that they produced a great deal of smoke only after they ran off did lucius realize that the purpose of their dance and the smoke was to distract the audience from a bit of stagecraft being performed on the victim as if by magic his entrails had been stuffed back inside him and his belly had been stitched up even the blood on his legs had been wiped clean the man was extremely pale but apparently conscious his lips moved and his eyelids flickered just as the punishment of prometheus was said to be repeated in an endless cycle so this victim had been made ready for yet another assault by the bears again they came loping towards him the man opened his mouth to scream but no sound came out instead of struggling against his chains he twitched and convulsed as the bears proceeded to disembowel him again eventually even the twitching stopped the dancers reappeared they cast aside their torches flinging them onto the stage set the mock cliff went up in flames consuming the body of the victim with it the dancers circled the bonfire joined hands and sang a song of jubilation praising the wisdom and justice of jupiter lucius found himself wondering what epictetus and dio would have made of the tableau the victim was not just a murderer but the very worst sort of murderer a parricide surely he deserved to be punished and why should his death not be used to educate the public the tableau taught a double lesson first while men might sympathize with a rebel like prometheus the authority of the king of the gods and by extension the authority of the emperor must be respected and would always triumph in the end second on a more basic level no man should dare to kill his own father for fear of suffering such a terrible fate lucius suspected that his philosopher friends would be unmoved by such arguments he himself was left feeling more queasy than uplifted by the spectacle there were a great many other such tableaux as martial had predicted bears featured prominently in most of them a temple thief was made to reenact the role of the robber laureolus made famous by the ancient plays of ennius and naevius he was nailed to a cross and then subjected to the attack of the bears a freedman who had killed his former master was made to put on a greek chlamys and go walking though a stage forest populated by cavorting satyrs and nymphs like orpheus lost in the woods when one of the satyrs played a shrill tune on his pipes the trees dispersed and the man was subject to an attack by bears an arsonist was made to strap on wings in imitation of daedalus ascend a high platform and then leap off the wings actually carried him aloft for a short distance a remarkable sight until he plunged into an enclosure full of bears and was torn to pieces a bit repetitious isnt it ending all the tableaux with bears said epaphroditus ah but those are lucanian bears not caledonian said martial good italian beasts not exotic stock from beyond the sea see how the people cheer them on poor daedalus never stood a chance after the punishments there was an intermission acrobats once again ran onto the sand floor of the arena lucius and his friends went to the vestibule for refreshments and then to relieve themselves at the nearest latrina where the quality of the bronze and marble fixtures was the finest lucius had ever seen in a public facility martial joked that he felt unworthy to relive himself amid such splendour while his friends lingered in the vestibule lucius returned to his seat down in the arena the lifeless body of an acrobat was being carried off what thats about he wondered aloud the poor fellow was walking across a tightrope when he lost his balance and fell the voice came from the row in front of him all the vestals had left for the intermission except one she turned in her seat and looked straight at him lucius stared back at cornelia he could think of nothing to say the vestal finally broke the silence he was hardly more than a child i think they should use nets dont you i believe they practise with nets lucius said but they never perform with them that would eliminate the suspense it would still display their skill i for one have no desire to see a tightrope walker die whats the point such a death is simply an accident not a punishment or the outcome of a ritual combat theyre acrobats not murderers or gladiators whats your name the question was so abrupt he simply stared at her its not a difficult question surely she laughed there was nothing malicious in her laugh the sound of it gave him pleasure lucius pinarius he said my father was titus pinarius ah yes i know the name though there dont seem to be a great many of you about these days there was a time when the pinarii were quite prominent said lucius more than one pinaria was a vestal one was rather famous but that was a long time ago she nodded thats right the vestal pinaria was among those trapped atop the capitoline hill when the gauls sacked the city we still talk about her and pass down the story to the new sisters thats why your name is so familiar she looked him up and down youre not wearing a senators toga not a politician then nor are you a military man i think how did you merit such a choice seat on opening day youre awfully forthright said lucius when youre a vestal theres really no point in being circumspect i say what i mean and i ask what i want to know perhaps its different for other women i dont know a lot about women he admitted now whos being forthright here come my friends he said one of them is a poet the emperor likes his work thats why we have such good seats martial will write verses to celebrate the inaugural games ah i wondered who that fellow was constantly chattering and scribbling on his wax tablet ill introduce you if you like lucius stood to let martial pass when he looked back cornelia had turned away the other vestals had returned to their seats the programme recommenced with a series of animal exhibitions first a brightly decorated elephant with a trainer on its back ascended a ramp to a platform then walked down a tightrope while the spectators were still crying out in amazement the elephant sauntered towards the imperial box emitted a trumpetlike cry from its trunk then folded its forelegs and dropped forward making a very dignified bow to the emperor the spectators responded with the first standing ovation of the day hunting exhibitions followed all manner of creatures were released chased and slain boars gazelles antelopes ostriches the huge wild bulls of the germanic lands called aurochs and even the spindlylegged longnecked creatures from farthest africa called cameleopards because they had a face like a camel and spots like a leopard the hunters stalked their prey on foot and on horseback using various weapons bows and arrows spears knives nets and even nooses lucius who enjoyed hunting boars and stags on his country estates watched the exhibitions with interest and a bit of envy especially when the hunters pursued the rarer or more dangerous animals since he himself would probably never have the opportunity to bring down a cameleopard or an aurochs as the slaughter continued attendants with wheelbarrows and rakes covered the pools of blood with fresh sand there were also exhibitions in which animals were pitted against each another the audience thrilled to see a leopard stalk and fell a cameleopard by leaping onto its huge neck like a siege tower brought down by a catapult muttered martial searching for a metaphor a tigress had less luck pursuing an ostrich the absurdity of a bird unable to fly was obvious but the creature could run with amazing speed the tigress eventually gave up the chase and crouched panting on the sand the spectators laughed and shouted mockery at the feline disgusted by a cat unable to catch a flightless bird but when the tigresss mate was unleashed the same spectators fell silent and watched in fascination as the two cats appeared to use a coordinated strategy to trap the ostrich the bird ran this way and that as the cats closed in my old friend pliny not long before vesuvius put an end to him wrote that the ostrich hides its head in a bush when attacked and thinks its whole body is concealed said martial see how the attendants have placed bits of shrubbery all around the arena so that the bird may demonstrate its foolish behaviour but the ostrich did not hide its head eventually in desperation it used its long powerful legs to kick furiously at the nearest tiger this gained the ostrich a brief respite but the bird was quickly exhausted while the tigers seemed to find fresh strength the ostrich at last resorted to lying flat on the ground with its long neck and head pressed against the earth in the rippling haze of heat that rose from the sand the bird looked like a lifeless mound of earth and for a while the cats were confounded they circled the prostrate motionless bird sniffing the air and growling at last the tigress began to paw at the ostrich which gave a twitch whereupon the feline pounced and seized the ostrichs long neck in its powerful jaws the two cats hissed at each other and fought over the carcass for a while much to the amusement of the audience then settled down to share the feast when they were done attendants plucked the huge feathers from the dead bird and handed them out as souvenirs to the nearest spectators who used them to decorate their clothing or fan themselves to see an animal hunted whether by a man or by another animal thrilled the audience but far more exciting was the spectacle of seeing one fearsome beast pitted against another in equal combat for the inaugural games the emperor had arranged a pairing that had never been seen before first a wild aurochs was released into the arena the gigantic bull had huge horns and a fiery temper as was demonstrated when trainers behind wooden enclosures taunted the creature by throwing red balls at it the aurochs charged at the cloth balls and managed to spear one of them on his right horn the clinging ball angered the creature even more he snorted and tossed his head furiously until the ball went flying into the stands spectators leaped to their feet shoving and struggling against one another to claim it next a creature that many of those present had never seen before was released into the arena this was the rare rhinoceros a beast whose ironcoloured flesh appeared to be made of plated armour and whose enormous nose terminated in a formidable pair of horns one large and one small as fearsome as the aurochs might be it was clearly a relative of the domesticated bull familiar even to the citydwellers of roma and was a creature of grace and beauty but the rhinoceros was like no other animal an exotic being from the ends of the earth by taunting both animals with balls prods and torches driving them closer and closer together the trainers eventually induced them to fight their methods of combat were so similar that one seemed to be the distorted mirror image of the other they stood their ground stamped their feet shook their haunches lowered their heads and finally charged on the first clash they only grazed each other as if each were merely testing his opponent they drew apart faced each other then charged again this time the aurochs delivered a glancing blow against the rhinoceros which snorted in pain the wagering in the stands which had been heavily against the aurochs was suddenly reversed on the third charge the rhinoceros demonstrated its brute strength and the sheer power of its horn the creature landed a shuddering blow against the aurochss head the bull was dazed while it staggered and stumbled the rhinoceros backed away just enough to reposition itself for a fresh charge then struck the aurochs with such power that the beast was thrown clear into the air before it plummeted to the ground landing on its side the aurochs beat its hooves against the ground but was unable to stand again the rhinoceros charged sinking its horn into the aurochss vulnerable flank and throwing it into the air again the aurochs bellowed out in pain when it struck the ground it thrashed it limbs for a moment then threw back its head and expired the rhinoceros goaded the carcass for a while then appeared to realize that its opponent was no longer a threat it charged one of the attendants who ducked behind a wooden enclosure the rhinoceros struck the enclosure with such force that its horn became stuck in the wood this provoked laughter in the audience but also posed a problem for the trainers how could the rhinoceros be pulled free while the animal was in such a fury no one dared get close to it finally someone decided to make the best of the situation by improvising yet another combat a bear was released and driven towards the rhinoceros the audience spontaneously rose to its feet in excitement no one could imagine how this unscheduled unprecedented combat would proceed if the rhinoceros remained trapped and unable to move it would be completely at the mercy of the bear unless its armourlike flesh offered adequate protection against the bears sharp claws the bear landed a few blows against the rhinoceross haunches drawing blood but these served only to incite the beast to exert the effort necessary to free itself to the sound of splintering wood the rhinoceros at last extricated its horn once the rhinoceros was mobile again the bear stood no chance just as the aurochs had been tossed into the air so was the bear which landed with a gaping wound in its belly and did not get up again trainers moved in to corral the rhinoceros which was surprisingly docile once its fury was expended the spectators remained on their feet and enthusiastically cheered the beast which had triumphed in not one but two death matches without even pausing to rest one of the acrobats ran up to touch the horn for luck the startled rhinoceros jerked its head and the small but powerful movement knocked the man flat on his back the audience gasped then roared with laughter when the acrobat sprang to his feet and made his exit by executing a series of nimble cartwheels and backflips passing the acrobat on his way out a massively muscled man strode into the arena he wore only the briefest of loincloths and a hooded cloak made from a lions pelt clearly he was meant to be hercules about to perform one of his famous labours a bull was released into the arena streamers of yellow blue and red on its horns identified it as cretan bull the creature that sired the monstrous minotaur on queen pasiphae the man playing hercules flexed and preened for the crowd looking supremely confident even as the bull snorted and stamped its feet when the bull charged the man grabbed its horns and vaulted onto its back crouching as he held the horns he managed to stay on the bulls back even as it furiously bucked and kicked its hind legs when the bull at last began to tire the man leaped off in a remarkable show of strength he seized the bull by the horns twisting them this way and that until he forced the bull to kneel before him the sight of a man overcoming a bull with his bare hands would have been amazing enough but this contest was only the first stage of the spectacle while the bull wrestler held the beast immobile in the very centre of the arena a team of men ran onto the field and fitted a harness on the bull a rope descended from the sky it seemed to have appeared from nowhere but in fact it was part of a system of ropes and winches that stretched from one side of the amphitheatre to the other across its highest point from rim to rim above the canvas awnings the hoisting mechanism had been put in place while all eyes were on hercules wrestling the bull the dangling rope was hooked to the harness on the bull the man playing hercules mounted the beast the rope drew taut and the bull began to rise into the air when its hooves lost contact with the ground the bull panicked and began to buck violently spinning wildly in midair the rider clutched the rope with one arm and waved the other he threw back his head with a raucous shout higher and higher the bull rose looking upwards to follow its ascent the spectators were dazzled by the sun the bull and its rider became a silhouette and the thin rope seemed to vanish the bull appeared to be running through the air flying without wings small brightlycoloured objects showered down on the audience from above the little squares of parchment flitted and skipped on the air like butterflies blinded by the sun no one could tell where the little tokens came from as they descended by the thousands as they landed amid the crowd there were cries of joy and excitement a loaf of bread my token says i receive a free load of bread ha mines a lot better than that i get a silver bracelet and i get a basket of sausages and cheese thatll feed my family for a month people began to compete for the little squares of parchment jumping for them as they descended or scrambling for those that fell underfoot the scene was chaotic but jubilant titus manipulates them as if they were children said epaphroditus with a sigh looking at the token in his hand which promised a jar of garum you sound wistful said lucius im thinking of the old days what might nero have achieved if hed built this amphitheatre instead of the golden house and if hed known how to please the people they dont want to see an emperor play oedipus on the stage they want to see a bull fly through the air speaking of the bull where did it go said martial lucius looked up squinting at the sunlight the bull and its rider were nowhere to be seen nor was the contraption that had hoisted them into the air bull rider and rigging had all vanished somehow while everyone were distracted by the shower of tokens creating the illusion that the bull had carried hercules to olympus melting into the ether as others in the audience began to realize what had happened another tumultuous round of acclamations rang through the amphitheatre amid the jubilation a second intermission was announced while lucius and his friends stood and stretched themselves a welldressed messenger appeared and spoke in martials ear martials eyes grew wide all three of us he said the man nodded martial turned to his friends a humble poets dream come true follow me both of you without waiting he hurried off where is he taking us said lucius to epaphroditus i imagine one of his patrons is hosting a private party during the intermission said epaphroditus more food more wine lucius glanced over his shoulder cornelia was standing and conversing with one of her fellow vestals she turned her face in his direction he tried to hang back hoping to exchange parting glances but epaphroditus grabbed his arm and pulled him along they followed martial and the courier through the vestibule then past a cordon of praetorians and down a splendidly decorated hallway that terminated in a flight of porphyry steps the purple marble shone with veins of crimson under the filtered sunlight martial skipped up the steps following the courier he looked back and saw that his friends were hesitating dont just stand there you two come along lucius ascended the marble steps into the imperial box his heart racing he looked at epaphroditus for reassurance but the older man normally so calm and selfpossessed appeared to be as flustered as lucius himself what was epaphroditus feeling once he had lived at the very centre of power but for more than ten years he had been retired from imperial service living a modest quiet existence occasionally waxing nostalgic for his glory days under nero but more often content to sit in his garden and talk about philosophy and literature with epictetus and dio nero was long gone the golden house had been demolished and dismantled epaphroditus had survived but in the new world of the flavians he was a forgotten man they were led before the emperor who remained seated with his sister on one side and his daughter on the other his brother stood nearby the courier presented martial and epaphroditus and then lucius heard his own name spoken aloud and had the presence of mind to step forward the emperor gave each of them a gracious nod tituss cheeks and forehead were flushed his eyes glittered with excitement so martial these fellows are members of your little circle the friendly critics who have the privilege of hearing your poems even before i do yes caesar and a good thing that is or else caesars ears would be subjected to some very bad poems that other writer fellow you consort with the one who wrote that lovely elegy for melancomas dio of prusa yes thats the one is dio not with you alas caesar dio is indisposed what a liar you are martial i know dios philosophical bent admit that the man is not here today because he objects to such games on principle i may have heard him utter some such nonsense titus nodded well the world shall be deprived of dios impressions of the days spectacles but i do look forward to reading yours have the proceedings inspired you exceedingly caesar to enter the amphitheatre of the flavians is to be transported into a world where perfect justice reigns and the gods walk among us i wish i never had to leave titus laughed see if you feel the same after sitting through the next few hours i have the best seat in the house and my backside is already numb oh im not complaining the animal hunts were splendid truly firstrate though on such a fine day id rather be out hunting myself hadnt you lucius pinarius im told youre a hunter lucius was taken aback surprised that the emperor knew anything at all about him much less such a personal detail had titus gleaned the information from one of vespasians old dossiers yes caesar i do enjoy hunting but there are no cameleopards or aurochs on my estate no you really should get some the thing with the bull that was really quite something wasnt it the engineers assured me they could pull it off but i was biting my lip there for a while let me tell you what a mess if the rope had broken but i should never have doubted my trusty engineers just give those fellows a winch and some rope and then get out of their way as my father used to say if they can hurl a missile over the walls of jerusalem and hit the forehead of a jewish priest on the dome of the temple why shouldnt they be able to make a bull fly but i fear the best of the day is over at least for me id go home right now if i had the option nothing left but the bestiarii and the gladiators carpophorus is on the bill the best bestiarius in the world able to kill any animal hes matched against with his bare hands if he has to fun to watch but expect no surprises and then the gladiators who wants to see a lot of fat sweaty men spill each others blood i saw enough gore in jerusalem to last a lifetime but i suppose its a novelty to these layabouts in roma who never venture farther than the appian gate of course my brother loves that sort of thing dont you domitian he could watch gladiators strut and stab each other all day long he gets quite excited by a good match nero was bored by gladiator shows wasnt he epaphroditus epaphroditus blinked i suppose he was caesar domitian stepped forward with his arms crossed and an unpleasant expression on his face his young son watching him intently likewise crossed his arms and glowered you only suppose said domitian i thought you knew nero quite well with him to the bitter end werent you titus had been making conversation with his guests playing the role of the congenial emperor which his father had perfected his brothers aggressive tone made everyone uncomfortable including his family members epaphroditus is not here to be questioned said domitilla like her brothers she had the broad face and prominent nose typical of the flavians her temperament seemed closer to that of the affable titus than to the dour domitian epaphroditus cleared his throat i suppose i knew nero as well as anyone especially in his last days caesar is quite correct nero was not much interested in blood sports preferred plays and poetry and that sort of thing didnt he said titus helpfully my versatile brother likes both gladiators and poetry dont you domitian quite a poet himself wrote a rather good one about the battle on the capitoline hill when that fiend vitellius set the temple of jupiter on fire domitian saw it all with his own eyes came up with some verses so vivid i feel i was there myself i smell the smoke and hear the screams just the sort of thing i want you to do martial for the games today no one who sees these games will have need of my verses caesar for they shall never forget them said martial but to the unfortunate few who miss this occasion i will strive to convey some small hint of the glorious sights and sounds ive witnessed however inadequate my words maybe domitian snorted the unfortunate few who arent here today including your friend dio who are these philosophers to think theyre so much better than everyone else it was our fathers dream to see this amphitheatre opened he died before that could happen but we persevered without him titus put a great deal of work into these games we all did more care and effort than a donothing like your friend dio could possibly imagine yet the philosopher thinks himself too good to accept this generous gift to the people of roma some men are simply squeamish said titus charitably cicero had no stomach for gladiator shows nor did seneca but they attended them nonetheless said domitian these games are as much a solemn duty as they are a celebration brother those who dont attend indeed who make a show of their absence disparage the memory of our father i wouldnt go that far little brother but you make an excellent point gladiator games began as a way to honour the dead our ancestors forced prisoners to fight to the death at the funeral games to mark the passing of great men weve come a long way from those early days as the building of this amphitheatre demonstrates what would romulus with his thatched hut make of this place nonetheless the gladiator games today hearken back to the very first such games because they honour the passing of a great man our father every drop of blood spilled today will be shed in his honour and every drop of wine poured today should be drunk in his honour said martial the words were risky breaking the somber mood created by the emperor but the risk paid off titus smiled at martials turn of phrase and raised his cup let us drink then to the divine vespasian said titus wine was poured for the guests as lucius raised his cup he was suddenly conscious of the extraordinary nature of the moment he stood in the imperial box close enough to touch all three children of the divine vespasian sharing wine with caesar himself and all because of his friendship with a poet lucius and his friends returned to their seats the games resumed with a series of matches between men and beasts culminating in the appearance of the famed carpophorus who was in excellent form uncannily nimble for a man so heavily muscled and apparently able to read an animals thoughts as he anticipated his opponents every movement lulled by the afternoon heat and too much wine lucius dozed during carpophoruss long performance waking intermittently to witness the bestiarius armed with a dagger to fight a bear armed with a club to fight a lion and taking on not one but two bison with his bare hands each time he killed a beast carpophorus slung the carcass over his brawny shoulders and paraded around the arena to show it off waking and dozing and seeing nothing but carpophorus in combat over and over again lucius seemed trapped in an endlessly repeating dream of slaughter at last lucius was roused by a thunderous ovation as the multitude rose to its feet to acclaim the bestiarius after his final match lucius stood with the rest he blinked yawned and rubbed his eyes how many animals did the fellow kill he asked martial what werent you counting along with everyone else i dozed you and the emperor both i imagine carpophorus took on a total of twenty animals one after another that must be a record and he suffered hardly a scratch the mans invincible if they want to find an even match for him they shall have to bring in a hydra or maybe one of those firebreathing bulls that jason encountered in the land of colchis the gladiator matches followed lucius was glad that epictetus and dio had not come the contests were bloodier than any he could recall and seemed endless stretching on for hour after hour long before the final match between two of the most famous gladiators priscus and verus lucius thought that even the most ardent lover of the games must be sated but as priscus and verus engaged lucius looked at the imperial box and saw domitian standing at the parapet clutching the railing with white knuckles watching the contest with rapt attention and responding with his whole body jerking scowling grunting clenching his teeth and exclaiming under his breath his little boy stood beside him mimicking everything his father did meanwhile the emperor remained seated watching the match without emotion occasionally casting a sardonic glance at his agitated brother and nephew priscus was a gladiator of the thracian type wearing a broadbrimmed helmet with a grille that covered his face and a griffin ornament greaves covered his legs up to the thighs and he carried a small round shield and curved sword verus was a murmillo the traditional opponent of a thracian so called for the mormylos a fish that decorated his helmet his right leg was padded with a thick gaiter and he was armed like a roman legionary with a short sword and a tall oblong shield the two fighters were so evenly matched that neither seemed able to draw blood from the other but the gracefulness of their movements was so striking and the violence of their sudden clashes so thrilling that theirs was by far the most exciting contest of the day even titus stopped chatting with his sister and daughter and sat forward in his chair while his brother became increasingly animated there was no doubt which gladiator domitian favoured he kept shouting the name of verus and when a senator seated nearby began to yell encouragement to the thracian domitian hurled a cup at the man and told him to shut up titus rolled his eyes at the sudden outburst but made light of it perhaps the murmillo should add a wine cup to his weaponry my brother draws more blood than does verus today the senator who was using a fold of his toga to stanch the bleeding from a cut on his forehead flashed a crooked smile to acknowledge the emperors wit the match had many high points and suspenseful moments eliciting gasps and shrieks and even some outbursts of weeping from the exhausted sundazed spectators a last titus put an end to it he rose to his feet and gave a signal to the master of the games to stop the contest priscus and verus removed their helmets faces covered with sweat chests heaving they gazed up at the emperor awaiting his judgement in one hand titus held a wooden sword the traditional gift to a gladiator who had earned his freedom after such a closely fought match with no clear victor to which gladiator would he grant the sword the partisans of the two gladiators began to chant their names priscus priscus and verus verus the two groups were so evenly dispersed throughout the stands that the names merged into a jumbled shout of two syllables the emperor disappeared from the imperial box the crowd grew confused and the chanting trailed off until a gate beneath the imperial box opened and titus strode into the arena his appearance on the bloodstrewn sand thrilled the crowd which gave a deafening roar as titus approached the two waiting gladiators holding the wooden sword before him titus reached the gladiators his back was to lucius who found himself wishing he could see the emperors expression the crowd began to chant the names of their favourites again titus stepped forward the crowd fell silent titus paused instead of awarding the wooden sword he raised his left arm to show that he was carrying a second sword stepping forward he presented the wooden swords to both gladiators at once verus and priscus were both declared victors both were rewarded with freedom such a thing had never been done before as the grinning gladiators lifted their wooden swords high in the air the spectators rose to their feet in the last and most thunderous ovation of the day at first they shouted the names of the gladiators but gradually the mingled roar resolved into a single word repeated over and over caesar caesar caesar lucius scanned the vast bowl of the amphitheatre he had never seen so many people in one place or so vast an outpouring of emotion at the very centre of it all was the emperor titus was still a young man with luck he might reign for many years until lucius himself was old he had certainly made an auspicious beginning all the disasters and trials of the last year the destruction of pompeii the plague in roma the fire that had devastated the city were eclipsed by the stunning success of the inaugural games titus had not merely distracted the citizens he had inspired them with a sense of unity and restored confidence more feasting and plays and spectacles would follow in the days ahead at venues all over the city but it was hard to imagine anything that could match the splendour of the opening day of the flavian amphitheatre the two gladiators made their exit the emperor gave a final salute to the people and left the arena the imperial box was empty the arena was deserted there were no more acrobats no more contests no more spectacles to behold as he gazed at the thousands of spectators around him it occurred to lucius that the crowd itself was the true spectacle seated in a circle with everyone visible to everyone else the spectators had spent as much time watching one another as they had watching the games the sound of the gathering whether a murmur or a roar was intoxicating the acoustics of the place could capture a whisper or a laugh from across the way or amplify the roar of the crowd to superhuman volume already the great amphitheatre had taken on a life of it own from that day forward this would be the gathering place for all roma rich and poor great and small the living embodiment of the spirit of the city and the will of its people the world outside the amphitheatre might pose dangers beyond human control plague earthquake fire flood all the perils of war but within the protective shell of the amphitheatre existed a cosmos in miniature where the people of roma were like gods gazing down at the little world of the arena where mortals and beasts lived and died at their whim perhaps epictetus and dio should have come lucius thought how else could they understand the collective grandeur experienced by the spectators and who but his philosopher friends could help lucius make sense of the curious feeling of detachment that cast a cold shadow over his enjoyment of that moment that drained the experience of its glamour and made it seem hollow and empty amid the blur of so many faces and the dull throbbing roar of so many voices lucius suddenly felt more alone than he had ever felt before in his life but he was not alone amid the vast crowd two eyes looked back at him surrounded by her fellow vestals close enough to touch if had dared to do so cornelia was smiling at him she said nothing nor did she need to lucius knew he would see her again ad lucius made ready to set out from his house on the palatine dressed not in his toga but in a worn brown tunic borrowed from one of his household slaves no roman wife married to a man of property would have allowed her husband to leave the house looking so drab and nondescript but at thirtyseven lucius still had no wife nor had he any intention of acquiring one he came and went as he pleased unconstrained by concerns of family or by most of the societal obligation that applied to men of his age and wealth as he stepped out the front door his heart began to race how absurd he thought that a man his age should feel such adolescent excitement at the prospect of a sexual tryst and with a woman who had been his lover for more than three years yet the thrill he felt at seeing her never diminished it grew stronger was it the danger that excited him or was it because they were able to meet so seldom which made each occasion special he looked up at the cloudless sky he would have preferred the anonymity of a hooded cloak but on a hot summer day such a garment might attract more attention than it deflected he took a few steps down the narrow street then looked back at his house how absurdly big the place was for a single man to dwell in a huge staff of slaves was required just to keep the place running sometimes he felt that the slaves were the true inhabitants and he was simply an occupant how he preferred the tiny house on the esquiline that was his destination the place he had purchased for the sole purpose of meeting his lover he made his way down the slope of the palatine and across the heart of the city passing the arch of titus and the flavian amphitheatre glancing up at the towering colossus of sol he passed through the crowded subura hardly conscious of the noise and the odors he ascended the steep winding path up a spur of the esquiline hill and paused for breath at the little reservoir called the lake of orpheus so named because the splashing fountain was decorated by a charming statue of orpheus with his lyre surrounded by listening beasts the house of epaphroditus was nearby but lucius turned in a different direction at last he arrived at his destination the house was small and unassuming with nothing to distinguish it the door was made of unpainted wood without even a knocker for ornament he pulled a key from his tunic and let himself in there was no doorkeeper to admit him there were no slaves at all in the house that in itself made the house a special place where did a man ever go in roma where he could be truly alone without even slaves present she was waiting for him in the tiny garden at the centre of the house reclining on a couch she must have only just arrived for she was still dressed in the hooded cloak she had worn to cross the city unlike lucius she could not possibly go out in public without hiding her face even on a day as hot as this he sat beside her without saying a word he pulled back the hood the sight of her short blonde hair excited him it gave her a curiously boyish look and made her different from other women only the other vestals and their female servants ever saw her like this without her headdress the sight of her cropped hair like the sight of her naked body was his alone a privilege both sacred and profane that was enjoyed by no other man on earth he ran his fingers through her hair intoxicated by a sense of possession he put his mouth on hers and tasted her sweet breath he slid his hands inside the cloak and touched warm sleek flesh he gasped beneath the cloak she was wearing nothing at all not even a sleeping gown or a simple tunic she had crossed the city like this naked except for slippers and a hooded cloak madness he whispered he pushed back the cloak and buried his face against her neck she laughed softly touching her lips to the inner folds of his ear nipping gently at the earlobe with her teeth she opened the cloak and let it fall so that she was suddenly naked in his arms he threw off his tunic and made love to her as quickly and desperately as a boy it was selfish of him because he knew she preferred a much slower rhythm but she indulged him and seemed to draw pleasure from his trembling uncontrollable excitement all his emotions crested at once and poured from him in a flood he wept which aroused her as if to draw more tears from him she dug her fingernails into his back and drew him closer to her exerting a strength that never failed to surprise him wrapping her limbs around him as the tendrils of a vine embrace a stone he did not have to work to reach the climax it came upon him unbidden like a fire that consumes all before it it consumed her as well for he felt her shudder against his sweating flesh and clench the part of him inside her she cried out so long and so loudly that people in the neighbouring houses must have heard let them hear he thought they would know they heard a woman in ecstasy but they could not know she was a vestal when it was over they lay close together their naked bodies touching saying nothing and savouring the afterglow when he had first met her he was struck at once by the beauty of her face but he could not have imagined how beautiful her body was it took his breath away the first time he saw her naked it still took his breath away over the years he had paid to take his pleasure with some of the most accomplished and alluring courtesans in roma but he had never known any woman with more beautiful breasts or more sensual hips than cornelia the voluptuous curves and the pale marmoreal perfection of her flesh induced him to explore every part of her with his hands eager to discover the most secret and sensitive parts of her body her breasts and hips were like those of venus ripe and womanly her slender calves her small hands and the hollows of her neck and throat were as smooth and delicate as those of a child she was beautiful she was also passionate not even the most skilled courtesan had ever responded to his touches with so much vitality or touched him so lewdly and shamelessly in return at times he felt he was the more vulnerable partner a quivering slave of pleasure at the mercy of a completely uninhibited lover able to give or withhold ecstasy with the merest brush of her fingers or the soft caress of her breath she was beautiful passionate and dangerous what he did with cornelia was not only illicit and irreverent it was illegal their lovemaking was a crime as serious as murder he took no perverse pleasure in that fact or so he told himself yet why had he chosen cornelia of all women deep down he sensed that the forbidden nature of their relationship played some role in his excitement but like a leaf caught on the flood he did not question how he had come to be in such a situation or make any attempt to resist the force that carried him along he simply accepted that he was at the mercy of a power greater than himself and submitted to it cornelia gave him the greatest physical pleasure he had ever experienced but she also fascinated him in ways that had nothing to do with her body he had never known a woman who could converse so knowledgeably about the world she was as educated as epictetus as witty as martial as worldly as dio as a vestal she knew everyone of importance and was in a position to follow everything of significance that happened in the city she was far more connected than was lucius to the spheres of politics and society she opened a window to those worlds through which he could gaze from a comfortable distance maintaining his customary detachment she was not only the best possible bedmate but the most interesting conversationalist he knew he could talk to cornelia about anything and what she had to say was always of interest as the glow of their frenzied lovemaking subsided and the sweat of their bodies cooled they gradually drew apart they lay side by side touching at the hips and shoulders staring at the ceiling above what excuse did you give this time he said for my absence from the house of the vestals ive assumed responsibility for looking after the lotus tree in the sacred grove attached to the temple of lucina here on the esquiline how much care does a lotus tree need this one is over five hundred years old we tend it very lovingly and what makes it special to the vestals all lotus trees are sacred theres a lotus tree in the grove next to the house of the vestals when a girl is inducted her hair is cut for the first time and the locks are hung on the tree as an offering to the goddess its a beautiful ceremony im sure it is somethings troubling you what is it lucius he sighed a messenger came to my house yesterday he delivered a letter from dio of prusa ah your dear friend who was exiled by the emperor where is the famous sophist now in dacia if you can believe its possible for a letter to travel all the way to roma from beyond the danube they say that dacia is one of the few civilized lands that the romans have yet to conquer one of the few wealthy lands weve not yet looted you mean how cynical you are lucius do you not accept the notion that roma has a special role given to her by the gods to bring roman religion and roman law to the rest of the world one province at a time he was never quite sure how seriously to take cornelia when she spoke in a patriotic vein when all was said and done despite her disregard for her vow of chastity she considered herself a devoted priestess of the state religion they say the dacians have been crossing the danube and making incursions into roman territory she said enslaving farmers on the frontier looting villages raping women and boys its almost as if king decebalus is deliberately provoking domitian to attack him or at least thats what the emperor wants us to think its an old roman ploy pretending that an enemy is responsible for the start of a war we greatly desire to wage titus spent the last of the treasure their father looted from the jews so domitian needs money if he wants to get his hands on king decabaluss gold a war to revenge outrages against roman citizens will serve his purposes nicely she made a dismissive gesture with her hand enough of that i wont waste our time together debating the dacian question you were talking about your friend dio is he terribly despondent not at all his letter was actually quite cheerful still his exile weighs heavily on me she sighed men cross domitian at their peril even a harmless sophist like dio but philosophers arent harmless or so dio says he believes the power of words and ideas is as great as the power of armies apparently domitian believes that too what a contrast to his brother who proclaimed that he had no fear of words and let people say whatever they wished the reign of titus is beginning to look like a golden age curious how golden ages are always so brief said cornelia i wonder if tituss reign in retrospect seems so golden precisely because it lasted for only a few years he put not a single senator to death they say perhaps he simply didnt live long enough when he died of that sudden illness no one ever suggested there was foul play domitian took over without bloodshed right away he banished some of tituss most fervent supporters men he felt he couldnt rely on but when brother succeeded brother what really changed very little still people were at once nostalgic for titus because he died young and handsome and beloved so domitian started at a disadvantage he was never as personable or eventempered as his brother thats an understatement youve seen domitians behaviour at the amphitheatre his apoplectic fits during gladiator matches the way he shouts encouragement to one fighter and yells threats at anybody who favours the other he lowers the tone of the whole place spectators emulate him fights break out some days theres more blood in the stands than on the sand you exaggerate lucius like you i would prefer to see more decorum in the amphitheatre the place is dedicated to mars and the spectacles are religious rituals but the sight of so much bloodshed releases powerful emotions in people even in the emperor it seems more disturbing to me are the manoeuvrings in the imperial court i suppose trouble must develop in every reign sooner or later factions form rivalries emerge intrigues simmer it was all made worse when domitians son died how he loved that little boy the child was the mirror image of his father always with him at the games emulating his every movement the boy wasnt just a beloved child for an emperor an heir is insurance because the very existence of a son discourages rivals when the boy died domitian was not only grief stricken he became acutely suspicious of everyone around him his courtiers in turn became suspicious of him once such an atmosphere develops even the smallest action by the emperor sets peoples nerves on edge exile is hardly a small action if youre the one whos banished true she said nor is losing your head youre talking about flavius sabinus the husband of domitians niece that was most unfortunate and almost certainly uncalled for my friends in the imperial court tell me domitian had no real cause to believe flavius was conspiring against him the man was arrested and beheaded nonetheless unfortunately for your friend dio was often seen in the company of flavius sabinus was that a crime perhaps not but if domitian had accused dio of conspiring against him your friend would have lost his head along with flavius instead domitian banished him dio is lucky to be alive alive but exiled from italy and forbidden to return to his native bythinia thats a steep price to pay for having been a welcome visitor to the home of tituss daughter and soninlaw do you know the first thing dio did after he fled roma he went to greece to consult the oracle at delphi the oracle is famous for giving ambiguous guidance but not this time put on beggars rags dio was told and head for the farthest reaches of the empire and beyond so off he went beyond the danube for a man with dios curiosity said cornelia travel to faroff lands must offer a splendid chance to learn more about the world think of all the obscure metaphors and allusions hell be able to work into those learned discourses of his lucius smiled he used just such a metaphor in his letter referring to the funeral practices of the scythians just as these barbarians bury cupbearers cooks and concubines along with a dead king so it is a roman custom to punish friends family and advisers for no good reason when a good man is executed cornelia drew a sharp breath did you burn the letter of course after i read it aloud to epaphroditus and epictetus did you read it to anyone else to martial you mean how he would have loved it but no i didnt share it with him dear martial tituss fawning poet one day domitians lapdog the next he was still working on those poems about the inaugural games when titus died what to do with all that hard work rewrite the verses to suit the new emperor of course the books just been published domitian is apparently quite pleased and that pleases martial because he says domitian is a more discerning critic than his brother ever was but martial would say that a poet has to eat while philosophers starve cornelia stretched her arms above her head and extended her toes her body rubbed against his and lucius felt a stirring of renewed excitement dio isnt starving he said he says the dacians are actually quite civilized despite the fact that they worship only one god the temples and libraries of sarmizegetusa cant have much to offer compared to those of roma but king decebalus is reputed to have one of the largest hoards of gold in the world where theres that much wealth a celebrated philosopher from roma neednt go hungry therell always be some dacian nobleman willing to feed a man who can bring a bit of wit and erudition to his table lucius rolled onto his side facing her he ran his hand over the sinuous curve of her hip then trailed his fingers across the delta formed by her thighs his letter was actually rather inspiring nothing seems to dampen his sprits he always looks for the good in the bad dio says his exile may actually be a blessing despite the trouble its caused him thats what the stoics teach every misfortune that befalls a man poverty illness a broken heart old age exile is simply another opportunity for a lesson to be learned is that what you believe lucius i dont know i listen to my philosopher friends and i try to make sense of what they tell me epictetus says it isnt a given event that disturbs us but the view we take of it nothing is intrinsically good or bad only thinking makes it so therefore think good thoughts and find contentment in the moment even if youre ill or hungry or in pain or far from home epictetus would say that even an affront to ones body like illness or torture is an external event outside our true selves the self of a man is not his body but the intelligence that inhabits his body that self is the one thing no one else can touch the only thing we truly possess the operation of our own will is the one thing in all the universe over which we have control the man who learns to accept this is content no matter what his physical circumstances while the man who imagines he can control the world around him is invariably confused and embittered so you see men who are oppressed by the worst sort of misfortunes yet who are happy nonetheless and you see men who are surrounded by luxury and have slaves to carry out their every wish yet who are miserable but what if a man is oppressed by others what if his exercise of free will is constrained by the brute strength of another epictetus would say that such a thing is impossible other men can have power over ones body and possessions but never over the will the self is always free if we are but conscious of it and what about the act of love or the other pleasures of the body epictetus disparages what he calls appetite the drive to satisfy the cravings of the body too often appetite controls a man rather than being controlled by him but since we have a body and its bare requirements must be met if we are to exist at all in this world clearly appetite serves a purpose a man must eat so why not take pleasure in food and what you and i do together lucius does it not give you pleasure perhaps too much there are moments when im with you that i forget where i am even who i am i lose myself in the moment she smiled and isnt that delicious dangerous epictetus would say to lose ones self in ecstasy is a trap an exaltation of the body over the will a capitulation to appetite an invitation to heartbreak and disappointment because we have no control whatsoever over the passions and appetites of another a person may love us one day and forget us the next pleasure can turn to pain but i believe a man needs to touch and be touched to find union with another to feel sometimes that he is an animal with a body and cravings and nothing more i experience that with you cornelia i wouldnt give up what i share with you for anything so do you embrace the stoic view or not lucius much of it makes sense to me but i have my doubts is that all there is to wisdom an acceptance of fate an acknowledgement that were essentially powerless if the pains and pleasures of the body are separate from the self and if nothing precedes or follows life why bother to live at all but look at me talking philosophy with a vestal virgin do the gods look down and laugh at us cornelia do they despise us if vesta were displeased with me she would let me know he shook his head sometimes i cant believe the risk you take by meeting me he ran the tip of his forefinger over her breast and watched the nipple grow erect sometimes i cant believe the risk im taking they both knew the law a vestal convicted of breaking her vow of chastity was to be buried alive her lover was to be hung on a cross and beaten to death cornelia shrugged at least since the days of nero all through my tenure as a vestal our vow of chastity has never been enforced some vestals remain virgins some do not we dont flaunt what we do and the priests of the state religion dont look too closely into our lives they take their cue from the pontifex maximus who is also the emperor vespasian never cared what we got up to titus also looked the other way they knew what truly mattered as long as we keep vestas hearthfire burning without interruption and perform the rituals correctly roma will continue to receive the goddesss blessing do you truly believe in vesta and her protection of course i do dont tell me youre an atheist lucius you havent converted to judaism you know my foreskin is intact or worse become a follower of christ a hater of the gods and mankind no i am neither a jew nor a christian but yes he hesitated what he was about to say he had never said aloud to anyone my uncle kaeso was a christian really yes he was burned alive by nero along with the other christians who were punished for starting the great fire she pursed her lips how terrible for you how terrible for him i never knew the man my father kept me away from him terrible for him yes cornelia left something unspoken but he could read her thoughts if the man was a christian and an arsonist perhaps he deserved his punishment your uncle didnt give you that did he she gestured to the amulet that hung from the chain around his neck why do you ask lucius had never worn the fascinum when he went to see her today was the first time he had forgotten to leave it at home i saw you touch it when you mentioned him it looks a bit like a cross the christians boast that their god died by crucifixion as if that were something to be proud of as a matter of fact my uncle kaeso did wear this amulet during his lifetime he was wearing it when he died so my father once told me but the resemblance to a cross is only a coincidence its a family talisman a fascinum it doesnt look like a fascinum thats because its so very old and worn if you look at it from a certain angle you can make out the original shape do you see here is the phallus and here are the wings yes i see youre one of the few people whos ever seen it when i wear it i keep it beneath my clothes out of sight and when you go to the baths i leave it at home for fear of losing it then i am indeed privileged to see lucius pinarius naked wearing only his family heirloom he lowered his eyes ive also never talked about my uncle before not to anyone ever is it a secret then some people know about him i imagine epaphroditus must know since he knew my father quite well but its never spoken of i understand in every family there are certain events that are never talked about relatives who are never mentioned he realized that he was touching the fascinum turning it this way and that between his forefinger and thumb he stared at it for a moment then released it with a grunt how in hades did we end up talking about my uncle kaeso we were talking about vesta and the sacred hearthfire and atheists like the christians who dont believe in the gods im not sure what i think about the gods lately ive been reading euhemerus do you know him no euhemerus served at the court of cassander who was king of macedonia after alexander euhemerus believed that our tales of gods are simply stories about mortal men and women who lived long ago made larger than life by the storytellers and given supernatural powers then i think this euhemerus was most certainly an atheist ive also been studying epicurus he thought the gods existed but believed they must have withdrawn from our world growing so distant from mankind that their effect on mortals is only very faint hardly perceptible like a shadow cast by a feeble lamp the light cast by the hearthfire of vesta is not feeble i can assure you said cornelia the goddess is with me every day i attend her with joy and thanksgiving but the common belief that she demands virginity of her priestesses and punishes impurity by visiting catastrophes on the city is a fallacy a mistaken notion that has been proved false many times i know for a fact that many vestals have been unchaste with no bad consequence whatsoever otherwise roma would have suffered multiple disasters virtually every year that ive been a vestal we lost pompeii that was far from roma there was a terrible fire the temple of vesta and the house of the vestals were untouched and a plague not a single vestal died or even became ill does talking about disasters always make you so hard only with you they made love again they had never met without making love more than once perhaps to make up for the infrequency of their meetings to lucius the second time was always better than the first less hurried and more relaxed with a greater sense of union between them and a more satisfying climax for both for the duration of their lovemaking all his questions about existence were suspended each moment was sufficient in itself he held her tightly as she reached the crisis he had never felt closer to her but afterwards she slipped out of his embrace and turned her back to him this is the last time well meet for a while she said for several months at least why im going away i wont come back until the spring itll be a long winter without you where are you going to the house of the vestals at alba longa the town was a days journey down the appian way in a hilly region of quaint villages luxurious villas and hunting estates thats only a few hours from roma i could come to see you no ill be in seclusion the rules are stricter in alba the vestals there belong to the oldest of all the orders established even before roma was founded i thought the worship of vesta originated here in roma she smiled ruefully and shook her head and you a patrician with a name going back to the days of hercules the history of religion is not my strong point i thought you read titus livius only the parts about my family even so every roman child should know that rhea silvia the mother of romulus and remus was a vestal imagine that another vestal who was not a virgin rheas father was king numitor of alba he was murdered by his brother amulius her wicked uncle feared that rhea might someday produce a rival for the throne so he forced her to become a vestal and go into seclusion but rhea became pregnant nevertheless some say mars ravished her others say her uncle amulius raped her however it happened rhea kept her condition secret until the twins were born cornelias voice trailed off even i know this part said lucius their mother put the newborn twins in a basket then a slave took the babies out to a rocky hillside and left them there to die that was a terrible thing to do dont you think but what choice did rhea silvia have a lot of women do the same thing nowadays its common practice but what sort of mother could abandon her child to die slave women poor women girls whove been raped rhea silvia faced death if the evidence of her crime was discovered lucius shook his head he had never approved of the common practice of abandoning babies but he did not care to argue with her ah well i know the rest of the story jupiter raised a tremendous storm and there was a great flood and the twins were carried all the way to roma where their basket foundered on a hillside a shewolf found them took them to her cave called the lupercale and suckled them eventually romulus and remus were adopted by a pig farmer and his wife grew up to become fearsome warriors killed the wicked amulius rescued their mother rhea silvia and founded roma and the rest is history but why must you go to alba cornelia and why for so long the decision isnt mine the virgo maxima has ordered me to go its my duty to obey her there was something evasive in cornelias tone but he sensed that there would be no point in pressing her ill miss you ill miss this he pulled her close but even more ill miss this the thing we do after making love the banter the teasing the serious talk will you take another lover while youre in alba no she answered without hesitation then neither will i he said dont be ridiculous youre a man and you are a woman the only one i want to whom else might i turn the bored wife of some acquaintance looking for an hours distraction a slave counting the cracks in the ceiling until im finished a whore with one eye on the coins in my purse or perhaps i should look for some doeeyed young girl fresh on the marriage market whose father is willing to settle for a suitor with a wornout patrician name a reputation for keeping company with exiled philosophers and a family fortune only a little tainted by association with nero not one of those women would be able to discuss philosophy and religion with me afterwards you might be surprised i suppose ill do what martial does when one of his boys fails to show up learn to love my left hand or i suppose i could turn to another of the vestals you wouldnt dare varronilla isnt badlooking and shes even younger than you maybe too young for my taste what about the oculata sisters i once enjoyed the attentions of a pair of sisters years ago and how many men have had sisters who were also vestals the sheer novelty of it dont even think about it cornelia gave him a pinch playful but painful enough to make him yelp you and i take precautions lucius were discreet when our paths cross in public at the flavian amphitheatre in the forum we greet each other briefly as is perfectly natural and acceptable then we move on we give no one cause for suspicion but if you gain a reputation for deliberately seeking the company of vestals if you seem to be too familiar with our comings and goings cornelia i was only joking i was teasing you the way a man teases the woman he loves when shes just told him that for months and months he wont be able to talk to her or touch her or do this to her his passion reignited hers their lovemaking was fiercer than ever fired by the knowledge of their coming separation ad and youve been faithful to her the entire time lucius even though you havent been alone with her for over a year said martial they were in the garden of epaphroditus along with their host and epictetus just as i vowed to her said lucius let me make sure i understand this woman went away for several months then finally returned and now she refuses to meet with you again except in public and in passing yet still you remain chaste having no intercourse with either women or boys that is correct but lucius this is madness if the womans lost carnal interest in you you must move on oh i understand the heartache the longing the period of grief when a love affair ends but while youre waiting for that to pass you still must attend to your physical needs if you dont feel ready yet to take pleasure with another woman then take a boy since you have no real interest in boys that way you can experience all the physical pleasure with none of the regret you might feel for betraying this woman though how you can betray a woman when it was she who abandoned you is beyond me martial you simply dont understand she hasnt betrayed me shes as chaste as i am oh really how can you believe that of course you wont even tell us if this woman is married or a widow or some other mans slave or a common whore in the subura she is none of those things thought lucius but he could think of no way to explain that fact without giving away cornelias identity personally said epictetus i think theres nothing perverse or unnatural or even unusual about remaining chaste if the body and mind are in harmony with such a choice this mad rage to deflower virgins and sample every available prostitute and carry on illicit affairs with other mens wives and meanwhile to give equal attention to fawning boys and compliant eunuchs the sort of topic so fashionable nowadays in poetry seems only to make a man constantly agitated and dissatisfied such a surrender to lust yields very little contentment in the long run ah but it yields so much pleasure in the short run said martial though it can be quite exhausting ill grant you our emperor used to be quite the sexual athlete you know in his younger days before his father became emperor they say the young domitian was on a firstname basis with every prostitute in roma hed go swimming naked in the tiber by moonlight with a whole group of lovelies and he was quite the seducer of respectable matrons as well he called his activities bedwrestling i like that dont you it shows that our emperor in his younger days didnt take lovemaking too seriously its was just another way of keeping fit and working up a good sweat like horseback riding or a bit of exercise at the gymnasium of course once our emperor married a true love match there was never a more devoted husband and father ah the death of that precious little boy what a blow that was and his wifes subsequent affair with that actor paris the irrational act of a grieving mother surely was yet another disappointment our emperor did what any selfrespecting roman would do divorced his wife and paris just happened to be murdered in the street one night but so devoted was our emperor to his chosen spouse that he forgave and took back the empress and their marital bliss continues my fondest wish is that they will soon produce another heir indeed i have a poem already prepared for that occasion be born great child to whom your father may entrust the everlasting reins of empire and yet does domitian look happy said epictetus was he ever happy even in his younger days when he was so proficient at this socalled bedwrestling no always he displays that same dour constipated look that one saw on his fathers face yet behold our friend lucius here have you ever seen a man who appeared more contented yet lucius has but one lover and that lover makes no demands on him at all he remembers the pleasures he once experienced with her which are perfect and inviolable in retrospect and contemplates her from afar with some suffering but also with the bittersweet satisfaction that she longs for him as well clearly there is some danger or impropriety attached to their relationship either for her or for him or else i think he would tell us her name but that element of risk must only add spice to his longing he loves this woman as certain men are said to have loved a goddess from afar with utmost devotion and at their peril see how satisfied he appears his eyes gleam his movements are sure and graceful his whole bearing is that of a man at peace with the world and with himself i think our friend lucius has discovered a secret happiness that the rest of us can only guess at were certainly left guessing at the name of his lover said martial lucius smiled its strange but somehow this relationship irregular as it may be has filled a need in my life as grateful as i am for the gift of friendship from each of you there was a vacant place inside me an emptiness that remained unamused by your wit martial unsatisfied by your philosophy epictetus insecure despite all your fatherly concern for me epaphroditus she fills that emptiness so poetry philosophy and friendship cannot compete with unrequited love said martial not unrequited love only unfulfilled for the time being anyway epictetus nodded if youve found contentment in a chaste love affair you should strive to maintain the relationship just as it is the happiness that comes from physical consummation is fleeting all happiness is fleeting said martial life is precarious everything changes look at the four of us growing older year by year yet weve all managed to remain unmarried said epaphroditus with a laugh only that fellow never changes epictetus nodded towards the statue of melancomas the young boxer is as perfect now as he was the day epaphroditus unveiled him and as empty of all desires martial laughed perhaps we should be envious of melancomas here while everything around him changes he never ages and he is never troubled by hunger or sorrow or longing perhaps medusa wasnt such a monster after all when she turned men into stone maybe she was doing those men a favour by freeing them from suffering and decay on the other hand pygmalion lusted for a statue and brought her to life and that went rather well according to ovid they lived happily ever after so we are left with a puzzle is it better to turn a man to stone or bring stone to life i think you may have found a subject worthy of a poem said epaphroditus no the paradox is too subtle for my audiences rich patrons want a quick setup a clever allusion or two preferably obscene and then a smashing punch line no i think my medusaversuspygmalion idea would be better suited to one of those learned discourses by our friend dio imagine the convoluted argument he could spin evoking all sorts of metaphors and obscure historical references say has anyone heard from dio lately i received a new discourse said epaphroditus only yesterday his voice trailed off what and youre only just now mentioning it come read it aloud said martial i only had time to quickly scan it im not sure dont tell me its no good said martial has the poor exile lost his wit stuck in sarmizegetusa no its not that to be candid im not sure its safe to keep the thing it may be seditious read it quickly then and afterwards well burn it martial laughed epaphroditus smiled uneasily lucius knew what he was thinking but would not say aloud none of them completely trusted martial any longer because of his favoured status with the emperor martial hardly seemed the type to betray old friends but epaphroditus had learned to be cautious over the years it was one thing to gossip about the emperors love life everyone from saltmongers to senators did that but it was something else to read aloud a work by a banished philosopher i dont mean that the discourse is overtly seditious said epaphroditus dio is far too subtle for that but this work could be seen as teasing the emperor youve set my curiosity ablaze said martial whats the subject hair what hair a learned discourse on hair and its role in history and literature they all laughed domitian was notoriously sensitive about his premature baldness in his younger days he had been famously vain about his chestnut mane and once as a gift to a friend he had even written a monograph on his secrets for hair care after domitians ascension to power copies of the treatise proliferated overnight every literate person in roma had read it but no one dared to mention it in the authors presence was dios encomium on hair meant to mock the balding emperor who had exiled him even the emperor cannot avoid the ravages of time observed martial he rose and circled the statue but our friend melancomas shall never grow bald or fat or wrinkled and if his lustrous hair should fade it can always be repainted how i envy his unchanging perfection ah well if our host is not going to share that new discourse from dio im off i should get a bit of work done before the sun sets maybe i can make something of that notion about pygmalion and medusa after all or perhaps ill write a letter to dio and give him the idea as a gift ill come with you epictetus reached for his crutch and got to his feet with some difficulty i dine tonight with a prospective new patron he wants to meet at the baths of titus so id better be off are you leaving as well pinarius lucius began to rise but epaphroditus touched his arm no lucius stay a bit longer when they were alone lucius looked expectantly at his host you look worried epaphroditus i am the older man sighed by all the gods lucius what do you think youre doing what are talking about epaphroditus i know the identity of your mystery woman how lucius lucius ive known you since you were a boy have you ever been able to keep a secret from me only about the role that sporus played in neros death thought lucius but he said nothing and let epaphroditus continue even before you spoke of her chastity i knew who she must be ive seen the two of you when you meet in public the stiff greeting the averted gazes the intentional distance you keep between you and i happen to know that she was absent from roma during the period you spoke of i must admit i find it ironic that the vow she would not keep for a goddess she will keep for a man i wont say her name aloud what slaves dont overhear they cant repeat but you know whom i mean am i right lucius gazed at the flavian amphitheatre which was surrounded by scaffolds and cranes a new tier was being added to accommodate even more spectators yes youre right epaphroditus shook his head lucius lucius what a terrible risk youre taking when i think of my promise to your father to look after you im a grown man now and responsible for myself epaphroditus your promise to my father was long ago discharged still the danger we were always very careful very discreet im not even seeing her any more we love each other at a distance epaphroditus shut his eyes and took a deep breath you dont understand the gravity of the situation events are about to take place that will affect us all events i didnt want to talk about this in front of the others in front of martial you mean or epictetus either or even you for that matter epaphroditus paused to collect his thoughts to lucius he suddenly looked quite old and more worn with cares than lucius had seen him in many years you know i still have friends in the imperial household even after so many changes and so many years sometimes i hear about things before they happen my sources demand my utmost discretion so usually i keep what i know to myself yes i keep things even from you lucius but theres no point in shielding you now seeing the danger youre in domitian is about to revive the office of censor he intends to assume the powers of the magistracy himself permanently didnt his father do the same yes for a limited time and for a specific purpose vespasian conducted a census that is one of the traditional functions of the censor but it is not the function which interests domitian i dont understand what else does a censor do lucius lucius did you learn nothing of history when you were growing up i know your father supplied the very best tutors for you lucius shrugged why bother to learn about the institutions of the longdead republic when all power now resides in the hands of one man and the rest of us count for nothing epaphroditus stifled his exasperation once upon a time when roma was ruled by the senate the censor wielded great power in some ways he was the most powerful man in the republic because he was responsible for keeping the official list of citizens and it was the citizens who elected the magistrates people didnt vote as individuals but in various blocks determined by their wealth and other indicators of status the censor determined in which block a man voted that was important because the voting blocks of the elite counted for more than those of the common rabble and the censor could strike a citizen from the rolls altogether which meant that citizen lost his right to vote and why might a censor do such a thing if a man committed a criminal offense for example or more to the point if the man was guilty of offending public morals and who was the judge of that the censor of course and so stemming from his duty to keep the voting rolls the censor acquired another duty to maintain public morals if the censor declared a man guilty of immorality he could not only strike that man from the voting rolls but could deprive him of other rights even throw him out of the senate the censorship began with a high purpose but quickly devolved into a political tool a way to punish enemies and destroy careers lucius shook his head i still dont understand domitian already can install any man he wants in the senate or remove any man he pleases and what do the senators matter anyway they have no real power never mind that pathetic decree they recently passed it is forbidden for the principal officer of the state to put to death any of his peers the notion that the emperor is the first among equals is a fantasy and the idea that they can constrain him with laws is wishful thinking so why does domitian want to make himself censor for life the office will provide him with a new and very powerful tool consider if the emperor wishes to punish an enemy or a rival and does so for no purpose but to protect his own authority he acts as a tyrant conversely he could charge his enemy with a real crime like embezzling or murder but that would require producing actual evidence but in his role as censor domitian can cast himself as the guardian of public morality acting for the good of everyone what constitutes an immoral act a list of offenses is being drawn up even as we speak i saw an early draft it includes adultery which is defined as any sexual act performed by a married person which takes place outside the marriage but thats absurd domitian himself slept with married women when he was younger one of those women was the empress who divorced her husband to marry him domitian will also revive the old scantinian law refresh my memory it outlaws sexual acts between men in which a freeborn male is the penetrated partner half the members of the imperial court consort with eunuchs ah but everyone assumes its the eunuchs who are penetrated which is perfectly legal since theyre all either slaves or freedmen its the roman citizen who plays the passive role wholl be vulnerable to prosecution lucius frowned domitian seriously intends to police the sexual behaviour of every roman citizen augustus had such a proclivity he was quite ruthless when it came to punishing what he considered immorality within his own family especially among the women to be sure when it came to dictating the morals of the citizenry augustus generally preferred to rely on inducements rather than penalties giving tax benefits to married men with children and so forth but i fear domitian will use his power as censor to inflict a great deal of suffering lucius was not convinced perhaps your fears are exaggerated if domitian wishes to make an example of a few particularly outrageous people but lucius dont you see thats what everyone thinks at the outset of such a crackdown it will be the other people who suffer the outrageous ones not me false hope domitian sees enemies everywhere the very fact that the senate passed that decree making it unlawful for the emperor to put a senator to death makes him think theyre plotting against him so domitian will seek to punish his enemies by accusing them of vice rather than insurrection exactly a dossier will be kept on everyone of importance and who in the senate is such a paragon of virtue that he need never fear the censors wrath what else is on the list of immoral acts incest which includes relations between uncles and aunts and nieces and nephews the socalled crime of claudius also carnal relations between a free woman and another mans slave but not between a woman and her own slave or between a man and anothers mans slave those acts were not listed on the draft i saw what about fornication with a vestal virgin epaphroditus turned pale theres no need for that to be on the list its a capital crime already lucius began to pace how can anyone know what people get up to behind closed doors the censor will assume the right to know remember the banishment of the informers under titus those days are over men and women who sell other peoples secrets even slaves who betray their masters will flourish under the censor citizens arrested for breaking the moral laws can be questioned in what ever manner the censor sees fit and their slaves will be interrogated under torture men found guilty will be encouraged to implicate others is that domitians only motivation for this moral legislation to give himself a tool to terrorize people who can say whats in his mind he may genuinely believe that he can control the morals of his subjects and wishes to do so the hypocrite yes he had a wild youth but licentious young men often become judgemental in later life like supple reeds that turn brittle the emperor is a bitter man everyone loved his brother no one loves domitian his precious son died his wife cuckolded him with a an actor so all roma must suffer because of one mans disappointments epaphroditus sighed to be fair not all the new moral legislation is punitive domitian plans to outlaw castration throughout the empire as well as child prostitution how strictly such laws can be enforced i dont know but we can applaud the intent the practice of buying up young boys making the prettiest ones into eunuchs and selling them for the pleasure of others is a cruel business domitians distaste for the practice seems to be sincere many a young slave may be spared the loss of his manhood lucius paced from one end of the garden to the other thank you for the warning epaphroditus but i assure you no one knows about me and the woman i love except you and you would never tell any witness can be made to talk lucius unless he has a weak heart and dies first lucius felt the blood drain from his face after a few mumbled words of farewell he took his leave of epaphroditus he walked aimlessly his thoughts racing the sun began to set shadows grew long he found himself in the heart of the forum passing the round temple of vesta the doors stood open the light of the eternal hearthfire illuminated the marble interior with a soft orange glow a shadow moved across the light one of the vestals was tending the flame was it cornelia he longed to run up the steps and look inside the merest glimpse of her face would calm his racing heartbeat but he forced himself to turn and walk on lucius could you add more wood to the brazier cornelia shivered inside her heavy cloak and drew it more tightly around her neck the little house on the esquiline was unchanged since the last time they had met there many months ago lucius had considered selling the house but could not bear to do so nor did he rent it out he had kept it vacant and just as it was in the days when they were meeting regularly a slave came occasionally to tend to the garden and to clear the cobwebs and every so often lucius visited the house alone to walk through the rooms and the garden remembering the times he had spent here with cornelia he could hardly believe she was here again the winter day was windy and overcast even at midday the room was full of shadows lucius fetched wood for the brazier they sat in chairs across from each other shivering inside their clothes he could not recall a meeting in this house when they had not been naked and making love within minutes of arriving but they had not come here for pleasure the chill in the air matched their moods the thing they most feared had come to pass and yet they were both still alive it was cornelia who had contacted him insisting that they meet again despite the danger he could not refuse her in anticipation of this meeting he had passed a sleepless night imagining their reunion his heart would race at the sight of her he would embrace her she would weep and speak of her suffering he would listen and share the terror of his own experience they would find comfort once again in each others bodies but that was not what happened when he entered the house and found her waiting with only a feeble fire in the brazier to warm the room they kept their distance there seemed to be an invisible barrier between them not only keeping them apart physically but blunting their emotions they were not like strangers that could never happen but they were not like lovers either they were mutual survivors of a disaster numb with shock the terror they had experienced eclipsed the passion that had once united them they seemed unable to approach each other physically nor were they able to speak of the reason for their meeting at least not at first they began by skirting the subject they talked as any two acquaintances might about the latest news keeping their voices steady and quiet of course all the news was about the emperor and the emperors schemes remember what titus said about the powerlessness of words to harm the powerful it is impossible for me to be insulted as he spoke lucius loaded more pieces of wood onto the brazier stacking them carefully so that they would ignite quickly and burn with a minimum of smoke the simple task calmed him domitian has drawn up a list of plays that can no longer be performed either because they offend the dignity of the emperor or undermine public morals and all new plays must be read and approved by the censor himself we have an emperor who scrutinizes comedies as if they were manifestos against the state surely someone reads the plays for him said cornelia her tone of voice was almost normal only slightly strained she looked not at lucius but into the fire domitian has a whole staff dedicated to combing through every play discourse and poem produced on the street of the scribes but he himself makes the final judgement he fancies himself a writer you know only he can judge the seditious intent of other writers hes mounted a campaign against slander as well apparently there are too many scurrilous lampoons making the rounds i dont mean ditties that insult the emperor no one is mad enough to do that but the kind of verses recited at drunken dinner parties harmless doggerel making fun of the host or hostess teasing a man for having skinny legs or a woman for putting too much paint on her face the dignity of distinguished men and women must not be impugned says the censor so we have poets being whipped and then thrown onto ships headed for ultima thule and men of importance must not compromise their own dignity said cornelia only yesterday he expelled a man from the senate the fellow had appeared in a play during one of the festivals and danced in public and to think we once had an emperor whose highest aspiration was to act on the stage lucius attempted a smile but wondered what his face must look like she glanced at him only briefly then looked away as if it pained her to look at him hes also drawn up a list of notorious women alleged fortune hunters who prey on rich old men said cornelia those women are not only banned from receiving inheritances they can no longer use a litter to cross the city if they must seduce and rob old men instead of living within their means let them go about their shameless business on foot says the censor i happen to know a few of the women on the list theyre not harpies or sirens one is a widow of noble birth whose brothers have all died and whose husband left her destitute the fact that a certain senator wishes to pay her rent and provide for her in his will shouldnt constitute a crime soon a man wont be allowed even to give a pair of earrings to his lover said lucius what will become of the timehonoured roman tradition of keeping a mistress how are those women supposed to support themselves and what pleasure remains in life for those rich old men you sound like your friend martial cornelia managed a semblance of a smile the rooms was beginning to grow warmer she loosened her cloak at the neck and sighed actually i dont sound like martial and thats a sad thing said lucius hes changed how we dont see him as often as we used to hes always at some court function these days or at home in his little apartment scribbling his verses he still shows up at epaphrodituss house every now and then but when he does hes very cautious about what he says just as were careful what we say around him martial used to joke about the emperors bed wrestling his sour expression even his baldness but no more martial has become the emperors favourite every poets dream only to discover that his role requires an almost impossible balancing act he must amuse and flatter his patron and produce the cleverest possible poem on whatever topic domitian chooses but he must never produce a pun or metaphor or hyperbole that might offend the censor its too bad martial has been muzzled said cornelia we could use a poet with teeth to record the absurdities of these days did you hear about the citizen who was struck from the jury rolls he charged his wife with adultery and divorced her but then he took her back just as domitian did the censor decreed that a man who couldnt make up his mind about his own wife should never be allowed to judge his fellow men and so we have a man who divorced his wife and took her back declaring that a man who divorced his wife and took her back is unfit to judge other men she laughed but the laughter caught in her throat she stared at the fire watching flames was a familiar occupation for her does the flame remind you of vestas eternal hearthfire he said quietly yes what of your faith cornelia she took a long time to answer i remain steadfast in my devotion to vesta despite whats happened they had finally arrived at the subject they had come to talk about lucius moved a few steps closer to her and joined her in gazing at the fire what happened to varronilla and the oculata sisters was unspeakable he said cornelia drew a deep breath people say domitian was merciful the punishments could have been worse much much worse her hollow emotionless voice seemed to be that of another woman a stranger he knelt beside her and took her hand her fingers were frigid cornelia we dont have to talk about it no i want to talk i want to tell you everything oh lucius how i longed to speak to you every day while it was happening but you were the one man i couldnt possibly talk to she spoke at last in a normal voice full of sorrow and pain the sound of it broke his heart for the first time he felt that the woman in the room with him was cornelia his cornelia the woman he had loved so long and so devotedly she wept he put his arm around her she fought back her tears it all happened so suddenly in the middle of the night armed men appeared at the entrance of the house of the vestals they blocked the exits as if we were criminals and might try to flee they were led by a man named catullus one of the emperors oldest friends remember his name lucius a tall thin man with pale mottled skin and a gaunt face everything about catullus is as cold as ice except his eyes the way he looked at me i felt i was made of straw i thought his gaze would set me on fire she shuddered lucius held her and said nothing letting her speak at her own pace they assembled the household slaves and took them into custody dressed in their nightclothes im not sure where they took them but we later learned they were tortured all of them from the youngest to the oldest from the accountant who kept records for the virgo maxima to the halfwitted slave who emptied chamber pots you never know which slaves will yield the most damning evidence so catullus said at the trial and by law the testimony of any slave must be obtained by torture even the slaves of a religious order like the vestals some of the slaves died from the torture they were too old to endure it others were maimed for life four of us were accused of breaking our vows of chastity varronilla the oculatae and myself im not sure why i was accused they had no evidence against me as it turned out but i didnt know that at the time i racked my brain trying to imagine what they knew and how they found out we were always so careful you and i or had they simply invented something and intended to make their case using false evidence against which i could offer no possible defense we were taken to the regia the ancient house of the pontifex maximus in the forum and confined to a small room i didnt dare say anything to the others for fear that catullus or one of his henchman was listening from some place of concealment the trial took place in the regia domitian presided not in his role as censor but as pontifex maximus all the vestals and a great many priests were there catullus presented the evidence poor varronilla there was no question of her guilt she had been very careless confiding in one of the slaves even telling the woman the name of her lover the oculata sisters were even more flagrant they shared the same lover at the same time and were seen coming and going outside his house the lovers of varronilla and the oculatae had already confessed but they were made to appear before the court and repeat their testimony before domitian rendered his judgement against those three the virgo maxima begged him to be lenient he told her she should be ashamed of herself that she was running the house of the vestals as if it were a brothel but he offered conditional clemency if the accused vestals would admit their guilt he would forgo the traditional punishment being buried alive and allow them to choose their own form of death varronilla and the oculatae agreed they confessed before the court with catullus asking questions he forced them not only to name their lovers but to recount each of the occasions on which they broke their vows and to describe the specific acts in which they engaged no matter how intimate or embarrassing which parts of their bodies had been touched and penetrated and in what positions and what acts they had performed to please their lovers after catullus had wrung every humiliating detail from varronilla and the oculatae he allowed them to step down during all this time no one had questioned me or even mentioned my name except in the initial reading of the charges i almost thought they had forgotten me but they were saving me for last no witnesses were called against me how could there be witnesses when not a single slave in the house of the vestals knew anything of our affair and no slave of yours had ever seen me in this house catullus called on me to name my lover and confess if i did so he said i would be spared like the others from being buried alive and be allowed choose my own form of death i told him i had nothing to say domitian rose from his chair and stood before me if you confess now at this moment you will be spared the traditional punishment but this is your last chance if subsequent evidence goes against you and you are pronounced guilty you will be buried alive what do you say vestal still i said nothing but i thought they must have lucius they must be holding him just outside this room if i fail to confess catullus will parade lucius before me and my lover will tell them everything and i shall be buried alive how close i came to confessing i was terrified the suspense was unbearable i could have ended it by telling domitian what he wanted to hear i had only to utter a few words and it would be over but i held fast i said nothing catullus took domitian aside and whispered in his hear domitian announced that i was to be taken to a private chamber stripped and examined to determine whether or not i was a virgin he himself in his role as pontifex maximus would conduct the investigation with the virgo maxima as witness lucius felt physically ill imagining the scene he shuddered no lucius it didnt happen the virgo maxima stood up to him she said that such a procedure carried out against a vestal who maintained her innocence and against whom there was no evidence of wrongdoing would be an offense against vesta the priests agreed as timid as they are almost all of them stepped forward to object even domitian could see he had gone too far he backed down but he was furious so was catullus every time that man looked at me i felt naked domitian dropped the charges against me the virgo maxima counted that as a small victory i still dont know why i was accused since they could produce no evidence against me i think someone must have accused me anonymously someone who may have suspected me without knowing enough to testify perhaps they thought i might confess simply from fear i very nearly did lucius nodded slowly i think this catullus was your accuser had you ever seen him before i must have as part of the emperors entourage i never took any notice of him but ill wager he noticed you a man like that lusting after a woman he cant have will use whatever influence he has to get her under his control he very nearly drove me to my death youre a vestal cornelia beautiful aloof unobtainable there are men who would take perverse pleasure from destroying a woman like you that may be exactly what catullus wanted to see you stripped naked and humiliated he failed then but he did manage to destroy varronilla and the oculata sisters they were returned to their cell the virgo maxima obtained a fastacting poison for them they died before sundown and their lovers because they freely confessed domitian was lenient instead of being hung on crosses and being beaten to death with rods they were stripped of their property and citizenship and sent into exile a punishment no more severe than those domitian hands out to slanderers and adulterers but lucius what of you when you heard about the arrests you must have been terrified my suffering was nothing compared to yours cornelia even so it isnt worth speaking of in fact the days and nights immediately after he learned of the accusations against the vestals had been the longest of his life at every moment he had expected a knock at his door the punishment for a despoiler of a vestal haunted his nightmares sleep became impossible he considered fleeing to one of his country estates or even taking an outbound ship from ostia heading for the euxine sea and land of the dacians to join dio but the futility of such an enterprise stopped him if domitian wanted to arrest him there would be no escape and sudden flight would be as good as a confession nor could he abandon cornelia if he should be arrested he would refuse to testify even if he was tortured so he told himself and if he was executed he would die with the knowledge that he had not betrayed cornelia he talked to no one about the arrests and upcoming trial not even epaphroditus if he was being watched and followed anyone with whom he had contact might fall under suspicion the date for the trial of the vestals arrived and still lucius was a free man all that day he expected soldiers to come and arrest him as he did every day he dispatched his freedman hilarion to go down to the forum to deliver messages and bring back the days news late that afternoon hilarion finally returned he quoted the latest price for grain from alexandria he also mentioned that another play had been added to the censors list though he could not remember the title oh and what else said hilarion scratching his head oh yes the pontifex maximus has rendered his judgement of the accused vestals yes lucius tried to control the quaver in his voice all were pronounced guilty except one is that right lucius could hardly breathe which vestal was that hilarion thought for a moment cornelia cossa is her name she was acquitted lucius could hardly believe his ears he was as stunned by the news as if cornelia had been found guilty he felt faint hilarion asked if he was alright i could use a bit of wine would you fetch it yourself hilarion as soon as hilarion left the room lucius had burst into tears he had longed to contact her but did not dare to then one day a message arrived written on a scrap of parchment and carried by a street urchin meet me tomorrow was all it said but lucius knew who had sent it and what it meant and so they were together again at last after so many months apart lucius shook his head if catullus was responsible for your arrest he wont give up hell be watching and waiting for another chance to ruin you he may be watching even now he may have seen you come here it was madness for us to meet again i had to see you lucius and i had to see you cornelia he touched her face he kissed her both of them had arrived expecting their tryst to be chaste a meeting to talk and share their suffering to acknowledge the terrible danger they had escaped and to say a final farewell but the strain of their ordeal culminated in a physical desire beyond anything they had experienced before their union was more than a simple coupling of bodies it was an affirmation that they were still alive lucius was shaken to the core of his being he experienced a blissful release such as he had never imagined he knew this would not be the last time they met much later as he was walking home alone and the haze of lust began to lift and he could think clearly again the irony of the situation struck him so forcefully that he laughed out loud domitians relentless campaign for public morals had driven him back into the arms of a vestal virgin ad it was the fifth day before the ides of junius the twentieth anniversary of the death of titus pinarius as he did every year on this date lucius conducted a simple ritual of remembrance before the wax effigy of his father that occupied a niche in the vestibule of his house on the palatine he was attended only by the freedman hilarion who had been his fathers favourite and who cherished the memory of his old master in the years since he had been manumitted hilarion had married and started his own family and in many ways was a more devout roman than lucius observing all the holidays and the customary rituals for the benefit of his children lucius since he had little interest in religion and had created no family of his own observed few ceremonies throughout the year but he never neglected to note the day of his fathers death as happened every year he felt a little guilty as he honoured the memory of his father at the age of forty lucius had not produced an heir after he died who would continue to honor the memory of his father and all his other ancestors two of luciuss three sisters had children but they were not pinarii it was also the twentieth anniversary of the death of nero that anniversary was not especially significant for lucius except as it related to his own fathers death but it meant a great deal to epaphroditus to observe the occasion he had asked lucius to join him at the tomb of nero on the hill of gardens it was a mild clear day lucius decided to walk rather than be carried in a sedan he told hilarion to spend the rest of the day with his family if he wished and set out alone leaving his house lucius gazed up at the massive new wings that had recently been added to the imperial palace domitian had so enlarged the complex that it now occupied not just the whole southern portion of the palatine but much of the rest of the hill he had also given the complex a name as nero had called his palace the golden house so domitian called his palace the house of the flavians the public rooms were said to be enormous with soaring vaulted ceilings while the rooms and gardens where the emperor actually resided were said to be surprisingly small and to lie deep within the palace accessible only by secret doorways and hidden passages lucius descended the stairs of cacus and crossed the marketplace and the forum he walked along the huge cordonedoff area where a saddle of land connecting the quirinal hill to the capitoline was being excavated to make room for a grand new forum that would facilitate passage from the centre of the city to the field of mars the amount of earth being removed was staggering the buildings that would fill such a space would have to be constructed on a truly monumental scale this new forum was without doubt the most ambitious of the emperors building projects but it was only one of many structures could be seen going up all over the city and a great many older buildings still damaged from the fires under nero and titus were at last being restored everywhere he went in roma lucius saw cranes and scaffolding and heard foremen shouting orders to their work gangs the incessant banging of hammers echoed from all directions everywhere too he saw the image of the emperor monumental statues of domitian had been placed at every important intersection and in every public square the statues were of bronze decorated with gold and silver and invariably portrayed the emperor in the ornate armour of a triumphing general walking across the city a man was never out of sight of a statue of the emperor from certain spots one could see two or even three of them in the distance there was no place in roma where a citizen could escape the stern gaze of domitian along with his statues domitian erected commemorative arches all over the city little replicas of the vast arch of titus in the forum ornamented in the same excessively decorated style on many of these arches some brave seditious wit had scrawled a graffito that consisted of a single word arci which when said aloud could be taken either as the latin word for arches or the greek word arkei meaning enough almost as ubiquitous as the statues and the arches and built on a massive scale were the altars to vulcan that domitian had erected all over the city the altars had been pledged by nero who as pontifex maximus had promised that propitiations to vulcan would prevent a reoccurrence of the great fire nero had poured his energies into the building of the golden house instead and in the chaos that followed his death the plans for the altars had been lost vespasian had never seen fit to revive the project and the result many thought had been the extensive fire that damaged the city especially the field of mars under titus titus renewed the vow to build the altars but he died before he could commence construction it was domitian who at last built the altars they were enormous carved from solid blocks of travertine more than twenty feet wide on the days that animals were sacrificed to vulcan huge plumes of smoke could be seen all over the city as the priests appealed to the god to prevent another conflagration the devastation of the field of mars had allowed domitian to rebuild the area to his liking as lucius crossed the flat expanse he saw the new temples that dominated the skyline along with a vast stadium for athletic contests and a grand theatre called the odeum intended for musical performances not for plays domitian had banned the public presentation of plays altogether as lucius began to ascend the hill of gardens he saw that a number of other people were walking in the same direction he noticed more people and yet more all converging on the same spot the street that ran in front of neros family cemetery which was surrounded by a stone wall many in the crowd were dressed in black as if in mourning some carried garlands of flowers most of these people were his age or older in other words old enough to remember the days of nero having raised no children lucius sometimes forgot that a whole generation had come up behind him that knew only the flavians but the predominance of people in their forties or older made the scattered younger faces in the crowd stand out all the more the older people tended to look serious and somber while the younger ones exuded a buoyant air of celebration seeing his perplexed expression a smiling young girl seized his arm her clothes were worn but she looked freshly scrubbed as if she had just come from the baths she had shimmering red hair and carried a garland of daffodils violets and poppies smile friend she said have you not heard the good news what news hes coming back who the divine nero of course lucius cocked his head i dont recall the senate voting divine honours to that particular emperor what does it matter whether or not a bunch of old fools vote to call a god a god nothing the senate says can change the truth that nero is a living god was a living god you mean no she laughed and rolled her eyes didnt you hear what i said hes coming back from the east where hes been living all this time hell be here any day now to reclaim his rightful place as emperor he shall rebuild the golden house and bring about a new golden age lucius stared at her blankly the girl was quite pretty even if she was deluded she laughed and shook her head i see youre a doubter never mind put this on his monument today when he comes he will know and be pleased with you she pulled a daffodil from the garland and handed it to him he took the flower from the girl managed a halfhearted smile and moved farther into the crowd some of the people stood idle and held on to their garlands waiting for the sepulcher to be opened to the public others who could not stay were moving as close as they could to lay their garlands against the high wall of stone that surrounded the gravesite jostled on all sides lucius looked around hoping to spot epaphroditus amid the crowd a wooden gate in the wall opened on creaky hinges and a familiar voice called his name epaphroditus gestured to him from the narrow doorway lucius stepped inside epaphroditus closed the gate behind him what a crowd said lucius happy to escape the crush does this happen every year yes and no said epaphroditus every year people come to deliver garlands and perform ceremonies of remembrance but ive never seen so many before its because its the twentieth anniversary i suppose they were alone inside the stone enclosure neros was not the only tomb this was the family plot of his ancestors on his fathers side but it was by far the most impressive the ornate sepulchre containing his ashes was sculpted from rare white porphyry before it stood an altar of luna marble the exquisite carvings of horses on all four sides were doubly appropriate since nero had loved to ride and horses were a funerary symbol from the most ancient times flowers had been laid on the altar where a smouldering bit of incense overpowered their fragrance with its cloying scent i see youve already honored the dead said lucius im sorry i didnt wait for you lucius i have my own key to the gate and let myself in i wasnt sure when youd arrive and i wanted to say a prayer before the gate is opened to the public in a little while the people out there will be allowed to pass by the sarcophagus and lay their garlands there are hundreds of people out there epaphroditus shook his head like most people they have the ability to believe two things at once they will gladly tell you that nero never died yet here they are marking the anniversary of his death and bringing garlands to his tomb nero is dead yet nero lives and hes on his way to roma right now someone just gave me the news and told me i should make ready for his arrival a young redhead yes quite pretty and carrying a garland the same girl talked to me earlier i didnt have the heart to tell that i was present when nero died much less that he died by my hand epaphroditus frowned curiously enough my contacts in the imperial house tell me there actually is an impostor claiming to be nero somewhere in syria hes not the first such pretender but this one appears to have serious backing from the parthians who may actually give the fellow some military support and make an incursion if that happens domitian is worried that this nero pretender might cause considerable mischief in the eastern provinces there are still a great many people especially in judaea who hate the flavians the ones vespasian and titus didnt manage to kill or enslave and people in that part of the world are always talking about the dead coming back to life who is this impostor i have no idea the people whove seen him say he sings like a lark and looks the very image of nero but do these people consider that nero would be in his fifties now epaphroditus laughed wistfully he would be quite fat and bald i imagine how can people believe such a thing so fervently because lucius without the discipline of philosophy to give rigour to their thinking people can and will believe anything no matter how absurd indeed the more farfetched the notion the more likely they are to believe it people have grown weary of domitian they enjoy the fantasy that nero will return bringing with him a new golden age why not some of the older people out there actually remember the reign of nero and theyll tell you how wonderful it was though i suspect the nostalgia they feel is not so much for nero as for their own lost youth and the younger ones have the natural propensity of youth to believe that a golden age must have existed somewhere at some time most likely just before they were born so why not in the days of nero does that mean that a generation from now people will look back to a socalled golden age of domitian thats hard to imagine i wouldnt be so sure said lucius on the walk here i saw the hand of the emperor everywhere his statues his temples and altars and arches arkei said epaphroditus people have had enough of domitian looking over their shoulders do you think so he pleased the people greatly when he added that tier to the flavian amphitheatre you admired the monstrosity before epaphroditus and now theres more of it to love than ever no one in roma need go without a seat but he banned the public performance of plays said epaphroditus every actor must suffer for the sin of paris but do the people mind i think not why should they wish to see stodgy old dramas and stale comedies when domitian gives them games instead and not just games but the most spectacular ever staged his marvels eclipse even those his brother presented he floods the amphitheatre and stages fullscale naval battles with convicts and slaves fighting for their lives and drowning before our eyes what play could possibly match such a spectacle he gives the people freakish delights like the gladiator shows he holds at night where naked women and dwarves are forced to fight one another by torchlight what comedy could make people laugh half that much and from the sky above figs dates and plums rain down on the audience the spectators think theyve died and awoken in elysium and all the while the emperor sits in his box said epaphroditus accompanied by that creature with a toosmall head is it a child a dwarf is it even human the two of them whisper to each other and giggle he shuddered nero loved beauty and perfection and his taste in all things was impeccable domitian loves excess too much decoration too much ornament and he surrounds himself with human oddities his behaviour at the games is appalling do you remember the day the sky turned black and a tremendous storm blew up the wind and rain were so fierce that the awnings were useless and people began to leave the amphitheatre domitian ordered his soldiers to block the exits people werent even allowed to take shelter in the stairwells and passages all roma sat there and endured the deluge and when a roar of complaint filled the amphitheatre the emperor angrily demanded silence and got it after enough of the offenders had been thrown into the arena to join the convicts about to be gored by a herd of rampaging aurochs lucius nodded what a bizarre moment that was sitting in the pouring rain with fifty thousand others and no one saying a word while thunder rumbled and lightning tore the sky and men screamed and died down in the arena say what you like it was unforgettable a day like no other just what people crave when they go to the amphitheatre the games are more popular than ever because domitian has reduced the roman people to the level of dogs they remain faithful even when their master beats them as long as he also feeds them he has the loyalty of the legions as well said lucius and thats where true power lies it was only when nero lost control of the legions that he came undone nero never led the legions into battle as domitian has and those legions are as loyal to domitian as they were to his father and his brother he pays the soldiers well and exempts the veterans from paying taxes but his wars in germania and dacia have ended in stalemates at best the death of his general fuscus and the loss of an eagle standard to the dacians was a catastrophe which domitian turned to his advantage said lucius just when the threat from germania had grown stale the dacians became the new enemy for romans to fear and despise and despite his limited success he still staged triumphs for himself parading through the forum as a conqueror though no one is quite sure what hes conquered did you hear the rumour about the supposed captives who were paraded in chains in the german triumph a source in the imperial household told me they were actually the biggest and brawniest slaves from the palace dressed in leather pants and blond wigs to look like germans thats the problem with domitian isnt it said lucius we never know whats real and whats not all the city is a stage everything that happens is a spectacle put on by the emperor one wonders if he himself knows any longer whats real he now signs official letters with the title dominus and deus said epaphroditus that makes him the first emperor since caligula to demand to be addressed as the peoples master and also the first since caligula to consider himself a living god he renames months in his honour we celebrate his birthday not in october but in domitianus which is preceded not by september but by germanicus in honour of his german triumphs he goes everywhere accompanied by a huge bodyguard of lictors and wears the costume of a triumphing general on formal occasions even when he addresses the senate and should be dressed in a toga as the first among equals the laurel wreath hides his baldness but how can he afford all this the spectacles the generous pay for his soldiers the massive construction projects thats a bit of a mystery said epaphroditus my sources tell me he manages the treasury himself obsessively scrutinizing even the smallest expenditures not a nail is bought without domitians approval as you can imagine the accountants and bursars are terrified of him theres a good side to that domitian has put an end to the corruption and selfenrichment that were so rampant in the flush freewheeling years of his fathers reign but my old friends at the treasury believe that the state is headed for bankruptcy and when that happens the emperor will hold them to blame theyre like men awaiting a death sentence watching sand run through the hourglass only in this case its sesterces running through the emperors fingers they were all hoping that fuscus might actually conquer dacia and capture king decebaluss treasure but now there seems no likelihood of that happening master and god he may call himself but domitian fears his underlings as much as they fear him he sees conspiracies everywhere senators are put to death for chance remarks that only a madman would find suspicious hes become deeply superstitious he fears not just daggers and poisons but enchantments did you hear about the woman who was executed because she was seen undressing before a statuette of the emperor presumably she was trying to bewitch him using sex magic epaphroditus placed his hands upon the sarcophagus of nero feeling the coolness of the polished stone the last bit of incense on the altar had turned to ash but its fragrance lingered on the air curiously he said domitian now has something in common with nero that none of us expected hes in love with a eunuch no oh yes remember the disdain he used to show for his brothers coterie of eunuchs and the one laudable achievement of his campaign for morality his ban on castration now domitian has quite openly fallen in love with a eunuch the boys name is earinus and he comes from pergamum a slave trader unsexed him here in italy when he was very young using the hotwater method what is that the child sits in a vat of steaming water that softens the scrotum then his testes are pressed between a finger and thumb until theyre crushed the method leaves no scar which many owners find pleasing the boys subjected to this method must be very young and they subsequently develop fewer masculine attributes than those who are castrated later in life some owners find that pleasing also a few years ago earinus was acquired by the imperial household where all the most beautiful eunuchs end up he has a face like cupid his hair is a very light blonde like white gold he can sing as well lucius shook his head imperial eunuchs are always said to have some talent other than the purpose for which they were made in the case of earinus the boy apparently has a true gift when he sang for the emperor domitian fell for him at once he dotes on earinus shamelessly showering him with gifts dressing him in the costliest garments anointing him with the rarest perfumes for his seventeenth birthday domitian manumitted him and gave him a very generous endowment to mark the occasion earinus sent a lock of his blonde hair to a temple in pergamum its a greek custom for boys to donate a lock of hair to a temple in their native city when they attain manhood you may remember that nero did something of the sort when he donated a clipping from his first beard to the temple of jupiter on the capitoline when earinus sent off the lock of his hair the court poets fell over one another in the rush to commemorate the event our dear martial wrote some lines comparing domitian to jupiter and earinus to ganymede no surprise there but for sheer sycophancy his rival statius outdid himself statiuss poem is a veritable aeneid of eunuchworship listen to this epaphroditus cleared his throat and declaimed all previous favourites and flocks of servants stand back as the new one carries to the mighty leader the heavy goblet of crystal and agate making the wine sweeter by the touch of his soft white hands boy dear to the gods chosen the first to drink the vintage blessed to touch so often that mighty right hand whose sway the dacians yearn to know epaphroditus broke off and made a retching sound even martial never stooped to writing anything as awful as that though hes come perilously close its curious said lucius how a man as vicious as domitian can lavish so much affection on a harmless mutilated boy its almost as if earinus were a pet earinus means springtime in greek domitian is almost forty now statius says earinus restores domitians youth though i imagine the boy only reminds him of it but you put your finger on something lucius they say the empress is quite aware of domitians passion and that she too is quite fond of earinus why not better for her if domitian spends his time courting a eunuch rather than the wife of some senator or worse an unmarried girl of childbearing age who might pester him to divorce his wife the empress has yet to give domitian another heir to replace his dead son as long as he spills his seed with a eunuch no one else will do so for dynastic purposes a eunuch is no rival at all earinus is more like a pet as you say a pretty creature whose company both of them can enjoy domitian what do we make of the man said lucius hes obsessed on the one hand with bureaucratic minutiae but on the other with a morbid fear of plots and magic he was once a promiscuous adulterer and now dotes on a eunuch but hes determined to criminalize the bedwrestling of others and this is the man who shapes every facet of the world we live in hes in the very air we breathe epaphroditus sighed enough about the emperor what about you lucius lucius shrugged nothing in my little world ever changes does that mean youre still seeing her lucius smiled were like an old married couple nowadays if you can imagine a couple married in secret who see each other only a few times a year the passion is still there but it burns more steadily with a lower flame like the flame in vestas hearth if you like she has even less time to see me now that shes become the virgo maxima at such a young age how old is she now thirtytwo and more beautiful than ever epaphroditus laughed you dont sound like a married man to me you still sound like a lover im a very lucky man to know such a woman ah dont give me that look epaphroditus you need not lecture me again about the risks i believe i was blessed not cursed when fortune led me to her i would never have found a love like hers anywhere else truly spoken like a lover how do you spend the rest of your time when im not hunting at one of my estates enjoying the fresh air and the thrill of the chase i do what i must to maintain my fortune dealings in real estate and trade arent exactly respectable activities for a patrician largescale agriculture or state service would be more suitable but you know ive never been a status seeker hilarion does most of the actual work he takes so much pleasure in moving numbers from one column to another dictating letters to merchants and issuing instructions to lawyers still no politics or public service for you then certainly not more than ever it seems to me that the only sensible strategy for a roman citizen is to attract as little attention to himself as possible so far ive managed to stay beneath the notice of the emperor i intend to keep it that way even as lucius said these words he felt that he was tempting fate he reached inside his toga and touched the fascinum epaphroditus opened his mouth to say something then seemed to change his mind what is it said lucius i was wondering if you had heard about catullus lucius drew a breath the emperors henchman the one who led the investigation against the vestals and many other investigations in recent years that seems to be his special gift an ability to ferret out every secret act and utterance that could bring destruction to another mortal how domitian prizes him for it but now a bit of misfortune has befallen catullus he fell gravely ill with a fever and almost died hes back on his feet completely recovered but hes completely blind lucius remembered what cornelia had said about the man everything about catullus is as cold as ice except his eyes i thought his gaze would set me on fire but this is happy news lucius said though his expression was grim catullus blind you should have told me right away epaphroditus pursed his lips epictetus says that to feel joy at the suffering of another is a sin like hubris it invites the retaliation of the gods really all roma watches and applauds when thousands die in the arena or when captives are strangled at the end of a triumph and the gods seem to approve why should i not take a little satisfaction at the muchdeserved downfall of a monster like catullus im not sure that blindness has put an end to catullus domitian still counts him among his closest advisers they say the infirmity has only made him more dangerous again lucius felt a superstitious chill he was reaching to touch the fascinum when they heard the jangling of a key in the lock the gate opened and an attendant looked inside i shall allow them to enter in a moment the man said you might want to pay your last respects they turned their attention back to the sarcophagus while epaphroditus stood in silence with his hands folded and his eyes downcast lucius burned a bit of incense and placed the flower the girl had given him on the altar he was not really thinking of nero as he prayed but of his father and of sporus they made their way to the gate the attendant shouted at the crowd to make way for them as lucius stepped through the crush surrounded by the smell of flowers a hand gripped his arm it was the redhaired girl dont forget she cried nero is coming any day now oh yes any day now a d did you enjoy your stay in the country i did hilarion good hunting typical for this time of year not much to shoot at but deer and rabbits still beautiful countryside and did you enjoy sleeping late this morning i did indeed i was up at dawn every day in the country but the journey home tired me out fortunately here in the city a man can sleep until noon and miss nothing and your visit to the baths this afternoon very pleasant i prefer the afternoon to the morning especially at the baths of titus its less crowded more relaxed i actually spent an hour playing some silly board game with a complete stranger in one of the galleries then took a final hot plunge i feel quite clean and revived ready for the rest of the day theres not much of the day left alas the sun sets quite early but we may still have an hour of sunlight in the study i was hoping you might join me in reviewing the accounts from the granary outside alexandria there are a few discrepancies to which id like to draw your attention not now hilarion it wont take long im off to where may i ask you may not perhaps this evening by lamplight with a forlorn expression hilarion held up a scroll probably not hilarion i may not be back until quite late i see hilarion looked at luciuss garments the master of the house was not wearing a toga but a brightly coloured tunic short enough to show off his athletic legs and cinched with a leather belt with silver inlays around his waist still trim at fortyfour thanks to his recent regimen of riding and hunting all day and eating only what he could catch hilarion shook his head it was obvious that the master of the house was going to see her the woman whose existence lucius had never acknowledged and whose identity hilarion very wisely had never attempted to discover hilarion sometimes felt sorry for the old masters son he himself was only a freedman yet he had found a suitable woman to marry and together they had made some wonderful children as lucius made ready to leave the house alone as he always did when he was going to meet his secret lover he whistled the tune of an old hunting song hilarion went about his business it was a brisk autumn afternoon lucius took a roundabout route occasionally glancing over his shoulder and doubling back long ago he had adopted such habits to make sure he was not being followed when he set out for the little house on the esquiline as usually happened when he returned to roma after an extended stay in the country he found the city disgustingly dirty and noisy and smelly full of unhappy and dangerouslooking people and that was just in the forum once he entered the subura he actually felt more relaxed because although the streets were more crowded and the people were dirtier there were not quite so many statues of domitian everywhere that was the most unnerving thing about the first day or two back in roma the ubiquity of domitian master and god always watching him but even the inescapable images of the emperor could not dampen luciuss mood on this day perhaps it was the nip of autumn in the brisk air that made lucius feel half his age or perhaps it was the fact that he had not seen cornelia in so very long more than two months and at last they had both found time to meet he had received her cryptic message at the baths that afternoon delivered as always by a street urchin selected at random who could not possibly know the identity of the woman who hired him or the meaning of the words he was told to repeat today an hour before sunset shops in the better parts of town would already be closed but many establishments in the subura stayed open until it was dark and lucius had found that the quality of their foodstuffs was often as good as anything to be found in shops on the aventine that charged four or five times as much he bought some flatbread with a thick crust a hard smoked cheese a little jar of his favourite garum and a few other items there would be wine and olives in the little house on the esquiline but no fresh food and if experience was any guide they would both have a ravenous appetite later he left the subura and ascended the hill carrying a cloth bag with his provisions and whistling a happy tune he stopped whistling when he saw the praetorians who loitered around the little reservoir called the lake of orpheus the soldiers were armed and in uniform but appeared to be off duty one of them had climbed amid the bronze statues in the fountain and was leaning against a deer that stood enraptured ears pricked up to listen to orpheus play his lyre what were praetorians doing in this mostly residential area with its mix of elegant homes like that of epaphroditus and more modest but still respectable dwellings like the little house lucius kept the sight of armed men was disturbing he almost turned back then thought of cornelia patiently waiting for him he continued up a winding narrow street after a sharp turn he saw the front of his house the door was wide open he turned around the soldiers he had seen at the lake of orpheus had followed him the foremost of them looked him in the eye the mans expression was dispassionate but determined with a nod and a slight gesture of his hand the praetorian made it clear that lucius was to enter the house he passed through the vestibule and entered into the room beyond someone was sitting on the couch where he had expected to find cornelia the room was dim it took his eyes a moment to adjust the man on the couch was dressed like a member of the imperial court in a lavishly embroidered robe with long sleeves he wore a necklace with large pieces of carnelian and a ring of the same red stone on one finger he turned to face lucius but there was a disconcerting blankness about his eyes which seemed to fix on nothing his face was gaunt his skin was pale and mottled are you lucius pinarius the man said i am my name is also lucius i am lucius valerius catullus messalinus perhaps youve heard of me perhaps do i hear a quaver in your voice lucius pinarius there appeared to be no one in the room but the two of them from a shadow on the wall lucius could see that one of the praetorians had followed him into the house and was standing in the vestibule your presence honours me catullus catullus laughed how polite you are pinarius decorum would have me now say something complimentary about your home but alas i cannot see it my other senses are quite sensitive however do i smell very faintly a womans perfume in this room or do i only imagine it theres no woman here catullus no and yet i can almost feel her presence in the silence that followed the items in the cloth bag made a slight rustling sound whats that you carry said catullus only a bit of food may i offer you some catullus catullus laughed oh no i never eat anything not prepared by my own cook or that of the emperor and tasted first by a slave such essential precautions are one of the drawbacks of my station in life i would advise you not to eat any of that food either why not why spoil your appetite when shortly you shall be dining in the house of the flavians i will luciuss voice cracked like that of a boy thats why im here lucius pinarius to deliver an invitation from our master and god you are invited to dine with him a sedan is waiting outside lucius swallowed im not properly dressed ill need to go home first to change into my best toga no need the emperor will provide your clothing he will this is to be a special dinner requiring special dress you need bring nothing shall we be off lucius looked around the room where was cornelia had she arrived before him seen the praetorians and left had she not come at all or he could hardly bear the thought had she been here when catullus arrived catullus called to the praetorian who assisted him as they stepped outside the house lucius pulled the door closed and produced his key what are you doing said catullus locking the door catullus shrugged if you wish it seemed to lucius that his meaning was clear there was little need to lock a house to which a man would never return he was carried through the streets in a sedan that seated only himself he made no attempt to converse with catullus who had his own sedan and was carried sometimes alongside him sometimes in front depending on the width of the street lucius found himself thinking of stories he had heard regarding the cruel games domitian played with his victims disarming them with gifts and tokens of friendship before subjecting them to hideous tortures his favourite interrogation technique was to burn the genitals of his victims his favourite punishment short of death was to cut off their hands the shortest route to the palace would have taken them close by the flavian amphitheatre and the colossus instead they went through the forum passing by the house of the vestals and the temple of vesta was this done deliberately to unnerve him surely it was for when they at last ascended the palatine the bearers passed directly by luciuss house catullus had to know exactly where they were as they passed by the house his sedan fell back alongside that of lucius and catullus turned turn his head to lucius and smiled as if to taunt him with a final glimpse of his home the sedans deposited them at one of the entrances to the imperial palace the reception chamber to which they were led with its soaring ceiling was grander than any room lucius had ever seen before even the most ornately decorated temples could not compare with the opulence of the place which was perhaps best seen at this hour of the day the last of the fading sunlight from the high windows still lit the far corners revealing the sheer scale and the astounding attention to detail while a multitude of newly lit lamps gave a lustrous gleam to the polished surfaces of marble and bronze and caused the monumental statue of domitian at the centre of the chamber covered with silver and gold to sparkle with points of fiery light from the reception room they were shown through a series of equally opulent but increasingly smaller chambers until lucius found himself walking in single file behind catullus with a praetorian directly behind him through a narrow hallway faced with dark green marble on all sides even the low ceiling was made of the same marble if any daylight remained it could not penetrate here the way was lit only by feeble lamps set far apart in the walls lucius had the sense of having gone underground though they had descended no steps he felt as if he were entering the tomb of some ancient king the air grew stale and thin he found it difficult to breathe lucius was shown to a small side chamber faced all around with the same dark green marble and lit by a single lamp and was left alone to change his clothes the garment laid out for him was a robe with long sleeves not unlike the one catullus was wearing but solid black even the embroidery around the hems was black reluctantly lucius took off his bright tunic laid it aside and picked up the robe then he gave a start and let out a stifled cry from nowhere a boy had appeared he was wearing black and had black hair and his skin had been painted black as well in the dimness of the room lucius had not seen the boy until he suddenly stepped forward like an apparition from a nightmare i am to be your cupbearer tonight master said the boy taking the robe from lucius allow me to help you dress master dumbfounded lucius allowed the boy to help him put on the black robe then the boy took him by the hand and pushed against a spot on the marble wall a door opened as if by magic and the boy led him through lucius found himself in a room without colour every surface was black the floor and the walls were of solid black marble the small tables set about the room were made of black metal as were the lamps which emitted only the faintest light the four dining couches gathered in a square were made of ebony and strewn with black pillows one of the couches was larger and more ornate than the others lucius detected a movement from the corner of his eye he thought he had seen a door open in one of the black marble walls but since no light was admitted from whatever room lay beyond he was not sure until a figure entered dressed like himself in black and led by a boy painted black it was catullus without a word the man stood before the dining couch opposite the larger couch he made a gesture to indicate that lucius should stand before the couch to his right another figure emerged from the doorway led by another boy lucius let out a gasp that echoed sharply in the small room it was cornelia she was dressed in a linen gown and a suffibulum headdress much like the vestments she normally wore except that these were solid black their eyes met the fear on her face mirrored his own she raised a hand towards him her fingers trembled the gesture was a plea for help neither of them spoke conscious of the blind catullus who indicated with a nod that cornelia should stand before the couch to his left by the dim light lucius saw an upright stone marker leaning against the wall behind cornelias couch letters were engraved on the stone but he could not make them out he looked over his shoulder and saw that a similar stone marker was behind his own couch the decorative engraving and the general shape were those of a grave marker chiselled into the stone was his own name lucius saw spots before his eyes the room seemed to sway and pitch he thought he might fall and looked for a way to steady himself the cupbearer sensed his distress and took his hand lucius leaned against the boy feeling faint and dizzy he was in such distress that he did not realize domitian had entered the room until he saw the emperor half sitting half reclining on the couch of honour at first glance the emperor appeared to be dressed in black like everyone else but on closer inspection lucius saw that domitians robes were of a purple so dark as to be very nearly black decorated with embroidery in the darkest possible shade of red on his head he wore a black laurel wreath the lamps cast their light in such a way that his eyes were hidden by deep shadows and could not be seen attending the emperor was the smallheaded creature who accompanied him at the games the creatures face was oddly shaped and his features were wizened even seeing him so closely lucius could not tell if he was a child or a dwarf like the other cupbearers he was painted entirely black lucius realized that catullus was reclining as well and so was cornelia and everyone in the room was staring at him had he lost consciousness for a moment his cupbearer hissed at him the boy tugged his hand urging him to sit lucius lowered himself onto the couch the cupbearer made a great fuss of fluffing pillows and arranging them for his comfort a first course of black olives was served along with crusts of a moist black bread sprinkled with black poppy seeds wine was poured for him in the cup the wine looked pitchblack meanwhile in the space between the four couches a group of young male dancers painted black like the serving boys and wearing very little performed a dance the music was funereal all shrill pipes and rattles lucius had no idea where it came from the musicians were nowhere to be seen the dance seemed interminable lucius saw that catullus was eating but he himself had no appetite and neither he noticed did cornelia amid so much darkness her face looked very pale nor did domitian eat he watched the dancers at last with a wild trilling of pipes and a final flourish of rattles the performance ended and the dancers dispersed they seemed to vanish into the walls an interesting fact about funerals said domitian he stared straight ahead in the old days all funerals were performed at night even those of great men nowadays only the poor are buried at night because they can afford no funeral procession funeral processions in my view are overrated if only because they are all alike first come the musicians alerting everyone to the coming event then the mourning women usually hired then the players and buffoons who imitate the deceased then come the slaves he freed showing gratitude with tears and laments for their late master and then the players who wear the wax masks of his ancestors as if the dead have come back to life to welcome their descendant into their ranks and then comes the dead man himself carried on a bier on the shoulders of his nearest relatives so that everyone can have a final look before hes laid on a pyre and burned people throw all sorts of things on the fire the dead mans clothes his favourite foods his most beloved books someone makes a speech and when its all over the ashes are scooped up and put in a stone sarcophagus another interesting fact in the old days our ancestors didnt burn the bodies of the dead but buried them intact im told that the christians favour this type of burial even today they place some value on the corpse itself expecting it to come back to life but who would wish to come back to life after the body has begun to rot especially to find oneself trapped in a stone box or buried underground like most of the farfetched ideas of the christians this one seems rather poorly thought out we romans no longer practice burial except in the very special case of the inhumation of a vestal guilty of breaking her vow of chastity but in that event the burial is not of a dead body but of a body while it still breathes catullus nodded that is the ancient penalty but i recall that caesar in his wisdom allowed a less severe punishment when the oculata sisters and varronilla were condemned a few years ago i have been having second thoughts about that decision said domitian it is seldom advisable to abandon the wisdom of our ancestors it was king numa the successor to romulus who founded the order of vestals in roma the punishment he decreed for an errant vestal was death by stoning is that a fact catullus chewed an olive and spat the pit into the waiting palm of his cupbearer i never knew that it was a later king tarquinius priscus who devised the penalty of death by inhumation his argument was religious let no mortal kill a priestess of vesta he declared let that decision be left to vesta herself so the vestal is alive when shes placed in that little vault underground and then the vault is sealed and the opening is covered over with dirt no man commits the act of killing her and she is given nothing with which she might commit the act herself time and the judgement of vesta take care of her i have been thinking that tarquinius priscus showed great wisdom in this matter even exceeding that of numa the first course was taken away each of the guests was given a plate of mushrooms and other fungi all black thanks to the sauce in which they had been simmered again only catullus showed any signs of appetite he ate with relish sucking the sauce from his fingertips as i recall he said when caesar judged the men who violated varronilla and the oculatae he showed great leniency yes i allowed them to live i have been reconsidering the wisdom of that decision too it might have been wiser i think to enforce the traditional punishment for the seducer of a vestal as a deterrent to others who might be tempted to commit such a crime in the future as pontifex maximus i must do all i can to preserve the sanctity of those who keep vestas fire do you not agree virgo maxima for the first time domitian acknowledged cornelias presence in a very faint voice she replied yes dominus tonight you may address me as pontifex maximus he said yes pontifex maximus thats better would you not agree virgo maxima that the traditional penalty makes for a powerful deterrent the man is stripped naked hung on a cross and publicly beaten with rods while the violated vestal watches until he is dead im told that can take quite a while depending on the mans general health a man with a weak heart might die after the first blow others remain alive for hours the beating can become quite tedious to administer not to say tiring sometimes the lictors charged with the beating become so exhausted that new lictors have to be brought in to continue the punishment it seemed to lucius that the plate of delicacies held before him by his cupbearer contained not fungi but a mixture of viscera and organs swimming in a nameless fluid he began to feel nauseated black figs were served next to all except domitian the servers brought him a single apple together with a silver knife domitian set about peeling the apple very slowly and methodically cutting away thin strips of the skin he handed these to the smallheaded attendant who gobbled them up as a dog might eat scraps from its masters table when domitian bit into the apple the noise was startling like the cracking of bones lucius again saw spots before his eyes he heard a low noise it was domitian whispering to the smallheaded creature who whispered back the two of them laughed we were wondering how it is catullus that a man who is blind can burn with lust for another beauty inspires passion but how can beauty be perceived without sight catullus turned his face to cornelia a blind man may possess memories of beauty a blind man has imagination ah but beauty fades catullus it is as shortlived as it is intoxicating your memories are surely outofdate domitian stared at cornelia who lowered her face beauty exists only in the moment that is why i asked earinus to entertain us tonight although you cannot see him catullus i assure you that he is beautiful the eunuch entered the room dressed in black he was small and delicate and moved with such grace that he seemed to float across the floor his pale hair the subject of poets was startlingly bright in the dark room it seemed to glow with a light of its own his skin was creamy white in the shadowy room earinus seemed to be an ethereal being from a realm of dreams he stood in the centre of the room and began to sing the notes were pure and sweet but also unsettling his voice had an uncanny quality impossible to categorize the song like the singer seemed to emerge from some realm beyond ordinary experience what has death to frighten man if souls can die as bodies can when mortal frame shall be disbanded this lump of flesh from life unhanded from grief and pain we shall be free we shall not feel for we shall not be but suppose that after meeting fate the soul still feels in its divided state whats that to us for we are only we while body and soul in one frame agree and if our atoms should revolve by chance and our castoff matter rejoin the dance what gain to us would all this bring this newmade man would be a newmade thing we dead and gone would play no part in all the pleasures nor feel the smart which to that new man shall accrue whom of our matter time moulds anew take heart then listen and hear what is there left in death to fear after the pause of life has come between all s just the same had we never been the last note of the song was followed by a long silence watching the eunuch and listening to him lucius thought of sporus a tear ran down his cheek before he could wipe it away he realized that domitian had risen from his couch and was walking slowly to him the emperors eyes emerged from the shadows and glittered reflecting the lamplight his unblinking gaze was fixed on luciuss face as a hunter lucius had often wondered at the tendency of certain prey such as rabbits to freeze rather than to flee when observed by the hunter now he understood he felt as the rabbit must feel unable to move a muscle frantically willing himself to vanish into the darkness around him it was as if he had turned to stone even his heart seemed to stop beating domitian stepped closer he stared at lucius intently his small mouth compressed in an unreadable expression he stopped directly in front of lucius and reached out to him frozen as he was lucius nevertheless feared that he would cry out if domitian touched his face he struggled not to flinch and only a stifled gasp escaped his lips domitian used his forefinger to wipe the moisture from luciuss cheek he furrowed his brow gazed at his finger then turned and very gently brushed his finger against the parted lips of earinus does it taste of salt he whispered earinus touched his tongue to his lips yes dominus a tear said domitian was it the words of the poet lucretius that made you weep lucius pinarius lucius open his mouth afraid he had forgotten how to speak then found his voice im not sure i heard the words dominus i only know that i heard earinus sing and then i felt the tear on my cheek domitian slowly nodded i too wept the first time i heard earinus sing he stared at lucius for a long time then turned to catullus the dinner is over he said the emperor left the room without another word the smallheaded creature followed him as did earinus lucius stood he looked at cornelia across the room and felt an urge to run to her she raised one hand beseeching him to keep his distance as they stared into each others eyes with all the power of his will he tried to show her what she meant to him he had never loved her more the serving boy took cornelias hand gently pulled her to her feet and led her from the room the room became even darker lucius looked around and saw that all the lamps but one had been extinguished catullus had vanished except for his cupbearer lucius was alone the boy led him though a doorway he was hardly aware of his surroundings though he sensed that each turning brought him to a hallway that was larger and more brightly lit than the last finally he arrived at the vast reception room dominated by the statue of the emperor he looked up at the statues face the sculptor had captured the terrible power of domitians gaze lucius shut his eyes and reached for the cupbearer letting the boy lead him like a blind man he opened his eyes only when he felt fresh air on his face and realized that they were outside under a dark and moonless sky a flight of steps led down to the sedan that had brought him the boy helped him step inside bearers lifted him aloft next to him on the seat were the clothes he had changed out of earlier the trip to his house was short he stepped from the sedan the bearers turned and vanished without a word lucius rapped on the door hilarion opened it his knowing grin vanished when he saw the look on luciuss face what do you see hilarion no dont speak you see a dead man before you in the days that followed lucius expected praetorians to arrive at his house at any moment to arrest him moving sometimes in a stupor sometimes in a frantic rush he put his affairs in order he wore the fascinum always so that he would not be without it when they came for him confronted by oblivion he tried to think about the gods and his ancestors and all the other things a man was supposed to think about in the face of death but he drew a blank in the end did he believe in nothing at all this revelation was the most disturbing aspect of the ordeal he had left the house of the flavians shaken uncertain full of dread as would any man but more than that he had emerged with a sense that nothing mattered in the black room all illusions had been stripped away a man and a rabbit were exactly the same two flashes of consciousness caught for a brief instant in the cycle of life and death that had no beginning no end no resolution no purpose in such a frame of mind he received the news that cornelia had been arrested then he heard that others had been arrested men accused of being her lovers that these men were innocent lucius had no doubt for he was certain that he was her only lover they were simply men who had run afoul of the emperor and this was domitians way of destroying them not one of them confessed though they were interrogated under torture nor did cornelias slaves from the house of the vestals produce any evidence against them the verdict against cornelia and her alleged lovers was delivered not in roma but at the emperors retreat at alba cornelia was not even present at the mockery of a trial she was condemned in absentia there was speculation that the guilty men would be allowed to flee into exile as had happened after the previous trials of vestals but because they had not cooperated with the court in other words confessed it was decreed that the men must suffer the traditional penalty in the forum for all to see they were stripped naked tied to crosses and beaten to death cornelia was compelled to be present lucius stayed at home he was not sure which would have been worse to see the men killed or to see cornelia as she was forced to watch he intended to avoid the spectacle of cornelias punishment as well but on the scheduled day well publicized by heralds and placards he found himself unable to stay away starting before dawn thousands of people began to gather outside the house of the vestals no living person had ever before witnessed the traditional punishment of a vestal the same spectators who flocked to the flavian amphitheatre came to see this spectacle as well they dressed in dark colours appropriate for a funeral the forum was a sea of black lucius found himself at the back of the crowd he could not have pushed his way to the front if he had wanted to there was nothing to see at least at first the beginning of the ceremony took place out of sight within the house of the vestals that was where cornelia would be relieved of her vitta and her suffibulum stripped naked and scourged with rods while the pontifex maximus the other vestals and the assembled priests of the state religion watched then she would be dressed as a corpse and placed in a closed black litter with restraints on her limbs and a gag over her mouth and the litter would be carried aloft like a funeral bier through the streets the crowd awaiting the appearance of the funeral litter grew restless some the women began to keen and tear out their hair some of the men muttered curses against the guilty vestal some made obscene jokes smirking and laughing a few dared to speculate that the vestal might be innocent despite the judgement of the pontifex maximus for it was said that she had comported herself with utmost dignity throughout her trial and that not one of the condemned men had spoken against her at last preceded by musicians with rattles and pipes the funeral litter appeared black curtains concealed the occupant but the knowledge that a living woman was inside the virgo maxima herself known to everyone because of her appearances at religious rites and at the amphitheatre caused people to shudder and gasp the procession passed at a stately pace through the forum then entered the subura heading for the colline gate this was the very route thought lucius that his father had taken with nero on their final journey out of roma the procession moved slowly down the narrow street oppressed by the crush of people lucius left the route and took other streets to arrive ahead of the procession at an open area just inside the old servian walls here the crowd had only begun to gather and lucius was able to find a place near the front there was not much to see only a hole in the ground from which a ladder protruded and next to it a pile of freshly dug earth this was the opening normally covered over to the underground vault that had existed since the time of tarquinius priscus in which for centuries condemned vestals had been interred and left to die how large was the chamber and how deep underground no one knew except the very few officials of the state religion who had seen it it was said to contain a cot a lamp with a little oil a few scraps of food and a pitcher with a bit of water cruel gestures of welcome and comfort for a victim doomed to starve to death in darkness presumably the vault was quite small but for all lucius knew it extended under his feet he might be standing over the very spot where cornelia would breathe her last what became of the previous vestals who died in this place were their remains ever removed or were they left in the chamber on grisly display for each new victim to see if that was true the chamber would house the remains of every vestal who had been condemned to die there cornelia would be made to see exactly what was to become of her and to contemplate the company she was joining and to realize that her own remains would be there for the next condemned vestal to see lucius found himself imagining the scene in horrifying detail unable to think of anything else at last he heard the sound of horns and rattles along with cries and moans of lamentation the procession was approaching the crowd grew thick around him but lucius stayed where he was determined to be as close to cornelia as possible at last the funeral litter arrived surrounded by a great many lictors to hold back the crowd and keep order and followed by the vestals and numerous priests among them was domitian wearing the toga of the pontifex maximus with its many folds gathered and tucked in a loop just above his waist and the cowl pulled over his head casting his face in shadow near him was catullus dressed in black and guided by a boy who held his hand the litter was placed on a platform near the opening the bearers drew back priests opened the curtains undid the straps that held cornelia in place and removed the gag from her mouth they roughly pulled her from the litter onto her feet cornelia stood before the crowd dressed not in her linen vestments but in a simple stola made of black wool the sight of a vestal without her headdress was startling even shocking without her suffibulum her uncommonly short hair was visible to all to see her that way in public knowing all eyes were on her made luciuss face turn hot the sight of her short hair had been his exclusive privilege now all roma saw her that way the indignity was as obscene as if she had been stripped naked some in the crowd dared to jeer at her without her vestments she was no longer a priestess but a mere woman and a fallen woman at that a wicked creature deserving a horrible death domitian put an end to the jeering lictors with rods quickly moved into the crowd striking anyone who failed to maintain the proper decorum cornelia was expected to walk the short distance from the litter to the opening in the ground by herself she did so with halting steps her body was stiff she seemed to be in pain lucius knew that she had been beaten with rods and wondered what sort of wounds and bruises were concealed by her black stola she reached the opening and looked down at the ladder that descended to the vault she swayed and jerked like a reed blown by a wind she looked upwards and stared at the sky she raised her hands vesta she shouted you know i never betrayed you while i served in your temple the sacred flame never wavered silence cried domitian cornelia lowered her eyes and gazed at the crowd looking from face to face caesar says i am guilty of impurity but my conduct of vestas rituals was immaculate every one of his victories every triumph he celebrated is proof of the goddesss favour domitian signalled to one of the lictors who moved towards cornelia if she would not step onto the ladder and begin the descent of her own volition she would be forced to do so when the man reached out to grab her arm she shrugged him off it was only a slight movement but the lictor recoiled violently as if he had been struck cornelia never touched him cried a woman in the crowd it was the hand of the goddess that threw him back see how calm she is how dignified said someone else his heart racing lucius dared to raise his voice perhaps shes innocent after all if vesta allows no man to touch her it made no difference the crowd ignored these scattered protests cornelia stepped onto the ladder and took hold of it with trembling hands she took a step down and then another until she was visible only from the waist up it was all lucius could do not to call to her despite his silence she seemed to sense his presence she paused and turned her head she looked straight at him she moved her lips mouthing silent words intended only for him forgive me cornelia took another step and another then vanished from sight the crowd let out a collective groan men shook their heads and shuddered women dropped to their knees and wailed while she descended the ladder moved slightly relaying the vibration of her steps then the ladder was still lictors stepped forward and pulled it from the hole the ladder was a long one the vault was many feet underground a large flat stone was placed over the opening the mound of earth was spread over the stone and pounded with mallets until the ground was even and no sign remained of the opening the new virgo maxima with averted eyes and a trembling voice stood on the spot and uttered a prayer to vesta asking the goddess to forgive the people of roma for allowing such a breach of piety and to restore her favour to the city the pontifex maximus and his retinue began to withdraw catullus was the last to leave led off by the boy it seemed to lucius that there was a smile on the mans gaunt face the crowd gradually dispersed until only lucius remained he stared at the place where the opening had been there was nothing to see nothing to hear cornelia had been swallowed by the earth yet he knew she must be still alive still breathing why was lucius still alive lucius knew the answer he had been saved by a quirk of fate the master and god of the world who saw enemies everywhere and executed men without reason who watched thousands die in the arena without mercy had been swayed by a sentimental whim earinus was the one human being for whom domitian felt any semblance of love when earinus sang in the black room lucius had wept for that reason alone domitian had spared him lucius had been saved by a tear the absurdity of it only deepened his despair he thought of cornelias final words forgive me he was alive and unscathed a free man for his affair with cornelia he had suffered no consequence whatsoever for what should he forgive cornelia it made no sense yet he was certain that she had mouthed the words forgive me what did it mean ad reclining in the shade of his garden on a hot afternoon in the month of augustus lucius reflected on the unexpected path his life had taken over the last two years the punishment of cornelia had marked a low point in his life existence had lost all meaning his taste for life had vanished nothing brought him pleasure was he in pain if so his pain was not a sharp agony a reminder that he was alive but a dull hollow sensation like a foretaste of death he was stripped of all emotion he did not loathe the world or hate the people in it he felt nothing now all that had changed his time of utmost despair was in the past once again he was able to take enjoyment from simple pleasures the bright colours and sweet fragrances of flowers in his garden the cheerful songs of birds the humming of bees the warm sunshine on his face the cooling breeze on his fingertips he was alive again fully alive not merely existing experiencing each moment as it occurred he was conscious of himself and accepting of the world in which he lived he had attained a state of contentment that he had never before thought possible his newfound peace was due to one man the teacher what had his life been like before he met the teacher lucius recalled his frequent visits to the house of epaphroditus over the years friendship had been the main reason for those visits but he had also been seeking wisdom but after the death of cornelia martials wit no longer amused him and lucius found the poets ties to the emperor intolerable the philosophy of epictetus seemed bland and insubstantial nor did the letters lucius received from dio convey any sense of enlightenment luciuss visits to the house of epaphroditus grew less and less frequent the unanswered letters from dio piled up on the table in his study yet even at the deepest point of his despair lucius had continued to seek comfort and enlightenment turning away from his circle of friends for a while he had studied the more esoteric modes of belief available to a curious man in roma of these there were a great many every cult in the empire eventually found adherents and proselytizers in roma as epaphroditus had once told him people were capable of believing anything the startling array of religions practised in the city was proof of that lucius even investigated the muchdespised cult of the christians of which his uncle kaeso had been a member but found it no more interesting than any of the other cults he had also made a study of astrology since so many people held such store by it but the fatalistic nature of it had only made him more despondent the astrologers taught that every aspect of a mans life was determined in advance by powers unimaginably larger than himself within that predestined fate a man had very little leeway to affect the course of his life what was the point of knowing that a certain day was illomened if one could do nothing to reverse the tide of events a man could hope to propitiate a temperamental god but nothing could be done to alter the influence of the stars if indeed such an influence existed for although wiser men than himself considered astrology a science and devoted great study to it lucius was unimpressed by all the charts derived from ancient texts and the endless tables full of esoteric symbols he had a uneasy suspicion that astrology was a fraud certainly astrologers had carefully observed the heavens and had learned to predict the movements of the celestial bodies with considerable accuracy but the rest of the socalled science determining precisely how those celestial bodies affected human existence seemed a mere invention to lucius a compendium of nonsense contrived by men who understood no more about the secret workings of the universe than did anyone else philosophy exotic religions astrology lucius had been open to them all but none had provided him with any sense of purpose or enlightenment none had relieved the emptiness he felt at the core of his being then he met the teacher and everything changed it happened on the first anniversary of the day cornelia was buried alive for a long time lucius had been dreading that day knowing that when it arrived he would be able to think of nothing else that morning he woke early he had no appetite he put on a plain tunic and left his house for hours he walked aimlessly all over the city lost in memories eventually he found himself standing before the house on the esquiline where he had met with cornelia so many times over the years he had sold the house quickly and for less than its value only a few days after her interment thinking that he would never want to step inside it again now he stood before it in the street longing to go in to stand in the vestibule and remember the sight of her face across the room to smell again the jasmine in the small garden where they had made love the door of the house opened a mother and her young daughter stepped out followed by a slave carrying a basket for a trip to the markets the spell was broken and lucius moved on inevitably he found himself at the colline gate standing exactly where he had stood when he saw her last before the entrance to the sealed underground chamber in his hand he held a single rose the symbol of love and also of secrecy he could not remember where he had gotten it he must have bought it from a vendor he clutched it so carelessly that a thorn had pricked his palm he did not feel the wound but saw a trickle of blood run down his fingers the moment felt unreal dreamlike he found himself kneeling at the very spot where the stone had been covered over as one might place a garland on a sepulchre he placed the rose on the beaten earth blood dripped from his fingers a shadow fell across him he imagined that he had been observed by some disapproving magistrate and that a lictor stood over him but the outline of the shadow was not that of a soldier he looked up to see a small man with a long white beard the sun was directly behind the mans head making his unruly hair into a wispy halo his features were surprisingly youthful for a man with snowwhite hair and deeply tanned the sunburned face of a traveller or a man without a home his eyes were bright blue and appeared to sparkle later lucius would realized this was impossible since the sun was behind the mans head and his face was in shadow from whence came the light that emanated from his eyes this was luciuss first indication that the man who stood over him was more than an ordinary mortal youre suffering my friend said the man yes lucius saw no point in denying it such suffering is like a flower that blooms it opens all at once and engages all our senses but soon enough it fades and falls away you will remember it always but it will no longer be present before you take heart my friend for the time when your suffering will fade and fall away is very near who are you lucius frowned he was still on his knees anyone seeing him now would assume that he was kneeling to honour the man before him despite the fact that the man was barefoot and dressed like a beggar wearing a threadbare ragged tunic strangely the idea did not displease lucius he stayed on his knees my name is apollonius i come from tyana do you know where that is in cappadocia i think that is correct have you heard of me no good those who have heard of apollonius of tyana often have certain preconceptions about me which i am not interested in fulfilling what is your name friend lucius pinarius are you some sort of wise man cappadocia with its weird desert cities carved from rock was famous for breeding hermits and seers the man laughed the sound was very pleasant i am whatever people choose to call me when you know me better lucius pinarius you will decide what i am why are you talking to me all men suffer but no man should suffer in secret as you do what do you know of my suffering you loved a person whom law and religion decreed you should not love and her separation from you has caused you much pain lucius gasped how can you know this the man smiled there was no mockery in his smile only gentleness i suppose i could put on airs of mystery and pretend that the stories about me are true that i can read mens minds that i have occult means of gaining knowledge but the truth is much simpler im a visitor to roma before this morning i never passed though this particular neighbourhood but even a casual visitor will quickly be told by the locals what happened on this spot a year ago when i observed a man standing here clutching a rose and staring for a long time at the ground i knew you must have had some relationship with the vestal who was buried here when you knelt and placed the rose so carefully heedless of your own bleeding wound i knew you must have loved her anyone with eyes could have seen this but in such a busy spot where everyone is passing by in such a hurry i alone observed your suffering who are you said lucius you asked me that already i am apollonius of tyana no i mean here why dont you stand my friend apollonius offered his hand lets take a walk lucius said little he listened to apollonius who spoke of his travels apollonius talked about these journeys in an offhand way as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world for a man to have gone to egypt to learn what the priests there could teach him about the hieroglyphs on the ancient tombs and to ethiopia to meet the naked sages who live at the source of the nile and even all the way to india to consort with the fabled wise men of the ganges a light rain began to fall they had wandered into an area of fine homes on the quirinal hill lucius was looking for a tavern or eatery where they might take refuge when apollonius noticed that the door of a nearby house was open he cocked his head do you hear that he said i hear nothing said lucius no i distinctly hear the sound of weeping coming from that house apollonius walked towards the open door what are you doing said lucius going inside where there is weeping there is need for comfort do you know these people ive never been on this street before in my life but all streets and all people are the same once a man knows that he is a stranger nowhere apollonius stepped inside the house against his better judgement lucius followed him beyond the vestibule in the atrium a drizzling rain fell from the open skylight into a shallow pool beyond the pool on the tile floor lay the body of a young woman she wore a white bridal gown with a purple sash around her waist gathered around the body were several women all dressed for a wedding they looked stunned some quietly wept farther back stood a group of men who looked helpless and confused how had apollonius heard the sound of the women weeping when lucius had not for an old man his hearing was very acute thought lucius apollonius looked down at the young woman is this her wedding day he said one of the kneeling women looked up there was an expression of shock on her face yes this is my daughters wedding day and the gods see fit to strike her down what happened said apollonius the woman shook her head we were organizing the procession to set out for the bridegrooms house we were in her room and i was tying the sash around her waist and she complained i was pulling too tight she said she couldnt breathe but the sash wasnt too tight i slipped a finger under it to show her still she couldnt catch her breath she said her face felt hot a servant told us it was raining without a word she pulled away from me and ran here to the pool i thought she wanted to cool her face i told her she mustnt get her gown wet and then she collapsed she fell just as you see her now perhaps she only sleeps she has no heartbeat she isnt breathing alas whispered apollonius he looked intently at the girl then at the huddled women he waved his hands before him to get their attention lucius thought but then the old man continued to move his hands making signs in the air apollonius had the full attention of everyone in the room including the men who stood farther back they all stared at him the women who had been weeping were now silent stand back said apollonius without a word the women drew back apollonius circled the pool and knelt beside the girl he put one hand on her forehead and passed the other hand over her body not touching her he whispered inaudible words apollonius snapped his fingers in the quiet room where the only other sound was the fall of drizzling raindrops on the pool the noise echoed like the breaking of a small branch he paused then snapped his finger twice more the girl shuddered drew a deep breath and let out a sigh she opened her eyes where am i she said her mother cried out the women gasped uttered exclamations of thanksgiving and shed tears of relief some of the men began to weep as well one of them stepped forward stranger you brought my daughter back to life the man was giddy with joy your daughter is indeed alive but i am no stranger i am apollonius of tyana how did you work such a miracle what god did you call upon apollonius shrugged i merely spoke to your daughter awake young woman i said the rain is about to stop and you shall be late for your wedding breathe deeply and awake and then as you saw she woke what girl wants to be late for her own wedding but how can i repay you here you must take these the father fetched a pair of drinking cups solid silver he said decorated with bits of lapis and not just any lapis but the special variety flecked with gold that comes only from bactria the workmanship is exquisite said apollonius they were to be a gift to my daughter and her new husband but here i want you to have them apollonius laughed what use have i for cups when i never drink wine drink water from them then the man grinned or sell them buy yourself a tunic with no holes in it apollonius shrugged a few more holes in this garment and i shall be as splendidly arrayed as the naked sages of ethiopia the man looked puzzled but was so happy that he burst out laughing i see that your daughter is on her feet again said apollonius go to her she wont be yours for much longer you should enjoy every precious moment precious indeed said the man how precious i never knew until this day thank you apollonius of tyana may the gods bless you the man joined his wife who was making a great fuss over their daughter amid the hubbub apollonius discreetly withdrew lucius followed on the way out they passed a young vestal who was just arriving to take her place in the procession the sight of her sent a chill through lucius in the street he had to pause to collect himself apollonius stood by observing him with a sympathetic smile i dont understand what happened in there lucius finally said was the girl dead or not ah wedding days they bring out a great deal of emotion in people are you saying they only imagined she was dead apollonius shrugged i suspect they were less observant than they might have been people often are did you notice for example how the women near the misty drizzle exuded a faint but visible vapour with each exhalation are you saying you observed such a vapour coming from the girls nostrils i saw what there was to see my eyes see no more and no less than those of other men lucius raised an eyebrow you did something with your hands they all watched did you bewitch them somehow i made them take notice of me and when i asked them to move aside they did so does that sound like magic to you lucius crossed his arms those cups he offered you were quite beautiful quite valuable too i imagine i had no use for them nonsense as the man said you could have sold them those cups would have paid for three months lodging in a nice apartment on the aventine but i never pay for lodging no i always stay with friends who are you staying with now with you of course apollonius laughed his laughter was infectious lucius felt his suspicions of the man fade away he began to laugh too and realized that it was the first time he had done so in more than a year so began his relationship with the teacher apollonius did not ask lucius to call him the teacher that was luciuss decision as apollonius told him at their first meeting i am whatever people choose to call me you will decide what i am apollonius was not a teacher in any traditional way he did not cite authorities and recite from texts as luciuss boyhood tutors had done he did not construct edifices of logic leading to rational conclusions like epictetus did he did not tell stories that led to some moral or theological conclusion like the mangod of the christians did he did not create charts and diagrams or write long treatises like the astrologers did and he certainly claimed no special status for himself or any special connection to the gods as did the priests of the state religion apollonius simply rose from his bed each morning and went about his day he visited old friends and made new ones by the example of his behaviour he showed that a man could move through the world without vanity or fear never showing anger or despair envious of no one wanting for nothing when asked apollonius would state his opinions and preferences but he never expounded on these to offer proof and he never insisted that others should agree with him he professed to believe in the gods but only as shadowy manifestations of a higher allencompassing principle and he claimed no special relationship with this principle beyond that which belonged to all living things which were equally a part of the divine unity and had equal access to the blessings that radiated like sunshine from that being i am to that deity as i am to the sun and so are you he would say i am no closer than you it warms me no more than it warms you it sheds no more light before me its blessing are for all equally and in endless abundance often it seemed to lucius that apollonius behaved in ways contradictory to what other men called common sense when lucius would question these seemingly perverse actions apollonius would patiently explain himself even so lucius could not always understand the teachers words but lucius was ceaselessly amazed by the teachers unfailing equanimity and he came to trust the man implicitly even when lucius could not follow apolloniuss reasoning he strove to emulate the teacher as best he could and to accept on faith that a fuller understanding might someday come to him apollonius did not drink wine intoxication did not bring a man closer to the deity he said but interposed a veil of illusion lucius followed his example apollonius did not eat meat saying that all life was sacred including that of animals nor did he wear anything made from an animal there were no scraps of leather bones or ivory on his person lucius followed this example as well and like apollonius he came to see the slaying of animals as no different from the slaying of men men did not kill other men for food or for hides nor should they kill animals and just as civilized men had long ago given up the religious practice of human sacrifice so it was time for men to give up animal sacrifice the slaying of a beast could be no more pleasing to the gods than the slaying of a child as for the killing of animals in the arena for sport that was sheer cruelty and if anything was worse than the killing of humans for sport for the animals did not possess speech and could not beg for mercy lucius who had enjoyed hunting all his life gave it up apollonius did not engage in sexual intimacy with others which he called an illusion and a trap fleeting moments of pleasure led only to endless agitation and suffering lucius asked him if copulation was not a virtue since it was necessary for procreation apollonius who believed in reincarnation replied what is the virtue of creating more human beings and thus more mortal life and thus more suffering if there were to be no more human beings eventually the population would vanish and would that be a bad thing if we possess spirits those spirits will still exist they will simply be freed from the onerous process of transmigrating from body to body wearing out one after another endlessly suffering the pains of mortal decay with or without humanity as we know it the divine unity will continue to exist this sentimental attachment to creating endless replicas of ourselves is yet another illusion another trap procreation only perpetuates the cycle of suffering there is no virtue in it it is a vice as far as lucius could determine no other wise man whether philosopher or religious savant had ever declared universal chastity to be a virtue at first lucius was dubious of following this example but in fact he was already practising it since the death of cornelia he had withdrawn from seeking intimacy with anyone else it required no real change on his part to emulate apollonius and once he made a conscious decision to do so he felt a great sense of freedom and relief apollonius held the great and powerful in no special esteem nor did he fear them during his first visit to roma in the reign of nero he had attracted the attention of the emperors henchman tigellinus who had put a watch on him apollonius gave the informers no cause to arrest him until he happened to hear nero sing one day in a common tavern the emperor was incognito wearing a mask but there was no doubt that it was him tigellinus was in the audience also in disguise wearing a hooded cloak and an eyepatch after neros performance he asked apolloniuss opinion was it not fit for the gods if the gods like it we must strive not to think less of them said apollonius tigellinus was incensed do you realize who that was youve just heard caesar sing one of his own compositions was it not divine now that it is over i do feel closer to the gods stop speaking in riddles and say what you mean i say the singing was wonderful what do you say i say i have a higher opinion of the emperor than you do how is that you think it is wonderful if he sings i think it is wonderful if he simply remains silent tigellinus charged apollonius with impugning the dignity of the emperor and arrested him as the trial approached he realized that he needed stronger evidence than the ambiguous statements made by apollonius he put an informer up to writing a series of charges against apollonius and had the charges notarized so that when they were produced in court they would appear to come from an outside witness all sorts of false statements were imputed to apollonius of a nature seditious enough to have him put to death in the court before nero and the magistrates apollonius was called forth tigellinus produced the sealed scroll upon which the accusations were written and brandished it like a dagger but when he unrolled the scroll his jaw dropped and he stood speechless nero demanded to see the scroll for himself is this a joke he asked tigellinus the parchment was completely blank nero ordered tigellinus to set apollonius free with the stipulation that he should leave italy at once nero thought i was a magician explained apollonius he feared that i would exact a supernatural revenge if i were to be imprisoned or executed but teacher asked lucius how did it happen that the scroll tigellinus produced was blank had the original scroll been taken and another substituted had the scribe been given a special ink which faded away or did you call upon some supernatural power to make the lies on the parchment vanish i can think of another possibility said apollonius what if those who looked at the scroll simply did not see the writing that was there but teacher how could that happen very often when a thing is inexplicable it is simply a matter of seeing or not seeing just as it is possible to open a mans eyes to what is before him simply by directing his attention so there are ways to make a man blind to what is before him that was as clear an explanation as apollonius would give apollonius had also met vespasian this was when vitellius was emperor legions supporting vespasian were marching on roma but vespasian himself was in alexandria uncertain about the future and eager for advice vespasian had solicited the counsel of the most prestigious astrologers and philosophers in a city renowned for its learning in his first meeting with vespasian apollonius described a vision in which he beheld the final days of vitellius including the burning of the temple of jupiter and the narrow escape of domitian vespasian was dubious but a messenger brought news of these events to alexandria the very next day vespasian was greatly impressed either this fellow truly has visions of faroff events he remarked or else he has informationgathering capabilities superior to my own either way i want his advice i took advantage of that the opportunity to encourage vespasian in his ambitions apollonius told lucius i could see he was a man of equable temperament and the most likely candidate to restore peace and order to the chaotic state of the empire but later when he wrote me letters beseeching me to come to roma to advise him i refused why teacher because of his treatment of the greeks nero had many faults but he loved greece and greek culture he bestowed many privileges on the greek cities allowing them a degree of dignity and freedom no emperor had granted them before but vespasian saw fit to revoke every one of those privileges he deliberately and systematically returned the greeks to their subservient state he was a great disappointment to me whenever he wrote to me i wrote a scolding letter back to him no oh yes what did you say in these letters this was my final letter to him apollonius to the emperor vespasian a bad man redeemed himself by freeing the greeks a good man tarnished himself by enslaving them why should any man desire the company of a counsellor to whom he will not listen farewell given a letter of introduction by vespasian apollonius had also met titus this was in tarsus after vespasian returned to roma as emperor and entrusted affairs in the east to his son i liked titus said apollonius he was surprisingly modest and had a wonderful sense of humour and at thirty when many fighting men let themselves go he kept himself very fit titus had a very stout neck like an athlete in training once i grabbed him by the back of the neck and said who could ever force such a sturdy bull neck as this under a yoke and titus laughed and said only the man who reared me from a calf his deference to his father was endearing yet he had the makings of a better ruler than his father alas we had the father for ten years and the son for only two is it true that you foretold tituss early death said lucius apollonius smiled sometimes i know i seem to speak in riddles but about this i shall be as clear as i can imagine that you enter a dark cave you strike a spark and for just an instant you see the extent of the place the details are uncertain and the shape of the cavern is vague but you grasp at once if the cave is large or small so it is sometimes when i first meet a person in a flash i sense whether their time on this earth will be long or short i knew from the moment i met him that titus would not live to be as old as his father he was like a lamp that burns more brightly than others but for a shorter time and his brother i havent met domitian but to me it seems he is not like a lamp at all he is an extinguisher of lamps he brings darkness not light i wonder how much longer his reign of darkness will last apollonius shrugged the man is only fortytwo that was the age at which titus died yes but vespasian lived to be sixtytwo twenty more years of domitian exclaimed lucius perhaps said apollonius or perhaps not lucius reclined on his couch in the garden his eyes shut smelling the flowers thinking of how his life had changed in the year since he had met the teacher he felt the warmth of the sun on his bare feet apollonius had taught him to go barefoot what need had a man for shoes in his own house sometimes lucius even went to the forum barefoot others stared at him as if he were mad are you dreaming said apollonius he had excused himself for a moment to empty his bladder in the small latrina off the garden the teacher had a body just like those of other men and was subject to the same needs to ingest and expel as dictated by the endlessly repeating cycles of mortal flesh the others will arrive soon said lucius wishing it were not so he treasured time alone with the teacher listening to his stories asking him questions simply enjoying his tranquil presence but apollonius had many friends and it sometimes fell to lucius to play host to the others in his home he was expecting perhaps fifty men and women they would be of all social ranks from freedmen to patricians like himself there would probably be a few senators among them but also shopkeepers and artisans and bricklayers no one who wished to hear apollonius speak was turned away lucius looked at the teacher and smiled to a careless observer apollonius might appear to be nothing more than a doddering old man but such were the illusions of the material world appearances meant nothing emulating apollonius lucius had begun to eschew the services of his barber his hair had never been so long and never before had he sported a beard at the age of fortysix lucius had only a few touches of silver in his hair but someday he might hope to have a beard as fleecewhite as that of the teacher what story will you tell the gathering today asked lucius i was thinking i might talk about my time in ethiopia lucius nodded the teachers stories about ethiopia were among luciuss favourites i thought in particular i might tell the story of my encounter with the satyr since most people nowadays have never seen a satyr and have various misconceptions about the creatures lucius sat upright you met a satyr in ethiopia ive never heard that story could it be that i never told you never im sure i would have remembered well then it was during my journey to the see the great lake from whence the nile originates on its shores one finds a colony of the naked sages who are wiser than greek philosophers but not quite so wise as the sages of india to whom they are kin they welcomed me heartily but i could see they were in distress and i asked the cause nightly they were plagued by the visitations of a wild creature a being that was goatlike from the waist down with shaggy hind legs and hooves and manlike from the waist up but with goat horns and pointed ears from their description i deduced it was a satyr a being previously unknown in those parts this satyr interrupted the sleep of the sages tramping outside their huts and bleating in the middle of the night when they confronted the satyr and complained the creature made rude noises and obscene gestures when they attempted to apprehend him he proved to be swifter than even the swiftest among them leaping and careening and causing them to trip over one another and make fools of themselves the sages took me to a nearby village where the elders informed me that the satyrs incursions there were far more serious at least once a month always by night he intruded upon the comeliest and most nubile of the women muttering incantations in their ears while they slept putting them under a spell and luring them into the woods a few of the women had awakened from this spell and dared to resist him whereupon the creature physically attacked them strangling them and trampling them with his hooves two women had been killed in this way and others had been seriously injured the villagers were terrified of the satyr what did you do to help those people teacher i recalled my studies of a rare book left to us by king midas who was known to have a bit of satyr blood in his own veins as could be seen by the shape of his ears occasionally his satyr relatives imposed on midass hospitality making chaos of his court with their wild behaviour but as a child midas had been told by his mother of a way to deal with satyrs which he put to the test wine has a peculiar effect on them when a satyr imbibes he becomes intoxicated as men do and eventually he falls fast asleep snoring loudly as men do but when the satyr awakens from this drunken stupor his animal nature has departed from him and he is as harmless as a child such a tame satyr is capable of being taught to speak and even to reason the widespread reformation of satyrs is no doubt one reason they are so very rarely seen nowadays since such satyrs are more afraid of humans than are humans of them but a wild satyr has a great aversion to wine so the challenge is to trick him into drinking it the villagers had reason to think this satyr drank at night from a particular cattle trough the chief of the village had a jar of egyptian wine left over from a recent festival at my instruction every drop of wine was emptied into the trough one night in the morning it could be seen that a substantial part of the mixture of water and wine had been drunk the satyr was asleep in his lair no doubt but where was that i traversed the area all around the village pricking up my ears listening for the sound of snoring at last i heard a faint noise i followed it to a place the locals called the grotto of the nymphs there lying on a mossy stone amid the reeds snoring loudly lay the satyr fast asleep and stinking of wine the villagers were eager to awaken him but i thought it best that he should be allowed to come to his senses in his own time an hour later quite abruptly he ceased snoring rubbed his eyes and stood upright the villagers were of a mind to stone him and even began to gather up suitable rocks but i shielded him with my own body and told the villagers they must do no harm to the creature for now he was a changed satyr and his days of mischief were behind him that night at a blessedly sober festival for all the wine was gone the naked sages danced for the villagers and the satyr joined them leaping and somersaulting in the air lucius smiled the scent of jasmine under the hot sun was intoxicating if i heard such a tale from any other man i wouldnt believe it for a moment he said but from you teacher hilarion rushed into the garden from his look of alarm he was not there to announce the arrival of the guests praetorian guards he said they refused to wait in the vestibule armed men entered the garden you must be apollonius of tyana said an officer id think this hairy fellow was your son if i didnt know better he said smirking at lucius i should think a wellborn patrician could find a better teacher to model himself on or at least one who was better groomed but dont worry well relieve you both of those ridiculous beards soon enough lucius was snatched up by the guards and dragged from his house he and apollonius were marched barefoot through the streets towards the imperial palace while his neighbours alerted by the commotion looked on some were aghast but others looked smugly pleased luciuss disdain for social functions his eccentric new appearance and his disreputablelooking visitors had caused a scandal among his wellconnected neighbours on the palatine they approached the same entrance to the palace at which lucius had arrived for his dinner in the black room he felt a surge of panic and looked to apollonius for guidance the teacher did not appear to be impressed by the grand entryway or fearful of what might lie beyond teacher do you understand whats happening i think so at long last i am to meet the emperor forgive me teacher if i had been on my guard if hilarion had given us more warning then what would you expect me to avoid the opportunity to meet domitian this is why i came to roma but teacher let us be grateful that these men arrived when they did had they come later they might have arrested all those visitors you were expecting and that would have been most inconvenient for everyone concerned imagine such a crowd being herded into the house of the flavians this way we may hope to have the emperors undivided attention they were taken through a maze of corridors arriving at last in a small but opulently decorated reception room in an ornate chair atop a dais domitian sat with his chin cupped in one hand looking bored a eunuch secretary was reading aloud to him from a scroll when apollonius entered the room domitian waved aside the secretary who put down the scroll and took up a wax tablet and stylus to take notes ive been listening to the charges against you magician said domitian apollonius looked at him blankly have you nothing to say are you addressing me said apollonius i thought you were speaking to some magician though i see no such person among us do you deny that you practice magic apollonius of tyana does magic exist our ancestors believed that there were two means of obtaining favours from the gods the first is by propitiation whereby a mortal sacrifices an animal and begs the gods for their blessing the second is by magic whereby a mortal casts a spell and compels the gods to do his will now the traditional method of propitiation is surely a mistake since the gods cannot be expected to delight in the destruction of a creature they themselves imbued with life as for magic can it be possible to force the gods to act against their will such a thing would violate the order of nature that is why we call it magic and make it a crime said domitian apollonius shrugged as i said i see no magician here then what do you call yourself you dress like a beggar you put on airs and wear long hair and a beard like a philosopher i call myself apollonius which is the name i was given at birth and you lucius pinarius you would be a dead man today but for my mercy what excuse can you make for consorting with this magician lucius summoned his courage i see no magician dominus domitian scowled i see the magician has turned you into his puppet did he cast a spell over you or are you such a fool that you follow him by your own choice never mind shave off their beards the praetorians converged on them with shears and blades apollonius did not resist lucius followed his example their hair was roughly shorn and their beards were cut they were stripped of their tunics but allowed to keep their loincloths lucius was wearing the fascinum on a thin chain around his neck he was touching it when one of the guards seized his hands and pulled them before him shackles were fastened around his wrists the metal was so heavy that lucius could barely lift his arms more shackles were fitted around his ankles lucius saw that the same thing was being done to apollonius who in his unclothed state looked very thin and frail now this is a curious thing said apollonius if you think me a magician what makes you think you can fetter me and if you can fetter me what makes you think i practice magic domitian was not listening a fly had landed on an arm of his chair the emperor motioned to the secretary to hand him his stylus domitian touched a fingertip to the point of the sharp instrument held it poised above the fly for several heartbeats then struck transfixing the fly he held up the skewered insect and smiled i learned to do that as a boy instead of using my stylus to copy cicero i spent whole afternoons hunting down the little pests and impaling them it requires considerable skill apollonius shook his head when i met your brother in tarsus a fly landed on his finger do you know what he did he blew the fly away and we both laughed any man can end a life with a weapon but not every man can spare a life with a puff of breath which man is more powerful domitian gritted his teeth lucius pinarius you must appreciate the skillful use of a weapon youre a huntsman arent you not any longer dominus said lucius all life is sacred i kill nothing if i can help it domitian shook his head in disgust he called to the praetorians you bring me a bow and a quiver of arrows and you go stand against that far wall facing it extend your arm parallel with the floor press your hand against the wall with your fingers spread wide apart domitian tested the string of the bow then notched an arrow this is another skill i taught myself observe huntsman i shall fire four arrows watch the spaces between the fingers domitian took aim lucius saw that neither the praetorians nor the emperors secretary appeared apprehensive this was a feat domitian had performed many times before in sudden quiet lucius heard a low murmur he could not make out the words or where the sound came from the murmur faded away no one else seemed to have noticed lucius wondered if he had imagined it domitian let fly four arrows in rapid succession each made a sharp sound like the buzzing of a wasp with a grin of satisfaction he lowered the bow what do you think of that he said one arrow in each of the spaces between the mans fingers titus could never have done such a thing with a loud groan the praetorian collapsed against the wall slid down and lay crumpled on the floor the secretary shrieked and dropped his wax tablet all four arrows had landed squarely in the praetorians back shot with such force that they had pierced his armour some of his comrades cried out and ran to help him what is this shouted domitian his voice quavered this is your doing magician i shot no arrows apollonius held forth his shackled wrists to show that his hands were empty get the magician away from me lock them both away but what is the charge against me asked apollonius the secretary has written down everything youve said your own words will condemn you you blasphemed the gods by ridiculing the practice of animal sacrifice and you repeatedly offended my majesty by failing to address me as dominus so a man can now be condemned for what he does not say as well as for what he says your brother punished no man for speaking freely you would punish a man for saying nothing domitian threw the bow against the floor so hard that it broke and the string went flying apollonius was unfazed and what are the charges against lucius pinarius is he not your accomplice i would prefer to call him my friend i have many friends will you arrest them all wait and see magician apollonius sighed and shook his head as the praetorians attached chains to their manacles and pulled them from the room the heavy shackles bit into luciuss ankles and wrists the polished marble floor was cold against his bare feet they were taken to a subterranean cell lit only by grated openings in the ceiling the stone walls seemed to sweat heaps of straw provided the only bedding the place had a foul smell for the disposal of wastes there was a single bucket attached to a rope that could be pulled upwards through one of the openings they were not alone it took luciuss eyes a long time to adjust to the dimness of the place but gradually he counted more than fifty fellow prisoners most of them huddled against the walls occasionally lucius heard something rustle in the straw and heard the squeak of a mouse lucius felt faint he steadied himself against a wall he touched his forehead and found that it was as clammy as the stones against which he was leaning are you unwell said apollonius this place youre thinking of her and imagining the hole underground in which they confined her yes push all such imaginings from your mind lucius think only of this moment and the place in which you find yourself see it for what it is nothing more and nothing less its horrible its certainly not as comfortable as your garden and yet we are able to breathe and to move about we have enough light by which to see each other and more importantly we are together sharing each others company and the company of these new friends with whom we find ourselves im guessing they have many stories to tell as long we possess curiosity we shall not be bored lucius managed a rueful laugh teacher this is a prison lucius we mortals are in a prison every moment we live the soul is bound inside a perishable body enslaved by all the cravings which visit humanity the man who built the first dwelling merely surrounded himself with yet another prison and made himself a slave to it for any dwelling must be maintained just like the human body i think that the man who lives in a palace is more surely a prisoner than the men he puts in chains as for the place where we now find ourselves we must reflect that we are not the first to be confined in this way many a wise man despised by the mob or hated by a despot has had to endure such a fate and the best have done so with serene resignation let us strive to do the same so that we may not be inferior to those who set an example before us some of the other prisoners hearing him speak drew closer youre apollonius of tyana arent you said one of the men i am i heard you speak once i recognized your voice but id never have known you otherwise your hairs been cut and so has your beard the man shook his head i never thought to see those snowwhite tresses be shorn like fleece from a lamb who would have thought that apollonius of tyana could be put in chains the person who put me in chains thought of it for otherwise he wouldnt have done it said apollonius the man laughed truly you are apollonius but those fetters must be causing you great pain look how the rough iron chafes the skin i hadnt noticed my thoughts are on more important things but how can you be in pain and not think about it a man cant ignore pain not so said apollonius the mind attends to what the self deems important if there is injury a man may choose not to feel pain or order the pain to stop the man pursed his lips but why are you still here youre a magician why dont you just walk out apollonius laughed like the man who me put me here you accuse me of being a magician well let us suppose that its true in that case it must be that i am here among you because i wish to be why would any man wish to be here said another man stepping forward and crossing his arms perhaps i can serve a purpose perhaps my words can give comfort or courage how did you come to be here friend the plain truth i have too much wealth lucius saw that the speaker was dressed in a fine tunic and cloak though his clothes were filthy from long confinement in the dank cell his face was haggard but folds of flesh hung from his chin as if he had once been fat but had lost weight very quickly who put you here said apollonius who do you think the same man who put us all here he covets your wealth he told me to my face before he sent me here that an excess of wealth is dangerous for a common citizen money makes a man insolent and prideful he said as if trumping up charges against me throwing me in this hole and trying to extort my money was all for my own good did he offer you a way out as soon as ill admit to false charges of evading taxes and hand over my fortune i shall be released then why are you still here the money is doing you no good its only value is to buy your way out of this place i wont give it up your wealth landed you here my friend and your wealth will purchase your release more importantly paying the ransom will free you from the money itself for wealth is also a prison the man who takes it from you will only increase his bondage this is nonsense the man mumbled an obscenity and turned away apollonius spoke in a low voice to lucius i think that fellow is not quite ready to receive my message what about me said another man stepping forward he was tall and solidly built but his hands trembled i could use some courage theyre taking me to face the emperor this very afternoon i think i shall die from fear before that happens take heart my friend i myself just came from the emperors presence yet you can see that i emerged unscathed but everyone knows youre fearless how do you do it i thought of an example i would not be ashamed to follow you can do the same but what example did you think of i remembered odysseus and the peril he faced when he entered the cave of polyphemus the cyclops was gigantic and far too strong for even a hundred men to overmaster with its single eye the creature was almost too hideous to look at and its booming voice was like thunder strewn all around were human bones the remains of past meals for the cyclops was an eater of human flesh but did odysseus take fright no he considered his situation and asked himself how to get the better of an opponent too powerful to be overcome by force and too vicious to be reasoned with yet odysseus left the lair of the cyclops alive and with most of his companions alive the first man who had spoken who had asked apollonius about the shearing of his hair and the pain caused by his shackles spoke up again are you comparing our emperor to the cyclops are you saying he should be blinded apollonius whispered in luciuss ear i suspect this fellow is an informer his previous comments were not to commiserate with me but to goad me into speaking ill of domitian apollonius answered the man what do you think my friend of the man who put you here among us the man shrugged i have nothing good to say about him would that every man could have such a mild temperament have you no harsh words for the man who confines other men to such a foul place who cuts their hair and puts them in shackles who extorts their wealth whose famous cruelty causes them to tremble when theyre called before him naturally i feel as the others here must feel and how is that by all means speak freely said apollonius you can say whatever you like in front of me for i am the last man in the world to inform against another no you have nothing to say as for myself what i have to say to the emperor ill say to his face thats telling him said the man who had been fearful of meeting the emperor there were nods and grunts of agreement clearly many in the cell already suspected the informer apollonius stepped back as if he were done speaking but the other prisoners implored him to keep talking tell us more said one of them the worst thing about this place is the boredom tell us about your travels youve been all over the world apollonius sat on the floor the prisoners gathered around him he described rivers and mountains and deserts he had seen he talked about the people he had met and their exotic customs the men listened with rapt expressions some closing their eyes transported by the teachers narrative to faraway places freed from their prison cell by the pictures he painted in their imaginations lucius closed his eyes and listened with them apollonius spoke of finding the spot high in the icy mountains of the caucasus indicus where even alexander the great had not ventured where the gods had chained prometheus for his crime of giving fire to mortals i discovered the very manacles which had held the titan gigantic they were so big that a man could stand inside one with his arms outstretched and barely touch the sides the manacles were set into either side of a narrow gorge thus one could see just how enormous prometheus must have been the titan himself was long gone the locals told me that hercules on one of his many journeys came upon prometheus even as jupiters eagle arrived to perform the daily torment of tearing out the titans entrails hercules took pity on prometheus and shot the eagle out of the sky in the ravine below i found the bones of an enormous bird larger than any other bones i had ever seen hercules broke the manacles and set prometheus free indeed i could see that the metal was severed and twisted but strangely it was not covered with rust vulcan must have forged those manacles of some alloy unknown to mortal men exhausted by the days events and lulled by the teachers voice lucius was almost dozing he chanced to open his eyes just enough to peer through the lashes and saw that apollonius was using each hand to rub the wrist of the other stretching the tendons and massaging the soreness caused by the manacles which were gone luciuss eyes shot open and he uttered an exclamation of amazement the others most of whom also seemed to be half dozing bolted upright and followed his gaze his shackles said one of the men hes taken off his shackles have i apollonius looked around absentmindedly as if he had misplaced something so i have ah but it would never do for the guards to see me this way theyd be terribly upset he turned his back on them for a moment and engaged in a series of peculiar movements hunching over and twisting from side to side when he turned back the shackles were again around his wrists there thats better said apollonius shaking his manacles so that they made a dull clang he began a new story this one about the time he had spent in babylon in his younger days where he met the parthian king vardanes and his chaldean astrologers lucius looked down at his own manacles he turned his hands this way and that and tugged against the shackles there was no way he could possibly take them off and yet it seemed that the teacher had slipped out of his manacles without even thinking as a man might shuffle off a pair of loose shoes or had apollonius only created the illusion of doing so or had he never been placed in the manacles at all they passed many days in the cell the accommodations were foul and the food was poor but the regimen was not harsh they were not physically harmed or made to do labour lucius received a visit from hilarion who assured lucius that everything was running smoothly in his absence it occurred to lucius not for the first time that he was an incidental part of his own household which was entirely capable of running itself without him apollonius also received visitors including a delegation of distinguished men headed by marcus nerva an elder statesman of the senate nerva looked the part with his narrow ascetic face his high broad forehead and his neatly groomed white hair lucius knew the senator to be a friend and correspondent of dio of prusa nerva asked after the prisoners health apollonius responded by asking after the senators health since nerva looked considerably more frail than he did from their easy manner with each other lucius realized that the two were old acquaintances lucius never ceased to be surprised at the great number and variety of people apollonius knew to know apollonius it seemed was to be only a step or two removed from almost anyone in the world nerva and apollonius conversed about inconsequential matters prison food the weather and which of them had whiter hair apollonius asked nerva about his hometown the village of narnia which was said to be in the exact center of italy and was one of the few places apollonius had never visited nerva assured him that it was a charming town it seemed to lucius that apollonius must have given nerva a sign early on that an informer was present and that their conversation should be guarded or were they conversing in code after the visitors left lucius expressed surprise that nerva and the others had dared to pay a call on apollonius domitian was always seeing conspiracies among the senators did these men not risk arousing the emperors suspicion by visiting a man arrested for disrespecting the emperors majesty not so said apollonius by coming to see me so openly those fellows protect themselves from suspicion if i were indeed seditious and if they were colluding with me would they come to chat with me about the weather they came here as roman statesmen to pay a courtesy call on a man who once counselled the divine vespasian and the divine titus conspirators would not come to see me at all but would lurk in the shadows thus by their boldness they disarm domitians fear i see nerva didnt look that clever to me dont let his manner fool you nerva is a very canny fellow i have high hopes for him high hopes for a frail old senator to all appearances there was never a more robust man than titus yet those who put their hopes for the future in titus saw those hopes dashed so why not look to a frail old man to deliver a brighter tomorrow one day passed into another until one morning a praetorian arrived and told them they were to be taken before the emperor who was ready to try them and pronounce judgement lucius had done his best to prepare for this moment striving to emulate the teachers equanimity still he felt a thrill of panic teacher what will become of us lucius what do you fear that we shall be tortured and killed every living thing must die and there are things far worse than the suffering of physical pain how much more terrible if we should comport ourselves disgracefully and lose our selfrespect then we should truly be damaged and the harm would have been inflicted by ourselves lucius breathed deeply i shall look to you teacher i shall follow your example and i shall do my best to make that example a good one lucius to know that your eyes are on me will give me strength they were taken first to an antechamber adjoining the reception room their shackles were removed a group of slaves appeared charged with making them presentable for the trial basins of water were brought their faces and hands were scrubbed clean they were dressed in clean tunics they were also given shoes but because these were made of leather apollonius would not wear them lucius followed the teachers example and remained barefoot when the attendants were finished cleaning and dressing them they were put in shackles again a figure in the sumptuous robes of an imperial courtier entered the room and approached them to luciuss surprise it was his old friend and protector epaphroditus lucius had seen him very little since the death of cornelia his old friend had aged a great deal im sorry i didnt come to visit you in prison lucius said epaphroditus he kept his distance and maintained a dignified posture but his voice was thick with emotion it wasnt possible given my new position to see you like this in shackles you serve domitian now epaphroditus flashed a crooked smile the emperor called me out of retirement he insisted that the state required my services i saw no way to decline his request you should be flattered i suppose said lucius the emperor could use the help of the man who ran the golden house it seemed that domitian who refused to have among his courtiers anyone who had been close to his father or to his brother and in his fits of suspicion had eliminated many members of his own imperial staff was now being forced to reach back to the days of nero to find men of sufficient experience to run the state i would gladly have remained as i was a retired observer of events said epaphroditus still there are advantages to my new position i was able for example to persuade the emperor to give me the role of preparing you and your friend for your trial epaphroditus turned to apollonius are you aware of the rules of procedure the trial will take place before a select audience of senators magistrates and imperial dignitaries the charges against you will be read by a prosecutor you will have a chance to respond to those charges then caesar will render judgement caesar will judge me said apollonius yes but who will judge caesar epaphroditus raised an eyebrow caesar is not on trial no i think he has committed many offenses contrary to the teachings of philosophy epaphroditus sighed caesar is not concerned with philosophy ah but philosophy is very much concerned with caesar that he should govern as a wise man epaphroditus sighed and exchanged looks with apollonius that left lucius perplexed he had presumed that epaphroditus and apollonius were strangers or did they know each other epaphroditus continued youll have only a short time to give your answers look to the water clock when the water level drops and the lever rises that means your time is growing short finish what you have to say you wont be allowed to speak longer than the clock permits then i hope that the tiber itself is connected to this water clock for every drop of its water will be needed for me to say all i have to say to the emperor im afraid your time will be considerably shorter than that said epaphroditus also you are not allowed to bring anything with you into the chamber from which you might read or with which you might cast a magical spell so you may not have on your person any scroll or scrap of parchment or anything at all with writing on it or any amulet or other magical device as we were stripped naked and then dressed by servants of the emperor himself i think that will not be a problem said apollonius still it is my duty to make sure there is nothing concealed in your tunics raise your arms as high as you can epaphroditus ran his hands over apollonius then did the same thing to lucius lucius stiffened for he realized that he was wearing the fascinum beneath the thin tunic he suppressed an urge to touch it epaphroditus ran his hands over luciuss chest he must have felt the talisman yet he said nothing and stepped back epaphroditus led them into the judgement chamber a somber but magnificent room decorated with dark marbles and bloodred curtains before a towering statue of minerva sat domitian seated crosslegged on the dais beside him was his smallheaded companion epaphroditus joined a group of other courtiers who stood to one side next to him was the water clock he had mentioned the inner workings of the device were hidden behind an ornate bronze covering that depicted images of the sun moon and stars among the senators in the room lucius saw the whitehaired nerva and several others who had visited apollonius there were also some faces he recognized from gatherings of apolloniuss followers magistrates and even a few imperial courtiers who had dared to attend meetings in private homes where the teacher spoke lucius felt heartened by the sight of these familiar faces even though not one of them dared to look him in the eye or show any sign of sympathy the prosecutor stepped forward luciuss heart sank it was catullus the blind man carried a staff and was assisted by a secretary who frequently whispered in his ear dominus the magician apollonius and his accomplice lucius pinarius have entered your divine presence said catullus the time has come for them to submit to your judgement the magician will be tried first step forward apollonius of tyana look upon our master and god address him as dominus and beseech him to be just and merciful to you apollonius stepped forward but he did not look at domitian instead he seemed to look everywhere else he looked at the emperors small headed companion and made a whimsical face as one might at a child at which the creature seemed to take fright and started back he gazed curiously at the water clock next to epaphroditus he looked over his shoulder at the spectators and smiled catulluss assistant whispered furiously in his ear catullus struck his staff against the marble floor magician you will face and address our master and god very well said apollonius with a shrug he lifted his head and gazed upwards and raised his shackled hands as high as he could divine singularity emanation of perfection whom the romans call jupiter greatest of gods he cried reveal your wisdom to us render your judgement make known to us your will tell us we beseech you who displeases you more the man who utters profane flattery or the man who receives it there were gasps from the onlookers catullus struck his staff against the marble floor demanding silence we can dispense with your formal response to the first charge against you since by your actions magician you have just given us ample reply and what was that charge that you refuse to show proper respect to caesar and address him as dominus you told me to look upon our master and god and i did i looked upward to the divine singularity dont try to throw dust in our eyes with a pretense of piety magician is it not true that you believe yourself to be a god is it not true that others have called you a god and that you accepted their worship without objection prosecutor i am impressed said apollonius you have done your research i believe you must be referring to my days in india when i sought wisdom among the sages of the ganges they refer to themselves as gods when i asked them why they answered because we are good men all creatures despite their mortal forms possess divinity and to be truly good is to be godly before i left them the indian sages addressed me as god and i was honoured so a man can become a god simply by being good to be good is not as simple as you seem to think but if you meet a good man you gladly call him god i do if the man you want me to address as a god were a good man i would gladly do so again there were gasps from the spectators catullus banged his staff repeatedly against the floor the smallheaded creature was heard to mumble in a high voice he isnt even wearing shoes whats that said apollonius speak up little one the creature hissed and spat like a cat with its back up you come here barefoot he cried you show contempt to caesar if i had put on the shoes i was offered i would have shown contempt to the poor animal who provided the hide i would no more kill a cow a godly creature and carve it up simply to cover my feet than i would kill and carve you up my little friend to make a pair of shoes out of you the bounty of the soil provides all that i require to eat and clothe myself if i must protect my feet i wear shoes made of cloth and bark i need not resort to the killing of fellow creatures the smallheaded creature pressed himself against domitians leg and covered his face catullus smirked is it true magician that in your youth you took a vow of silence and did not speak for five years that is so silence is a language unto itself there is much to be learned by not speaking yet it seems that ever since then you cant keep your mouth shut you may regret not keeping silent today magician the words you spoke just now lead nicely to the second charge against you that you have profaned against the gods and imperiled the state by preaching against the institution of animal sacrifice do you deny this charge catullus signaled to epaphroditus who touched a switch on the water clock water gurgled as it flowed from one chamber to another and the lever that indicated the passage of time began to move apollonius cleared his throat have i said that animal sacrifice is unnecessary yes have i offended the gods and imperilled the state by doing so no to show fitting respect to the divine singularity we must offer no victim at all nor kindle a fire nor burn incense nor make promises nor offer up any sort of trinket or amulet or any other material object for if there is a god who is higher than all else and of such perfection that he is unique and distinguished from every other essence then what use does this god have of our paltry offerings far from giving him nourishment such material offerings can only pollute his purity and how dare we attempt to bargain with the divine singularity by making promises and pleading we should approach the divine singularity using only our highest faculty which is our intelligence by thought alone should we strive to make ourselves known to the divine singularity which itself is pure thought if we desire to make these thoughts manifest for the benefit of other mortals then we may employ beautiful speech which is the imperfect servant of thought a song or an uttered prayer shared among mortals may be pleasing to the divine singularity but bloody carcasses and charred remains can only be offensive to that which is perfection the lever on the water clock reached its upright position which caused a bell to be struck the gurgling of water ceased apollonius smiled serenely he had said what he had to say in exactly the allotted time catullus made a face of disgust do i need to state the next charge dominus the accused has already sufficiently incriminated himself to offer him more opportunities to speak will only subject your majesty to more blasphemy and sedition domitian who had been watching the proceedings in silence stared at apollonius with a quizzical tilt of his head that this man is guilty and worthy of death there can be no doubt but surely the third charge against him is the most serious it should be addressed catullus stated the next charge it is alleged that apollonius of tyana practises magic witnesses attest that he has had healed sick persons by the use of magical influence and has even caused the dead to return to life against the laws of nature he has used magic to witness faraway events and otherwise obtain knowledge of the movements of others including even yourself dominus he has used magical powers to look into the minds of others so that even when they remain silent his victims cannot conceal their thoughts from him these uses of magic which in and of themselves violate the laws of men and gods also constitute a clear danger to the state and to the person of caesar what do you say to the charge apollonius of tyana again epaphroditus touched a switch on the water clock its gurgling echoed loudly in the suddenly silent room for everyone present was intent on hearing what apollonius had to say apollonius turned to lucius his lips did not move yet lucius heard him speak do you have the thing epaphroditus gave you earlier give it to me now lucius was puzzled nothing in the room had changed and yet everything suddenly seemed unreal as if he had entered a dream without falling asleep what was apollonius talking about epaphroditus had given him nothing earlier and yet he found himself reaching into his tunic and pulling out a small sphere made of glass he handed it to apollonius again without moving his lips apollonius spoke to him you are a good friend lucius pinarius i will miss you be strong apollonius raised the glass sphere and threw it against the floor there was a blinding flash of light and a loud blast a cloud of smoke enveloped apollonius there was a loud clatter as of shackles falling to the floor a peculiar smell filled luciuss nostrils the floor seemed to ripple as if shaken by an earthquake lucius thought that he alone felt these things but when he looked at the spectators he saw that they too were reeling as if from a blow some of them dropped to their knees lucius turned and saw that domitian had risen from his chair his smallheaded companion was clutching the emperors leg the blind catullus turned his head this way and that whats happening he cried what has the magician done the smoke dispersed apollonius was nowhere to be seen his empty shackles lay on the marble floor what trickery is this said domitian he ordered the guards to search every corner of the room and make sure that every exit was blocked apollonius was not to be found domitian glared at lucius the magician looked at you before he vanished what happened i dont know dominus where has he gone i dont know dominus strip this man cried domitian luciuss tunic was torn from him what is that said domitian what is it you see dominus asked catullus he wears a talisman of some sort catullus raised his eyebrows how did this happen epaphroditus you were to make sure the prisoners had no magical devices on their persons im as baffled as you said epaphroditus domitian stepped from the dais and approached lucius lucius flinched but stood firm the emperor reached out and took hold of the fascinum what is this did this amulet play some part in the magicians disappearance its a fascinum dominus a family heirloom i call on it for protection but i know of no other powers it might possess domitian frowned it looks like a cross catullus scurried to them tapping his staff on the floor before him a cross dominus domitian put the fascinum into the hand of catullus who examined it with his fingertips lucius cringed at having the man so close to him catullus cringed as well he released the fascinum with a show of disgust most certainly this is a magical amulet i can feel the sorcery in it christian magic i suspect christian said domitian they use amulets in the shape of a cross to bewitch their enemies its a fascinum dominus not a crucifix said lucius he lies said catullus when i was preparing my dossier on this man i discovered that his uncle was a christian one of those punished by nero for arson can it be a coincidence that he wears a christian amulet domitian peered down his nose at lucius this man is follower of apollonius and whatever else he might be apollonius is not a christian we cannot expect the enemies of the gods to be consistent in their blasphemy this secret christian has just assisted in the escape of a most dangerous magician and by means of this amulet he may intend to endanger your divine person lucius pinarius has conspired against you dominus he must be punished domitian narrowed his eyes yes but how his uncle was burned alive in the circus vaticanus lucius felt a sudden prickling sensation all over his body and saw oily spots before his eyes he tried to emulate the courage of apollonius but he swayed and fell to the floor domitian looked down at him are you sure this pitiful wretch poses a threat to me catullus catullus lowered his voice to a whisper dominus if the magician apollonius has truly escaped then this one must be made to suffer in his place his punishment must be public and it must be made to fit his crime domitian nodded i know what to do with him lucius was taken not to the cell where he had previously been held but through a series of narrow underground passages to a much smaller cell large enough to hold only one prisoner he was allowed to keep the fascinum from the whisperings of the guards lucius gathered that they had been instructed to take it from him but they were all too afraid to touch it his cell was a bare windowless cubicle of dank stone with iron bars on one side beyond the bars set too closely for him to stick his head between them was a curved hallway dimly lit by indirect sunlight from somewhere nearby he heard wild animals the growling of lions the snorting of aurochs the yelping of dogs the air was heavy with the odours of straw dung and urine and the smell of the raw meat that was fed to the carnivores from elsewhere he heard the clashing of swords and gruff voices the sounds of gladiators training and realized where he must be in the cells beneath the flavian amphitheatre if he recalled correctly the next occasion for games in the amphitheatre was five days away by the alternation of darkness and light he was able to mark the passage of the days at night the hallway was unlit and the darkness of his cell was absolute the blackness of the nights terrified him at first but in his imagination he sought the company of apollonius and was comforted it seemed to him sometimes that the teacher actually spoke to him during the night but in such complete darkness he could not tell if he was awake or dreaming or even if he was alive or dead be calm apollonius said though my body is far away i am with you on the fifth day lucius awoke to a great tumult of sounds from near and far the blare of trumpets men shouting and laughing gates clanging and the steady hum of a vast crowd punctuated at intervals by roars of excitement the amphitheatre above him was filled with people and the games had commenced the punishment of criminals was a part of the games lucius had watched such exhibits many times until he had become a follower of apollonius and ceased to attend the games though he had sometimes imagined himself in the role of the hunters in the arena who stalked exotic prey he had never imagined himself as one of the wretched criminals forced to fight to the death or to become the prey of savage beasts and yet that was to be his fate had apollonius foreseen this outcome why had the teacher fled saving himself only to abandon lucius to a horrible and humiliating death why had he not used his magic to take lucius with him for a brief instant lucius fell into despair then his spirits suddenly lifted he felt a sense of lightness as if a great weight had been lifted from him even his shackles felt lighter he decided to surrender himself completely to the teacher to trust that apollonius had foreseen this moment and had sufficiently prepared lucius to face it calmly and with dignity all was for the best when the guards came for him they were surprised by his demeanor they were used to seeing men who cringed wept struggled and begged or who fell limp or went stiff and stared into space but lucius looked them in the eye nodded to them amiably and stood up to follow them they removed his shackles his arms and legs felt weak and stiff after such long confinement but he was glad to be free of the restraints he stretched out his arms and spread his fingers wide he kicked out his legs and lifted his knees testing his control of his body it was a good thing that in his final moments he would be able to feel like man again however briefly they took off his tattered tunic so that he wore only his filthy loincloth around his waist they fitted a leather belt with a sheath in the sheath was a knife he pulled it out for a moment and saw that the blade was very dull they handed him a bow and a single arrow the bow was weak and poorly strung and the head of the arrow was made not of metal but of cork from a distance the spectators would not be able to tell that the weapons were useless as they proceeded down a hallway the roar of the crowd grew louder they arrived at a gate made of iron bars the gate opened the guards lowered their spears but there was no need for them to drive lucius into the arena he walked barefoot onto the sunheated sand squinting at the brightness of the day he had beheld the enormity of the amphitheatre from the stands but never from the arena floor the magnitude of the crowd was staggering the imperial box looked very small amid the vastness and the people within it seemed like figures in a picture lucius spotted domitian and the empress and also the emperors smallheaded companion the most highly favoured members of the imperial family were there including the emperors beautiful niece flavia domitilla along with her husband and two of their young sons earinus was there and close to the eunuch lucius saw with a slight shock was martial would he make a poem of what was about to happen amid the courtiers lucius saw catullus and also epaphroditus there was a hush a crier made an announcement the words echoed oddly in luciuss ears he was unable to make out anything the man said except his own name lucius pinarius his name sounded strange to him a collection of sounds that had nothing to do with what he was lucius pinarius i am called lucius pinarius he said to himself i am in a place called roma i am about to die lucius strode to the very centre of the arena and turned in a slow circle gazing around him he felt that he was at the precise centre of the cosmos surrounded on all sides by the whole population of roma and by the city itself and by the vast empire and the lands and oceans that lay beyond it every eye in the amphitheatre was upon him he was the focus of every gaze and yet he felt not exposed and vulnerable but strangely isolated and protected all around him was ceaseless noise and swirling chaos but in the place where lucius stood there was silence and stillness he stood in the pupil of the eye of the divine singularity had apollonius known that he would feel this was that why the teacher had guided him to this place and this moment he heard the clanging of a gate and turned to see that he was no longer alone in the arena a lion had been released the beast looked about sniffing the air then spotted lucius it crouched for a moment tensing and flexing its haunches then sprang forward and ran straight towards lucius of what use were the bow and arrow even if lucius took aim and struck the beast he would only aggravate it lucius cast them aside of what use was the knife there was a slim chance that even with such a dull blade lucius might inflict a wound on the beast he might even by some miracle fatally wound it but by the time that happened the lion would have mauled him and in the best possible outcome they both would die lucius felt no desire to kill the lion he drew the knife from the sheath which greatly excited the crowd then cast it away which elicited cries of derision and mutterings of confusion lucius looked at the belt around his waist what would apollonius think if he saw lucius wearing a garment made of leather lucius undid the belt and cast it away he suddenly loathed the touch of the filthy loincloth against his flesh he did not want to die wearing it he pulled off the loincloth and threw it to the ground lucius stood naked at the centre of the cosmos stripped of all earthly pretense naked except for the fascinum which caught the sunlight and glittered brightly where did he find the sense to do what he did next an old slave the scarred survivor of many dangerous hunts over a long lifetime had once advised lucius on the best way to comport himself should he ever encounter a deadly animal in the wild without the advantage of a weapon you must be as wild and fierce as the beast no wilder fiercer jump flail your arms scream and shout like a madman pretend to be dangerous lucius had asked no pretending said the slave you must find inside yourself the part of you that truly is as savage as the beast and what if there is no such part of me said lucius there is the slave had answered lucius had quickly forgotten this exchange but he remembered it now as the lion ran towards him he heard a shrieking noise so bloodcurdling that even he was unnerved by it though he knew he must be producing it himself his body was in motion but he had no conception of what his movements must look like perhaps they were comical like the writhing of a mime for he heard laughter from the stands but the lion did not seem amused by his screaming and stamping and flailing the beast stopped in its tracks and sprang back looking startled lucius sensed that he had the advantage and pursued it he did what no sane man would have done he charged the lion what would he do if the lion stood its ground he would have no choice but to leap onto the beast and wrestle it the idea was absurd but there was no turning back he heard gasps of disbelief and screams of excitement from the spectators the lion crouched flattened it ears lifted a paw and bared its fangs lucius continued his headlong rush screaming at the top of his lungs waving his arms and gaining speed as he drew closer just as he was about to leap the beast turned and began to run lucius chased the lion the roar from the crowd was deafening he perceived a vast upward movement all around him the spectators in unison had risen to their feet the lion ran for a short distance then stopped and looked back at him with flattened ears made ready to fight then lost its nerve and began to run again staying low to the ground the beast seemed as perplexed by its own craven behaviour as it was by luciuss headlong advance the predator was not used to being pursued lucius could not continue to scream and run for long he was weak from imprisonment he had managed to find within himself an unexpected reservoir of energy and had released it in a great burst of noise and action but already he was flagging in the blink of an eye his strength was gone he stopped running he could scream no longer he gasped for air he could barely stand the lion ran until it reached the far side of the arena it spun around and peered at lucius then sat on the sand like a sphinx and snapped its tail this way and that they stayed like that for a while man and lion peering at each other across the sand eventually a gate opened attendants with long poles ran onto the sand and poked at the lion trying to goad it into attacking lucius again but the cat turned on the attendants instead spitting and batting its claws at them eventually the attendants retreated the lion sat on the sand again panting and showing its tongue no longer able to stand lucius sat nearby he noticed a bloody spot on the sand amid the blood lay a lump of flesh most likely it was from a human being one of the days previous victims but it was so bloody and torn that it looked like a cut of meat from a butchers shop lucius wrinkled his nose and felt a twinge of nausea for a while lucius and the lion sat on the sand resting and keeping their distance then the cat roused itself it stood and began to walk very slowly towards lucius the crowd murmured in anticipation a stones throw from lucius the lion came to a stop and sat again sphinxlike staring at him lucius summoned his last vestige of strength to crawl on his hands and knees to the lump of bloody flesh on the sand what would apollonius think of his intention apollonius believed that men should not eat animals but lucius had never heard him express the opinion that animals should not eat men it was in their nature and they could not be reasoned out of it grimacing with disgust lucius grabbed hold of the lump of flesh and flung it at the lion the beast scrambled back then poked its head towards the flesh and sniffed at it it leaped onto the bloody lump seized it with both paws and attacked it with its powerful jaws the lion relished its meal when it was done it rose to its feet and sauntered towards lucius who stayed where he was too exhausted to do anything except shut his eyes he breathed deeply and awaited what was to come as the lion drew nearer lucius heard its footsteps on the sand and smelled the gore on its breath something rough and wet touched luciuss hand he opened his eyes and saw that the cat was licking the blood from his fingers the lion took its time and did a very thorough job then sat beside him and closed its eyes seemingly content from the stands came a strange mixture of sounds applause and laughter but also angry jeers and cries of scorn some of the spectators were enthralled by the scene they had just witnessed and hailed luciuss bravery others felt cheated of the thrill of seeing a man torn apart and suspected that some trickery was afoot lucius looked at the imperial box domitian was on his feet catullus was beside him speaking into his right ear epaphroditus was speaking into his left ear domitian waved them both aside and gave an order to another courtier in his retinue a few moments later the attendants with long poles again appeared in the arena one of the poles had a bit of meat tied to the end they lured the cat to one of the openings and through the gate which clanged shut after them a courtier beckoned to lucius from the imperial box somehow lucius rose to his feet and staggered in that direction domitian stood at the parapet looking down at him the emperor raised his hand the spectators fell silent domitian flashed a chilly smile thanks to the extraordinary acoustics of the amphitheatre he barely had to raise his voice to be heard by lucius i think lucius pinarius that you are the luckiest man i have ever met more than once i have intended to do away with you more than once i have changed my mind caesar is merciful lucius managed to say his throat ached and his voice was hoarse from screaming perhaps or perhaps caesar is mindful of some powerful magic about you did the magician from tyana teach you to cast that spell on the lion i am always mindful of the teachers example dominus but he did not teach me any spells then perhaps that amulet you wear is responsible for your good fortune it must possess a powerful magic lucius touched the fascinum you are pardoned and released lucius pinarius the property that was to be confiscated from you is hereby returned epaphroditus see to the details but dominus protested catullus before domitian cut him off by pressing a finger to the mans lips attendants assisted lucius from the arena they were strong men and for that lucius was glad his legs had turned to water and the attendants practically had to carry him out ad the weather was unusually stormy all through the summer months and into september or germanicus as the month had been renamed by domitian as one violent tempest followed another even casual observers noted the unprecedented occurrence of lightning lightning struck the temple of jupiter on the capitoline lightning struck the temple of the flavians causing damage to the statue of vespasian in the sanctuary lightning struck the imperial palace on several occasions including it was said a strike that caused a small fire in the emperors bedchamber there was widespread speculation on what so many omens from the sky could mean wrapped in a woolen cloak lucius sat on a stone bench in his sodden garden under the threatening morning sky a bolt of lightning flashed above his head casting a weird light on the glistening greenery around him followed a heartbeat later by a thunderclap that caused the leaves to tremble if there were omens to be perceived in all the lightning lucius was oblivious to them he was again at a low ebb in his life the lowest he had experienced since the death of cornelia how he missed her still especially at a time like this he also missed apollonius since his disappearance from roma the teacher had been constantly on the move travelling from city to city in the eastern provinces staying just ahead of domitians agents for a long time lucius had no news of him at all but eventually the senator nerva paid lucius a visit and revealed that he was in contact with apollonius nerva even offered to send messages between the two of them sharing with lucius a cipher with which he could encode his letters apolloniuss letters to lucius were encouraging but brief to the point of being perfunctory a typical letter after being decoded read i am in a coastal town which must not be named among good people i told them the tale of my friend in roma who lay beside a lion in the arena how i wish i had been there to see it your courage gives courage to others farewell when lucius wrote to apollonius he said little about himself there was little to report about his secluded existence so he mentioned events in roma that he thought might be of interest to the teacher though he suspected that nerva already kept apollonius well informed on that count these infrequent exchanges were no substitute for the personal contact lucius once had enjoyed with the teacher with apollonius no longer present to set a daily example for him lucius often felt confused and lost he still adhered to the teachers tenets abstaining from wine meat and sex but the sense of balance and wellbeing he had felt at the side of apollonius often eluded him more lightning flashed across the sky followed by a long rumble of thunder despite the teachers belief that one should not dwell on sadness lucius found himself brooding over the loss of all the people who had mattered most to him the suicide of his father had been a terrible blow and even after all these years the death of sporus still haunted him his mother had died from the plague that followed the fall of ash on roma after vesuvius erupted without her presence to unite the family he had drifted further and further from his three sisters and his appearance in the arena a mark of shame despite his pardon had completed the estrangement he had grieved when domitian banished dio of prusa now the emperor had seen fit to banish epictetus as well along with virtually every other philosopher in roma and while once lucius had taken enjoyment from martial and his wit the poets sycophantic loyalty to domitian had alienated lucius long ago to him martial might as well have been dead with apollonius gone and likely never to return to roma lucius felt forlorn and isolated the lone survivor of the ongoing catastrophe that was his life these morbid thoughts had been set off by the terrible news lucius had received the day before epaphroditus was dead no man had ever been a better friend to him epaphroditus had kept lucius safe through the treacherous months that followed the death of nero had welcomed lucius into his circle of learned friends had been the only person in whom lucius confided about his love for cornelia the intimacy of their friendship had eventually lessened but only because luciuss melancholy had driven him to seek inspiration outside epaphrodituss circle epaphrodituss reappearance in his life at the trial of apollonius had been as brief as it was unexpected after being spared by domitian lucius arrived home from the arena to find a letter from epaphroditus delivered not by imperial courier but by a private messenger the letter expressed joy at luciuss good fortune but also made it clear there could be no further contact between them my return to imperial service and your singular history with the emperor make it impossible that we should be as close as we once were you are a dangerous man to know so am i let us keep a distance between us for both our sakes but know lucius that i am forever fond of you and i wish you well i trust you will destroy this message after you have read it in the years since lucius had not seen or communicated with his old friend and mentor and now epaphroditus was dead hilarion gleaning information in the forum the preceding day had brought lucius the news hilarion had not been able to discover the cause or the exact circumstances of epaphrodituss death lucius hoped to learn more from the visitor he expected to arrive at any moment the cloudy morning sky turned as dark as night a heavy rain began to fall shivering in his woolen cloak lucius retreated from the garden to his library where hilarion was stoking the fire in the brazier above the pelting of rain against the roof and the peals of thunder lucius did not hear the knock at the front door but hilarion did the freedman showed the visitor to the library then discreetly vanished her long voluminous cloak concealed her gender the hood concealed her face did she wear the cloak to protect herself from the inclement weather or because it allowed her to traverse the palatine without being recognized she stood before the brazier and warmed her hands for a moment then pushed back the hood and shook her head freeing tresses of lustrous black hair in which there were a few strands of grey flavia domitilla was the emperors niece the daughter of his sister domitilla but she did not share his typical flavian features her cheekbones were high her nose was small her forehead broad she had dark flashing eyes and a sensual mouth the outlines of her cloak hinted at a voluptuous figure giving way to stoutness though flavias life scarcely resembled that of a vestal she had borne seven children something about her reminded lucius of cornelia perhaps it was her willfulness and her spirit or perhaps it was simply that flavia was the first woman since cornelia who had inspired in lucius a faint stirring of lust but it was not to woo him or even to seek his friendship that she had come greetings flavia he said greetings lucius what can you tell me about the death of epaphroditus he said she sighed i gather the two of you were close friends back in the days of my grandfather yes i never ceased calling epaphroditus my friend though i hadnt seen him in quite some time what have you heard only what my freedman was able to pick up from the gossips in the forum which wasnt much its true that hes dead then yes how did it happen domitian condemned him he took his own life but why what was the charge the same charge my uncle always brings against his enemies whether real or imagined he was accused of conspiring against caesar and was he flavia gazed at the fire youre assuming that i would know such a thing that i know who wants to see the emperor dead i should think that many men desire his death but only a few would risk everything to make it happen was epaphroditus one of them flavia pursed her lips the firelight glinted in her eyes lucius found her beauty distracting what would apollonius say about her presence in luciuss house certainly the teacher would disdain the physical attraction lucius felt towards her but flavia was not here because of that she was here because they both desired the death of domitian what would apollonius think of that would the teacher ever approve of murder even the murder of a tyrant flavia shook her head i used to see epaphroditus in the imperial court his manner was so cowed and timid i thought to myself that fellow would make an ideal agent who would ever suspect him so i approached epaphroditus cautiously discreetly and he rebuffed me he told me he had seen enough chaos after the death of nero and could never be part of any plan that might lead to such chaos again however well intentioned his timidity was not an affectation it was genuine he wanted no more trouble in his life poor thing uncle should have left him where he was instead of dragging him out of retirement his return to court was epaphrodituss undoing what made domitian suspect him she sighed the story is so pathetic it pains me to tell it domitian heard a rumour that when nero tried to kill himself he failed and it was epaphroditus who finished the task for him out of loyalty and mercy of course nonetheless it was the hand of epaphroditus that dealt the final blow domitian called epaphroditus before him and demanded that he tell him the truth epaphroditus was too frightened to lie he admitted that he dealt the final blow to nero after that domitian became obsessed with the story he made epaphroditus tell it to him again and again sometimes in the middle of the night as if he were trying to trick the man into confessing a crime letting slip some previously hidden detail eventually domitian got it into his head that epaphroditus had murdered nero and if so was that such a bad thing his courtiers would say after all without nero dead my grandfather would never have become emperor but uncle became convinced that epaphroditus was a threat to him once a man dares to kill an emperor hell do it again he said epaphroditus wasnt involved in any conspiracy against uncle but he was the man who killed nero so he had to die that was almost thirty years ago its absurd its mad uncle is mad thats why im here thats why i need your help her first visit had been a month earlier and she had come to him twice since then approaching lucius as cautiously as she had approached epaphroditus unlike epaphroditus lucius had been receptive to her subtle overtures now she was back i can also tell you that epaphroditus left a will she said it was fetched from the keeping of the vestals and read this morning you were named was i yes of course uncle will probably invalidate the will and claim the estate for himself since epaphroditus was condemned as an enemy of the state did she think to incite him against domitian by telling him that the emperor meant to cheat him out of an inheritance if so lucius was offended greed was not his motivation but what she said next made him realize that he had misjudged her the will didnt leave you much almost everything was left to a freedman of his a philosopher called epictetus whos been banished from italy with the stipulation that the proceeds should be used to set up a school let my fortune such as it is foster the learning of philosophy but to you he left a statue a statue its in his garden apparently a statue of an athlete if i recall correctly the boxer melancomas whispered lucius remembering the first time he had seen the statue on the day the ash of vesuvius fell on roma yes thats the one epaphroditus had once remarked melancomas will be here long after the rest of us are gone the statue had survived its owner lucius stood across the brazier from her looking at her through the flames he tried to see her not as a beautiful woman or a grieving widow nor as the niece of the emperor but as a potential partner in a very dangerous enterprise could she be trusted to keep silent when she needed to was she clever enough to hatch a successful plot against a man as suspicious as her uncle and would she have the courage to see it through her reasons for hating and fearing her uncle were obvious enough married to a flavian cousin and the mother of seven children she had long been a member of domitians inner circle after the death of the emperors son and the subsequent failure of his wife to produce another heir domitian had placed two of flavias young sons in the line of succession her future and that of her family had looked very bright lucius recalled an ancient etruscan proverb sit too near the flame and your cloak will catch fire in one of his frequent fits of suspicion domitian had turned against flavia his pretext was that she and her husband had secretly converted to the religion of the jews or else had become christians it hardly mattered which since both cults promoted atheism and a disrespect for the gods which could not be tolerated within the imperial family were the charges true lucius had never asked flavia nor had she told him whatever the truth flavias husband had been executed and she and her children had been exiled to the island of pandateria off the western coast of italy eventually domitian had allowed flavia to return to roma indeed had compelled her to do so while her children remained on the island to ensure their mothers loyalty flavia was bitter and desperate she was motivated by revenge but also by the desire to see her progeny survive every day domitian lived she and her children were in danger a botched attempt to kill him would certainly mean death for them all even a successful assassination might lead to their destruction but it might also free them from fear and allow them to be reunited looking at her across the flames lucius made up his mind to trust her you know why im here she said yes will you help us he thought of cornelia he thought of epaphroditus he also thought of apollonius but in the present circumstance he could find no inspiration in the precepts of the teacher lucius himself was not truly a philosopher only a sincere but oftthwarted seeker nor was he a man of action but he might yet become one yes ill help you but what can i do she flashed a smile of triumph it marred her beauty he suddenly saw her as the niece of her uncle more like him than not rapacious unstoppable murderous she had made no mention of the danger he would surely face probably she did not care whether lucius survived or not he was simply a tool to be used her questionable motives the likelihood that he would be killed the risk of failure none of these mattered to lucius he was determined to cast his lot with hers uncle will send for you very soon she said today perhaps perhaps within the hour his heart sank by all the gods what have i done to attract his attention this time its not what youve done but who you are youll understand when he tells you he will ask a favor of you what favour she shook her head its better if you know as little as possible agree to help him do as he asks observe and listen through you an opportunity may arise that will lead us to success i dont understand you dont need to not yet just go to him when he summons you thats all you can tell me one more thing within the house of the flavians there is one person whom you can trust absolutely if he should tell you to say or do something do as he says i speak of an imperial steward named stephanus hes a brave man and not squeamish when the moment finally comes hes the man were all counting on hilarion appeared in the doorway looking shaken forgive me for interrupting what is it hilarion theres a visitor in the vestibule a courtier from the palace he says hes come to take you there praetorians came with him theyre waiting for him in the street dont look so glum hilarion its only when the praetorians come inside the house that we should worry this visit was not unexpected lucius looked at flavia and raised an eyebrow i should conceal myself she said lucius nodded to hilarion who stepped to one of the bookcases that appeared to be built into the wall took hold of a scroll that was not a scroll but a lever and pulled it the bookcase opened like a door hilarion ushered flavia into the hidden compartment then shut the bookcase behind her lucius sighed in such a world it was a foolish man who did not have at least one concealed room in his house for his visit to the palace he dressed in his finest toga the rain had abated for a while a shaft of bright sunlight unseen for days broke through the clouds and caused the wet paving stones and puddles to glisten he was conducted to a part of the palace he had never seen before the narrowness of the passages the small size of the rooms and the less formal demeanour of the courtiers seemed to indicate that this was a more private less public area of the imperial complex at various points he was searched for weapons not once but three times at last after waiting alone for an hour in a small chamber off a small garden he was joined by catullus greetings pinarius said catullus in a flat tone of voice that acknowledged nothing of the history between them greetings catullus lucius strove to keep his voice steady though the very sight of the man made his heart beat faster his palms began to sweat so profusely that he had to wipe them on his toga fortunately the blind courtier could not see his distress for a man who professes to have no interest in public affairs your visits to these premises are surprisingly frequent remarked catullus he smiled perhaps he was making a joke to set lucius at ease or was he toying with him i came because i was summoned what is it you want from me catullus began to pace he knew the room well without hesitation and apparently without thinking he could pace from end to end turning just before he reached a wall what im about to tell you you must never reveal to anyone do you understand pinarius yes on penalty of death i understand do you in the past caesar has been extraordinarily merciful to you unduly so in my opinion but if you should ever reveal what im about to tell you i shall see to it myself that youre put to death you make yourself clear catullus good foul weather weve been having dont you think surely you didnt summon me here to discuss the weather as a matter of fact i did catullus ceased pacing you are aware that there have been a great many lightning strikes in the city during recent months im aware of this yes regarding these numerous lightning strikes caesar is not happy to be candid caesar is in some distress every man fears lightning its not the lightning itself that caesar fears but what it may portend i will explain many years ago when caesar was only a boy an astrologer predicted the day of his death indeed the very hour the astrologer also predicted the manner of caesars death by a blade at the time the date foretold must have seemed very distant but time passes the day is swiftly approaching and for a boy death by blade meant death in battle as a brave warrior but now when he imagines death by a blade caesar thinks of treachery and assassination does caesar believe this prediction made so long ago whether he takes it seriously or not a man never forgets such a prediction once caesars father made a joke of it the divine vespasian was dining with his two sons the young domitian was suspicious of a mushroom he had been served and refused to eat it the divine vespasian laughed even if that mushroom is of a poisonous variety you must be immune to it my son for we know the day of your death is a long way off and it isnt mushrooms that will do you in lucius shrugged perhaps if the day predicted draws close caesar should summon this astrologer and order him to cast his horoscope again the astrologer is long dead so the man can neither be punished if his prediction proves false nor rewarded if his prediction proves correct catullus grunted you twist words like apollonius of tyana you flatter me catullus but surely there are other astrologers whom caesar can consult he did so ascletarion whom caesar had never consulted before cast caesars horoscope afresh the astrologer made no specific predictions but what he had to say was unsettling nonetheless because of a conjunction of the stars the beneficent influence of minerva the goddess whom caesar most venerates is waning according to ascletarion minervas protection will be weakest on the very day that was predicted for his death naturally caesar was alarmed to relieve his anxiety he decided to test the mans skill he asked if ascletarion could predict the manner of his own end to which the astrologer replied yes dominus i will be torn apart by dogs lucius almost laughed aloud could it be that ascletarion feared the illtempered emperor was inclined to throw him to the dogs in the arena and thought to save himself by predicting that very thing knowing caesar would then not dare to do so catullus grimaced if the astrologer outwitted anyone it was himself caesar ordered the astrologer to be strangled to death then and there i watched him die a most unpleasant death and thought so much for his powers of prediction caesar ordered me to arrange the mans funeral rites that very afternoon so that his body might be disposed of quickly but though the day had been clear a storm blew up a deluge extinguished the flames before the body was consumed a pack of wild dogs appeared before anyone could stop them they bolted onto the pyre and tore the corpse to pieces lucius shook his head so ascletarions prediction was correct for their sake i hope caesar has sought the advice of no more astrologers his attention is currently fixed upon a soothsayer from one of the germanic tribes a man named eberwig caesar summoned him all the way from colonia agrippina on the strength of the mans reputed knowledge of lightning as the art of lightning reading has declined among the romans it seems to have been taken up by the germans even now the man is making a thorough study of all the lightning strikes that have taken place in recent months charting their location and frequency eberwig will deliver his report to caesar today this is all very fascinating said lucius but what has any of this to do with me why am i here when he cannot sleep at night caesar reads and of late caesar hardly sleeps at all which means he reads a great deal his current fascination is the reign of tiberius whose career he finds of great interest far into the night caesar pores over documents from the reign of his predecessor secretaries are sent to fetch this document or that among tiberiuss private journals caesar has come across a mention of your grandfather who was also named lucius pinarius you are aware that he was an augur as was my father yes your father performed auguries for both the divine claudius and for nero but before that your grandfather was known to tiberius and to claudius and even to the divine augustus luciuss father had spoken little of his own father whose exile to alexandria he considered a chapter of the familys history better forgotten i know that my grandfather was a friend of his cousin claudius and i know he ran afoul of tiberius who banished him from roma but that had nothing to do with augury or with lightning its my understanding that my grandfathers troubles stemmed from dabbling in astrology at a time when tiberius was banning all astrologers yes thats correct but before that when the divine augustus was still alive he called upon your father to interpret a lightning strike which occurred in the old imperial palace did your grandfather never tell you the story i never knew my grandfather and my father never mentioned such a story amazing how families fail to pass on the most interesting tales about themselves yet i assure you in his private journal tiberius gives all the pertinent details there was a lighting strike augustus called upon your grandfather to interpret the omen your grandfather told augustus that the strike meant he had exactly one hundred days to live and when the hundredth day arrived augustus died this has the ring of a legend tiberius recounts it as a fact and domitian accepts it as such again i ask what has this to do with me just as the divine augustus was convinced correctly that your father was the man to interpret that lightning strike so our caesar has become convinced that you the grandson of lucius pinarius are the man who can determine the significance of this current plague of lightning why else have the gods inspired caesar to spare your life when he had every reason to snuff it out not once but twice caesar now sees that you were fated for this task lucius was about to dismiss the idea as nonsense then realized that flavia must have known that this was the reason domitian was summoning him to the palace catullus was offering lucius a means to enter the emperors presence and perhaps even to gain his confidence how could such a charade lead to the result that he and flavia mutually desired that he could not foresee but he knew that flavia would want him to cooperate with catullus you realize that im not an augur like my father and grandfather he said yes but your father actively practised the science for nero while you were growing up you must have learned something about it simply from observing him just enough lucius thought to perform a mock augury himself if he had to without looking completely foolish yes i saw the ritual performed many times i know how its done and your father must have confided certain secrets of the science to you the tricks of his trade as a matter of fact he did he liked talking about augury i suppose he had hopes that i would follow his example one day and become an augur myself lucius recalled the last time he had seen his father on the day titus pinarius left the house to join nero on his final flight he took his secondbest lituus with him and left the family heirloom the beautiful old ivory lituus of their ancestors for lucius who had hardly looked at it since that day and had done nothing to pursue the study of augury the old lituus was still in his possession kept in a chest of keepsakes in the vestibule of his house just under the niche that held the wax mask of his father caesar wishes you to take the auspices said catullus he wants you to observe the skies for lightning and to give him your interpretation not as a member of the college of augurs but as the grandson and namesake of lucius pinarius here now why not the day is stormy with no lack of lightning this seems most irregular isnt caesars german soothsayer already at work to interpret the lightning caesar will listen to both of you and compare your findings will you do this or not what if i refuse that is not the answer im looking for lucius took a deep breath ill do what caesar asks without an assistant to guide him using only his staff the blind man led lucius across the small sodden garden and then through a series of hallways their destination was a gravel courtyard surrounded by a low portico lucius recognized the auguratorium he had seen his father take the auspices in this place which had once been situated outside the imperial palace but was now completely enclosed within the house of the flavians under a nearby portico shielded from the drizzling rain and surrounded by courtiers sat domitian who looked up at their arrival lucius suddenly felt unsure of himself to perform a religious travesty for a man he wanted dead lucius could hardly look to the teacher for inspiration to stall for time he told catullus that he would need the lituus of his ancestors surely any lituus will do said catullus no it must be the ivory lituus i keep with my fathers things ill have to go home and get it no youll stay right here someone will fetch it for you a nearby courtier overhearing stepped forward he was a middleaged man with bristling eyebrows and a neatly trimmed beard ill go for it the man said very well stephanus said catullus luciuss ears pricked up at the name pinarius will tell you where to find it while i explain the delay to caesar as soon catullus was out of earshot lucius whispered i heard your name spoken earlier today before i came here stephanus nodded ten days hence he said quietly barely moving his lips lucius wrinkled his brow what was the man talking about ten days hence stephanus repeated fourteen days before the kalends of domitianus at the fifth hour of the day can you remember that lucius stared at him blankly for a moment then nodded yes he said in a normal tone of voice i keep it in an antique chest in the vestibule just under the wax mask of my father you cant mistake it a beautiful old thing made of solid ivory my freedman hilarion will help you find it then im off said stephanus ill be back as quickly as i can domitian was not pleased by the delay he strummed his fingers against the arms of his chair he tapped his foot nervously he glared at lucius he muttered something to catullus catullus shook his head dominus surely it would be better to wait until after fetch him now said domitian and take pinarius elsewhere until hes ready for the augury as lucius was led away he passed a man wearing such an outlandish costume that he looked like a parody of a german with a huge mane of red hair and a bristling red beard fur boots on his feet tanned leggings and a tightly laced leather vest that left bare much of his broad hairy chest his bare arms were decorated with bracelets that were fashioned as coiling dragons and covered with runes lucius was shown to a small waiting room and left alone he spied a grated window high in one wall he stood on a chair if he peered to one side looking down the length of the portico he could see most of the imperial party including domitian and he could hear everything that was said catullus spoke to a translator you will tell eberwig that caesar is ready for him to deliver his report the translator spoke to eberwig the german replied to the translator at length domitian leaned forward impatiently what is he saying the translator looked uneasy he says if he should deliver news to caesar which displeases caesar what will become of him tell him to speak said domitian as long as he tells the truth hell receive his reward and remain unharmed but if he doesnt speak at once ill have him strangled the translator and eberwig conferred at length at last the translator addressed domitian in a quavering voice dominus the soothsayer declares that he has examined all the evidence of the lightning strikes most scrupulously and he is convinced that he has reached a correct interpretation he says that the frequency and location of the strikes foretell an imminent change at the very highest level of power he says that this can only mean yourself speak clearly he says that very soon there will be a new emperor in roma domitian sat back nervous ly picking at something on his forehead when he cannot say exactly but very soon a matter of months the translator questioned eberwig not months dominus days there was a flash of lightning followed by thunder take him away said domitian eberwig protested the translator cleared his throat he says what of his reward if his prophecy comes true let him seek his payment from my successor snapped domitian now take him away and keep him under close guard an uneasy silence followed eventually stephanus appeared slightly out of breath from running lucius was brought back to the courtyard stephanus stepped forward and handed him the lituus there could be no more delaying lucius took a deep breath he looked at the lituus in his hands he had not touched it in many years what a lovely thing it was with all its intricate carvings of birds and beasts as he had seen his father do many times when he was a boy lucius gazed up at the skies and marked out a zone for his augury the sky was cooperative almost at once a flash of lightning rent the dark clouds to the north and then another lucius waited awhile longer and was rewarded by a third flash of lightning so close that it illuminated the whole courtyard with a spectral blue light it was followed by a tremendous clap of thunder that made everyone jump except lucius whose thoughts were focused entirely on what he was about to say he turned and faced domitian the augury is done dominus so quickly the signs are unmistakable and there is to be a great change a change so great it will affect the whole world the change will be sudden not gradual it will happen in a single moment like a thunderclap when the signs are very clear about that unusually so by counting the branches of all three strikes and observing their relationship to the main trunks of lightning an exact number of days and hours from this moment can be calculated the event will take place not out loud you fool snapped domitian whisper it in my ear lucius approached the emperor he had never been so close to the man before he was close enough to smell his breath and to know that he had eaten onions recently he was close enough to see a black hair that grew out of one nostril and a wart on the mans forehead he was close enough to kill him if hed had a weapon he fought back the revulsion he felt and spoke in domitians ear exactly ten days hence during the fifth hour of the day domitian calculated the date fourteen days before the kalends in the hour before noon youre certain absolutely domitian gripped luciuss wrist squeezing it painfully hard you will return here on that day lucius pinarius you will be with me during that hour if your prediction is false if youre playing some trick on me ill see you strangled at my feet do you understand i understand dominus you will speak of this to no one as you wish dominus domitian released him the emperor sat back nervously picking at the wart on his forehead with one hand and making a curt gesture of dismissal with the other guards escorted lucius from the courtyard through the palace and all the way back to his house one of the guards he noticed took up a post across the street from his door his comings and goings were to be carefully watched and no one could call on him without being observed he could expect no further visits from flavia domitilla that night he wrote a coded letter to apollonius telling him of the days events his summons to the palace the nervous demeanour of domitian and the sham augury which he described in detail where was apollonius now nerva would know when he was done lucius would dispatch hilarion to take the letter to an intermediary who would take it to nerva they never communicated directly lucius finished the letter with the customary closing of farewell and felt a chill as he wrote the word on the morning of the fourteenth day before the kalends of domitianus the month previously known as october praetorian guards arrived at the house of lucius pinarius lucius was ready for them dressed in his best toga he had slept surprisingly well the night before he rose at daybreak and wrote farewell letters to his old friends dio and epictetus and even an affectionate message to martial hilarion stood by unsuspecting lucius had told him nothing about his visit to the palace the less hilarion knew the better for him what a dreary morning this would have been had hilarion suspected that lucius would be dead before midday instead hilarion was in a cheerful mood and kept exhorting him to eat something unable to understand why lucius had no appetite lucius took a stroll through his garden the sky was overcast but not stormy the garden was usually dull and dreary at this time of year but all the recent rain had kept everything quite green at the centre of the garden stood the statue of melancomas he had inherited from epaphroditus it had arrived just the day before and lucius had insisted that the workmen install it at once like epaphroditus he chose to display the statue not on a pedestal but at ground level it was a pity lucius thought that he would have so little time to enjoy it when the praetorians arrived hilarion was quite flustered lucius assured him that all would be well and hilarion seemed to believe him until lucius told him about the letters in his study to be delivered in the event that he failed to return hilarion began to weep lucius embraced him then left with the praetorians he was led farther into the palace than he had ever been led before the reception room where domitian awaited him appeared to be attached to the emperors private bed chamber for through an open door lucius glimpsed an unmade bed piled with richly embroidered pillows and coverlets on this morning the emperor was not stirring far from the place where he felt most secure at the far end of the small reception room was a dais where domitian sat on a chair attended only by catullus and the smallheaded creature there was also a water clock on the dais a beautifully made device that used a dial to indicate the hours of the day the dial was very nearly touching the numeral for the fifth hour of the day a balcony to one side admitted weak daylight from the overcast sky lucius instinctively took a closer look at the balcony wondering if it might provide a means of escape but the room was located on one of the palaces uppermost floors the balcony looked down on a garden several stories below take off your clothes said domitian lucius sighed dominus ive already been searched for weapons your guards did a thorough job i didnt ask if youd been searched i told you to take off your clothes all of them lucius did as he had been ordered he felt no embarrassment instead he felt a kind of freedom as he had felt when he stood naked before the emperor and all of roma in the amphitheatre domitian sent the smallheaded creature to look through luciuss discarded toga and undergarments to make sure they contained no weapons then sucked in a sharp breath when he noticed the fascinum on the chain around luciuss neck that amulet you always wear it dont you and no harm ever befalls you that is not true dominus ive suffered harm those closest to me are all dead or banished because of you but you still live is it because of the amulet give it to me domitians wide eyes were bloodshot and his face was haggard he looked as if he had not slept for days lucius lifted the chain over his neck the smallheaded creature snatched it from him and scurried to the dais domitian put the chain over his head and touched the fascinum which nestled amid the folds of his purple robes yes he whispered i can feel its power let it protect me today blessed minerva and let this mans presence protect me my presence dominus are you not a magician lucius pinarius like that accursed teacher of yours there can be no doubt that some protective magic clings to you that sort of thing rubs off on others today i intend to keep you close at hand until the fatal hour passes lucius smiled at the idea that he himself might be a sort of lucky charm he was also struck by the curious reversal of their roles once he had stood before the emperor a condemned man now the emperor sat before him convinced that he was the one facing death lucius had found peace when he confronted almost certain destruction but domitian was growing more agitated by the moment the smallheaded creature gave a shriek and pointed to the water clock the dial had touched the numeral v make sure the door is locked shouted domitian catullus who could move about the familiar room like a sighted man stepped from the dais strode past lucius and tested the door might i put on my clothes dominus said lucius theres a draft from the balcony domitian grunted and waved his hand time passed with excruciating slowness lucius did not know what he had expected but it was not this endless tedium was there not to be an attempt on the emperors life what part was lucius expected to play or was he simply to wait here until domitian did or did not die and then to die himself it took all his presence of mind simply to stand in the middle of the room and show no emotion as the time slowly passed domitian fidgeted and sighed his stomach growled did you hear that lucius pinarius ive eaten nothing since yesterday morning do you fear poison dominus its not poison that will kill me i fear some drug that might render me unconscious and vulnerable im hungry my stomach too is empty dominus is it i set aside some apples i was given yesterday for my midday meal today if i should live until then theyre in the bowl on the table by my bed fetch one catullus and give it to lucius pinarius well see if it makes him sick catullus brought him an apple lucius bit into the crisp flesh domitian watched him eat and began to salivate so copiously that he had to wipe the drool from his lips when lucius was done domitian told him to get rid of the core by tossing it to the garden below lucius stepped onto the balcony he dropped the apple core and watched it fall a great distance looking down made lucius dizzy the apple core struck and bounced off a large sundial in the garden below the dial was an iron triangle set in a round stone pedestal the day was too overcast for the dial to cast a shadow lucius turned and looked at the water clock on the dais the hour was almost done domitian continued to fidget he tugged at his chin and cracked his knuckles he picked at the wart on his forehead suddenly blood appeared on fingers he gave a cry of alarm then realized that it came from the wart minerva let this be the only blood i spill today his cry brought a knock at the door dominus is something wrong never mind parthenius called domitian alls well but look the clock has reached the sixth hour its done the hour has passed and no harm came to me unlock the door and let him in catullus the chamberlain parthenius entered the room behind him in chains and flanked by guards was the german soothsayer eberwig what do you say now soothsayer demanded domitian eberwig muttered something but there was no one present to translate the guards pulled him to his knees strangle the fool said domitian one of the guards wrapped a chain around the mans neck and twisted it eberwig turned a dark shade of crimson his eyes bulged and his tongue protruded domitian sat back in his chair smiling he appeared to take great pleasure from watching the man die the guards dragged the corpse from the room parthenius followed them lucius stayed where he was on the balcony by a great application of will he had managed to remain calm for the last hour now his body began to exhibit signs of panic his heart raced his palms turned clammy sweat erupted on his forehead did domitian intend to kill him as he had killed the german soothsayer for the moment the emperor was distracted he told catullus to bring him the bowl of apples from the bedroom as the blind courtier walked by the balcony lucius held his breath fearful of drawing the mans attention catullus returned with the apples and domitian began to eat ravenously consuming one after another parthenius reappeared the steward stephanus wishes to see you dominus ill see no one said domitian as soon as i finish these apples ill retire to my private bath stephanus is most insistent he says its very important dominus he says he has urgent information about a plot against you a failed plot you mean im still alive domitian laughed but show him in perhaps he has names for me wait has he been searched for weapons of course dominus no one comes before you without being thoroughly searched go ahead then show him in luciuss heart sank the hour predicted for domitians death had come and gone and now he knew why stephanus had betrayed them poor flavia this would be the end of her would domitian allow her children to live probably not lucius gazed over the parapet of the balcony wondering if death by falling would be preferable to strangulation he felt a sudden urge to flee but the balcony was much too high if only he could disappear like apollonius in a puff of smoke the clouds had begun to break a warm shaft of sunlight touched his face the sky itself seemed to be smiling on the emperors deliverance stephanus entered the room before he could speak domitian waved him aside he called to catullus and pulled him close id almost forgotten about pinarius lucius heard the emperor say in a low voice what shall i do with him whatever pleases you dominus catullus said while waiting to be called on stephanus joined lucius on the balcony in his right hand he clutched a rolled document was this the incriminating list and was luciuss name on it lucius noticed that the mans left forearm was wrapped in bandages a boars tusk can inflict a very nasty wound stephanus explained keeping his voice low it happened when i was out hunting a few days ago would you believe the guards made me unwrap the whole thing the first day i came here wearing it once they saw the blood and the oozing gash they were satisfied i think it made them a bit queasy since then whenever i come they search me like everyone else but they never make me take off the bandages domitian finished his conversation with catullus and called to stephanus the steward hurried to the dais while catullus backed away dominus said stephanus the moment this document entered my hands i headed directly here what is it a list of names dominus when you see them i think youll be shocked catullus stepped towards the balcony lucius moved as far from the man as he could again he gazed over the parapet a shaft of sunlight stuck the sundial far below something was not right lucius squinted and peered more closely at the sundial the shadow cast by the dial indicated not the sixth hour of the day shadowless noon but the fifth hour lucius looked at the water clock without a doubt the clock indicated the sixth hour the water clock was in error someone had changed its settings stephanus extended the document to domitian who unrolled it and stared at it he scowled what is this all i see is a list of provincial magistrates what has this to do quickly deftly stephanus loosened the bandages around his left forearm and reached inside he pulled out a dagger and lunged for the emperor because of domitians elevated position on the dais stephanus fell short of stabbing the mans heart his blade struck domitians groin domitian bellowed in pain he struck stephanus across the face the steward staggered back clutching the bloody dagger domitian bolted forward the throne tumbled backwards the smallheaded creature shrieked and scrambled out of the way domitian grappled with stephanus my knife domitian cried the one i keep beneath my pillow bring it to me the creature scurried past catullus striking him with his elbow and knocking him farther onto the balcony where he almost collided with lucius before grabbing the parapet to steady himself the creature ran into the bed chamber and a moment later emerged with a stricken look on his face he held a scabbard in one hand and in the other a hilt that had no blade someone had substituted a false dagger for the one domitian kept under his pillow other courtiers entered the room they swarmed over domitian who roared and put up a tremendous struggle like a lion attacked by dogs whats happening cried catullus dominus how can i help you suddenly the blind man realized that lucius was next to him he snarled like an animal and lunged for him the accuracy of the mans aim and the ferocity of his attack took lucius by surprise while domitian struggled with the courtiers lucius and catullus wrestled on the balcony catullus used his sharp fingernails to gouge at luciuss eyes and nose and sank his teeth into luciuss arm lucius seized the mans wrists and tried to immobilize him but catullus was too strong the best lucius could manage was to push the man to one side towards the parapet almost before lucius knew what was happening catullus went tumbling over with a bloodcurdling scream catullus plummeted to the garden below lucius heard a sickening sound of impact and looked over the parapet faceup with his limbs outstretched catullus was impaled on the metal blade of the sundial his body was broken nearly in two his mouth gaped open and his eyes glittered his limbs flailed horribly for a moment then fell limp lucius realized that the room behind him had fallen silent except for the sound of men gasping for breath the struggle was over stephanus stepped beside him throwing back his head to exult in the sunshine on his face his hair was dishevelled and his torn clothes were covered with blood the tattered remains of the bandage hung from his left forearm the gash looked very real stephanus saw lucius looking at it and grinned i inflicted the wound myself using a boars tusk theres no substitute for authenticity what had flavia said about stephanus hes a brave man and not squeamish blinking and blearyeyed lucius looked over his shoulder a bloody heap draped in imperial purple lay in the centre of the room courtiers with knives stood in a circle gasping for breath and gazing numbly at their handiwork blood and gore were smeared all over the floor is he really the tyrant is dead said stephanus he proudly held up the dagger in his right hand sunlight glinted on the blood then he showed lucius his left hand in which he clutched a chain with an amulet i think this belongs to you lucius pinarius lucius took back the fascinum covered with blood ad the philosophers had returned to roma three years had passed since the death of domitian on a morning in early september no longer called germanicus lucius played host in his garden to two guests who had long been absent from roma its a shame that neither of you intends to move back to the city said lucius sipping a cup of water spiced with dried apple peel cinnamon and cloves wine had been poured for his guests but lucius as always abstained there is no city like roma said epictetus who had arrived the preceding night but my life now is the school ive founded in nicopolis the students are so bright and eager they inspire me as much as i inspire them and theres something to be said for living in an environment where greek is spoken from dawn to dusk without a word of latin being uttered i feel more at home there than ive ever felt anywhere else and you dio how can you leave roma now that youve returned looking at the sophist lucius was pointedly reminded of the passage of time dio was now in his sixties and looked much older than when lucius had last seen him of course lucius at fiftytwo probably looked much older to dio i was delighted when nerva became emperor and lifted my banishment said dio roma i longed to see again but i was even more pleased by the fact that i could at last return to prusa with so many changes afoot i feel that my place is in my native land looking after the interests of my fellow bithynians and its so lovely and quiet in prusa i think my long absence from roma has cured me of it i couldnt ask for more comfortable accommodations than those youve provided lucius but out there in the streets of roma how noisy it is and how crowded and how smelly dont forget the smells said luciuss third guest it had occurred to lucius that his visit from the two philosophers was the perfect opportunity to effect a reconciliation with martial though reconciliation was perhaps too strong a word lucius and the poet had never had a fallingout they had simply grown distant in recent years determined to set aside any bitterness he felt about martials relationship with domitian lucius had invited the poet to gather with their mutual friends ah but you have a good reason to live in roma said dio to enjoy all the accolades youre receiving on the publication of your collected poems which was long overdue at last your genius is being recognized beyond the how shall i say it the elite circles where it was previously enjoyed fah said martial he too had aged considerably in recent years though he was a bit younger than dio he looked older probably due to the overindulgent style of living he had enjoyed at the court of domitian accolades what do i care for accolades accolades will not pay my rent which has just gone up by the way why is it that every time theres a change of emperor the cost of living goes up im leaving roma as soon as i can settle my affairs and why not ive had all the boys in this city worth having or at least all the ones in my price range im retiring to spain the land of my birth where both the rents and the boys are said to be very cheap our new emperor was also born in spain noted lucius they say trajan is the first emperor to be foreignborn and why not said dio having seen a great deal of the empire and the lands beyond in recent years i think it will be a good thing for roma to have a emperor who was born outside italy though i must say i was greatly saddened by the death of nerva he was a good man and a true lover of philosophy how delighted i was when i heard that he took a vow to kill no senators and i was even more delighted when i heard his declaration that domitians socalled house of the flavians would henceforth be known as the house of the people that sort of thing sets a tone if nothing else to be sure nerva was old and frail and the demands of his office were probably too much for him we can only hope that his successor will be half as good a man trajan is a military man said lucius and widely travelled with experience in syria and on the german and dacian frontiers nerva chose him to please the praetorians who insisted that he put a capable commander in the line of succession since nerva was childless he acquiesced and picked trajan lets hope that sets a precedent said dio succession by bloodline did not prove very successful from augustus we descended to nero from vespasian we plummeted to domitian perhaps if we can settle on some more rational method for choosing an emperors successor the empire and everyone in it will be better off just make sure all the emperors are childless quipped martial like old nerva or like trajan for that matter poor plotina trajan stays so busy chasing after boys one wonders if he ever beds that horsefaced wife of his at all from what ive heard about her plotina can take care of herself said lucius shes said to be quite formidable well soon enough we shall behold the imperial couple with our own eyes said martial after more than a year of settling affairs on the german and dacian frontiers this was the day trajan was to make his official entry into roma i presume well all go down to the forum together later to gawk at trajans arrival along with everyone else in the city i wouldnt miss it said dio if my leg will allow it said epictetus didnt you write a poem in anticipation of the event said lucius he asked out of politeness to allow martial the opportunity to recite from his work but the poet reacted with a sour expression i did indeed and i sent it to the new emperor hoping to please him as yet ive received no reply lucius nodded in other words he thought martial had attempted to ingratiate himself with the new regime and had been rebuffed no wonder he was leaving roma still im sure wed all love to hear what you wrote oh very well said martial who needed little encouragement he stood and cleared his throat happy happy those blessed by fortune to behold the arrival of the new leader whose brow dazzles with the light of northern constellations when will the day come when will the route be thronged with the lovely ladies of roma perched in every tree and window along the flaminian way come soon longedfor day come clouds of distant dust rising from the road to foretell the approach of caesar then shall every citizen and richly clad foreign delegate go forth to exclaim as one with joy he comes the others clapped politely as martial took a bow he returned to his couch and drank thirstily from his cup and now the day has come he said i wonder what sort of chariot trajan will be riding some ornately gilded wonder or something more austere and warlike to emphasize his status as a military man if he wants to look like a general arriving on horseback would be best i suppose or will he recline in a litter and be borne aloft by the prettiest boys hes collected from the far corners of the empire lucius sighed how vacuous and irritating martial seemed to him lucius almost regretted inviting him but dio and epictetus seemed genuinely to be enjoying the poets company perhaps a bit of wine was necessary to appreciate martials wit as you say soon enough well see for ourselves said lucius but its too early yet hilarion will let us know when its time to go in the meantime lucius can tell us more about all the changes in roma said dio simply to have had a sane man like nerva in charge of the state must have seemed a miracle after the grim years of domitian thats true said lucius after fourteen long years i felt that i could breathe again breathe all you want if you can stand the smells of this city said martial wagging his finger though i must admit it became much easier to move about after they pulled down all those triumphal arches choking the streets and got rid of the statues theres definitely more elbow room without a gilded domitian on every corner what happened to all those statues anyway nerva melted them down to replenish the treasury and pay the praetorians said lucius speaking of statues said dio our old friend here looks as magnificent now as the day we first saw him he gestured to the statue of melancomas that dominated the garden do the rest of you remember that occasion the day the ash of pompeii fell on us said epictetus who could forget that it seems a lifetime ago said dio and yet melancomas never ages what a remarkable work of art incomparable it was good and right that epaphroditus left most of his estate to you epictetus but im glad he left the melancomas to you lucius it looks splendid here in your garden lucius nodded i think of epaphroditus every time i look at the statue and i look at the statue every day a toast to epaphroditus martial lifted his cup a toast said the others in unison lucius quaffed his brew of spiced water and the others drank their wine i dont know how you can stand to drink that said martial i suppose you abstain from wine to follow the example of your old teacher i do said lucius i strive to follow his example in all things to the extent to which i am able where is apollonius these days said dio the last i heard he was back in his native tyana said lucius but hes always travelling i hoped he would return to roma to enjoy the brief reign of his friend nerva but hes never come back epictetus smiled in ephesus they tell the most remarkable story about apollonius have you all heard it of course said dio and lucius nodded but martial shrugged and said enlighten me epictetus the stoic smiled glad to have a pair of fresh ears for the tale on the day domitian was assassinated by his courtiers apollonius happened to be in ephesus hundreds of miles from roma speaking to a huge crowd suddenly in the middle of his talk he fell silent and began to stagger and clutch the air staring into the distance good for you stephanus he shouted hurrah stephanus do it smite the bloodthirsty wretch thats it thats it the deed is done you have struck you have wounded you have slain the tyrant there were so many witnesses theres no doubt whatsoever that this happened and it occurred at the very hour that domitian was killed at the time no one had any idea what apollonius was talking about but once the news from roma arrived it became clear that apollonius had witnessed the killing as it happened truly the man possesses a remarkable gift for seeing faroff events now wherever he travels he attracts more followers than ever i can assure you that everyone in nicopolis knows the story they talk of it in prusa as well said dio apolloniuss fame has spread all over the empire thanks to that incident do you suppose the tale is true lucius i think it must be said lucius with a wry smile he remembered the coded letter he had written to the teacher ten days before the assassination thinking it would be his last in which he told apollonius not only the day foretold for the death of domitian but the hour and the name of the man who would kill him it amused him to think that at the very moment he was grappling with catullus on the balcony and stephanus was stabbing domitian apollonius was hundreds of miles away in ephesus shouting encouragement hilarion appeared the time had come for them to head down to the forum lucius could not recall ever having seen a more jubilant crowd in the forum the new emperors anticipated arrival had been the talk of roma for months people were giddy with excitement and everyone in the city seemed to be present even old people who usually avoided such crowds and children held high on their elders shoulders the roofs of the buildings sagged under the weight of spectators at temples and altars people formed long queues to pray for the wellbeing of the new emperor and the air was thick with incense the atmosphere was not of religious awe as attended certain festivals or of the patriotic fervour displayed during triumphal processions or of the frenzied bloodlust evoked by shows in the amphitheatre the feeling was lighter yet equally intense the atmosphere was one of joy of release of hope thought lucius finally putting his finger on it as it turned out martial was mistaken on all counts about trajans mode of transportation the new emperor did not arrive in a chariot or on horseback or in a litter trajan entered the city on foot and he wore not a generals regalia as domitian had done on public occasions but a toga the sight of the new emperor simply walking into the city like any common citizen evoked spontaneous cheers and applause even on foot trajan was easy to spot at a distance because of his height walking alongside him was his wife plotina who graciously smiled and waved to the crowd in their forties the imperial couple were both quite plain but physically robust their relaxed manner seemed completely unpretentious walking a little behind them was trajans cousin and ward hadrian who was in his early twenties and also of spanish birth like trajan hadrian was tall and powerfully built he was handsomer than trajan but his cleanshaven cheeks were covered with acne scars faced with the cheering crowd he comported himself much more stiffly than the genial trajan the cousins were said to be very close it was young hadrian serving under trajan on the german frontier who had delivered to him the news of his acclamation as emperor in the heart of the forum the entire membership of the senate gathered in groups to greet the new emperor beginning with the foremost magistrates and senior members lucius and his friends happened to be standing in the crowd nearby as trajan began to approach the receiving line hadrian looking in the direction of lucius and his party whispered in trajans ear the emperor nodded turned and walked directly to them trajan raised his hand in greeting dio of prusa epictetus of nicopolis have you come to welcome this humble citizen to roma his accent was decidedly provincial lucius was startled by trajans approach he was even more surprised by the casual ease with which his philosopher friends responded caesar has come home and his people rejoice said epictetus the house of the people has been empty too long said dio caesar and his wife will fill it with light and happiness trajan laughed seen close at hand he was even larger than lucius had thought his face was homely but pleasant dominated by a long nose and topped by a thick mop of greying hair since we havent met before you must wonder how i recognized you thank my cousin over there young hadrian is quite the scholar i call him the little greek hes too shy to come meet you but he insisted that i do so many a night in my tent hadrian has read your works aloud to me dio i laugh i cry if you can imagine tears from a big fellow like me your discourses about melancomas delightful and you epictetus my wife speaks very highly of you though i think she leans towards the epicureans rather than you stoics i leave the philosophy to plotina and believe whatever she tells me to much simpler that way and your companions he indicated lucius and martial who stood to one side this is our host in the city said dio lucius pinarius and this is martial the famous poet martial eagerly stepped forward welcome caesar the day of your arrival is finally here now every citizen and richly clad foreign delegate steps forth to exclaim as one with joy he comes he made a small bow trajan looked down his nose for a moment he worked his large jaw back and forth then nodded to the philosophers well i must go say hello to some senators now he turned around and headed to the receiving line astounding said lucius he greeted you two even ahead of the magistrates a good sign i think said dio the new emperor may not be a lover of philosophy but he acknowledges the contribution of philosophers i have high hopes for this man did you hear his accent said martial making a face he sounded like a spanish fishmonger one might almost wish to remain here in roma to see what sort of tone trajan sets for the social life of the city said epictetus martial grunted not me i cant wait to get out of this stinking dung heap after trajan had received the personal greetings of every senator embracing and kissing many of them he and plotina ascended to the temple of jupiter on the capitoline for a formal ceremony then returned to the forum and made their way through the crowd to the grand entrance of the imperial palace on the steps trajan made a brief speech mostly in praise of nerva like nerva he made a vow to kill no senators he then invited plotina to say a few words she made a show of surprise at this and demurred whereupon a cry went up for her to speak without too much prompting she acquiesced nerva called this place the house of the people said plotina and so we shall call it for that way every day we shall be reminded of who put us here and for whom we toil the people of roma not long ago people dreaded to enter this house and some who entered were never seen again it is my hope that we can make this a place where every citizen feels safe and welcome i am a simple woman the wife of a soldier a daughter of the house of pompeius to reside in the house of the people with your blessings is the greatest honor of my life your respect is the greatest prize i can imagine i shall strive to earn it and to keep it we love you plotina shouted someone in the crowd never change plotina laughed i dont intend to the way i go into this house is the way i hope to be carried out of it this prompted a huge cheer and with that trajan and plotina gave a final wave and disappeared into the palace what a charming couple said dio what a couple of actors said martial really they should start a mime troupe they seem delightful said lucius martial grunted pinarius the man was downright rude to you he didnt say a word when dio introduced you thats quite alright by me said lucius i should prefer to remain beneath the emperors notice im off said martial i need a drink and someone to drink with and i know i wont find that at your house pinarius it was good to finally see you all again after a round of farewells martial took his leave as did dio who wished to spend the rest of the afternoon at the baths relaxing and writing his impressions of the days events lucius made his way home walking slowly to accommodate the lame epictetus back in luciuss garden epictetus joined him in drinking a cup of spiced water he grimaced and rubbed his leg if it would help said lucius i could have one of the slaves give you a massage no please dont bother actually ive been waiting all day to have a moment alone with you is there something we need to talk about said lucius epictetus had seemed quiet and moody all day the expression on his face was grave you know that epaphroditus left his estate to me yes for the establishment of your school a worthy cause his wealth has been put to good use but among the many objects i inherited there were some of no monetary value among them was this epictetus pulled forth a rusty circle of iron what on earth is that exclaimed lucius this note was attached to it epictetus handed him a scrap of parchment this manacle circled the wrist of a man from tyana but could not restrain him it should be given to the man who appeared beside him that day lucius picked up the manacle and laughed aloud at the wonder of receiving such a memento one of the shackles cast off by apollonius at his final appearance before domitian how remarkable that epaphroditus managed to get his hands on it how thoughtful that he should have intended it for me epictetus nodded but did not smile theres something else said lucius yes epaphrodituss estate included a great many documents as you might imagine many capsae full of scrolls and scraps of parchment some dating back to the days of nero some more recent ive slowly been sorting through them as time allows just before i left for roma i came across a document that will be of particular interest to you yes its a letter written in epaphrodituss own hand or a draft of a letter as it appears to be unfinished and has no salutation or signature at first i had no idea for whom it was intended but as i reread it and saw the documents attached to it i realized it had to be you why epaphroditus never finished the letter and why he never sent it i dont know perhaps he intended to wait until domitian was dead perhaps he changed his mind about telling you i myself have debated whether i should give you the letter you seem to have attained an enviable state of contentment lucius why should i give you news that may only disturb your tranquility but i give it to you nonetheless epictetus handed him a small scroll lucius unrolled it and peered at epaphrodituss familiar handwriting there are two things i have never told you the first of these is about the one you call teacher when i approached the two of you that day just before the trial i made a pretense of not knowing him this was at his request forgive me for deceiving you the teachers ideas are honest and simple but the dangers of this world require him to be secretive sometimes even devious perhaps you have realized that many of his exploits which some attribute to magic are realized through his remarkable ability to control the perceptions of others i suspect he does this by using the power of suggestion though how this works i do not know i do know that it works more readily and more deeply with some people than with others i seem to be immune to it but our socalled dominus is highly susceptible as are you my friend the teachers disappearance that day was effected partly by the use of a device which was secreted on your person by me without your knowledge which you handed to the teacher just before he used it if you think back you may recall other occasions when you thought you saw or heard something miraculous when in fact your senses perceived an illusion planted in your mind by the teacher who is to say this ability of his is not a gift from the divine singularity which he has used not for malicious purposes but wisely for the benefit of us all i hope this knowledge does nothing to damage your respect for the man or for his precepts yet as i begin to think that i have not much longer to live i feel compelled to confess to you what i know the second thing i want to tell you is of a more intimate nature it is about the woman whom you loved in secret for so many years not long before her tragic end she asked me to visit her during her incarceration she knew i was your friend and she wanted to entrust a secret to me she was the mother of your child you may recall a period of several months when she was away from roma her sisters in alba knew of her condition and helped to conceal it that was where she delivered the child it was a boy the unwanted baby was exposed as they call this ancient and alltoocommon custom taken to a desolate spot and abandoned to die unless the gods or some passing mortal should take pity on it she kept this a secret from you for that she felt guilty also she was profoundly struck by the idea that she should die in the same way she condemned her own child to die abandoned and left to starve i think this was why she faced her fate so calmly she believed her end was a punishment from vesta and that our socalled dominus was merely a tool of the goddess she left it to me to decide whether or not to tell you this after she was gone i could not bear to do so nor did i see any reason to until now for her story so disturbed my own peace of mind that i undertook to discover if i could the fate of her child your son our socalled dominus often holds court at his retreat outside alba where i am obliged to follow i have used my position to obtain information from the local people and from the sisters who concealed the birth in recent days i have found reasons to suspect that the exposed child was rescued harvested as they say by a professional scavenger of exposed children and raised as a slave i am told such slaves are commonly called foster children and that this lucrative practice is widespread i have sought to find this boy a task made possible perhaps by a characteristic which distinguished him as a baby the second and third toes of his right foot are joined to the outermost knuckle as yet i have not succeeded but i am hopeful that your son may yet live and that i can locate him though whether such a discovery would bring you joy or sadness i do not know in the event that this letter should reach you after my death i attach some of the information which i have thus far uncovered if anything should the letter ended with an unfinished sentence lucius put down the scroll the revelation about apollonius did not disturb him he knew that the teacher was a master of illusion and he felt privileged to have served him in any capacity with or without his own full knowledge but the news about cornelia and the child struck him like a thunderbolt in retrospect the reason for her withdrawal to alba seemed painfully obvious why had he not guessed that she was pregnant why had she not told him he understood at last why she had mouthed forgive me as she descended to her tomb she was talking about the child the love he had felt for cornelia which he had so assiduously sought to bury along with everything else from the dead past suddenly welled up inside him the knowledge that he had a son changed his perception of the world in an instant no matter how long it took or how difficult the task lucius was determined to find the child ad when vespasian saw that the treasury was empty he filled it up again by looting jerusalem said trajan for us the obvious solution is the conquest of dacia the loot of sarmizegetusa would be enormous imagine what i could build with all that gold the emperor was holding a private conference in one of the more modest reception rooms in the house of the people he sat alone on the dais plotina and hadrian were seated in their own chairs nearby one to each side of him with his marriage to trajans grandniece sabina hadrian was now an inlaw of the emperor as well as his cousin and trajan frequently included him in his deliberations plotinas participation in all important discussions was taken for granted the gold mines of dacia and the hoard of king decebalus are legendary said hadrian he spoke slowly and carefully not out of caution but because he was making a concerted effort to get rid of his provincial accent which a year ago had been even more pronounced than trajans more than once he had overheard a veteran courtier making fun of the emperors spanish accent trajan seemed to have no interest in changing his speech but hadrian was determined to speak latin like a born roman and was taking lessons to learn to do so they were discussing the treasury and the means by which it could be replenished taxes were unpopular conquest was the preferred means and had been throughout romas long history as plotina pointed out the great generals of the republic destroyed carthage and took spain and greece the divine julius conquered gaul the gold and slaves he captured made him the richest man in history and helped make him the sole ruler of the empire the divine augustus took egypt the oldest and richest kingdom in the world vespasian sacked jerusalem and brought back enough gold and slaves to build his amphitheatre when one looks at the map she gestured to a painting on the wall what remains to be taken of any value except dacia or parthia said trajan stroking his chin and gazing at the vast empire that dominated the fareastern portion of the map there are dangers of course said hadrian even the divine augustus was thwarted when he tried to make slaves of the germans and no roman has yet succeeded in taking parthia the empire is simply too big and too powerful dacia seems ripe for the picking but that too presents a risk domitian did his best to get the better of king decebalus and repeatedly failed thats because domitian was a military genius only in his imagination said plotina hadrian nodded certainly caesar is a far better military man than domitian but is he not also a better diplomat rather than attack king decebalus headon perhaps the best strategy would be to win over the kings neighbours and allies using statecraft to isolate the dacians before directly confronting them the less blood shed by romans the better plotina agreed never forget what becomes of roman soldiers when theyre captured by the dacians theyre handed over to the dacian women and the tortures inflicted on those poor men are the stuff of nightmares if the way of conquest can be made easier by diplomacy all the better might we not also send agents to tamper with the dacians religious ceremonies suggested hadrian how would that be of use asked trajan the dacians most important religious ceremony is an event held every five years at which a youth is sacrificed to their god zalmoxis ive never heard of him said plotina nor have most people outside dacia said hadrian zalmoxis was once a man a dacian who became a slave and then a disciple of the greek philosopher pythagoras after pythagoras freed him zalmoxis returned to dacia and became a healer and religious teacher in his own right he died but was resurrected and preached to the dacians about the immortality of the soul before he finally left this world for the next dont the christians also worship a man who became a god said trajan or is it a god who became a man there are similarities in the two religions acknowledged hadrian but the worship of zalmoxis is much older the most important ceremony is held once every five years in a cave in the holy mountain of kogaionon where zalmoxis spent three years in seclusion a chosen youth is cast onto the points of three lances his mission is to die and then to deliver the requests of the dacians to zalmoxis in the other world but sometimes the youth fails to die if that happens the messenger is deemed unworthy and another is chosen but the omen is very bad when does the next such ceremony take place asked trajan according to our spies the next fiveyear ceremony will take place in just a few months this has caused me to wonder caesar if roman agents inside dacia might somehow sabotage the ceremony and by doing so spread doubt and dissension among the dacians trajan laughed heartily and slapped his knee little greek only you could sift through all that foreign gibberish and find a way to use it to our advantage perhaps that endless education of yours will turn out to be more useful than i thought i love this idea by all mean yes instruct our agents in dacia to make a shambles of the upcoming ceremony and if they should be uncovered asked plotina well disavow any knowledge decebalus will assume the agents originated from enemies within his own court while the dacian women have their way with the poor agents said plotina such men know the risks they take in return for the generous rewards i give them said trajan ah but this discourse on zalmoxis reminded me of the christians he waved to a secretary who brought him a scroll ive been asked by a provincial governor for official instructions on what to do about the christians their refusal to pay allegiance to the imperial cult indeed to worship any of the gods makes them a menace to society but their numbers are quite small are they not said plotina one of my ministers estimates they account for five per cent of the population said trajan respectfully caesar i think that estimate is much too high even in the eastern cities where their numbers are concentrated said hadrian the aggravation they cause is out of all proportion to their actual numbers most people see their flagrant atheism as a clear threat to the security of the roman state which has always depended on the favour of the gods when a pious lawabiding citizen in antioch say discovers that a christian is living next door that citizen is likely to demand that a magistrate do something about it and if the magistrate acts the christians are arrested incarcerated and given a choice recognize the emperor and the gods by the simple act of burning incense on an altar or be executed and some of these fools actually choose to be executed these people are fanatics caesar what if the magistrate does not act people take the law into their own hands christians have been burned out of their homes and driven off even stoned to death by angry neighbours as you can imagine that sort of thing causes a huge headache for the authorities in charge of keeping the peace trajan rubbed his nose thoughtfully but such incidents are rare are they not in my experience whether one is in antium or antioch most people try to get along with their neighbours and mind their own business even if the neighbours are christians and what of the legions said hadrian surely a christian soldier is a contradiction in terms said plotina i thought these people were opposed to killing nonetheless there are reports of christians being found among caesars soldiers where they greatly upset morale a legionary who refuses to sacrifice to the gods before battle poses a clear danger to his comrades no pious soldier of roma wants to serve beside such people in combat trajan shook his head it seems to me that an official policy of aggressively seeking out and punishing this tiny cult would be a waste of resources more trouble than its worth likely to make people anxious and upset for no good reason i certainly dont want to reward these deathworshipping fanatics with the attention they crave and i am determined not to follow the example of domitian who was ready to believe that anyone was a christian if an informer told him so such an accusation became an easy way to blackmail or get rid of an enemy which is one reason our estimate of the number of christians may be inflated there are more people accused of being christian than there are christians trajan waved to the secretary who brought a stylus and wax tablet and began to dictate notes for my response to a query from a provincial governor in regard to the christians these people are not to be sought out if brought before you and found guilty they must be punished but even to the last minute if such a person should repent and consent to worship the gods he should be pardoned anonymous accusations must play no role in any prosecution such practices are a discarded relic of a previous time the official policy regarding the christians in a nutshell may be summed up thusly ask not tell not he turned to hadrian there what do you think of that caesar is like a father who wishes to keep peace between his children even the worst of them trajan was amused speak freely little greek what do you really think i think that caesar is perhaps tolerant to a fault but that is the opinion of a man much younger and less experienced than caesar dont rub it in trajan laughed erudite pious and clever is our little greek and dont forget handsome said plotina with a smile hadrian nodded to acknowledge the compliment but touched his fingers to one acnescarred cheek what else is on the agenda said trajan the secretary handed him another document ah the new census i commissioned can you believe that roma has a million inhabitants so many people and so much misery said plotina i took a walk yesterday through the subura the squalour was shocking so many children dressed in rags and running wild the growing number of the destitute is not just a problem in roma said hadrian but in every city of the empire domitian did nothing about the problem of course said trajan but nerva instituted a system of financial relief for the children of the poor and also for orphans i intend to continue that relief perhaps we can even expand the system if we can fill the treasury one hears there are more abandoned infants now than ever before said plotina newborns left to die not on remote hillsides but just outside the city walls the situation is so common that people travelling along the roads think nothing of seeing the corpse of an infant lying in the gutter where do these unfortunate children come from in such great numbers i was just reading a discourse by dio of prusa on that very topic said hadrian he speculates that slave women impregnated by a master or by another slave often abort children or else hide their pregnancies and then abandon the infant but abandoning ones child to die how could even a slave do such a thing said plotina after many years of marriage she herself remained childless dio says that such a slave woman gets rid of her baby so as to escape the added slavery of having to raise a child that will simply become another slave for her masters use what a vexing situation said plotina so many problems so much suffering and so very little we can do about it said trajan all the more reason husband that we must do whatever we can trajan smiled ruefully speaking of dio of prusa cousin i almost regret introducing myself to the man hes taken the liberty of sending me a lengthy piece with the title oration on kingship he seems to expect me to read the thing and send him a reply i dont think he realizes that a man engaged in actually running the world hardly has time to read a longwinded compilation of helpful suggestions however well intentioned and are his suggestions helpful said plotina honestly i tried to skim the thing but its so full of highflown phrases and obscure literary allusions that i couldnt make any sense of it perhaps cousin you could read dios oration and prepare a brief summary for me then i can send the fellow a suitable reply ive already read it said hadrian trajan raised an eyebrow he sent you a copy i think he sent copies to just about everyone he could think of hes distributed the oration far and wide the nerve of the man dio wishes to have an influence on the world to do that he must influence the emperor to influence the emperor he uses the tool he knows best words words can be very powerful said trajan indeed they can which is why it is better for caesar to have these philosophers as friends rather than enemies in point of fact much of his advice is quite sound ill read his oration again and prepare a summary which caesar can read at his leisure leisure trajan laughed i have precious little of that well weve talked enough of the great problems of the world lets see if we can actually get something done this morning what sort of petitions are on the agenda he gestured to the secretary who brought him a list of the citizens who were awaiting an audience along with a description of their requests whats this one trajan peered more closely at the list lucius pinarius the name sounds vaguely familiar have i ever met this fellow i dont think so said hadrian i looked at the list earlier and i also noticed the name the pinarii are an ancient patrician family cousins of the divine julius and the divine augustus but this bearer of the name is a man of no particular importance not even a senator though he does appear to possess considerable wealth trajan grunted according to these notes his request is linked to an issue we were just discussing this lucius pinarius desires to redeem a foster child from slavery he claims the child is his offspring and he wants to have the boy legally recognized as such so that the boys name and citizenship are restored thats not the same as manumission is it legally it would be saying that the boy was born a citizen and so was never a slave despite the fact that he was raised as one there are plenty of precedents for such cases noted hadrian but legal technicalities invariably arise that must be decided on a casebycase basis for example should the foster childs current master be paid for the childs upbringing or should the master relinquish the child to its lawful parent without payment trajan nodded thoughtfully how old is the boy the secretary consulted his notes fifteen caesar trajan raised an eyebrow ah well lets have look show them in dressed in his best toga lucius pinarius entered the room and stood before the emperor his demeanour was humble but confident and he glanced about the room in a way that suggested he was not unfamiliar with the surroundings the wideeyed boy who accompanied him on the other hand was obviously dazzled by the magnificence of the room trajan and hadrian exchanged brief but knowing glances both had an appreciative eye for male beauty and the boy was extremely goodlooking with his dark blonde hair and flashing green eyes he did not much resemble his reputed father trajan took the secretarys notes on the case and read them then passed the notes to hadrian he looked at lucius pinarius it would appear citizen that your claim of paternity for this boy is flimsy at best you wont reveal the identity of the mother for one thing why not my relationship with the boys mother was irregular caesar in other words a cause for scandal had it not been kept secret it would have caused a scandal yes said lucius that is why i wish her identity to remain a secret even though she is no longer alive but i swear by the gods that she was a freeborn woman and thus so was our child youre certain the boy was your offspring and not that of another man i am caesar hadrian looked up from the notes if this account is correct the boy was abandoned shortly after birth in the vicinity of alba he was harvested by a scavenger and sold as a slave then passed though several hands before he was acquired by his current master youve clearly documented all the steps you took to track him down yet how can you be certain this individual is in fact the boy you seek by an unusual physical characteristic hadrian glanced again at the notes ah yes i see his webbed toes he looked at the boy and smiled his face is perfect yet the gods have given him a hidden flaw its like a poem by theocritus trajan laughed and shook his head little greek was there ever a pretty boy who did not suggest to you a poem by someone or other but what of the boys current owner show him in the man who entered was dressed not in a toga but in a brightly coloured tunic that he was not a roman citizen became evident when he spoke with a cosmopolitan greek accent my name is acacius caesar i live in neapolis this boy is my property trajan looked at the mans feet your sandals are covered with dust marble dust caesar im a sculptor i acquired this boy because his previous owner noticed that he had a skill for shaping things with his hands and offered to sell him to me ive had him for five years his talent is considerable no more than considerable he has a gift from the gods thanks to the education ive given him hes become a very skilled artisan and i think he might eventually become a true artist maybe even a great one the slave represents a substantial investment of my time and money caesar and if hes as gifted as i think i stand to make a great deal of money from his skills in the future i dont want to give him up trajan rubbed his chin i see you may all withdraw from the room while caesar deliberates but caesar said lucius i feel ive hardly had a chance to plead my case the facts are all in the notes are they not you may withdraw after the litigants were gone trajan ordered a slave to bring wine to settle this matter i think we will need the inspiration of bacchus he said then threw back his head and emptied his cup well cousin what do you think is lucius pinarius a devoted father whos performed a labour worthy of hercules in tracking down his longlost son or he is simply a lusty old goat trying to get his hands on another mans slave my thoughts exactly said hadrian oh the two of you said plotina must you always view the world through the lens of your own proclivities not every fiftyyearold man wants to sleep with pretty boys trajan sipped from his second cup of wine and smirked plotina dear the man has never even been married do you seriously think he has no interest in boys he suddenly laughed out loud so long and hard that he had to wipe a tear from his eye im remembering something one of my servants once said this was back when my father was governor of syria and i was serving under him as a tribune i was retiring to my quarters one evening after a particularly stressful day and the man asked me if he could bring me anything i said well i wouldnt mind if you could bring me a couple of fifteenyearold syrian boys and the servant relied with a completely straight face certainly master but if i cant find two fifteenyearolds shall i bring you one thirtyyearold what a wit that fellow had even plotina laughed she had long ago accepted her husbands proclivities and tended to be amused by them she was glad that he had a sense of humour and could laugh at himself young hadrian on the other hand took such matters very seriously he was wont to declaim about the philosophical and mystical properties of desire while trajan simply wanted to have a good time so said trajan what do we know about this lucius pinarius hadrian was reading the notes according to this the fellow once fought a lion before domitian can you imagine that theres no note about what happened to the lion but pinarius obviously survived a lot of people got on the wrong side of domitian said plotina even senators ended up in the arena as a punishment that it happened to pinarius is no mark against him that he survived may indicate the favour of the gods his father was closely tied to nero noted hadrian the elder pinarius performed auguries in furtherance of some of neros more disreputable schemes nero had many sycophants some more willing and culpable than others said plotina a son shouldnt be held accountable for his fathers mistakes but look at this said hadrian this should have been at the beginning of the notes not at the end the fellow has character references from dio of prusa and the philosopher epictetus both have written glowing testimonials to his virtue and honesty thats where i met him said trajan slapping his knee on the day we entered roma and you sent me to say hello to those two in the forum lucius pinarius was with them ah well if dio and epictetus speak well of him i think that settles the matter dont you plotina trajan called for the litigants to return lucius pinarius acacius of neapolis this is my decision this boy will be recognized as pinariuss son though the boy was raised as a slave he shall be considered as born free he is not a freedman but under the law was born and has always been a free person and the son of citizens however in consideration of the uncertainties involved in this case no fault whatsoever shall accrue to you acacius and in recognition of your lost investment lucius pinarius will pay to you a sum adequate to purchase a similarly educated slave to replace the boy the sculptor protested caesar the boy is irreplaceable i shall never find another boy as talented if you think talent is too rare complain to the gods not to me said trajan but caesar my judgement is final be gone the unhappy sculptor withdrew lucius and the boy stood before the emperor trajan leaned forward and smiled what are you called boy my various masters have called me various names said the boy daring to look the emperor in the eye my master acacius called me pygmalion did he and do you know the tale of pygmalion he was a greek sculptor who made a statue so beautiful he fell in love with it venus brought the statue to life and pygmalion married her a greek tale with a rare happy ending noted hadrian and what will you call the boy lucius pinarius asked trajan will you give him your own first name no if i may caesar in your honour and with your permission i will give him the name marcus my own first name said trajan smiling broadly caesar is pleased lucius turned to the boy then from this moment forward my son you shall be marcus pinarius saying the name aloud for the first time lucius was overwhelmed by the reality of the moment at fifteen his son had not only been found and restored to him but was of age to put on the toga of manhood on a sudden impulse lucius did something he had never dared to hope would be possible with the emperor himself as witness he took off the necklace he was wearing and placed it over his sons head as countless generations of pinarii had done before him lucius passed the fascinum to his heir father and son embraced trajan caught only a brief glimpse of the golden amulet puzzled he crooked a finger to summon hadrian and whispered in his ear is that a cross and is a cross not a christian symbol hadrian frowned our intelligence said nothing to indicate pinarius might be a christian if he were would that have influenced caesars verdict trajan held out his cup to be refilled he allowed his gaze to linger on the cupbearer who happened to be attractive though not as beautiful as young marcus pinarius does caesar wish to retract his judgement and question pinarius about his religious beliefs asked hadrian certainly not said trajan sipping his wine you know the official policy ask not tell not part iv marcus the sculptor ad marcus pinarius woke with a shiver and a start the first dim light of morning seeped through the shutters in the distance a cock crowed a hand touched his face he drew back with a jerk then saw his father standing over him you were dreaming my son said lucius pinarius was i i heard you whimpering even from my room was it the same dream marcus blinked yes i think so its already faded away for years even before his father had found him marcus had been haunted by a recurring dream in the dream he was shivering and frightened and naked and the place in which he cowered was dank and dark and cold a giant hand reached for him and grabbed him and he gave a cry and at that point in the dream he always woke up he never saw the giant who caught hold of him he never knew what happened next what did it mean did the dream recall a genuine memory or was it a fantasy from his imagination the dream always exerted such a powerful spell that after waking it took marcus a moment to remember who and what he was not a child any longer and not a helpless slave but a man of twentyeight living with his father in their house on the palatine hill are you really my father he whispered lucius sighed i am by the shade of the blessed apollonius of tyana i swear it never doubt it my son but who was my mother whispered marcus after much deliberation and despite the boys desperate desire to know his origin lucius had made up his mind never to reveal to him the secret of his birth the truth was simply too dangerous and not only because lucius himself had committed a capital crime each time he made love to cornelia how could it possibly benefit young marcus to know that his mother had been a vestal that she had broken her sacred vow of chastity that she had been buried alive and that his own conception had been the result of a sacrilegious crime surely such knowledge could only plague him with more nightmares lucius would tell his son only that his mother had been a woman of patrician rank with whom lucius had carried on an illicit and impossible liaison whose family would never forgive her lapse and who had died years ago i loved her deeply and still miss her every day he would add for this was the truth at the age of sixtysix lucius was determined to go to his grave without revealing to anyone the fact that cornelia cossa was the mother of his child i too woke from a familiar dream he said ignoring his sons question you were visited again by apollonius said marcus yes he visits you often in your dreams more often now than when he was alive said lucius with a laugh i only wish he had returned to roma before he died so that you could have been blessed with the chance to meet him i have been blessed by having a father who knew him said marcus he flashed a weak smile the dreadful spell cast by the nightmare was fading of course there are those who question whether apollonius actually died at least in the usual sense said lucius since no corpse was ever discovered tell me the story said marcus closing his eyes his father had told him the tale many times before but marcus was always glad to hear it it would help him to forget his bad dream this occurred a few years ago on the island of crete where the teacher had acquired a great following he arrived late one night at the temple of the minoan goddess dictynna which stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea the wealthy people of crete deposit their treasures in the temple for safe keeping at night the doors are locked and fierce dogs stand guard but when the teacher approached the dogs wagged their tales and licked his hands and the doors of the temple sprang open when the priests found him sleeping inside the next morning they accused him of drugging the dogs and using magic to open the doors they put him in chains and confined him in an iron cage suspended from a precipice overhanging the sea with crashing waves below but late that night unfettered and free again the teacher approached the entrance to the temple and this time there was a great crowd gathered in anticipation of his appearance again the dogs grew tame and fawned on him and again the locked doors sprang open he stepped inside the doors shut after him and from within there came the sound of women singing hurry hurry upwards upwards they sang fly away from this place and ascend to the heavens when the doors opened no singers were to be seen and neither was the teacher apollonius has never again been seen on this earth except in the dreams of those who knew him do you think hell ever visit me in my dreams father i dont know my son what did he say to you this time he talked to me about the immortality of the soul he said here is the proof presented to you from beyond the grave which i couldnt offer to you when i was a living man the fact that i endure and visit you in your dreams shows you i have survived beyond my mortal life your soul is no less immortal than mine but it is a fallacy to speak of your soul and my soul for the soul is no ones possession it emanates from and returns to the divine singularity and the body it inhabits is mere gross matter which decays and vanishes when the body dies the soul rejoices like a swift horse freed from its traces it leaps upwards and mingles with the air loathing the spell of harsh and painful servitude it has endured you should write all this down father lucius shook his head im not sure that i should because in the next breath the teacher told me that all he had just said was of no real value to a living man but of what use can this knowledge be to you while you live he said the truth will be known to you soon enough and you shall have no need for words to explain it or to convince you you shall experience it for yourself as long as you live and move among other living beings these things will be mysteries to you like shadows cast on a wall by a light you cannot see lucius looked down at his son who gazed back at him with trusting green eyes the eyes of his mother marcus sometimes still looked like a boy to him though the world by every measure considered him a man come lucius said wash your face and dress yourself hilarion will have woken the kitchen slaves by now and our breakfast will be waiting you have a busy day ahead of you later that morning holding a hammer in one hand and a chisel in the other marcus stepped back and read aloud the inscription on the massive marble pedestal to which he had been putting some finishing touches the senate and people of roma dedicate this monument to the emperor caesar nerva trajan augustus germanicus dacicus son of the divine nerva pontifex maximus in his seventeenth year in the office of tribune six times acclaimed as imperator six times consul father of his country he stepped farther back from the immense pedestal and gazed up the towering column was surrounded by scaffolding but in his minds eye marcus could see the structure as it would appear when it was completed and the scaffolds were removed never before had there existed a monument like this one and marcus was immensely proud to have had a hand in creating it the column rose feet if one included the pedestal and the statue that would top the column the total height would reach feet and was made of eighteen colossal marble drums stacked one atop another within the hollow column was a spiral staircase of steps lit by narrow slits in the drums wrapped around the column in an ascending spiral was a series of relief sculptures depicting trajans conquest of dacia these sculptures were the reason for the scaffolds that surrounded the column the hundreds of images that circled the drums were still being finished and painted the height of the column corresponded to the height of the hillside that had been excavated to make room for it the volume of earth that had been removed by human labour mostly dacian slave labour was staggering where before a spur of the quirinal hill had blocked the way between the citys center and the field of mars there was now a new forum bearing trajans name the centerpiece of which was the enormous column that pierced the sky above marcuss head he felt a hand on his shoulder standing beside him was the man who had designed not just the column but the entire forum complex people called apollodorus of damascus a second vitruvius comparing him to the great architect and engineer who had served julius caesar trajan had met apollodorus during his service in syria had realized his genius and had kept him busy ever since in the dacian campaigns apollodorus had served the emperor by designing siege engines and other weapons to facilitate troop movements he had constructed a stupendous bridge across the danube river the longest arch bridge ever built to allow a vast army to move quickly and safely through the iron gates of the danubian gorges he had built a wooden roadway cantilevered from the sheer rock face the legions had literally walked on top of the river and penetrated to the heart of the enemys territory roman bravery the favour of the gods and the leadership of the emperor had won the day but it was the brilliance of apollodorus that had allowed the legions to move with the speed and force of a lightning bolt early in the dacian war apollodorus had asked trajan to give him an assistant the emperor recalled the strikingly handsome youth who had stood before him one day in the house of the people and the comment made by the boys onetime master his talent is considerable he has a gift from the gods it had been the great good fortune of marcus pinarius to be summoned by the emperor to serve under apollodorus of damascus throughout the dacian war marcus was at the mans side day and night assisting him watching him work learning from him earning his trust and respect now back in roma apollodorus continued to work for the emperor and marcus continued to work under apollodorus marcuss aptitude for engineering was considerable but his special gift had always been for sculpture anything he could visualize in his imagination he could render in stone with a sureness and ease that astounded even apollodorus while apollodorus could take credit for the concept and the overall design of the great column marcus had sculpted many parts of the spiral relief as well as the monumental sculpture at the base a pile of weapons that symbolized the enemys defeat with vivid images of warfare many witnessed by marcus firsthand the spiral relief recounted the struggle of the dacians ending in their slaughter and enslavement by the roman legions over and over in the sequence of images the figure of the emperor appeared often sacrificing animals to the gods or taking part in a furious battle apollodorus joined marcus in gazing up at the column he was a tall man with big arms who kept fit by taking part in the actual construction of his projects not merely overseeing the work like many of trajans legionaries his hair was shoulder length and he wore a beard claiming that he had no time for barbers at middle age his hair was still thick and dark with a bit of silver beginning to show at his temples and on his chin he gave marcuss shoulder a friendly squeeze his grip was painfully strong what do you feel when you look up at it pride marcus said it was true marcus took great pride in his artistry and pride was what romans were meant to feel when they gazed at the column pride in their soldiers pride in their emperor pride in the conquest of another people but pride was not all marcus felt when he looked at the images that wrapped the column many of those images had been summoned from his own memories though he had not taken part in the fighting marcus had seen the aftermath of many battles stepping over corpses severed limbs pools of blood and scattered entrails he had seen long trains of exhausted naked dacian prisoners chained necktoneck with their hands tied being driven to their new lives of slavery he had seen the sack of villages and the rape of women and boys by roman soldiers enjoying the privileges of victors after the terror and exhilaration of battle his father had taught marcus the precepts of apollonius of tyana it was hard to reconcile the ideas of a man who refused to kill an animal with the horrors marcus had witnessed in the war and the fact that the world glorified such horrors marcus had experienced life as a slave it was hard for him to take pride in the enslavement of free men even though their enslavement meant the enrichment of the roman state and of roman citizens like himself the war against dacia had been necessary to secure romas frontiers and had been sanctioned by the gods whose favour was made manifest by auguries and other portents to please jupiter the romans desecrated every temple of the god zalmoxis pulling down his altars smashing his images and obliterating all inscriptions that referred to him the dacians holiest shrine the cave in mount kogaionon where zalmoxis had lived as a mortal had been ruined its interior looted and the entrance filled with rubble zalmoxis must have been a very weak god for he had been powerless to save his followers except in a few remote corners of dacia his worship was now extinct the dacians were an ignorant impious and dangerous people a threat to the danube frontier and with their vast hoard of wealth a menace to roma itself so the legionaries were told as their commanders exhorted them to fight but sometimes it seemed to marcus that the dacians were simply a proud people desperately fighting to save themselves their religion their language and their native land just as the atrocities he had witnessed in the war sometimes caused him distress so marcuss work on the column that commemorated the war sometimes afflicted him with doubts however dazzlingly executed the images on the column were they not a celebration of brute strength and human suffering lets take a closer look shall we said apollodorus who seemed never to be bothered by such thoughts he and marcus mounted the scaffolding they had examined the images many times before yet each time marcus always saw a bit more work to be done the most vexing problem at this late stage was the placement of the miniature swords in numerous places tiny holes had been drilled so that tiny metal swords could be fitted into the hands of the figures on the relief it had been marcuss idea to use this novel effect which gave the sculpture even greater depth especially when seen at a distance unfortunately the artisans responsible for the tedious task of fitting these embellishments had been quite careless and had missed a great many places on the first pass every time marcus inspected the relief he found another area that had been overlooked with individual scenes each blending into the next and more than individual figures perhaps it was not surprising that the workmanship was not always consistent still apollodorus demanded perfection and marcus was determined to meet his expectations as the two men ascended the scaffolds marcus was swept into the encyclopedic history of the war recounted by the images taking thirteen legions more than men into the field trajans campaign had resulted not just in victory but in a cultural annihilation the fortresses of the dacians had been demolished along with their temples and cities facing defeat king decebalus made a last desperate attempt to hide his vast treasure he diverted a river buried trunks of gold and silver in the soft riverbed then returned the river to its course but an informant revealed the secret to the romans and the treasure was recovered hundreds of tons of gold and silver had been seized carted out of dacia under heavy guard and brought to roma there would be more treasure to come for the mines of the dacians had been discovered and dacian slaves had been put to work digging new veins his armies defeated his people enslaved his cities and towns in flames his treasure stolen king decebalus at last killed himself he was discovered sitting upright on a stone bench outside the sealed cave at mount kogaionon wearing his robes of state and surrounded by a great many of his nobles who had all taken poison the body of decebalus was stripped and decapitated the robes were burned the naked headless body was thrown down the rocky mountainside to be consumed by vultures the head was taken to roma by the same speedy messengers who brought news of the wars successful conclusion as the people of roma thronged the forum to celebrate the head of decebalus was displayed on the capitoline hill as proof of the dacians defeat then thrown down the gemonian stairs someone kicked the head into the crowd where it was batted about like a ball until it was dropped on the paving stones the crowd swarmed around it competing with one another to stamp the last remains of king decebalus into the ground when trajan returned to roma he celebrated with an unprecedented days of games at the flavian amphitheatre and at other sites across the city ten thousand gladiators fought eleven thousand animals were slaughtered the scale of these spectacles had never been seen before nor had the scale of his lavish building programme the results of which were to be seen in all directions from the uppermost tier of the scaffolding around the column apollodorus and marcus gazed down at the largest basilica ever built a vast hall revetted with marble and flooded with light an adjoining courtyard the largest open space in the city center was dominated by an enormous statue of trajan on horseback farther away against the cliff face of the excavated quirinal hill a sprawling multistory shopping arcade was being built there was also a gymnasium for sporting competitions and a new bathing complex even grander than the one titus had built on either side of the column directly below them were the two wings of trajans library the wing for latin literature was almost finished and the extravagantly decorated reading room lined with busts of famous authors would soon open to the public the greek wing was still under construction apollodorus who had served as chief architect and designer of these new constructions called them the fruits of dacia as grand as they were none of these buildings approached the height of the column from the topmost scaffold apollodorus and marcus stepped onto the top of the column their view of the city in all directions was virtually unimpeded only the temple of jupiter atop the capitoline loomed higher turning slowly marcus saw his fathers house and the sprawling house of the people on the palatine the flavian amphitheatre and the towering statue of sol at the far end of the forum the cluttered tenements of the subura the hill of gardens and the vast expanse of the field of mars with the bend of the tiber beyond the only manmade object that reached to their level was an enormous crane situated just beyond the greek wing of the library apollodorus pointed to it with a satisfied nod i reworked the last of the calculations last night everything is ready well lift the statue into place today marcus gazed down at the workmen who surrounded the statue of trajan that was to be placed atop the column the men were securing the statue with padded chains and ropes connected to the crane how soon as soon as i can get all the workmen in place here well go down using the stairway inside the column you can observe as i give my final instructions come along pygmalion long ago from the emperor himself apollodorus had learned that pygmalion had once been marcuss name to marcus the name was a reminder of his years as a slave but when apollodorus first used it as a pet name for him he had been too intimidated to object apollodorus clearly intended no malice he seemed to think that the name was a compliment an acknowledgement of marcuss skill as a sculptor as they descended marcus counted each of the steps he always did this all the artisans and workmen practised similar rituals always tying an odd number of knots or using an even number of nails or stepping onto a scaffold with their right foot first they walked to the crane and stood before the gilded bronze statue of trajan apollodorus had executed the basic design but marcus had sculpted most of the finer details including trajans face and hands this had meant spending long stretches of time with the emperor who listened to reports and dictated correspondence while marcus observed him and sculpted his likeness first making preliminary models and then working on the fullscale statue marcus vividly remembered his first meeting with trajan thirteen years ago when his father had petitioned the emperor to recognize marcuss status as a freeborn citizen trajan had seemed larger than life to marcus then and he still did far more accessible was the emperors protege hadrian who had often been present when marcus was sculpting trajans likeness perhaps marcus found the man more approachable because he was closer to marcuss own age hadrian had distinguished himself in the dacian wars commanding the first legion minerva but he also had an avid interest in all things artistic and had strong opinions about everything from the poetry of pindar incomparably beautiful to trajans collection of silver dacian drinking cups unspeakably hideous they should be melted down he was known even to dabble in architecture though none of his fanciful drawings had ever resulted in an actual building hadrian joined them as apollodorus and marcus were making a final inspection to see that the statue was securely fitted for lifting is the operation on schedule asked hadrian well begin at any moment said apollodorus will the emperor be present he intended to be here but affairs of state preclude his presence said hadrian he cracked a smile and lowered his voice actually i suspect hes a bit unnerved by the whole thing i dont think he fancies the idea of seeing himself being hoisted a hundred feet in the air and dangling from a chain perhaps its better that hes not here said apollodorus his presence might make the men nervous hadrian slowly circled the statue then nodded what a clever idea you came up with marcus pinarius to slightly exaggerate and elongate the emperors features so as to make them appear more natural when viewed by spectators on the ground whats the word for that its a trick of perspective called foreshortening said marcus im grateful that you supported my idea lets hope it works caesar was certainly skeptical when he saw the result horrified actually no mans nose is that long not even mine he said it does look a bit of a caricature when seen this close but at a distance of a hundred feet and from a low angle i suspect that nose will actually flatter him the workmen assigned to stand atop the column and guide the placement of the statue were in place they called and waved to apollodorus to signal their readiness the workmen who would operate the various hoists and pulleys of the crane were also at their stations as were the slaves who would supply the labour to pull the ropes turn the winches and steady the counterweights the statue was ready to be lifted apollodorus closed his eyes and muttered a prayer marcus touched the fascinum at his breast apollodorus gave the signal for the operation to begin with a great groaning noise the various parts of the crane began to move the statue cleared the ground and began to ascend the statue rose to half the height of the column and then higher still until it dangled above the column apollodorus peered at all the various mechanisms in play and suddenly seemed nervous marcus run up to the top of the column he said see that everything is done correctly marcus ran to the column stepped inside and bounded up the steps he was so intent on reaching the top that he forgot to count them the workmen atop the column stood in a circle ready to guide the statue into the spot intended for it the outline of which had been drawn with chalk each of the men wore a rope around his waist that was secured to an iron pin driven into the marble to catch them should they fall marcus was not wearing a rope the statue seemed to float on the air nearby twisting slightly so that the gilding reflected sparkles of sunlight then it began slowly to move towards them until it appeared just above their heads the men reached up and touched the base of the statue which then began very slowly to descend their foreman shouted instructions making sure the orientation of the statue remained true as it was lowered into place marcus stayed out of the way crouching to keep his balance the statue was still two feet above the top of the column when marcus heard a sharp noise somewhere a chain had snapped he looked at the statue which swayed a bit he looked at the crane which also seemed to sway very slightly then the crane began to tilt to one side numas balls cried the foreman the statues coming down right now keep it steady the workmen grabbed hold of the statue but they were powerless to guide it any longer as it swung one way and then the other with a tremendous cracking noise part of the crane collapsed as he strove to keep his balance and stay clear of the statue marcus saw in glimpses that a section of the crane was falling and men on the ground were scrambling to get out of the way he experienced a moment of vertigo in which it seemed that the huge statue was stationary while everything else earth sky and the column under his feet was spinning offkilter the statue bumped one of the workmen the movement was relatively small but the weight of the statue lent tremendous force to the slight contact the workman went tumbling backwards paddling his arms in the air he stepped off the column and onto the topmost scaffold but couldnt regain his balance and kept staggering backwards marcus waited for the mans safety rope to stop his fall but the knot at his waist had been poorly tied the man slipped free from the rope and went flying off the scaffold somersaulting backwards his scream pierced the air as he plummeted to the ground there was a sickening sound of impact then a moment of silence then a tremendous crash as the broken section of the crane fell onto the greek wing of the library marcus experienced a moment of sheer panic he imagined the statue swinging ever more wildly out of control knocking off more and more of the workman until it actually struck the column dislodging the top drum throwing the whole column out of balance and causing it to topple over but that was not what happened the statue twisted one way then the other then suddenly dropped and landed with a jarring thud atop the column none of the workmen were harmed and when they took a closer look they were amazed to see that the statue had landed precisely within the chalk outline despite the broken crane the outcome could not have been more perfect for marcus the earth and the sky gradually stopped spinning and all was still he realized that he was clutching the fascinum with his right hand his knuckles were bone white as he slowly unclenched his fist he stepped onto the scaffolding and took stock of the damage below the crane was ruined beyond repair one end of the greek wing of the library was destroyed but that part of the building was unfinished and the repairs would be relatively minor the body of the man who had fallen lay twisted on the paving stones below surrounded by a pool of blood as marcus watched apollodorus and hadrian approached the lifeless body apollodorus gazed down at the corpse for a moment then up at marcus his face was ashen marcus too stunned to speak extended his arm and turned his thumb upwards to signal that all was well atop the column apollodorus looked as if he might faint with relief hadrian took a step back to avoid the spreading pool of blood then stared up at marcus or rather beyond him at the towering statue of trajan the nose he shouted what was hadrian talking about marcus craned his neck to peer up at the statue the gilding reflected the sunlight so brightly that he was blinded he looked down at hadrian and made a quizzical gesture hadrian smiled broadly he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted the nose looks perfect a month later lucius pinarius hosted a small dinner party in honour of his son the column would soon be officially dedicated and in the various celebrations the emperor and his chief architect would be the focus of all attention before that happened lucius wanted to acknowledge his sons accomplishments and tremendous hard work the dinner party was to be a major event for the pinarius household which seldom saw guests outside the small circle of luciuss friends most of whom were advanced in years and fellow followers of apollonius of tyana not a group much given to traditional feasting since they ate no meat and drank no wine no meat had been cooked or served in luciuss house for many years and he could not bring himself to include any sort of flesh fowl or fish on the menu his cook assured him that no one would even notice the omission among the highly spiced delicacies and sumptuous sweets that would be offered but for a dinner party that included a member of the imperial household hadrian had accepted an invitation there would have to be wine lucius never drank wine but marcus occasionally did and lucius had no objection to serving it to his guests if they should be disappointed by the absence of meat he was determined that they would have no cause to be disappointed with the wine he had stocked a variety of what a reputable merchant assured him were the very finest vintages both greek and italian for such an occasion his son informed him there must be a scurra among the guests no memorable social occasion could take place among the elite of the city without a scurra to amuse them apparently there existed an entire class of such persons in the city men who literally made their way by their wit a scurra cadged dinner invitations to the homes of the wealthy and in return shared gossip told jokes injected double entendres into the conversation flattered the host and gently mocked the guests and where on earth will i find such a person lucius had asked his son quite certain there were no scurras among the staid acolytes of the teacher apollodorus says hell bring someone a fellow named favonius said marcus apollodorus had also invited the director of the imperial archives a man in his forties named gaius suetonius who had learned that the elder pinarius had known nero and his longvanished circle and was eager to meet him after many days of preparation the appointed hour arrived the guests appeared in quick succession and were shown to their dining couches the house was filled with the steady hum of conversation and laughter the scurra showed his worth early on favonius had frizzled red hair plump cheeks and a peculiar nose that skewed to one side from his protruding belly it appeared that he loved food and seldom missed a meal when it became evident that no meat would be served favonius pretended to pout i see were to be served a gladiators diet tonight no meat just barley and beans ah well thank the gods that gladiators are allowed to drink wine both lucius and marcus were taken aback by the mans rudeness but everyone else laughed and not another word was said all night about the lack of meat or fish the scurras blatant complaint forestalled any further grumbling instead the guests vied with one another to praise the cooks skill and ingenuity hadrian and suetonius engaged lucius in conversation the archivist was curious to learn anything about nero while hadrian wanted to know every detail of his hosts friendship with apollonius of tyana epictetus and dio of prusa marcus noticed that apollodorus stayed largely out of the conversation it seemed to him that there was some tension between the architect and hadrian who had always been on friendly terms hadrian excused himself to go to the latrina as soon as he was out of sight the scurra grunted i do believe that fellow has lost his provincial accent entirely i was just thinking the same thing said lucius when he first came to roma i seem to recall that his accent was quite pronounced you recall correctly said favonius people still talk about the occasion early in trajans reign when hadrian read one of the emperors speeches aloud to the senate and the senators laughed out loud hadrian blushed so brightly you couldnt even see his acne scars hadrians worked very hard to get rid of his accent and i think hes succeeded said suetonius whose own diction was elegant to the point of pedantry apollodorus who was from damascus and whose latin had its own provincial accent shook his head he now sounds so much like a cityborn roman that trajan has stopped calling him the little greek he calls him the little roman favonius tittered oh dear i am going to have to steal that one from you its not a joke insisted apollodorus its the truth when hadrian returned the entire company fell silent hadrian took the opportunity to steer the conversation back to dio of prusa whose latest writings had been much concerned with the subject of marriage happily restored to his native city dio also seemed to be quite happily married and expressed his contentment by extolling the virtues of marital union above all other forms of love the topic cheered no one lucius pinarius had known love but never marriage apollodoruss wife had been very ill lately and thoughts of her only made him gloomy hadrian had been married for several years to trajans grandniece sabina but their marriage was childless and thought by many to be in name only as for marcus his irregular origins a subject never openly discussed by those who knew him but apparently known to all had made it difficult for him to find a match suited to his familys ancient name and patrician status not yet married and with no immediate prospects he had given up thoughts of creating a family and devoted himself entirely to his work the scurra seeing the gloominess caused by the subject managed to crack a few crude jokes about marriage but these seemed forced and stale it was suetonius who rescued the conversation as a sidelight to his work as an archivist he was a dedicated antiquarian and amateur historian and kept a notebook dedicated especially to anecdotes about imperial marriages he amused them at length with stories about the duel of wits between livia and augustus caligulas socalled marriages to his sisters claudiuss misery with messalina and his agony with agrippina and neros marriage to the beautiful but illfated poppaea followed by his betrothal to her double the equally illfated sporus you must have known sporus said suetonius looking at their host lucius made no answer for a long moment yes i did he finally said was the eunuch as beautiful as they say asked hadrian yes she was said lucius lowering his eyes the others waited for him to elaborate but instead he said shall we retire to the garden carry your cups with you i shall be serving a special wine from samothrace with a jasmine flavour that emerges only under moonlight so the merchant assured me as they stepped into the garden hadrian came to a sudden halt he stared at the statue of melancomas marcus had noticed that visitors were often a bit startled by the image of the naked boxer probably because it stood at ground level and was so extraordinarily realistic that a casual observer might mistake it for a living man but hadrians reaction went beyond mere surprise his face was lit with wonder and delight he reached out to touch the smooth marble of the statues face a moment later he stepped back and touched his own cheek running his fingertips over the rough mottled blemishes melancomas said lucius yes ive seen other images of him but none that could match this one said hadrian unable to take his eyes from the statue they say melancomas was beloved by the divine titus lucky titus if only someday i could meet a youth as beautiful as this marcus smiled if only someday i could create a statue as beautiful as this favonius stepped between them and tilted an eyebrow at each in turn may each of you be granted his desire and be happy with it apollodorus joined them he was a bit drunker than the rest for apollodorus the evening was a rare break from months of unceasing labour and he had imbibed a considerable quantity of the fine vintages on offer seeing that they were all gazing at the statue he nodded ah the melancomas superb without a doubt the most beautiful and most valuable thing in the house he looked from marcus to hadrian look at the two of you spellbound but for rather different reasons i suspect which of you is truly pygmalion and which is the little greek it seems to me that marcus here is more the pure connoisseur the greekling who loves art for its own sake and you hadrian are the lover who longs to see a statue brought to life perhaps we should call you pygmalion favonius laughed but marcus was not amused being called pygmalion in private was one thing but hearing his old slave name used in front of others rankled him nor was hadrian amused he looked quietly furious and the acne scars across his cheeks turned bright red again marcus was puzzled by the tension between the two men favonius who missed nothing saw the look on marcuss face and drew him aside as they strolled to the far end of the garden the scurra spoke in a low voice are you not aware of the tiff between those two marcus wrinkled his brow the scurras eyes lit up there was nothing that gave favonius greater pleasure than the chance to deliver fresh gossip everyones talking about it where have you been the last couple of days helping my father plan this party said marcus ah then you havent heard about the meeting caesar had with apollodorus about the reconstruction of the greek wing of the library i know about that it was two days ago but you werent there i wont be involved until the time comes to decorate the interior i see the scurra nodded knowingly well it so happens that hadrian did attend that meeting as he often does but this time he put forward some plans of his own what sort of plans apollodorus was explaining to caesar how long it will take to finish the repairs to the greek wing when hadrian interrupted and proposed that the wing should have a dome on it the man is crazy for domes and produced some very elaborate drawings and plans which he insisted they both look at but such an idea isnt possible the latin and greek wings are intended to be symmetrical and the latin wing has no dome thats exactly what apollodorus said whereupon hadrian said thats why i propose to remodel the latin wing and give it a dome as well apparently he has some idea that a dome is absolutely necessary for such a building something about letting in light from the ceiling he produced another drawing to show how the library would look if both wings had a dome with the column rising up between them and apparently trajan rather liked the notion marcus raised his eyebrows thinking of all the time and effort such a scheme would entail how did apollodorus react apparently he was absolutely scathing you know hes not afraid to be outspoken when it comes to such things even as hadrian was expounding on the beauty of his domes apollodorus pointed at the drawings and turned up his nose what are these supposed to look like he said two swollen testes flanking the upright column well once that image is in your mind you cant picture it any other way can you these bulbous monstrosities not only spoil the overall symmetry of the whole forum he says but theyll collapse even before theyre completed to which hadrian made some crack about that unfortunate business with the broken crane whereupon apollodorus looked him straight in the eyes and said its one thing to draw your fantasy young man another to actually build it be off now and draw your giant gourds elsewhere caesar and i have a lot to talk about and you understand nothing of these matters trajan let him speak that way to his own cousin the emperor gives apollodorus a very long leash as you know at least in matters to do with art and architecture he trusts his judgement implicitly whereas hadrian when all is said and done is still the little greek an overeducated dabbler who would do better to concentrate on his military career and leave art to the hirelings who create it for the pleasure of their betters hadrian was crushed he gathered up his precious drawings and stalked off practically in tears oh dear but now weve come full circle and there they are still staring at that statue and not saying a word to each other marcus tried to think of a new topic for discussion what word hadrian about this expedition being mounted by the emperor against parthia the question seemed to draw hadrian out of a trance he smiled im to go with him it seems ill finally see the cities of the east perhaps even ctesiphon he alluded to the capital of parthia not content with the conquest of dacia trajan had been seized by an even grander conceit to fulfill the repeatedly thwarted roman ambition that went back to the days of julius caesar to follow in the footsteps of alexander the great and expand romas empire eastward into the realms of ancient persia lucius pinarius who had joined his guests in the garden cleared his throat of course theres no real strategic purpose for inciting such a war except that the parthians present the only empire in the world to rival that of roma i should think theres every reason to conquer them said favonius or rather the only reason there ever is for a war wealth to plunder the dacians were the last neighbour left on the edges of the empire who actually possessed anything worth taking beyond our provinces on the northern coast of africa lies a trackless desert beyond egypt lies a land of savage troglodytes and impassable jungles the northern part of the island of britannia is a frigid wasteland and the realms beyond germania and dacia seem to be completely uncivilized inhabited by such foul barbarians that theyre not even worth taking as slaves there is india of course and beyond that the kingdom of serica the land of silk which surely must be wealthy but the world beyond the indus river is so remote that hardly any roman has ever traveled there except for a few intrepid merchants within our reach only parthia and its satellite kingdoms remain to be conquered and the wealth of its empire must be staggering as will be the challenge of taking it said hadrian even the flavians at their most ambitious never dreamed of such a thing but caesar is ready for the challenge you wont be going will you marcus said lucius with a slight quaver in his voice no father the emperor has decided that apollodorus and i should remain here in roma apollodorus nodded im compiling a handbook of designs for siege engines and such for the emperor to take with him and training some of my best engineers for the expedition but theres still a great deal of work to be done on caesars grand building projects here in the city and whom could he possibly leave in charge but myself naturally he looks to someone with experience someone who knows how to get things done in strict accordance with his own high standards his boasting seemed to marcus a deliberate attempt to needle hadrian after another swallow of wine apollodorus spoke to hadrian directly but while pygmalion and i stay here in the city to finish the projects im sure youll manage to kill a parthian or two little greek and like every conqueror youll find its easier to demolish buildings and strip their ornaments than to put one up in the first place hadrian blushed furiously apollodorus laughed and held out his cup for more wine did he not realize how deeply he had offended hadrian did he not care lucius stepped forward caesar shows great trust to keep you here in roma apollodorus and you must have great trust in marcus to keep him here with you no one else has the skill to finish the interior decorations of the greek wing of the library for one thing said apollodorus looking askance at hadrian im gratified to hear you say that said lucius because as our evening together draws to a close i wish to remind you of the reason for this occasion to honour my son for all hes accomplished in recent months i ask you to drink a toast raise your cups please to marcus pinarius the best son a man could ever hope for to marcus pinarius said the rest except for apollodorus who shouted sounding quite drunk to pygmalion as soon as the toast was finished hilarion entered and spoke in luciuss ear lucius hurried to apollodorus your daughter is in the vestibule he said quietly hilarion invited her to the garden but she wouldnt come apparently shes quite upset your wife has taken a turn for the worse apollodorus looking suddenly sober drew a deep breath and left them without a word the guests began to amble out of the garden until no one was left except marcus and hadrian who stood gazing at the statue of melancomas and rubbing his chin marcus interpreted the gesture to mean that hadrian was brooding or lost in thought then realized that the man was once again touching the acne scars that disfigured his otherwise handsome face while the guests said their farewells to his father marcus proceeded to the vestibule where apollodorus was having a hushed conversation with his daughter marcus had met apollodora when he first began working for her father she had been a mere child then he had not seen her since as hilarion opened the door for apollodorus and his daughter to make their exit apollodora looked back at marcus for a moment he was startled to see what a beauty she had grown into with her lustrous dark hair shimmering skin and enormous eyes later when he went to bed marcus fell asleep thinking about her lucius pinarius claimed that wine disturbed sleep and that this was yet another reason to avoid it perhaps it was the wine that caused marcuss strange dreams that night his pleasant thoughts about apollodoruss daughter vanished as he fell asleep he was back in dacia a village was in flames as if he were a bird he followed a boy with unkempt hair and ragged clothes who ran through the narrow streets laughing and making obscene noises roman soldiers pursued him the boy tripped over a dead body threaded his way through jumbled ruins leaped over raging flames suddenly he reached a dead end he was trapped he screamed but there were plenty of other people screaming in the village he was just one more suddenly marcus became the boy the soldiers converged on him he was tiny and they were huge looming above him in darkness so that he could not see their faces a giant hand reached for him marcus had experienced this dream before or dreams much like it always this was the point at which he would awaken shivering and covered with sweat but this time he seemed to fall even deeper into the dream the leering soldiers vanished as did the ruins of the village all was suffused with a golden light hovering before him was a beautiful naked youth he reminded marcus of the statue of melancomas but this being was so radiantly beautiful that he seemed more than human was he a god the youth regarded him with an expression of such tenderness and compassion that marcus was suddenly close to tears the youth reached towards him he whispered do not fear i will save you then marcus woke his room was lit by the first faint glow of dawn he reached for the coverlet he had thrown off during his nightmare and pulled it to his chin the warmth comforted him but it was the lingering impression of the dream that filled him with an exquisite sense of wellbeing he had never experienced such a feeling before a certainty that somewhere in the universe there existed a power that was perfect and loving that would shield him from all evil in the world who was the divine youth of his dream there had been nothing to identify him as one of the familiar gods of olympus was he apollonius of tyana who often visited marcuss father in dreams marcus didnt think so surely apollonius would have shown himself as marcus had always heard him described an old man with a white beard was he a manifestation of the divine singularity of which marcuss father spoke perhaps but it seemed to marcus that the youth in his dream was a completely new being never before seen by anyone in this world he had shown himself to marcus and to marcus alone as the afterglow of the dream began to fade marcus tried to remember the face of the youth he even tried to draw him reaching for the stylus and wax tablet he kept at his bedside but he found it impossible to recapture the features the face marcus drew was only a rough approximation that gave no hint of his unearthly perfection perhaps the youth was nothing more than a creation of marcuss imagination and yet the dream had seemed more real than waking life marcus was convinced that this being came from a place outside himself a world that was unimaginably vast and beautiful and full of wonder ad trajan was dead four years of campaigning in the east had yielded a series of conquests including the capture of ctesiphon and the subjugation of much of the parthian empire armenia was made a roman province expanding romas empire to the shores of the hyrcanian sea as were mesopotamia and assyria which included the fabled city of babylon and the tigris and euphrates rivers giving roma direct access to the persian gulf and control of all imports from india and serica including silk trajan sent a letter to the senate in which he declared that his mission was accomplished he regretted only that he was too old to follow the example of alexander and march all the way to india in fact throughout the campaigns he often displayed the vigour of a man half his age marching on foot and fording swift rivers alongside his soldiers who worshipped him like a god then even as scattered rebellions broke out in the newly conquered territories trajan fell ill his condition became so grave that plotina who was with him persuaded him to set sail for roma he did not get far off the coast of cilicia he suffered a paralyzing stroke then was afflicted with a dropsy that caused parts of his body to swell to enormous size further travel was impossible and the imperial fleet made harbour at the small port city of selinus trajan died there at the age of sixtyfour ending a twentyyear reign that had added unprecedented wealth and territory to the empire hadrian serving as governor of syria was declared emperor he had arrived in roma some days ago but as yet he had been seen by only a handful of people this was to be the day of his public debut as emperor with a triumphal procession to celebrate the stupendous conquests in the east the triumph would not be for hadrian but in posthumous honour of the divine trajan in preparation for the triumph marcus and apollodorus had been very busy the entire route of the procession had to be decorated with pennants and wreaths as did various temples and altars all over the city viewing stands had to be erected near the column where the procession would reach its climax stage sets had to be designed for the plays that would be produced in the days ahead decorations had to be made for a great many banquets large and small apollodorus had been summoned for a private audience the first day hadrian arrived and had been in daily contact with him ever since marcus working under apollodorus had not yet seen the new emperor the hour was early the city had not yet begun to stir but apollodorus and marcus and their workers had already been up for hours labouring by torchlight to ready the triumphal route the procession was only a few hours away they stood near the column surveying the brightly coloured streamers that had been affixed to the viewing stands in the utterly still air the streamers hung as limp as shrouds but with the slightest breeze they would snap to life their undulations adding excitement and colour to the acclamations of the crowd marcus threw back his head opened his mouth wide and yawned did you get any sleep at all last night said apollodorus last night its not dawn yet this is still yesterday apollodorus laughed youre babbling pygmalion did you go to bed early as i told you to yes but marcus was about to say my wife went to bed with me which meant i got no sleep at all but since his wife was apollodoruss daughter he restrained himself apollodorus nevertheless read his thought the two had worked together for so long that each usually knew what the other was thinking and smiled indulgently the relationship between apollodora and marcus had grown gradually with a long courtship that had given both of their fathers a chance to get used to the idea apollodorus was aware of marcuss irregular origins but marriage into such an ancient patrician family was a great honour for the daughter of a damascene greek for lucius pinarius the match had seemed far below his sons station but marcus clearly loved the girl and when lucius asked himself what would apollonius of tyana do always his test for making a difficult decision he enthusiastically approved the union the marriage was a happy one so far there had been no children but not for lack of trying as marcus made clear with another yawn and a dreamy smile i never thought id see this day declared apollodorus gazing at the cleaners who were sweeping the empty square soon to be thronged with people the day wed celebrate a triumph over the parthians said marcus no the day hadrian would ride through the streets of roma as caesar he still seems a boy to me i suppose i thought trajan would live forever so did trajan apparently said marcus even towards the end when he was paralyzed and puffed up like an arabian adder they say he refused to make a will some say he wanted to die without naming a successor in imitation of alexander the great how did hadrian become emperor it was all plotinas doing said apollodorus not that hadrian wasnt the obvious choice but it was plotina who assured his legitimacy she told everyone that her husband had adopted hadrian with his very last breath and she rallied her loyal courtiers to support hadrian at every turn some say plotina must be in love with hadrian and the two were carrying on an affair behind trajans back is that likely apollodorus laughed knowing hadrian what do you think i suspect plotinas affection for him is more of the maternal variety dont you oh im sure shes infatuated with him and has been for a very long time in the way an older woman may be smitten by a younger man but that doesnt mean their relationship is carnal i suppose hadrian will be heading off to war as soon as this triumph is over said marcus why do you say that ive heard that a great many of the newly conquered cities are in revolt insurgencies threaten to undo all those lightningquick conquests made by trajan hadrian will have to go back and reconquer everything to keep it from being lost or maybe not said apollodorus i was talking to him yesterday you understand this is absolutely confidential soninlaw when he was serious apollodorus tended to address marcus as soninlaw rather than as pygmalion hadrian says the new provinces in the east are untenable he says trajan overreached not only are the conquered territories in revolt but the jews are making trouble again theyve staged bloody riots in alexandria and cyrene and theres open warfare on the island of cyprus tens of thousands have died according to hadrian suppressing the jews is far more important than holding on to ctesiphon so instead of pouring soldiers and treasure into a perpetual war to hold the new eastern provinces he wants to cede the more troublesome areas to potentates beholden to roma creating a string of client states along a more defensible eastern frontier it sounds like he must have given the situation a great deal of thought even before he became emperor i suspect he did you know hadrian never at a loss for an opinion whatever the subject marcus frowned so here we are about to celebrate a triumph for the very conquests hadrian is about to give up apollodorus laughed ironic isnt it but you and i have done our job weve decorated the city just as splendidly as if hadrian intended to hold those provinces for a thousand years the first rays of the sun struck the top of the column the statue of trajan seemed to burst into golden flames time to go home and change into our best togas said apollodorus marcus nodded and yawned he closed his eyes dont you dare fall asleep when you get home pygmalion or youll miss the triumph and dont do the other thing either unless you and apollodora intend to make a baby this time apollodorus laughed heartily and slapped marcus on the back startling him into wakefulness even as he was about to fall asleep on his feet will your father be coming marcus felt a twinge of anxiety at the mention of his father and was abruptly wide awake no he wont be able to come he hasnt been well lately in fact lucius pinarius who was now seventy had been bedridden for a month troubled by lightheadedness and a weakness in his legs hilarion who had also grown quite frail in recent years was always at his old masters side often reading aloud to him the letters lucius had received from apollonius of tyana who continued to visit lucius regularly in his dreams by his bedside as a reminder that death was nothing to fear lucius kept the iron manacle that had been cast off by apollonius just as apollonius had been able to cast off his shackles so lucius anticipated the moment when his soul would cast off its earthly frame to rise up and merge with the divine singularity a few hours later under a cloudless sky and a bright sun marcus awaited the arrival of the triumphal procession apollodorus greeted by an acquaintance had drawn a little distance away taking apollodora with him so that marcus stood unaccompanied in the crowd long before the parade arrived at the column he heard the thunderous reactions of the multitude along the route that wound through the city the sound of cheering grew nearer until at last the vanguard of trumpeters came into sight they were followed by the magistrates and senators in their redbordered togas some chatting casually as if unimpressed by all the pomp while others carried themselves with all the dignity of their offices then came the white bulls on their way to be sacrificed at the temple of jupiter atop the capitoline followed by countless carts and wagons loaded high with the spoils of war paintings and models of captured cities including ctesiphon babylon and susa and a great many captives in rags and chains including some of the petty monarchs who had been deposed by trajan at last preceded by lictors brandishing fasces wreathed with laurel the triumphal chariot arrived trajan had been famed for making his first entrance as emperor into the city on foot on this day his effigy rode alongside hadrian in the chariot the effigy was made of wax modelled and coloured to look astonishingly lifelike there was no need to make it larger than life for trajan in the flesh had towered above other men inevitably the question arises which of those two in the chariot is suffer said a voice in marcuss ear he turned to see favonius with the scurra was suetonius the director of the imperial archives raised an eyebrow i think our new emperor looks unusually relaxed and animated he quipped look there how hadrian smiles and salutes the crowd no wait im looking the effigy of trajan i dont think hadrian likes to be stared at said marcus who had to admit that the new emperor looked distinctly uncomfortable standing next to the smiling waxen image of his predecessor they say vespasian found his triumph so tedious that he was bored to tears said suetonius theres a letter of his in the archives where he writes what an old fool i was to demand such a gruelling honour who can tell what our new emperor is thinking with that beard concealing his face said favonius the beard has everyone talking suetonius have we ever before had an emperor with a beard suetonius considered one sees images of nero wearing a partial beard with his cheeks and chin cleanshaven but a full beard no hadrian is the first do you suppose he wants to remind us that he fancies himself a philosopher said favonius or is he affecting the unkempt look of the common soldiers who never shave while on campaign as can be seen by all those images of bearded romans killing dacians on the column over there his facial hair looks impeccably groomed to me said marcus not every man can grow such a fine beard i think the emperor looks quite handsome this way it seemed to him that hadrians motivation was obvious a beard was a way to cover the acne scars about which he was so selfconscious as trajans protege hadrian felt obliged to maintain the cleanshaven look favoured by countless generations of the roman elite but now he was emperor and would do as he pleased even grow a beard this time next year said favonius i predict a majority of senators and practically every courtier in the house of the people will have a beard even the old eunuchs left over from the days of titus will be sporting beards if they have to paste them on indeed the only men without beards will be the young ones who want to attract caesars attention said suetonius the chariot drew alongside the base of the column and came to a halt hadrian stepped from the car bearing a funerary urn so hes actually going to do it said favonius hadrian is going to deposit the old mans ashes in the base of his column thats the plan said marcus who had been responsible for preparing the small vault that would receive the urn it required an act of the senate to make such a thing legal noted suetonius until now the remains of all the emperors have been interred in sarcophagi outside the old city walls but hadrian was determined that trajans column should also serve as trajans tomb favonius gazed up at the column in his final resting place trajan shall remain upright and erect for all time i envy the old fellow joined by plotina hadrian deposited the urn in the chamber then hadrian delivered a eulogy reciting trajans accomplishments not only as a builder and a military man but as a friend of the people and the senate of roma trajan had kept his vow to kill no senators during his reign a vow that hadrian repeated and one of his proudest achievements was his expansion of nervas welfare system for orphans and the children of the poor which hadrian promised to continue but of course said hadrian on this day we celebrate his triumphs in the field and in particular the conquests for which the senate saw fit to vote him the title parthicus we celebrate his victories over many foes and his capture of many cities nisibis and batnae adenystrae and babylon artaxata and edessa hadrian continued in this singsong vein his rhetorical style was surprisingly dull perhaps he was tired or nervous for he frequently reached up to tug at his beard and every so often marcus heard a hint of his old spanish accent favonius sighed hes merely reciting a catalog and leaving out the juicy details thats like serving bones with no meat do you know the story of trajans encounter with king abgarus of osroene marcus shrugged he was about to tell the scurra to hush when suetonius leaned in ive heard one version but i should love to hear yours favonius the scurras eyes lit up well im not sure where osroene is but it sounds terribly exotic it was one of those little kingdoms in the ancient land of mesopotamia said suetonius the capital was edessa which is not far from the upper reaches of the euphrates geography was never my strong point admitted favonius anyway king abgarus was frightened to death of both the romans and the parthians like a chicken caught between a fox and a wolf and whenever one or the other tried to approach him for talks he scuttled off in a panic so for the longest time while trajan was in the vicinity and trying to meet with him abgarus ignored every summons and stayed out of sight hoping the romans would simply go away but when someone told him about trajans love of boys abgarus heaved a sigh of relief for the most beautiful boy in all the east by general consensus happened to be his own son prince arbandes trajan had finally given up on meeting the king and was moving on leaving behind one of his generals with instructions to sack edessa when abgarus and his royal entourage sped after trajan and caught up with him at the border that night beside the road abgarus put up a huge tent and threw a sumptuous banquet for trajan and whom did he seat on the pillow next to caesar but young prince arbandes trajan was utterly smitten rumour has it he wrote a coded letter to hadrian in which he proclaimed i have met the most beautiful boy ever born to cap the evening abgarus had his son perform some barbaric dance for trajans amusement what happened after the banquet we can only imagine but apparently arbandess dancingboy diplomacy was effective because trajan spared the city of edessa and let abgarus keep his throne as a roman puppet suetonius frowned but wasnt that abgarus we saw earlier in chains trudging along with the other monarchs deposed by trajan ah yes the kings fortunes later took a turn for the worse after trajan conquered babylonia and was sailing down the euphrates to have a look at the persian gulf word arrived that a revolt had broken out in osroene king abgarus blamed parthian instigators and jewish insurgents but when trajans general lusius quietus and his bareheaded berber cavalry arrived to put down the revolt edessa was sacked and abgarus was deposed thus we saw abgarus paraded before us in chains today what happened to prince arbandes said marcus thats a good question said favonius he wasnt among the prisoners a pretty puppy would have stood out among those mangy old dogs given trajans laudable practice of educating his boys after he was done with them im betting arbandes was given a tutor and sent off to some academy in greece or perhaps hell perform his savage dance for hadrian at tonights banquet the scurra was being facetious the fate of arbandes was of no interest to him the boys history merely provided material for a salacious tale marcus remembering all the suffering he had seen in dacia felt a stirring of pity for the dancing prince who had done everything he could to save his fathers kingdom hadrian had arrived at the end of the eulogy and was reciting all the late emperors titles including dacicus conqueror of dacia germanicus conqueror of germania and of course parthicus but of all the titles bestowed on him by the grateful people and senate of roma the one of which he was most proud was the one which had never been bestowed before optimus best of all emperors sensing that the speech was at an end the crowd reacted with loud cheering it was impossible to tell whether the cries of hail caesar were for trajan or for hadrian it was suetonius who stepped forward and acclaimed the new emperor by name hail hadrian long may he reign this cry was taken up by others hadrian who looked as uncomfortable as ever receiving their accolades but who had witnessed suetoniuss initiative cast a grateful nod in the archivists direction during a lull in the cheering favonius who by the glint in his eye thought he had come up with something clever stepped forward and shouted hail hadrian may he be luckier than augustus may he be better than trajan suetonius pursed his lips at such a bold proclamation luckier than the luckiest better than the best hear hear he loudly repeated the phrase and so did many others may he be luckier than augustus people shouted may he be better than trajan marcus gazed at the new emperor who appeared to be genuinely touched by the outpouring of goodwill but even amid the jubilation marcus saw hadrian touch his face to others the emperor might appear to be stroking his beard as thoughtful philosophers do but marcus knew the man was thinking of the scars hidden beneath when marcus and apollodora arrived home that evening hilarion met them at the door with tears in his eyes marcus rushed to his fathers room lucius pinarius had grown so thin in recent months that his body seemed hardly to press on the bed at all his arms were folded across his chest his eyes were closed there was a smile on his face it happened while he was asleep said hilarion i came to look in on him i knew the moment i stepped into the room i held a mirror before his nostrils and saw there was no breath marcus touched the fascinum at his breast he gazed around the room wondering if his fathers spirit lingered or if it had already flitted off to join apollonius and merge with the divine singularity he looked at his fathers face and began to weep he would never hear his fathers voice again he would never know the name of his mother ad on a brisk autumn day marcus and apollodorus found themselves engaged in one of the most challenging enterprises they had ever faced they were moving the colossus originally the towering statue of nero stood in the courtyard of the golden house it was left in place when the courtyard was demolished by vespasian who remodelled the features so that the sun god sol no longer resembled nero for decades the statue stood with its back to the flavian amphitheatre dominating the southern end of the ancient forum and gazing over the rooftops of temples and offices of state towards the capitoline hill hadrian had decided to build a vast new temple on the site to make room for it the colossus would have to be moved the project was especially important to the emperor because he was designing the new temple himself apollodorus had not even been allowed to see the plans your task is merely to relocate the colossus hadrian told apollodorus one sunny day as they surveyed the site i want the statue to be placed much closer to the amphitheatre here ill show you the spot when apollodorus saw the location he expressed reservations the area around the amphitheatre is already congested on game days putting the colossus here will make the problem worse and theres a question of proportion having the statue so close to the amphitheatre throws both structures out of scale the viewer who sees them from a distance will find the contrast quite displeasing rather than clutter up this area on the contrary hadrian had snapped this open area is exactly the right spot to accommodate the statue in fact i see room for two such statues two caesar i intend to construct a new statue as a companion to the colossus equally as tall but where will you put such a thing right over there in a spot equidistant between the amphitheatre the colossus of sol and my new temple of venus and roma i think it must be a statue of luna so the two statues together will pay homage to the sun and moon does that not please your sense of balance apollodorus frowned in a religious sense perhaps but aesthetically i want you to design this new statue apollodorus the style should match that of sol of course but ill be interested to see what innovations you come up with i realize that such a project is as much an engineering challenge as an artistic one we mustnt have the goddess losing an arm or tumbling into rubble when theres an earthquake as happened to the colossus of rhodes the statue nero built has stood the test of time so as you move it i suggest you take the opportunity to study the way it was cast and assembled and learn whatever secrets you can about its construction the prospect of such a commission the creation of a statue equal in size to the colossus silenced all apollodoruss objections until that point he had considered his work on trajans column the crowning achievement of his career but the luna colossus would eclipse all his other accomplishments this was apollodoruss opportunity to create a work of art that would endure for eternity in the meantime the challenge was to move the colossus of sol the distance to be traversed was not great only a few hundred feet and the ground was flat and paved the entire way the area had been cleared of spectators first the colossus was hoisted by three cranes just high enough for a conveyance on rollers to be placed underneath the upright statue was gently lowered onto the conveyance the ropes were left attached and were pulled taut by teams of men on all sides to keep the statue steady as it was moved a team of twentyfour elephants was harnessed to the conveyance at apollodoruss signal the elephant trainer drove the team forward the rollers creaked under the strain the taut ropes sang as if plucked the elephants brandished their tusks and trumpeted marcus watched the procedure with a tremor of anxiety the neardisaster that had occurred when the statue of trajan was set atop his column was still vivid in his memory this project was if anything even more ambitious and the possibility of disaster given the proximity of the amphitheatre was even greater despite careful planning and scrupulous attention to detail unknown factors were in play chief among them the uneven distribution of weight within the colossus and the volatile temperament of elephants merely to relocate the colossus said a voice behind him it was apollodorus who stood with his arms crossed gazing up intently at the statue as it lumbered forward whats that said marcus the emperors instructions to me your task is merely to relocate the colossus ha compared to this designing a new temple would be childs play hes probably up there right now sketching gourds to plop down on top of his temple marcus glanced at the palatine hill on a balcony high up in the house of the people hadrian and some of his courtiers stood watching their progress i overheard a joke told by one of the workmen today said apollodorus never taking his eyes off the statue how did it go said marcus the fellow said what will they call it if the colossus goes tumbling into the flavian amphitheatre marcus shuddered at the thought what will they call it neros revenge marcus gave a dry laugh he nervously fingered the fascinum and whispered a prayer not to the ancient god the talisman represented but to the radiant youth who had first appeared to him on the night of the dinner party in his honour and since then had frequently visited him in dreams always the youth brought marcus a sense of wellbeing and tranquility yet never did he reveal his name he only said what he always said do not fear i will save you the colossus moved forward steadily marcus tried to imagine the astounding sight presented to hadrian and to everyone else watching from a distance to whom it must appear that a giant was striding slowly through the city at last the statue reached the spot from which it was to be hoisted into its new location again it was lifted skywards and then slowly carefully with utmost precision it was lowered onto its new base a cheer went up from the workers the operation had been carried out without a hitch marcus sighed with relief he turned to his fatherinlaw who was grinning blithely as if there had never been any possibility of error no revenge for nero today said marcus later that night marcus and his fatherinlaw with apollodora quietly celebrated the days good fortune with a dinner at marcuss house it was still a bit difficult for marcus to think of the house as his rather than as the house of his father marcus had been the sole heir to his fathers estate and was one of the few pinarii left in roma the ancient patrician family had dwindled to a handful of scattered cousins a fact that lent a special urgency to marcuss desire for a son to carry his name apollodorus seemed to read his thoughts any news from the two of you he said looking at marcus and then at his daughter apollodora averted her eyes and blushed as she always did when questioned on the matter apollodorus shrugged the world needs fresh blood as the older generation passes away do you know who just died your fathers old friend dio of prusa when did you hear this said marcus earlier today after we moved the colossus suetonius happened to pass by and he gave me the news truly that does mark the passing of a generation said marcus quietly his father and almost all his fathers closest friends were gone even hilarion was gone he had died of a sudden illness the preceding winter surviving his old master by little more than a year one generation passes and another takes its place said apollodorus its a new age with hadrian at the helm all sorts of changes are afoot imagine an emperor who fancies himself an architect he shook his head and emptied his wine cup to be sure there are those who speak ill of the emperor said marcus who only a handful of malcontents said apollodorus since hadrian had instructed him to proceed with preliminary sketches of the luna colossus apollodorus would not hear a word against him im thinking of the senators who were put to death at the outset of his reign in contravention of his vow said marcus among the alleged conspirators had been lusius quietus the despoiler of edessa perhaps they were indeed plotting to kill the emperor and deserved their sentences but still the emperor never broke his vow said apollodorus at least not technically what he actually said was that he would punish no senators without the express consent of the senate and in fact a majority of the senate voted in favour of the executions still the appearance really pygmalion any hard feelings that resulted from that unfortunate turn of events were more than made up for by the goodwill caesar garnered when he lit that bonfire of promissory notes in the courtyard of trajans forum wholesale debt relief to those who owed money to the state what an idea some said the treasury would go bankrupt and the economy would come to a standstill noted marcus instead that bonfire had the opposite effect confidence was restored and everyone began to spend again the new tax revenues have more than made up for the debts that were forgiven the emperor showed his own willingness to contribute to the public coffers when he melted down the famous shield of minerva that glorified silver serving dish created by vitellius all the subsequent emperors had been afraid to touch the thing even trajan they took it seriously as a sacred offering to the goddess but when hadrian was reviewing the imperial holdings he took one look at the shield declared it inconceivable that any goddess would care to have such a hideous thing consecrated to her and ordered the shield to be melted down they say he was able to mint enough coinage to pay an entire legion oh hes a clever fellow our hadrian for the rest of the evening apollodorus continued to dominate the conversation fulsomely praising the emperor marcus almost preferred the old days when his fatherinlaw had aimed an occasional barb at hadrian and then praising his own accomplishments his enthusiasm fuelled by his continuous consumption of wine marcus was indulgent if any man deserved to boast a bit and drink to his hearts content it was apollodorus who had achieved something truly remarkable that day with the successful relocation of the colossus at length though marcus and apollodora offered him a bed for the night apollodorus departed for his house he said he wanted to work on the sketches for the luna statue in his private study marcus suspected he would fall into a drunken sleep before he picked up a stylus the house seemed very quiet after apollodorus had left marcus took a stroll under starlight in the garden and paused to gaze at the statue of melancomas he was a lucky man to own such a thing the emperor himself occasionally dropped by just to sit alone in the garden and admire it the statue almost but not quite captured the image of the divine being who visited marcus in his dreams occasionally marcus considered sculpting his dreamgod so far the demands of his work had prevented him from doing so or so he told himself in truth marcus was afraid to make the attempt fearful that he would will fall short of capturing the perfection of the divine youth perhaps one day he would be ready apollodora joined him in the garden she put her hand in his husband i have something to tell you he looked in her eyes and let out a gasp but why didnt you tell me earlier i wanted you to know before anyone else including my father i decided to wait until he left well tell him tomorrow a child our child youre sure im sure he gazed at apollodoras face under the starlight he hoped the child would have her lustrous black hair and dark eyes he touched the fascinum and whispered a prayer of thanksgiving to the youth who came to him in dreams ad marcus strolled through the ancient forum past the temple of castor and the house of the vestals happily whistling a marching tune he had learned in the dacian campaigns it was a beautiful morning in late aprilis made all the more beautiful by the fact that his son had been born healthy and whole the preceding day the infant appeared to take more after his father than his mother having golden hair and bright blue eyes that the midwife predicted would change to green over time marcus named the boy lucius his only regret was that his father had not lived to see the grandson named for him life was good marcus was happily occupied with his work which at the moment meant collaborating with apollodorus on designs for the luna statue he had never seen apollodorus so excited by a project marcus was headed for the site now to check some measurements as he approached the flavian amphitheatre and saw the colossus looming beside it he could see the luna statue in his minds eye and the vision gave him a thrill of delight his route took him past the site where the colossus had previously stood where work was now in progress on the foundations of the temple of venus and roma what the finished temple would look like remained a secret so far hadrian had insisted on overseeing all aspects of the project excluding apollodorus completely and forbidding the builders to show the plans to anyone not directly involved in the project the emperor was determined to prove that he could conceive and create a masterpiece entirely on his own with no help from anyone apollodorus was curious of course but had resisted any urge to pry into the matter his energies were focused entirely on the luna commission judging by the scale of the foundations the temple was going to be enormous such a huge construction commanding the prime location once occupied by the vestibule of the golden house would make the temple a landmark whatever its appearance marcus arrived at the site for the luna statue pulled out a ball of twine a compass a wax tablet and a stylus and took the measurements he needed for a while he simply stood on the spot basking in the knowledge that one day apollodoruss crowning achievement would rise up for all the world to wonder at and that he would be able to show it to little lucius and say i had a hand in building that he walked past the flavian amphitheatre and on to the great bath complex that had been built by apollodorus for trajan like all trajans projects the baths had been constructed on a vast scale and decorated with exquisite taste paintings and sculptures adorned the public areas and the pools were surrounded by colourful mosaics along with the bathing facilities and the courtyards for gymnastic exercises there were a great many rooms where one could have ones hair cut or ones nails groomed enjoy a cup of wine or a light meal read a scroll from the library or simply sit and talk with friends there were also a great many dimlylit nooks and crannies where patrons could enjoy moments of intimacy sometimes with prostitutes and sometimes with each other virtually every aspect of life was carried on at the baths the scurra favonius had once told marcus that an ideal existence would be one in which a man was born lived procreated and died at the baths never leaving marcus stripped and checked his clothing and shoes in the changing room the floor heated by piped hot water was delightfully warm the walls were heated as well carrying a drying cloth over his shoulder he headed for the nearest hot plunge the room was dim and steamy before his eyes could adjust a familiar voice called his name his fatherinlaw had arrived ahead of him how is my new grandson this morning asked apollodorus as marcus stepped into the pool beside him the water was so hot that he had to lower himself into it very gradually as loud as he was yesterday said marcus smiling broadly the midwife says he has a very powerful set of lungs good good said apollodorus congratulations on the birth of your son marcus pinarius marcus looked around surprised to hear the voice of the emperor whom he had not seen amid the rising vapours hadrian was nearby immersed to his chest and leaning back against the side of the pool a handsome young slave sat crosslegged behind him using a set of tongs to curl the emperors steamdampened hair also in the room were a number of other retainers whom marcus took to be secretaries and bodyguards thank you caesar please accept my congratulations as well marcus pinarius said the man next to hadrian who turned out to be suetonius formerly of the imperial archives but now elevated to the post of private secretary to the emperor thank you suetonius and i congratulate you as well the speaker was obscured behind a veil of mist only a blur of frizzled red hair was visible but marcus recognized the voice thanks to his friendship with suetonius and his own dogged efforts to ingratiate himself favonius had managed to attract the favour of the emperor i offer congratulations not merely on the birth of your son but also on that splendid beard youve grown your handsome face is like a painting framed with gold beards are the fashion said marcus selfconsciously touching the wiry blonde hair that covered his jaw he was still not used to it fatherinlaw when you sent me that message this morning asking me to meet you here you didnt mention that caesar would be present what difference would that have made said favonius would you have worn something else he laughed at his own joke actually our meeting here was purely by chance said hadrian but since apollodorus happens to be here and i happen to be here i think perhaps the gods have brought us together i take this as a sign that the time has finally arrived for me to show you something apollodorus whatever caesar has to show me i will be honoured to view said apollodorus marcus looked at the scurra expecting him to exploit the opportunity for a lewd comment but favonius held his tongue hadrian had a notoriously slippery sense of humour especially when it came to himself or anything to do with his appearance in that regard he was quite unlike trajan who had seemed incapable of being offended this was not the first time marcus had encountered hadrian at the baths it was hadrians practice to see and be seen at the public baths moving among the people as if he were simply another citizen enjoying the amenities of city life apollodorus thought hadrian did this to demonstrate the common touch something that came less easily to the little greek than it had to trajan behind hadrians back favonius had once suggested to marcus that the emperor frequented the public baths because he enjoyed looking at naked youths hadrian his forehead beaded with sweat suggested that the party move to the cool plunge as they all stepped from the pool and made their way to the next room marcus noticed that favonius used his drying cloth to conceal as much of his plump pink body as he could while hadrian remained naked and allowed the boy who had been curling his hair to carry his drying cloth the man certainly had no need to be embarrassed about his physique at the age of fortyfive hadrians broad shoulders burly chest and full beard touched here and there with silver suggested to marcus the image of jupiter as portrayed by the great sculptors of the past as they entered the room that had the cool plunge hadrian noticed a greybearded man leaning against the protruding corner of a wall and rubbing his back against it what on earth are you doing citizen said hadrian the man hardly looked at him clearly he did not recognize the emperor what does it look like im doing im massaging my back against this wall ive got a terrible knot in my shoulder blade that wont go away old war wound this is the only thing that seems to help by hercules man you look like a superannuated ganymede performing an erotic dance get a slave to do that for you a slave ha the only slave i own is an old woman who does my cooking and her hands are too crippled to give anyone a decent massage hadrian pursed his lips a war wound you say youre a veteran then i certainly am first legion minerva dacian campaign got this wound fifteen years ago in the back not because i was running cursed dacians ambushed us in the woods and attacked us from the rear i took an arrow in the back and kept fighting until the last dacian was dead sometimes it feels like that arrow is still in there he rubbed his back furiously against the corner first legion minerva you say yet you dont recognize your old commander the man stopped his movements he took a closer look at hadrian his jaw dropped caesar is that you i had no idea sure i recognize you now you didnt have the beard back then let me see your wound the man turned around there was a dark scar on the inside of one shoulder blade hadrian reached out and pressed his thumbs against the spot here he said oh thats the very spot the man let out a groan hadrian stepped back and called to one of his secretaries some of the slaves who work here at the baths must be skilled at massage purchase a couple for this fellow the veteran turned around and gaped well i never you are truly a soldiers friend caesar to do such a thing for an old veteran of the minerva may all the gods bless you but how am i to pay for these slaves upkeep slaves have to be fed and i can barely afford to feed myself hadrian turned to the secretary along with the slaves give this fellow a monthly stipend for their upkeep how much caesar how should i know ask suetonius for a figure he knows that sort of thing hadrian walked on the veteran gazed after him in awe bless you caesar he cried after a brief soak in the cool plunge hadrian sent slaves to fetch everyones clothing he put on a purple toga trimmed with gold and those in his retinue wore togas rather than the simple tunics that marcus and apollodorus found suitable for a visit to the baths it was curious marcus thought that the emperor didnt mind being seen naked by half of roma but when dressed he wished for himself and those in his train to be seen only in formal attire after everyone was dressed hadrian led them to a suite of private rooms reserved for the emperors exclusive use marcus had seen these rooms when they were being built but had never been admitted into them since they were finished the columns and walls were of the rarest marbles the floors were decorated with extraordinarily detailed mosaics the furniture was all of greek design the pillows and draperies were of silk the paintings and statuary had been selected by hadrian himself there was no denying that the emperor had exquisite taste hadrian called for delicacies and wine to be served the conversation turned to the trip that hadrian would soon be taking to visit the troops and talk with provincial magistrates along the rhine and in gaul and britannia apollodorus ate little marcus noted and drank his wine straight without water when hadrian invited his guests to follow him into an adjoining room apollodorus called for a slave to refill his cup and carried it with him the room was dominated by a large table upon which architectural plans had been unrolled the corners held down by marble weights in the shape of eagles heads there was also an architectural model of a temple made not of painted wood but with actual marble columns and steps a gilded tile roof and bronze doors every aspect of the model even to the painted friezes in the pediments and the finely carved capitals of the columns was rendered with uncanny detail hadrian stepped back and studied his guests gratified to see the looks of astonishment on their faces as you will have realized these are the plans for the temple of venus and roma the architect decrianus made this model for me amazing is it not but the plans were entirely my own because progress has been so swift and because theres no telling how long i may be away ive decided to show these plans to you at last apollodorus slowly circled the table studying the plans and the model he raised an eyebrow but where is the front of the temple and where is the back i think decrianus must have misread your plans or perhaps caesar can point out to me what im missing hadrian smiled you see apollodorus but you do not perceive decrianus was also taken aback when he saw what i had done but soon enough he came to appreciate the novelty of it let me explain this temple is situated at the very centre of the city which means it is at the centre of the empire and thus at the centre of the world i ask you can a centre have a front and a back no from the centre of something one faces outwards no matter what the direction perhaps this should have been a round temple then said apollodorus hadrian frowned that was my first conception but the engineers were unable to guarantee that a dome of the span i envisioned could remain aloft so this was my solution a double temple with a dividing wall running through the middle which can be entered from either side the side facing the flavian amphitheatre is dedicated to venus felix bringer of good fortune the side facing the ancient forum is dedicated to roma the eternal there will be no front or back but rather two entrances of equal importance within their respective shrines the statues of venus and of roma will sit backtoback with a wall between them one gazing east the other gazing west here ill show you this is quite ingenious hadrian took hold of the gilded roof of the model which lifted completely off exposing the interior which was as finely finished and detailed as the exterior with tiny porphyry columns marble apses and beautifully rendered statues of the goddesses apollodorus gazed at the model without speaking hadrian cleared his throat of course you will have grasped the rather clever wordplay at work here venus represents love amor and amor spelled backwards is roma thus placing the two divinities of venus and roma backtoback in a single temple creates a further symmetry with the backtoback symmetry of their names within romas chamber there will be an altar where officials of the state will make sacrifices for the good fortune of the city within venuss sanctuary there will be an altar where newlywed couples can make sacrifices to the goddess ive designed the altars myself of course his voice trailed off he was waiting for apollodorus to say something at last apollodorus waved at the model and said i dont suppose the whole temple lifts up to show whats underneath no said hadrian what would be the point of that to allow us to see the basement theres a basement but its of no particular interest i presume theres also a tunnel leading from that basement to the subterranean chambers beneath the flavian amphitheatre hadrian shook his head i have no plans for such a tunnel thats too bad the need for one is so obvious i should think even decrianus would have seen it probably he did but was afraid to say anything what are you talking about apollodorus the basement of this temple is going to be huge that much space in the heart of the city shouldnt go to waste it would have been the ideal place to store the various mechanisms for the amphitheatre when theyre not in use the lifts and pumps and cranes and so forth with an underground tunnel those machines could have been moved from the basement of the temple to the amphitheatre and back out of sight what a shame what a wasted opportunity if only i had been consulted only you would look at a temple and see a closet said hadrian this building isnt about creating storage space its about beauty and worship and ah yes the temple itself apollodorus sighed i suppose we can be thankful that the engineers couldnt solve your dome problem or else wed have gotten a gigantic gourd plopped down in the very centre of the empire instead we have this well it has a normal ceiling and a normal roof i can approve of that yes the doubletemple idea is clever rather too clever i think the temple as palindrome personally i think theres something unnatural about a building which has two fronts and no back i cant say i find it pleasing the whole conception is flawed from the ground up literally the structure should have been built on higher ground to make it stand out more conspicuously at the head the sacred way if trajan could excavate a hill to make space for his forum surely his successor could have built a hill on which to place his temple that would have given you an even larger basement and more storage space by the way of course you might yet be able to make the ceiling higher it may not be too late to fix that problem at least higher ceilings said hadrian his face was ashen obviously any beginning student of architecture could see that these statues are too large for the interiors too large what if the goddesses should wish to get up and leave theyll hit their heads on the ceiling but why would the goddesses apollodorus kept a straight face for a moment then burst out laughing no one joined him despite the warmth that radiated from the heated floors and walls it seemed to marcus that the room was suddenly chilly hadrians face was as red as if he had just stepped from the hottest pool in the building apollodorus seemed oblivious of the scene he had just caused he gestured to one of the slaves and asked for more wine without a word hadrian left the room suetonius and favonius and the rest followed after him but apollodorus stayed where he was he sipped his wine and gazed at the model shaking head fatherinlaw what have you done said marcus apollodorus shrugged he asked me what i thought and i told him better now than later he may yet be able to salvage something from this folly fatherinlaw do you imagine youre so important do you think the emperor is so unfeeling apollodorus waved his hand dismissively if you have nothing intelligent to say pygmalion go home and change my grandsons diapers marcus hurried after the others he hoped to find the emperor laughing and joking with his friends in the gallery making light of apollodoruss comments but as marcus caught up with the retinue he saw that hadrians attention had been claimed by a most unseemly sight two naked middleaged men one on each side of the gallery were furiously rubbing their backs against protruding corners just as the impoverished veteran had done earlier apparently word of the emperors kindness to the veteran had spread and these two were hoping to elicit a similarly generous response hadrian angrily seized one of the men by the shoulders and pushed him towards the other then called to his bodyguards if these fellows need a backrub so badly let them rub each other tie them together backtoback let them they stay that way for the rest of the day as an example to anyone who presumes to make a fool of caesar hadrian walked away at a fast clip marcus followed him for a while then gradually slowed his pace and came to a stop watching as the emperor and his retinue receded in the distance listening to the echo of their footsteps down the long gallery ad dont stack those stones here said marcus cant you see theres more digging to be done stack them over there the workmen charged with enlarging the basement of the temple of venus and roma were probably the stupidest marcus had ever dealt with and he had dealt with some very stupid workers these fellows did not have even the excuse of being slaves they were all skilled stoneworkers hadrian had insisted that only artisans of a certain calibre be employed at each stage of the temples construction including the enlargement of the basement how had it fallen to marcus to oversee the project it was a matter of attrition he thought he had done nothing to rise in the emperors favour rather those of greater experience and standing had lost the emperors favour one by one until marcus had found himself called on to manage the work on the temple of venus and roma while hadrian was away from the city on his tour of the northern provinces it was a great honour but at this early stage there was nothing challenging about it and certainly nothing that called on his skills as an artist essentially the temple was still just a hole in the ground and at hadrians decree that hole was being made larger i spend my days with idiots in a hole in the ground marcus muttered shaking his head the slave who assisted him at the site each day running errands carrying messages taking dictation was a redheaded macedonian named amyntas the youth scurried down the ladder and approached him master your wife has come to visit you did she bring my son with her again yes master marcus sighed how many times had he asked apollodora not to visit him at the work site and especially not to bring the baby even on the best of days accidents happened a cart stacked with stones might spill its load or a carpenter with a sweaty hand might send a hammer flying through the air but apollodora was truly the daughter of her father she would do as she pleased marcus decided that the workmen could restack the stones without his supervision he climbed up the ladder secretly glad for a chance to get out of the hole and breathe some fresh air a little distance away with the flavian amphitheatre and the colossus for a backdrop apollodora sat on a pile of neatly stacked bricks nearby one of her slaves was holding little lucius in her arms cooing to him apollodora did not look happy has something happened asked marcus two letters arrived for you she said producing the little scrolls brought by separate messengers did you read them said marcus frowning of course not thats why im here he understood she wanted to know what was in the letters she handed him the first letter the seal was familiar marcus himself had carved the carnelian stone in apollodoruss ring when pressed into the sealing wax it left an image of trajans column this is from your father he said you could have opened it if you wished apollodora shook her head i was too nervous you read it husband and tell me what he says the letter had come from damascus where apollodorus had been living for several months technically hadrian had not banished apollodorus from roma but the imperial order that assigned him to an indefinite posting in his native city amounted to the same thing apollodorus had no desire to return to damascus officially hadrian had claimed that he needed a builder with apollodoruss experience to oversee repairs to the roman garrison but the posting was clearly a punishment in the letter apollodorus made no complaints and said nothing that might be construed as criticism of the emperor perhaps marcus thought his fatherinlaws exile had at last taught him to choose his words carefully marcus skipped over the formalities and found the gist of the letter which he read aloud to apollodora you know that i am most eager to return to roma so that i can resume my work on the luna statue and serve the emperor to my fullest capacity on any other projects that may please him towards that end in my spare time of which i sadly have too much here i have composed a treatise on siege engines this treatise i dedicated to the emperor i sent him the first copy with a note to express my hope that this small contribution to the science of war might meet with his approval though i sent this copy to him some months ago i have not heard back from him if you have any way to discover whether the emperor received this offering and what he thought of it i should be grateful if you could let me know soninlaw marcus scanned the rest of the letter apollodorus described a sandstorm that had swept through the city made some wry comments about damascene cuisine goat goat and more goat and noted that unrest among the jews throughout the region seemed to be on the rise again attached to the letter was a scrap of parchment upon which apollodorus had drawn his latest version of the luna statue poor father said apollodora hes so miserable he doesnt say that because hes afraid to thats the saddest thing of all marcus had to agree his fatherinlaws vanity and bombast had sometimes been difficult to take but marcus cringed to see the onceproud man reduced to the status of a miscreant servant desperate to return to the emperors good graces whats the other letter marcus said apollodora handed it to him it bore the imperial seal in red wax and the parchment was of the high quality that hadrian always used when corresponding with marcus which he did quite often using the new imperial postal service which was far quicker and more reliable than the piecemeal system it replaced marcus broke the seal and unrolled the scroll the letter came from a far northern outpost in britannia he quickly scanned the letter for any mention of his fatherinlaw but saw none as usual hadrian inquired about progress on the temple and offered highly detailed instructions on how the work was to be carried out he described his tour of gaul and britannia which had succeeded in making him known to the legions with whom he had previously had no contact hadrian relished his reputation as a soldiers soldier able to endure hardship alongside his troops like trajan he was not afraid to sleep on the ground march for days ford rivers and climb mountains he also included a few sketches he had made studies for a massive wall that would cross the entire breadth of the island of britannia at its narrowest point to man this fortified wall he would need at least fifteen thousand auxiliaries from all over the empire a wall across britannia said apollodora looking at the drawings over his shoulder her dismissive tone made her sound uncannily like her father trajan wouldnt have built a wall he would have conquered whatever lay beyond only if the barbarians had something worth looting said marcus the wall was emblematic of the emperors new frontier policy hadrian believed that there was no longer any incentive to push outwards in conquest nothing remained that was worth conquering except the western provinces of parthia which trajan had briefly seized but could not control under hadrian a consensus was forming that the empire had reached a natural limit the wild impoverished lands beyond its borders offered little to loot and instead were full of potential looters it was hadrians goal not to conquer these people but to keep them out his task was to maintain peace and prosperity within the existing boundaries of the empire almost as an afterthought hadrian mentioned that he had dismissed his private secretary suetonius who would returning from britannia to private life in roma marcus read aloud i realize that you have been on friendly terms with this person so i wish to tell you this news myself you will doubtless hear rumours regarding the reason for his dismissal the fact is that this person developed an inappropriate professional relationship with the empress what in hades does that mean said apollodora court politics said marcus sabina has her courtiers and hadrian has his and when relations between the emperor and empress are strained those courtiers sometimes find themselves in an awkward spot anyone too closely allied with sabina runs the risk of being dismissed by hadrian i suspect thats whats happened to suetonius my father and now suetonius and there have been quite a few others said apollodora men whose lives have been ruined because they said a wrong word or gave the emperor a wrong look i hardly think suetoniuss life is ruined said marcus hes coming back to roma isnt he hell finally have time to finish that history hes always dreamed of writing about the first caesars apollodora gazed despondently at the letter no mention of my father then or the treatise he sent to hadrian im afraid not what will happen if you cross the emperor husband marcus blew out his cheeks i shall try my best not to do so he wanted to tell her there was no cause for fear but in truth there was a harsh and even petty side to hadrian marcus told himself that the situation could be much worse except for the small number of executions that took place at the outset of his reign hadrian had kept his word to kill no senators and his punishments were mild compared to those of some of his predecessors when marcus recalled the stories his father had told him about the reign of domitian who had forced lucius pinarius to face a lion in the arena and whose favorite method of interrogation had been burning mens genitals the reigns of trajan and hadrian seemed gentle by comparison still marcus was acutely aware that he served at hadrians pleasure in a state ruled absolutely by one man no matter how enlightened that man might be every other man was at his mercy marcus felt a sudden rush of anxiety thinking how far he had risen in life and how much he had to lose he calmed himself by touching the fascinum at his breast and thinking of the nameless god who visited him in dreams his distracted gaze fell on the colossus beside the amphitheatre dazzling under the sunlight he glanced again at the drawing of the luna statue in apollodoruss letter and then at the nearby spot the statue was intended to occupy try as he might he could not envision the luna statue looming over him he saw only empty sky the masterpiece that was to be apollodoruss crowning achievement his monument for the ages would it ever be built apollodora began to weep tears ran down her cheeks little lucius began to cry as well filling that air with loud wailing marcus looked on feeling helpless to comfort either of them he whispered a prayer god of the dream who protects me give me a great work to do and give me an emperor who will let me do it ad the city was abuzz with excitement at the emperors longawaited return to roma what had begun as a trip to the northern provinces had turned into a grand tour that spanned the empire taking him from britannia down to the pillars of hercules and mauretania where he put down a bloody revolt then across the mediterranean sea to asia minor and then to greece where hadrian showered favours on the city of athens restoring it as a great seat of learning by endowing it with a new library as well as a forum and an arch and restoring the temple of olympian zeus now at last hadrian was back in roma and on this day he was to visit the house of marcus pinarius the household was in a frenzy of lastminute preparations everything had to be made perfect marcus thought how very different this visit felt from the first time hadrian had visited the house some twelve years ago when marcuss father had hosted a dinner party to honour marcus for his work on trajans column hadrian had been an honoured guest on that occasion but today one would have thought that a god was about to come calling apollodora was driving the slaves to tidy every corner prune every bush in the garden and polish every marble surface to a lustrous shine marcus knew what she was thinking if only they could make the right impression on the emperor perhaps he might yet relent in his banishment of her father who continued to languish in damascus you will bring up the subject wont you apollodora asked him for the tenth time that day ill try wife if the right moment arises amyntas came running master theyre coming up the street theyll be at the door any moment calm yourself amyntas take a deep breath when you answer the door i master i m to answer the door marcus smiled who else in the household was more suitable to greet the emperor than the handsomest of his young slaves yes amyntas you but im so nervous master look how my hands tremble the emperor will find your demeanour charming now go i hear a knock at the door the retinue of some twenty people filed through the vestibule and the atrium then into the formal reception room where refreshments awaited them hadrian resplendent in a purple toga accepted marcuss formal greeting then drew him aside lets retire to your garden marcus pinarius just the two of us marcus walked beside the emperor you look well caesar he said it was true though close to fifty with touches of grey in his hair and beard hadrian was as trim and muscular as ever and his mood was buoyant his years of travel had agreed with him ah there it is he said as he stepped into the garden marcus remembered the awed expression on hadrians face when he first laid eyes on the statue of melancomas the emperor seemed less impressed now he cocked his head and looked the statue up and down with an expression more wistful than astonished caesar must have seen many beautiful works of art during his travels marcus said oh yes amazing things amazing experiences my induction into the mysteries of eleusis was the most remarkable of those experiences though i can say nothing specific about that of course my travels have opened my eyes i received a very good education when i was young my teachers did their best to enlighten me but books and words can relate only so much actual experience is the key oh before i forget epictetus asked me to give you his regards i believe that he and your father were very close yes caesar how is he as brilliant as ever and still teaching at his school in nicopolis i hope that my wits will remain as quick when im in my seventies i think epictetus must be the very last of my fathers circle whos still alive said marcus thoughtfully hadrian was in such high spirits that marcus wondered if this might be a good time to bring up the matter of his fatherinlaw he was clearing his throat to speak when hadrian returned his attention to the statue of melancomas do you recall pinarius what we said about this statue that evening many years ago i said if only someday i could meet a youth as beautiful as this to which you responded if only someday i could create a statue as beautiful as this marcus smiled remembering yes and favonius said may each of you be granted his desire and be happy with it the scurra i had forgotten he was here that night but yes youre right i remember now well favonius was a wise man after all you know seeing it again after all this time the melancomas statue doesnt impress me as much as it once did and you marcus as an artist with many more years of experience now what do you think of it marcus tried to look at the familiar statue with fresh eyes perhaps the shoulders are a bit too wide and the hips too narrow but of course the sculptor had a duty to record the actual proportions of the living model the workmanship itself seems quite flawless to me does it here theres someone i want you to meet hadrian summoned a secretary who stood at the gardens edge and spoke in his ear the man hurried to the reception room to fetch someone marcus noticed that apollodora was peeking at them from behind a corner looking anxious as he wondered again if he should mention his fatherinlaw hadrians young friend stepped into the garden and joined them marcus was stunned the youth who stood before him was the very incarnation of the god from his dreams hadrian laughed thats a typical reaction of those meeting antinous for the first time but really try not to gape pygmalion thats what they used to call you isnt it just as they used to call me the little greek marcus closed his mouth the resemblance was too uncanny to be accidental he touched the fascinum at his breast forgive me caesar its only that is its hard to explain then dont try not with words anyway hadrian shifted from speaking latin to greek here antinous what do you make of this statue the youth likewise answered in greek with a bithynian accent its very beautiful who is it this is melancomas a famous wrestler is he still alive hadrian laughed melancomas and the emperor titus were lovers fifty years ago so antinous cocked his head he could be a handsome man in his seventies today hadrians smile faded no melancomas died young but here i want you to stand next to the statue i want to see the two of you side by side this is something ive been curious to see since i first met you take off your clothes antinous theres no need to be modest before pygmalion hes an artist antinous stood next to the melancomas he pulled off his chiton and dropped it to the ground then undid his loincloth and let it fall hadrian crossed his arms and nodded there do you see pinarius theyre not really comparable are they as beautiful as we thought the melancomas it pales beside antinous he circled the youth and the statue looking from one to the other of course cold marble can never compete with warm living flesh just as words in a book cannot match the actuality of experience but even if melancomas were alive and breathing and standing next to antinous would there be any competition as to which was more beautiful marcus was still too stunned to think clearly i dont know what to say then say nothing youre not a poet after all youre an artist and thats what i want from you art i want you to sculpt antinous of course as i said i know that marble or bronze can never fully capture the subtlety and solidity of flesh but you must do your best what do you say pygmalion will you make me a statue of antinous of course i will caesar marcus dazed saw his wife peering at him from her place of concealment for the life of him he could not remember what she wanted to carry out the emperors commission marcus set up a workshop at the foot of the aventine hill not far from the river it was a lofty space with excellent light and plenty of room soon the shelves were lined with scores of clay models of the youth and all the various parts of his body occasionally marcus heard the sounds of workers on the waterfront but otherwise the space was very quiet marcus had never enjoyed anything as much as he enjoyed working on the statue all his other work even on the temple of venus and roma was suspended antinous was the ideal model he was never late had impeccable manners and carried himself with a composure beyond his years he was willing to quietly hold a pose for hours content simply to exist and be still inside his perfect body letting whatever thoughts were behind his perfect face remain a mystery from the brief conversations that occasionally took place between them marcus learned that hadrian had met the youth while travelling in bithynia marcus noted that dio of prusa had been a bithynian but antinous had never heard of him philosophy did not interest him nor was he much interested in religion or science but when the subject of astrology came up he told marcus that the emperor himself was an expert astrologer caesar frequently casts his own horoscope said antinous he cant let anyone else do it you see because that would give them too much knowledge thats why he wont allow any astrologers in the court and studies the heavens himself how he can remember the meanings of all those configurations of the stars is beyond me but of course he has a very scientific mind he casts horoscopes for the people around him too including you antinous frowned no never for me he seems to be superstitious about that he says some things should remain a mystery what the boy really loved was hunting one day when the subject happened to come up marcus was talking about all the famous statues that had been made of the hunter actaeon antinous became more animated than marcus had ever seen him i was very nearly killed by a lion once he said really caesar and i were hunting together on horseback we trapped a lion against a cliff face caesar wanted me to have the kill so i threw my spear first but i only wounded the beast the lion was furious it roared and crouched and whipped its tail and then it sprang at me my heart stopped i thought i was dead but while the lion was in midair caesars spear struck the beast and pierced its heart it fell to the ground dead if caesar hadnt killed the lion it would surely have torn me to pieces caesar saved my life i can never repay him for that thats a remarkable story said marcus seeing a glint in the youths eyes that he was determined to capture he seized a piece of charcoal and some parchment and began sketching furiously i think someone is making a poem about it antinous said blandly in his charming bithynian accent as if having ones activities recorded in verse were an everyday occurrence there were probably a great many things antinous took for granted marcus thought what must it be like to go through life looking like that attracting the admiration of every person you met after his initial awe marcus had come to realize that antinous was not his dreamgod for one thing despite marcuss overwhelming first impression he began to see that the youth was not exactly identical to the dreamgod or at least not all the time there was something quicksilver about his appearance as there was about every human face it changed depending on his mood the angle the light sometimes antinous did not resemble the dreamgod at all and marcus could not imagine how he had ever thought he did then in the next instant antinous would turn his face just so and he was the dreamgod come to life it was this elusive nature of the youths appearance that marcus was striving to capture a challenge he found allconsuming if antinous was not a god he was surely the vessel of a god possessing some degree of divine power marcus would do his best to capture that divinity in marble uncharacteristically hadrian had refrained from taking any part in the process not even dropping by to look at marcuss sketches or clay models he declared his intention to wait until the statue was finished before he laid eyes on it marcus was touched by the emperors trust and the privacy of the process had allowed him to invest himself completely in his work antinous had just left for the day when marcus heard a knock on the door a small vestibule separated the studio from the entrance and it was here that he admitted an unexpected caller gaius suetonius marcus pinarius i havent see you in ages said suetonius i pass by the site of the new temple occasionally but i no longer see you there my duties at the temple have been suspended for a while i come here to the workshop every day hiding out eh i thought id never find this place tucked away among the granaries and storehouses working on something for the emperor are you perhaps oh come pinarius everyone knows what youre up to youre making a statue of that bithynian boy marcus frowned how did you know favonius told me im no longer privy to imperial comings and goings but favonius keeps me informed he says everyone is talking about this statue of yours just as everyone is talking about hadrian and his new favourite what do they say some people claim to be scandalized by hadrians lack of propriety elevating a foreign youth of no standing to a place of honour in his household sabinas faction certainly isnt happy caesar has less time for the empress than ever but others are pleased to see the emperor so content a happy caesar is a benevolent caesar so can i have a look at the statue to see what all the fuss is about marcus shook his head no one is allowed to see the statue im afraid no perhaps you could let me see a preliminary sketch ive never even seen this boy im curious to know what he looks like not possible even caesar hasnt see my work yet and no one can be allowed to see it before caesar suetonius made a sour face ah well one bithynian youth looks like another i imagine theyre all available to a roman with money or so it seemed when i was stationed there in the imperial service you couldnt set foot in the baths without those boys practically throwing themselves at you i wouldnt know said marcus ive never been to bithynia there was an awkward silence broken by suetonius ive been hard at work too have you toiling away on my collection of imperial biographies ive been writing about domitian lately that could put anyone in a bad mood i was wondering did your father ever talk about those days in particular did he ever mention a black room apparently there was a chamber in the imperial palace to which domitian invited certain guests when he wanted to frighten them half to death no i dont remember any stories about a black room ah well plenty of others have stories to tell i have to say some of the tales ive collected about the emperors almost defy belief theyre quite shocking and all the more so because theyre true i rather hate to end my collection with domitian such a grim fellow but one cant yet write this sort of biography about trajan or nerva the emperors father and grandfather by adoption one never knows what might cause offense even the most flattering account might somehow provoke the emperors displeasure caesar is letting you write whatever you want about the previous dynasties amazing isnt it everyone in a position of authority assures me that i may proceed as i wish my biggest worry is what the emperor will say about my prose hadrian fancies himself a writer you know architect emperor author literary critic is there nothing the man cant do his own specialty is collecting odd bits of information and compiling catalogues of marvellous facts his book will be forthcoming any day now of course he cant publish such a thing under his own name so hes having his creature phlegon put his name on the book trivial timewasting miscellany just the sort of thing everyones reading nowadays not a work of true merit like your imperial biographies exactly perhaps youd like to read what ive written so far i could profit from the reactions of a fellow like yourself a man of learning and experience but with no literary pretensions or axes to grind shall i have a copy sent to you yes please do said marcus just to get rid of the man he was eager to return to the studio where he could be alone to contemplate his progress on the statue of antinous a few days later while he was preparing to leave home for the workshop an imperial messenger arrived with a request for marcus to come to the house of the people do you know why im being summoned said marcus im afraid not said the messenger marcus was perturbed his work on the statue had progressed to a stage that was particularly pleasurable to him smoothing and polishing the stone and making very small adjustments now he would lose the best part of the day when the light was brightest and he would have to go through the bother of changing his simple tunic for a toga the summons also made him uneasy if hadrian was curious about progress on the statue why did he not simply come to see it could it be that suetoniuss visit to the workshop had been observed and reported to the emperor surely hadrian knew marcus well enough by now to trust that he would never show the statue to anyone ahead of himself while he dressed marcus decided that he was being unduly anxious probably there was some architectural detail about the temple that hadrian wanted to discuss the chamber where hadrian received him was tastefully appointed with greek furnishings brought back from his travels the room had the intimate atmosphere of a private home rather than of a regal reception hall the slave who escorted marcus showed him to a couch and brought him a cup of wine a number of guests were already present and more continued to arrive antinous was there marcus noticed the empress sabina was not some of the guests were senators and magistrates but more were writers and philosophers the mood was like that of a literary gathering almost all the men sported facial hair though few could grow a beard as handsome as that of the emperor eventually hadrian rose and called forth the scholar phlegon of tralles a small nondescript man whom hadrian introduced as the author of a new work titled the book of marvels phlegon stood before the company and read a number of excerpts all of which he claimed had been verified by scrupulous research having to do with wondrous things sightings of live centaurs appearances by ghosts incidents of males giving birth and stories about men and women who had changed their gender he concluded with several accounts about the discovery of gigantic teeth and bones the existence of which appeared to prove that huge creatures now extinct had once lived upon the earth a tooth the size of mans leg was uncovered by an earthquake in sicily and shown to the emperor tiberius phlegon read tiberius called on a geometrician named pulcher who concluded that the creature who possessed such a tooth would have been as large as a ship far larger than any creature known to exist today bones of gigantic size were found in a cave in dalmatia and equally enormous bones have been excavated in rhodes athens and egypt some say these objects must be made of a stone which happens to look like bone or are deliberate hoaxes but i say we should not disbelieve this remarkable evidence rather consider that in the beginning when nature was in her prime she reared everything near to the gods but just as time is running down so also living things have become smaller and smaller in stature phlegon bowed marcus saw that hadrian was beaming like a proud author he remembered suetoniuss claim that the emperor was the true author of the work and joined the others in applauding after this bit of amusement hadrian moved on to moreserious matters our attention has been called to the recent death of a citizen a case of murder it would appear a slave is suspected of killing his master there were mutterings of disdain from some of the guests especially the senators hadrian raised his hand as outrageous as such a crime may be i bring up the matter because i see here an opportunity to reform certain laws handed down to us by our ancestors specifically those harsh measures which demand the examination by torture of all the slaves in a household where such a crime occurs and if one of their number is found guilty the execution of every slave marcus pinarius marcus blinked and looked up surprised at being called on i asked you here today pinarius because your grandfather once made an impassioned speech to the senate on this very topic in the reign of nero you are aware of that occasion i presume marcus cleared his throat yes caesar my father told me something about it i realize you never knew your grandfather but you should be proud of what he said fortunately his words were recorded and preserved in the senate archives i read them for the first time last night phlegon would you be so kind as to read aloud the section ive marked phlegon took the scroll and stood before them again these slaves must be known not only to fellow slaves in other households but to shopkeepers and artisans and all sorts of citizens who have dealings with them some are errand boys and messengers some are seamstresses and hairdressers some are cooks and cleaners some are bookkeepers and scribes highly educated and valuable slaves deserving a degree of respect some are near the age of death some are newborn just beginning life some are in the prime of life at the peak of their usefulness and value some are pregnant and about to bring forth new life these victims of the law are not a faceless crowd but are human beings known to their neighbours and so we cannot be surprised if there are murmurs throughout the city that the law is too harsh hadrian nodded and took back the scroll i think those words are quite remarkable considering the occasion and atmosphere in which they were delivered your grandfather spoke of those doomed slaves as if they were human beings not mere property as if their suffering mattered at the time your grandfathers sentiments were rebuked and ridiculed but with the passing of the generations and the general progress of mankind i think we are able to see that your grandfather was not only brave and compassionate but wise as the divine trajan often told me if the emperor can see a just way to reduce the suffering of those under his care even the most wretched he is obligated to do so in the case at hand i think we have an opportunity to do exactly that therefore i am proclaiming a number of edicts involving the punishment of slaves first if a master is murdered in his house no slaves shall be examined under torture except those who were near enough to have knowledge of the murder this reform has been a long time coming there was a murmur of approval a number of people nodded deferentially to marcus in honour of his farsighted grandfather further said hadrian a master may no longer kill a slave at will instead the execution of a slave must be decided by a court further no master may sell a slave male or female to a sexual procurer or a trainer of gladiators unless the master can make a case that the slave is fit for nothing else further i intend to abolish the existing houses of hard labour to which some masters consign their unwanted slaves for a fee and where even some wretched freedmen end up so desperate are they to work off their debts i have visited those workhouses which are places of unimaginable suffering and i intend to shut them down the emperors pronouncements were met with silence hadrian looked around the room does anyone wish to comment on these ideas a whitehaired cleanshaven senator stepped forward caesar today you have introduced us to a work called the book of marvels but more marvellous than anything in that book are these radical ideas you put before us i drew a breath when i heard about a tooth from a creature the size of a ship but my jaw dropped to hear that a roman citizen shall no longer have the power to discipline his slaves as he sees fit i fear that caesars new laws are likely to be very unpopular and not just with the rich who own many slaves consider the common man who owns only a handful of slaves unless his authority over those slaves is absolute yes even to the point of death how can that man possibly feel safe inside his home at night our forefathers created these laws for a reason and the divine augustus restated them anew i fear these pronouncements will stir considerable discontent and such disorder that the magistrates will be unable to contain it hadrian raised his hand for silence if disorder breaks out then i will hold the magistrates responsible it is their duty to contain such outbreaks whatever the cause and to see that laws are respected all laws including these if the magistrates cannot do the job then others who are more capable shall be appointed to take their place the senator bowed his head and stepped back no one else dared to comment if theres no other business this morning then im ready for my lunch said hadrian as the various courses were served the emperor called marcus to his side what do you think of my ideas pygmalion im not a statesman caesar perhaps not but your grandfather was who knew i had to check twice to be sure that the pinarius who gave that speech before nero and the senate was indeed your grandfather that took nerve you can be proud of the blood in your veins pinarius i am caesar thank you for inviting me here today to hear the words of my grandfather yes i thought you might enjoy that how goes work on the statue it proceeds well caesar and quickly very soon ill be ready to unveil it for you very good hadrian looked at antinous who was sitting next to phlegon scrolling through the book of marvels i can hardly wait to see it at last marcus was ready for the emperors visit to the workshop apollodora was with him overseeing the slaves as they cleaned and tidied the place and decorated it especially for the occasion marcus had assured her that such preparations were unnecessary its a workshop its supposed to be cluttered and covered in marble dust the emperor knows that but apollodora had insisted that all must be perfect if hadrian was pleased and of course he would be this could at last be marcuss opportunity to ask for a special favour the return of his fatherinlaw from exile apollodora had insisted on bringing along fouryearold lucius as well saying that the boy should be there to see his fathers proud moment no doubt she also thought that the sight of lucius might move the emperor to be merciful to the boys grandfather as the hour for the visit drew near marcus was increasingly fretful not only would hadrian be judging his work but marcus would have to put the delicate matter of his fatherinlaw to the emperor with his wifes happiness hanging on the outcome marcus stood before the statue a final time studying the sensual curves of the naked body the tilt of the head the faraway look and the elusive smile without a doubt this was the finest and most beautiful thing marcus had ever created he reached for a sailcloth and threw it over the statue there was a sound from the vestibule amyntas came running master yes i know the emperor is here hes left his retinue in the street only antinous is with him well show them in the emperor and antinous entered marcus stood next to the draped statue apollodora stood nearby with little lucius beside her no one said a word hadrian smiled and gave a slight gesture with his hand to indicate that marcus should proceed marcus pulled aside the sailcloth the statue was unveiled hadrian approached the statue he slowly circled it looking it up and down his face was expressionless antinous was smiling he seemed pleased with his image of course the statue offered no surprise to him since he had seen it at every stage of its creation in his mind marcus rehearsed the little speech he had prepared caesar you recently saw fit to praise the plea my grandfather made asking for clemency to be shown to even the lowliest of men i also have a plea to make which only caesar can grant i ask that you show mercy and forgive ness to a mistake said hadrian he had concluded his full circuit of the statue and stood in front of it staring at it there was no expression on his face marcus blinked the utterance was so abrupt that he was not sure he had heard it correctly a mistake caesar if some tiny flaw remains an area where i failed to smooth the marble sufficiently said marcus though he knew every inch of the statue was perfect no the entire idea was a mistake hadrians tone was frigid he averted his eyes from both marcus and the statue the fault is mine marcus pinarius not yours i should never have expected that you or anyone else could do the thing i desired i understand that now caesar if the pose of the statue is not to your liking or if the tilt of the head nothing about the statue is to my liking by hercules look at antinous and then look at this this travesty trembling apollodora stepped forward caesar its a true likeness what would you know you might as well be blind and so might you marcus you possess a certain skill yes this is the image you intended to shape im sure but you have no eyes to see this thing is not antinous not even a vague approximation am i the only one who can see him hadrian turned his back on the statue as if disgusted by it apollodora looked desperately at marcus husband do it she whispered now is not the time he said through clenched teeth but apollodora had staked so much on this meeting that she could not let the chance go by she rushed to hadrian even as he was departing and dropped to her knees caesar we have a favour to ask my father in damascus he longs to return to roma if you could forgive him we beg you hadrian shuddered he waved his hand dismissively turned away from her and walked on following him antinous looked over his shoulder and cast a parting glance at the statue to marcus the face of the youth and the face of the statue were mirror images perfectly alike in every way at the doorway to the vestibule hadrian stopped and collected himself he kept his eyes averted his voice was strained but calm you will return to work on the temple marcus pinarius there is still much you can accomplish there but you will destroy this abomination and everything to do with it do you understand as soon as im gone you will destroy every model and burn every drawing you will break this statue into pieces you will grind the pieces to dust no one must ever see it ad work continued on the temple of venus and roma with the huge columns at last in place the true massiveness of the structure was becoming evident but on this day marcus was at work at different site out on the field of mars where hadrian had decided to rebuild a neglected ruin called the pantheon the original structure a temple dedicated to the great gods had been erected by agrippa in the reign of augustus damage caused by fire in the reign of titus had been repaired by domitian another fire caused by lightning virtually destroyed the temple while work was under way on trajans column and forum and with those enormous projects claiming all available resources the rebuilding of the pantheon was neglected for almost twenty years the pantheon remained in ruins a cordonedoff area in the bustling heart of the field of mars passing the familiar eyesore one day hadrian suddenly saw it afresh the limitations of the site were such that any rebuilt temple would have to be nearly square in shape it was hard to imagine an aesthetically pleasing temple no deeper than it was wide essentially a cube but what if the rebuilt temple was circular or indeed as hadrian perceived in a flash of inspiration spherical here at last the emperor realized was the project to which he could give full expression to his fascination for domes the giant gourds that apollodorus had derided the rebuilt pantheon would be unique a sphere within a square surmounted by a dome of almost inconceivable size the challenge of constructing such a dome had defeated engineers in the past but hadrian insisted that it could be done and had charged marcus with doing so the emperors expression of confidence in him had surprised marcus who had been badly shaken by hadrians rejection of the statue but not once had hadrian ever reminded marcus of his displeasure on that occasion and marcus was determined to show the emperor that his trust was well placed fired by hadrians enthusiasm marcus and a team of engineers had conceived new ideas for making such a vast dome feasible making the concrete thinner near the top using coffers to lessen the mass and using an oculus an eyelike opening at the top to admit light and further reduce the weight marcus was determined that his efforts should not disappoint the emperor he often wished that apollodorus were with him to offer advice and help oversee such a hazardous but thrilling enterprise the actual construction of the dome was still a long way off on this day marcus was inspecting recent work on the thick loadbearing walls when he heard a familiar cry and looked up to see his sons blonde curls glinting in the sunlight at the age of eight lucius was now old enough to visit his fathers worksites as long as he was always supervised marcus was surprised to see that lucius was accompanied not by one of the slaves who usually chaperoned him but by amyntas who had rapidly risen in the ranks of the household and was usually occupied with moreimportant duties marcus greeted the boy by lifting him in the air not as easy a task as it once had been then saw the reason why amyntas had come in the slaves hand was a scroll and even at a distance marcus could spot the imperial seal pressed into the wax hadrian was again off travelling he frequently corresponded with marcus but those letters were usually bundled with other imperial documents and delivered by couriers to the palace where marcus sent a slave to fetch them a letter that had come not to the palace but directly to marcuss house was unusual while amyntas took lucius to look at the walls marcus broke the seal and unrolled the scroll previous letters had come from sicily carthage the interior african city of lambaesis athens ephesus and antioch the heading of this letter showed that it had been posted from the desert trading city of palmyra recalling its close proximity to damascus marcus felt a twinge of hope apollodorus in his latest letter had expressed his intention to do his best to gain an audience with hadrian should the emperors travels bring him anywhere near damascus the letter was written not in hadrians usual first person full of learned asides and literary allusions but in a very stiff and formal third person from the first words marcus knew the letter contained bad news caesar wishes to inform marcus pinarius personally of an unfortunate event so that he will hear of it first from caesar and not from some other source caesar will state the fact plainly the fatherinlaw of marcus pinarius apollodorus of damascus has been executed for plotting against the life of the emperor because of irrefutable evidence supplied to caesar caesar had no other recourse this action was carried out swiftly and with respect to the persons status as a citizen marcus knew what that meant apollodorus had been beheaded and not killed in some more disgraceful way like crucifixion marcus pinarius need fear no recrimination against himself although caesar is aware of the natural bond of affection between marcus pinarius and his fatherinlaw caesar is of the belief that marcus pinarius played no part whatsoever in the plot is certain of marcus pinariuss loyalty to the emperor and desires marcus pinarius to continue his valuable work on the temple of venus and roma and on the pantheon it is the wish of caesar that this unfortunate event shall have no effect on the amity between himself and marcus pinarius we shall not speak of it again stunned marcus put down the letter could it be true that apollodorus had conspired against the emperor had the bitterness of so many years of exile driven him to involve himself in some desperate plot hadrians journeys exposed him not just to those who sought favours from the emperor but to those in each region who craved revenge and in the vicinity of damascus where so many had been subjected to so much suffering under roman rule there must be many such persons had apollodorus conspired with other malcontents and been discovered by hadrians agents or had he been the victim of rumors and lies hadrian spoke of irrefutable evidence but that phrase was invariably used when a declared enemy of the state was put to death marcus would probably never know the truth the emperor was above being questioned apollodorus was beyond giving answers marcus saw something from the corner of his eye it took him a moment to realize that it was a man in a toga only when the man spoke did he recognize gaius suetonius pinarius i havent see you in a titans age only yesterday i was revising a passage about marcus agrippa and i thought to myself i must drop by to see what youre up to here at agrippas ruined temple those walls look awfully thick must be quite a heavy roof youre planning to put on top you know i never heard a word from you when i sent you my work in progress all those years ago oh thats alright not everyones a literary critic and thank the gods for that but now good news ive finally finished the work and i have an army of scribes busy making copies shall i send you one its not a bad read if i say so myself i promise you wont be bored indeed you may think ive written a book of marvels like our friend phlegon its so full of outrageous anecdotes amazing what some of those emperors got up to even i was surprised at the details i discovered and i spent years combing through the imperial archives theres one story about caligula truly it defies belief marcus didnt hear he was wondering how he was going to tell apollodora the news he was suddenly distracted by a glint of sunlight on his sons blonde curls lucius had wandered into an area where loose bricks had been piled in high stacks amyntas marcus shouted amyntas look after lucius he doesnt belong over there its too dangerous suetonius smiled boys always getting into trouble eh a pity our emperor hasnt got one that might keep him out of trouble oh but i forget caesar does have a boy to look after takes him everywhere so my correspondents along his travel route tell me i hear hes headed for jerusalem next or what they used to call jerusalem hadrian plans to rebuild the city vespasian destroyed and give it a rather pretty new name aelia capitolina named for his ancestors the aelii i suspect hell put a statue of himself next to jupiter and see if he cant convince those stubborn jews to burn a bit of incense on the altar then hes to press on to alexandria for his first look at egypt he and antinous will play caesar and cleopatra languidly cruising up the nile past hippopotami and crocodiles do you suppose the egyptians will put some sort of animal head on hadrians statue and declare him a god the man chattered on and on marcus did not hear a word ad hadrian was back in roma after years of travel the emperors return to the capital was to be marked with celebrations and banquets but his very first excursion bright and early on the morning after his first night back in the imperial palace was an unannounced visit to the site of the temple of venus and roma to see what progress had been made in his absence when the emperor was informed that marcus pinarius was not present being occupied that morning at his workshop hadrian and his retinue headed directly to the aventine hill marcus and his assistants were busy piecing together some sections of the gigantic bronze statue of venus that was to be installed in the temple when amyntas came running in to announce that the emperor was in the vestibule marcus told everyone to cease working and stay exactly where they were he put down his tools and dusted off his tunic amyntas checking marcuss appearance flicked some bits of metal from his beard impeccably dressed as always the emperor made a cursory examination of the statue then suggested that the workmen might be allowed a rest so that he and marcus could speak in private ive just come from the temple said hadrian im pleased with the progress youve done well pinarius thank you caesar im but one of the many artisans and engineers who are privileged each day to carry out the emperors grand vision you neednt be so modest pinarius ive spent a lifetime dealing with architects and artists all over the world you may be the most talented of all now that apollodorus is dead marcus thought then he thought of the other death that had occurred in the course of hadrians journeys during the trip up the nile antinous had drowned it seemed to marcus that the emperor had aged considerably since he had last seen him there was more silver in his hair and his beard was now almost entirely grey his face was more wrinkled he spoke more slowly and with a quaver in his voice his eyes were dull some essential spark had gone out of him hadrian strolled around the studio touching the various implements you spent so many hours with him here in this room alone with him looking at him observing him more than anyone else on earth except myself you must remember what he looked like caesar speaks of antinous said marcus quietly when i learned of his death i wept it was true marcus had grieved not so much for the youth himself whose personality had remained a mystery to him but for the loss of so much beauty in his mind there was still some mysterious link between the bithynian youth and the god who visited him in dreams the death of antinous had struck him as more than the death of a single mortal his passing was emblematic of the death of all things do you know the circumstances of his death said hadrian in a whisper i know only what everyone knows that antinous drowned in the nile egypt cast a spell over us the heat the buzzing insects the oozing mud the endlessly flowing river the temples filled with strange symbols and animalheaded gods the gigantic monuments from some unimaginably distant past as we journeyed farther and farther up the nile we were gripped by some nameless ancient dread as i had explored the mysteries of eleusis so i was initiated in the secret rites of the egyptians when the priests looked into my future they saw something terrible they declared that my life was over that i would die in a matter of days unless unless another life was sacrificed in my place i didnt want to believe them but when i cast my horoscope adjusting the reading for the greater influence of the southern stars i saw they were right i was in great danger death was very near marcus drew a breath so antinous he sacrificed himself in my place i never asked him to do it i was restless that night i heard him leave the cabin i heard the soft sound of a splash i was half asleep and thought i was dreaming marcus remembered the story antinous had once told him in this very room about the time hadrian and the boy hunted a lion if caesar hadnt killed the lion it would surely have torn me to pieces caesar saved my life i can never repay him for that the boy had been able to repay him after all what antinous did was not the act of a mere mortal said hadrian i always sensed there was something divine in him i think you sensed that too pinarius but i never truly understood the nature of his divinity until he left this world in his honour i built a city on the nile where i consecrated a temple and appointed priests to worship him in ephesus and athens on the way back to roma i built more temples in honour of the god antinous marcus had heard about the emperors activities on behalf of the new god the grandiosity of hadrians grief was the talk of roma some dared to ridicule it but others were in awe of it marcus had heard it compared it to the madness of alexander the great after the death of alexanders lover hephaestion but it was hard for marcus to look at the aging paunchy hadrian and see any resemblance to the dashing doomed figure of alexander there will be no temple to antinous here in roma said hadrian just as worship of the emperor is not required of citizens within italy so i will not ask the people of roma to worship the youth who was my consort but i plan to build a tomb for antinous near the town of tibur east of the city i also plan to build a residence there a place where i can retreat from the world hadrian closed his eyes for a long moment then opened them naturally pinarius i want you to be part of those projects of course caesar ill do whatever i can hadrian stepped closer he gazed steadily into marcuss eyes what i really want dear pygmalion is for you to sculpt antinous marcus stared back at him had grief erased the emperors memory hadrian smiled wanly i understand your hesitation pinarius let me explain temples have been erected temples must have statues so artists in egypt and greece have sculpted images of the divine antinous at best these statues have been what word can i use acceptable but none has captured the divine essence of antinous im convinced that only you because you alone sculpted him in life can possibly do that i want you to make a statue of antinous well collaborate on this project you and i working from memory marcus felt many things at once doubt dread and a twinge of anger but also a thrill of excitement such as he had not experienced in a long time hadrian looked at him with a plaintive expression i dont suppose when i told you to destroy the statue i did as i was ordered caesar i burned my sketches i destroyed the models i broke the arms and legs from the statue smashed the torso pulverized the hands and feet hadrian winced and shut his eyes but marcus hesitated for a long moment then decided to tell the truth i kept the head hadrians eyes grew wide it was the most beautiful thing i ever made or ever could hope to make said marcus i couldnt bear to destroy it where is it marcus walked to a cluttered corner of the workshop hadrian followed him marcus cleared away a pile of implements and tattered scrolls to reveal a small cabinet covered with dust the iron latch was rusty marcus had not opened the cabinet in years it would have been too painful to look at the object it contained he managed to open the latch he reached into the cabinet he stood and held aloft the head of antinous hadrian gasped he took the head from marcus and held it in his hands he touched his lips to the marble his eyes filled with tears in the days and months that followed the emperor spent every spare moment with marcus in the workshop surrounded first by drawings and small clay figurines then by lifesize models together they strove to recreate to hadrians satisfaction the true image of antinous marcus drew and moulded and hadrian gave his critiques circling the lifesize models touching them and closing his eyes as if to summon up tactile memories telling marcus to make the chest larger or the nose slightly longer or the curvature of the calves more pronounced having sculpted antinous from life marcus trusted his memories of the youths appearance sometimes hadrians suggestions struck him as dubious but marcus did as he was told hadrian was pleased and sometimes so shaken by the verisimilitude of the image that he wept strangely to marcus their collaborative creation seemed to resemble more closely the god of his dreams than his recollection of the living antinous at last came the day of the unveiling the statue would present no surprises to hadrian since he had overseen its creation from conception nonetheless marcus wished to make a formal unveiling more for the benefit of his son than for the emperor but young lucius was late hadrian arrived ahead of the boy but he did not seem to mind waiting he strolled about the workshop fiddling with various objects and taking deep breaths caesar has much on his mind today observed marcus the two of them had grown increasingly comfortable in each others presence hadrian now regularly unburdened himself to marcus the jewish revolt said hadrian it was the problem that most preoccupied him these days its like the hydra cut off one head and two more take its place people continue to die by the tens of thousands as long as a significant number of jews persist in their belief that this firebrand simon bar kochba is their longawaited messiah there seems to be no way to suppress the revolt short of complete extermination of the sort that trajan practised in dacia but thats not possible in the case of the jews theyre scattered all over the empire the only longterm solution is to somehow assimilate these people whether they wish to be assimilated or not towards that end ive enacted a ban on their practice of amputating their foreskins for reasons which defy comprehension they attach some religious significance to this barbaric procedure its yet another way by which they deliberately set themselves apart for their own good and to put an end to these insurrections they must put aside their primitive religion and embrace the true gods like the rest of the world i understand youve renamed the province said marcus the region that was judaea is now to be called syria palestina just as jerusalem is now aelia capitolina these things make a difference names and symbols and such and caesars problems with the christians said marcus this was another concern occasionally mentioned by the emperor hadrian scoffed my travails with the christians are as nothing compared to the trouble stirred up by the jews some of my advisers lump the two groups together but such thinking is ignorant and out of date a great many christians are not and never were jews like the jews their atheism sets them apart from their neighbours but unlike the jews they seem to be quite meek meekness is actually a part of their teachings as long as their numbers remain small and they keep their heads down i think trajans policy of ask not tell not is best what does that mean exactly said marcus to whom this dictum had never quite made sense it means that roman magistrates take action against the christians only when there is a formal complaint against them no complaint no action that would seem to put a great deal of power in the hands of their neighbours noted marcus if the christians persist in their perversity then they must live or die at the discretion of the decent lawabiding majority hadrian put down the clay model he was examining and raised an eyebrow wasnt one of your relatives a christian i hardly think so said marcus with a laugh his denial was genuine marcus had never been told about his christian greatuncle oh no im quite sure about this said hadrian who had reviewed every aspect of the imperial dossier on marcus when he was deciding the fate of apollodorus as a matter of fact isnt that talisman you wear some sort of christian amulet ive always presumed it was handed down from the christian in the your family and worn by you for sentimental rather than religious reasons since you yourself clearly are not a christian a christian symbol my fascinum certainly not marcus touched the fascinum this heirloom was given to me by father in the presence of yourself and the divine trajan the fascinum long predates the first appearance of the christians calm yourself pygmalion perhaps im mistaken about your amulet nonetheless i can assure you that the brother of your grandfather was indeed a christian i cant recall his name at the moment but i know for a fact that he was executed by nero after the great fire it must have been quite a scandal at the time thats probably why you never heard about it families have a way of falling silent about the scandals in their past the children are the last to find out if they ever do if you dont believe me ask your friend suetonius the next time you see him in his research hes certain to have come across the pinarius who was a christian with respect caesar suetonius is not my friend said marcus flustered and taken aback by these revelations no didnt suetonius send you a personally inscribed copy of his imperial biographies was there anything hadrian didnt know thanks to the vast network of imperial spies marcus cleared his throat yes suetonius sent me a copy but i didnt ask for it and i swear ive never read it no you should its not bad rather smutty but i suppose the salacious details are what keep most readers scrolling forward ah but i think your son has finally arrived they turned at a sound from the vestibule amyntas entered first looking a bit shamefaced from fear that marcus would blame him for the delay before he could speak apollodora swept into the room wearing her best stola she had never forgiven hadrian for the death of her father but in his presence she had been careful never to show a trace of bitterness she was followed by lucius who at eleven was very big for his age almost as tall his father luciuss green eyes and fair hair had come from marcus but his build seemed to have come from his grandfather apollodorus glad to leave behind the emperors unsettling revelations about a christian relative marcus proceeded with the unveiling he strode to the statue and pulled away the sailcloth hadrian seemed to see the statue as if for the first time he gazed at it for a long time then reached out to touch it marcus saw on his face the same expression of awe he had displayed when he first saw the melancomas statue long ago you captured him pinarius hadrian whispered youve done the impossible now you must do it again again caesar we must make more images each slightly different so as to capture different aspects of his divinity but all as true to life as this one they can serve as models to the others who will make images of him all across the empire are you up for it pinarius nothing would please me more caesar said marcus with a quaver in his voice the prospect of dedicating his time and talent to the creation of more such images which to marcus were as much an expression of devotion to his dreamgod as to hadrians beloved filled him with happiness im glad your son is here today said hadrian to show my gratitude i want to offer a very special opportunity to young lucius recently casting horoscopes i discovered a curious fact your son was born on the very same day as one of my proteges marcus verus since the boys are exactly the same age almost to the minute i propose that we introduce your lucius to young verissimus verissimus caesar i call verus that sometimes he so loves truth that i cant resist punning on his name well if lucius and verus are compatible the two can be educated together marcus looked at lucius who seemed a bit overwhelmed at this idea i fear my son might be at a disadvantage caesar ive tried to provide good tutors for him but his education thus far could hardly have rivalled that of your protege hadrian smiled dont worry im not expecting lucius to provide competition in the fields of scholarship verus has a prodigious intellect sometimes the breadth of his knowledge surprises even me but verus also loves every kind of sport he could use a companion his own age for boxing wrestling ball games riding hunting and so forth what do you say it occurred to marcus that his son might be more than a match for young verus in any sort of athletic competition lucius was uncommonly big and strong for his age marcus looked to apollodora whose eyes were wide with excitement despite her bitterness against the emperor she could see what a tremendous opportunity was being offered to their son at the age of eleven lucius pinarius would be admitted into the innermost circle of the imperial court lucius was too young to wear a toga but he did own a very finely made tunic that marcus deemed suitable for his meeting with verus apollodora fretted that the boys recent spurts of growth had rendered the long sleeves a bit too short but marcus told her not to worry theyre not as fussy about such things at the house of the people as you might think he said the house of the people apollodora laughed no one but you calls it that anymore husband no im pretty sure all that pandering to the common folk ended when plotina died i stand corrected well then lucius are you ready for our visit to the house of hadrian a courtier met them at the entrance to the imperial palace at the appointed hour and escorted them to a lush garden with splashing fountains it was here for the time being that the statue of antinous had been installed on a stone bench beside the statue sat hadrian with the boy marcus verus who was his distant cousin and a greatgreatgrandnephew of trajan the curlyheaded verus had a prominent nose and a small mouth he had been brought up in the most rarefied atmosphere imaginable surrounded by philosophers and scholars of great renown and he carried himself with a composure beyond his years hadrian introduced verus to marcus and his son when lucius expressed his honour at such a meeting as his father had coached him to do verus shook his head the honour is mine to meet a fellow my own age whose grandfather was a friend of the great apollonius of tyana he turned to marcus did your father have many tales to tell about apollonius as a matter fact no day passed without his recitation of a story about apollonius my father called him teacher and was greatly devoted to him in life and in death verus looked genuinely excited you must share those stories with me they should be written down alas my hand was meant for a chisel not a stylus said marcus but you must dictate those stories to a slave the people who actually knew apollonius are almost all dead now adorable isnt he said hadrian who reached out to muss the boys hair verus responded with a very boyish roll of his eyes im thinking someone should sculpt him at this age perhaps you could find time to do it marcus though i hate to interrupt your work on the next statue of antinous it would be my pleasure caesar marcus looked at the boy and envisioned at once the expression he would try to capture in stone a mixture of innocence and wisdom sophistication and guilelessness i understand that your father was also a close friend of the late the boy hesitated and looked to hadrian for guidance verissimus realizes that you cannot yet have heard the news which arrived just this morning by imperial courier said hadrian epictetus is dead marcus drew a breath and lowered his eyes truly he was the very last of my fathers circle verus took marcuss hand perhaps we can find comfort in the words of epictetus himself we are disturbed not by events but by the views which we take of them is that not true even of the death of loved ones marcus smiled ruefully im not the philosopher my father was im not even sure what those words mean if you are pained by an occurrence outside yourself it is not that occurrence which disturbs you but your own judgement about it and it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now verus spoke with extraordinary conviction for one so young well spoken verissimus said hadrian he turned to marcus the genealogists tell me the boy is descended from wise king numa and i think they must be right marcus nodded how was his awkward taciturn son ever to keep up with the likes of young verus i propose that these two boys should spend some time with me at tibur said hadrian what would you say to a bit of riding and hunting lucius apollonius of tyana was opposed to the killing of animals said lucius gravely hadrian laughed excellent you and verissimus have a readymade subject for debate can a lover of philosophy also enjoy the hunt you shall come too pygmalion ive selected a site for the tomb of antinous and there are a number of other sites i want to show you for the baths the library the great pool it will be an honour caesar marcus raised his eyes to the statue of antinous the god who had brought him so much good fortune ad on the sixth day before the nones of maius marcus pinarius and his son lucius stood among the crowd of courtiers who filled the porticoes surrounding the ancient auguratorium on the palatine hill before the altar the emperor himself performed the augury to mark the passage to manhood of marcus verus who stood in the middle of the gravelstrewn courtyard wearing his first toga at fifteen however mature his intellect verus still had no beard and his delicate features were closer to those of a boy than a man hadrians beard and hair had more grey than ever and his face had an unhealthy pallor it seemed to marcus that the emperor looked considerably older than sixty it was rumoured that hadrian was suffering a serious illness he had begun construction on his own mausoleum marcus was involved in the building of the new mausoleum all the other imperial tombs are already full hadrian had told him and i have no intention of spending eternity crammed next to trajan inside the column the structure was to be a vast circular building not unlike the mausoleum of augustus in design but much larger located on the banks of the tiber across from the field of mars it seemed to marcus that hadrian could not be content unless he had some vast building project under way now that that the temple of venus and roma was at last completed along with the pantheon with its magnificent dome and the sprawling imperial villa at tibur what was left to build except his mausoleum at the dedication ceremonies for all those grand projects marcus had been among a select group of architects and artists who had received the emperors highest accolades but those honours could not compare to the one that was to be bestowed on the pinarii this day no sooner had hadrian taken the auspices for marcus verus declaring them to be highly favourable than he called out the name of lucius pinarius and asked him to step forward lucius looked down at his father at fifteen he was already slightly taller than marcus with an expression of sudden terror the boys combination of athleticism and shyness had made him an ideal companion for verus their differences complemented each other but this was no time to be timid marcus cast a look at the boy that he hoped was at once stern and supportive then gave him a tiny shove to start him on his way lucius stepped forward hesitantly at first but then with greater confidence instead of standing in place verus stepped forward to greet his friend hadrian made no objection to this lapse of decorum he had grown quite fond of lucius in recent months and it had been his idea to make the donning of the manly toga a dual ceremony including both young men however awkward he might feel wearing it lucius looked splendid in his toga marcus thought to him the boy disproved the popular notion that humanity was in decline dwindling in intellect and physical prowess with each generation it seemed to marcus that his son combined all that was best from the bloodlines of his parents and marcus could see no reason why lucius should not surpass his ancestors in every way before the most important people in roma the emperor himself took the auspices declared them favourable and announced that lucius pinarius son of marcus pinarius had attained all the privileges and duties of a citizen of the greatest city on earth among those who converged on the young men to congratulate them was the man whom hadrian had recently adopted and named as his successor lucius ceionius was in his middle thirties too old to attract the sexual attentions of the emperor but nonetheless a wildly handsome man with a statuesque physique as hadrian had once remarked to marcus pinarius in the whole empire there is no handsomer man than lucius ceionius surely thats not the reason you picked him to be your successor marcus had responded in jest dont be so certain of that hadrian said if beauty is a sign of divine favour then ceionius has it in abundance sometimes when i look at him i think ive adopted a god not a son it struck marcus that ceionius on this day did not look particularly well he had the same unhealthy pallor as hadrian and while marcus looked on the man suffered a fit of coughing so violent that he had to leave the courtyard hadrian watched him depart with a worried look someone leaned towards marcus and spoke in his ear o handsome youth the blissful vision of a no sooner glimpsed than snatched away favonius said marcus leave it to you to twist the words of virgil into an ill omen virgil i had no idea said the scurra i was quoting the emperor actually i overheard him utter those lines earlier today when poor ceionius first appeared is he seriously ill caesar seems to think so im told he cast a horoscope for ceionius and the results were most alarming poor hadrian just when he had the future all neatly planned out with the empire cordoned off and his temples finished and his mausoleum under way and the next emperor selected poof fate deals an unforeseen reversal congratulations by the way on your sons ascent to manhood and in such esteemed company the future of the pinarii looks very bright thank you marcus was irritated by the mans flippancy but managed a gracious nod almost as bright if i may say so as that curious bauble at your breast how the gold catches the sunlight marcus reached up to touch the fascinum which on this day he was wearing outside his toga for all to see since this was the last occasion on which he would ever wear it youll excuse me now he said i need to go to my son hadrian was already conducting the two young men to a private chamber just off the auguratorium for the ceremony that was to follow marcus had requested that no witnesses be present except the emperor and young verus the small quiet room was sparsely decorated dominating one wall was a bust of antinous set in a niche this too had been marcuss request that the only image present should that of the divine youth while the emperor and verus stood to one side marcus approached his son now that the public ceremony was over lucius looked quite relaxed he smiled as marcus lifted the chain over his neck and held the fascinum aloft my son youve seen this amulet many times hanging from my neck before me my father wore it and before him his father the fascinum has been in our family for many generations even before the founding of the city it has protected us guided us given us strength in times of trouble you are a man now with all the uncertainties of life ahead of you on this day i wish to pass the fascinum to you so that you may never face those uncertainties alone as it has guided me so let it now guide you and just as it was given to me in the presence of the emperor the divine trajan so i wish to give it to you here before caesar marcus placed the chain over his sons head it was strange to see the gold talisman glimmering upon another breast and for a moment marcus felt a pang of regret had his father felt the same regret when he gave up the fascinum if so he had never spoken of it and neither would marcus for a hour or so before the banquet was to begin the young men were left to themselves i dont know about you said verus but im taking off this toga and changing into something less cumbersome you shall just have to put it on again for the banquet said lucius besides i have nothing to change into you can wear one of my tunics though it may be a bit short for you no matter were men now and allowed to show our legs lets go to my rooms a statue of minerva met them as they entered veruss apartments around a corner a bust of socrates had pride of place upon a pedestal on the ceilings and walls there were no paintings of warfare or scenes of seduction or of maidens dancing or gladiators fighting indeed there were no paintings at all the walls had been coloured a placid sky blue a color that was conducive to study and philosophical discussion according to verus as they discarded their togas and put on tunics veruss attention was drawn to the fascinum at his friends breast he asked to touch it can it really be as old as your father says so the divine claudius believed verus nodded gravely few men were more knowledgeable about the distant past than the divine claudius how remarkable that this object must have been in existence in the days of king numa and even before in the age when demigods like hercules walked the earth what a wondrous thing that you have this link to your ancestors one of them must have worn it when hannibal and his elephants crossed the alps and another when the divine julius was slain by assassins where will you keep it when youre not wearing it youve seen the shrine in the vestibule of our house among the niches that display the wax masks of the ancestors theres one niche where we keep a small capsa that contains all the letters my grandfather received from apollonius of tyana and the manacle that apollonius cast off and a small bust of antinous made by my father thats where the fascinum is kept verus nodded he had asked and been allowed to read the letters from apollonius but had been rather disappointed by them a great teacher apollonius must have been a great writer he was not the letters were nothing more than brief messages of encouragement enthusiastic but without any philosophical content and frequently ungrammatical the manacle had impressed verus even less it looked like any rusty piece of iron and he secretly wondered if it was genuine as for antinous verus did not share hadrians fascination for beautiful young males and though he was too circumspect to say so he had little enthusiasm for the cult of the divine youth but the fascinum was another matter to verus it seemed a truly wondrous object a repository of all the mysteries of the past all the more intriguing because time had worn away its features yet was powerless to diminish its golden lustre lucius had shown him the fascinum it seemed to verus that he should show his friend something equally marvellous follow me he said they made their way to a part of the imperial palace that lucius had never seen before it soon became evident that they had entered a forbidden area in a whisper verus told him to be silent and whenever anyone passed verus pulled him out of sight they came to a locked door to luciuss amazement verus produced a small metal device and proceeded to pick the lock they proceeded down a long hallway and came to another locked door which verus picked with equal ease once inside verus quietly closed the door behind them they were in a stone vault narrow slits set high in the walls admitted bright beams of sunlight even before his eyes adjusted to the dimness that swallowed most of the room lucius saw that it was lined to the height of his waist with wooden cabinets and atop the cabinets were objects that shone with bright points of coloured light this is the jewel room verus whispered surrounding them was a vast collection of gemstones most were stored inside the cabinets but some of the more spectacular examples were displayed on stands or hung on the wall or simply lay atop the cabinets left there by hadrian or sabina or whatever courtier was allowed to handle such precious objects some were cut into cameos some were faceted and set as jewels into necklaces or bracelets of silver and gold some were in their natural state there were rubies and sapphires emeralds and lapis lazuli amethyst and jasper carnelian and agate tigerseye and amber hadrian didnt acquire all these in his travels did he whispered lucius oh no these have been collected by generations of emperors nero ended up in such dire straits that he sold off most of the gems he inherited but vespasian and his successors managed to recover many of them do you see that carnelian necklace queen cleopatra was wearing it the day she died augustus was furious that she killed herself and took it off her with his own hands as a trophy i never imagined such a collection existed lucius was astounded by the treasure he had seen the emperors sprawling villa go up at tibur he had stood beside his father at the dedications of the temple of venus and roma and of the pantheon the largest and grandest buildings ever constructed that the wealth of hadrian was immense he had always known but now gazing at the splendours that surrounded him he realized that the emperors fortune surpassed all reckoning very few people have ever seen this room said verus even fewer have seen this he opened a cabinet and pulled out a stone that he held between two fingers thrusting it into the nearest beam of sunlight to lucius it seemed that the stone must have come from a world of dreams it was octahedral and as large as a walnut the stone was transparent yet captured the light and cast it back again in a dazzling array of colours lucius had never seen anything like it its called a diamond said verus this is by far the largest and most perfect specimen ever found its not only beautiful but indestructible fire will not burn it no blade can cut it where did it come from we think domitian acquired it he had such a penchant for secrecy that no one knows its history but it must have come from india which is the source of all true diamonds nerva presented it to trajan as a sign of his favour trajan presented it to hadrian as a reward for leading the first legion minerva its the rarest jewel in all the collection which means in all the world its amazing said lucius i myself have little interest in gemstones said verus or in any of the other trappings of wealth material objects possess no intrinsic value only that which men assign to them and yet when i gaze upon a thing as beautiful and perfect as this i think it must in some way be a manifestation ofthat which apollonius called the divine singularity i could stare at it for hours said lucius thank you for showing it to me verus smiled and yet the most precious thing in this room is not this diamond but that object you wear upon your breast do you really think so lucius looked down at the fascinum which seemed to him a fragile crudely fashioned thing compared to the adamantine perfection of the diamond he could scarcely believe that verus was serious but it was not like his friend to joke about such a thing i truly think so i speak not just as marcus verus your friend but as verissimus who loves truth above all else ad the month of junius had been uncommonly hot the month of julius promised to be even hotter wearing his toga and wiping sweat from his brow marcus pinarius made his way to the imperial palace in answer to the emperors summons he was sweating because the day was hot he told himself a man in his fifties should be carried in a sedan on such a day rather than travel on foot but in fact marcus was also quite nervous he had not seen the emperor for months and these days a summons to the palace was a cause not for celebration but for grave misgivings hadrian was now sixtytwo his health was rapidly declining and his illness had brought out a dangerous even murderous side of his personality the vow he had made more than twenty years ago to kill no senators had fallen by the wayside an atmosphere of gloom and fear had settled over everyone who had dealings with the emperor marcus was conducted not to a reception hall but to the emperors private quarters the courtier left him in a room with a balcony perched above a garden the bright sunlight from the balcony at first blinded marcus to the contents of the room only gradually did he perceive the sumptuous furnishings the elegant statues the paintings on the walls and the fact that he was not alone a figure in silhouette was seated on a couch with his back to the sunlight for a moment marcus mistook the man for hadrian his hair and beard were much the same but the mans posture was that of a younger man marcus gasped thinking for just an instant that he was seeing ceionius who had died on the kalends of januarius it was rumoured that the mans lemur still lingered in the palace held back by the anguish of hadrians mourning but this man was older than ceionius had been and younger than hadrian perhaps in his forties and he appeared to be in the best of health despite the strained look on his face you must be marcus pinarius he said quietly im titus aurelius antoninus i dont think weve met but i believe youre acquainted with my nephew young marcus verus or rather my son as i suppose i should call him now so this was the man whom hadrian bitterly disappointed at the death of ceionius and pressed by the imminence of his own death had named to be his successor determined to control the succession even after his own death hadrian had required antoninus to adopt as heirs the son of the late ceionius and also young marcus verus verus had taken his new fathers name and so was now marcus aurelius third in the line of succession the forced adoptions had not been hadrians only gambit in his bid to control the future he seemed determined to move or remove numerous people around him like tokens on a game board in his depressed bedridden state obsessed with protecting the succession he had resorted to executing or forcing suicide on a number of men he considered too ambitious the latest and most scandalous of these deaths had been the forced suicide of his ninetyyearold brotherinlaw servianus whom hadrian suspected of seeking to advance his grandson the death of the empress sabina had also sparked a scandal some of her relatives dared to whisper that hadrian had poisoned her i was told that caesar asked for me said marcus antoninus nodded it was the first thing he requested when he woke this morning i pray that i may find caesar in better health than when i last saw him said marcus i presume thats your tactful way of inquiring about his condition youll see for yourself soon enough try not to be shocked at his appearance his entire body is swollen with fluid his face is so bloated you may hardly recognize him they say something similar happed to trajan near the end may i inquire about caesars state of mind antoninus gave him a piercing look youve known him a very long time so i wont lie to you in recent days hes tried several times to take his own life first he ordered a slave to stab him when the slave refused he tried to stab himself but he was too weak then he sought poison from a doctor caesar asks me to be his murderer said the poor man and hadrian quoted sophocles to him i ask you to be my healer the only physician who can cure my suffering the words of hercules from the women of trachis dying in agony and begging his son to set him afire the doctor refused to give him poison whereupon caesar ordered that the man should be executed along with everyone else who had thwarted his suicide attempts marcus wiped fresh beads of sweat from his brow and was the doctor executed of course not i simply removed the offending persons from caesars presence and replaced them with others they all have strict orders to keep close watch on caesar and prevent any further suicide attempts meanwhile since his physicians have failed to cure him caesar has called upon a series of wonderworkers and magicians mostly charlatans i have no doubt but just lately caesar seems a little better he insists that hes well enough to travel he intends to depart for baiae tomorrow he says the sea air will improve his health before he goes he wants to see you antoninus escorted him to the door of the bedchamber he opened it but stayed where he was indicating that marcus should enter alone curtains had been pulled to block the sunlight by the glow of several lamps marcus saw the grotesquely swollen figure of the emperor on the bed a statue of antinous not quite lifesize stood on a pedestal at the foot of the bed looking down on the emperor as antoninus had warned him the edema made hadrian almost unrecognizable his cheeks and chin and even his forehead were massively swollen while his eyes and mouth looked small and pinched but when he spoke his voice was the same except that a hint of his old spanish accent kept breaking through pygmalion is that you it is caesar wished to see me yes come closer youre looking well pinarius no dont bother to return the compliment i shudder to think what i must look like youll notice that antoninus has thoughtfully removed all the mirrors from this room hadrian managed a weak laugh marcus was surprised to find him in such good spirits was this the bitter man who had been ordering executions right and left i called you here pinarius because i wanted to thank you for all youve done for me over the years and especially for your service to the worship of antinous the divine youth has no follower more devoted than you the images youve created will outlast us all the flesh is all we know in this life but the flesh grows old and withers and rots as i know only too well only perfection is immortal and we were blessed by the god to witness perfection and to touch it you and i speaking wearied him hadrian paused to rest for a while then went on have a look at the object on the table over there by the window open the curtains if you need more light on the table marcus saw a model of the new mausoleum when he parted the curtains he saw that the window framed a distant view of the building itself on the far side of the tiber construction was well under way but whatever decoration the emperor had in mind for the top of the huge circular building had remained a mystery until now the top of the model was fitted with a statue of hadrian riding a chariot pulled by four horses marcus gaped judging by the scale of the model the quadriga sculpture would be one of the largest statues ever made though not as tall the sheer mass of the thing would rival the colossus of sol what do you think pygmalion may i ask who made this model caesar i made it myself with these swollen fingers of mine yes its a crude thing but i never called myself a sculptor the details ill leave to a true artist to you pinarius so what do you think are the proportions of the statue to the mausoleum correctly rendered closely enough marcus frowned the mausoleum rises to almost sixty feet this statue is very nearly as tall as the structure upon which it stands is caesar aware of just how large the fullscale piece would be i am but how is such a huge monument to be built how is it to be transported and assembled atop the mausoleum the enormous amount of bronze required i leave those petty details to you pygmalion hadrian snapped his face turned dark red and his eyes were reduced to two baleful points of light for a moment marcus imagined that the mans head might actually burst like a grape squeezed between two fingers then hadrian laughed listen to me did you hear that accent thicker than trajans when i think of all those hours i spent with my elocution teachers reading cicero aloud until i was hoarse numas balls i havent sounded so much like a spaniard since i was a boy that was so long ago he closed his eyes and drifted off marcus stared at him for a long time what would apollonius of tyana have made of hadrian certainly he was infinitely better than domitian and more knowledgeable of philosophy than trajan but if philosophy reconciled a man to life and prepared him to face death then in hadrian all the lessons of philosophy came to naught as death approached he was more tied to the material world than ever craving a monument larger than anyone elses and determined to decide who would rule after him even to the second generation life obsessed him death to him was unacceptable his own death no less than the death of his beloved antinous whom hadrian had sought to keep alive by populating the whole world with his image perhaps no emperor could truly be a philosopher since his duty was to care so deeply about the material world and the mortals in it but hadrian had come as close as anyone perhaps hadrian with all his flaws was as good a ruler as the world could ever hope to see would antoninus do a better job would young marcus aurelius if he ever came to power reflexively marcus reached to touch the fascinum but it was not at his breast the fascinum belonged to lucius now to the divine youth who looked over him he whispered aloud i am a fortunate man to have lived in such an age and under such an emperor whats that hadrian muttered he opened his eyes are you still here pygmalion i am caesar i almost forgot to tell you ive made you a senator i caesar why not there are some in the senate wholl say that a mere sculptor has no place among them who cares what those useless creatures think i say youre a senator and so you are youve served me as well as any general or magistrate better than most and never forget that your grandfather was elevated to the senate by the divine claudius and that his father was a senator and that your greatgreatgrandfather was one of the three heirs of julius caesar so from now on you are senator pinarius except when i make a slip and call you senator pygmalion marcus smiled thank you caesar ive also named you to the priesthood of antinous i a priest religious service is in your blood you come from a long line of augurs in essence youre already a priest of antinous so you might as well enjoy the title and the stipend along with the duties what duties you will make more images of antinous so as to propagate his worship ill do my best caesar hadrian closed his eyes his breathing slowed marcus thought he slept but then he began to speak very softly he was reciting a poem perhaps he had composed it himself marcus had never heard it before sweet soul that inhabits this clay soon you will flit away where will you go to what place dark and cold and stripped of grace never again to laugh and play hadrian sighed and fell asleep marcus quietly left the room the next day the emperor and his retinue left for baiae ten days later word reached roma that hadrian was dead antoninus who had been running the state in caesars absence departed at once for baiae to look after the remains and bring them back to roma it fell to young marcus aurelius to oversee preparations for the funeral rites including the gladiator games in honour of the dead upon his return to roma antoninus was recognized as emperor by unanimous declaration of the senate may he be even luckier than augustus they shouted may he be even better than trajan hadrians final months left a bitter taste in the mouths of many senators there was a movement to annul many of his final acts including the naming of several of his favourites to places in the senate and other high positions antoninus said these annulments would dishonour the memory of his adoptive father and refused to allow them he insisted that the senate should deify hadrian despite widespread reluctance thus marcus pinarius retained his status as a senator and a priest of antinous and the late emperor became the divine hadrian ad the construction and decoration of the mausoleum of hadrian was at last complete on this day the late emperors remains were to be officially interred to reach the mausoleum a new bridge had been built across the tiber the bridge offered an impressive view of the huge structure and it was here that the emperor antoninus and a host of dignitaries assembled for the ceremony along with hadrian the remains of the empress sabina and of hadrians onetime heir ceionius would also be interred for marcus pinarius dressed in his senatorial toga the occasion marked the pinnacle of his long career it also provided a rare moment to simply stop and catch his breath marcus had never been so busy in his life not even during the hectic years of the dacian campaigns when he was apollodoruss assistant he regularly attended meetings of the senate in roma he made frequent trips to the villa at tibur to oversee the worship of antinous and he made new images of the divine youth whenever the inspiration struck him but most of his efforts in the last few years had been consumed by the design and construction of the massive statue atop hadrians mausoleum the images of antinous were unquestionably the most beautiful of all the works marcus had made the closest he would ever come to creating perfection but the quadriga statue with hadrian was by far the grandest constructing a work on such an immense scale had been one challenge creating a sculpture of sufficient grandeur to properly honour hadrian was another as he stood on the new bridge listening with only one ear to the endless speeches and invocations marcus gazed up at the gigantic sculptural group and felt tremendous satisfaction apollodorus would have said that the statue was much too big its bulk reducing the mausoleum beneath to a mere pedestal making the whole structure appear topheavy but marcus had resisted the temptation to revise hadrians model and had stayed true to the emperors wishes though he had employed various tricks of perspective to give the figures a more pleasing proportion when seen from the ground over the last few days marcus had ventured all over the seven hills and out on the roads that radiated from the city seeing what the sculpture looked like from various viewpoints and distances for sheer prominence hadrian in his quadriga rivalled the temple of jupiter atop the capitoline the colossus of sol and even the flavian amphitheatre indeed marcus had chanced upon one vantage point north of the city from which nothing of roma could be seen except the quadriga the illusion of seeing a titanic figure riding a gigantic chariot across a landscape devoid of humanity had been complete as an artist marcus had known no moment of greater satisfaction not even when gazing upon his images of the divine youth next to marcus stood apollodora her features were those of an aging eastern beauty but she displayed the inscrutable expression of a true roman matron marcus had no idea what she was feeling it had been a long time since she had expressed resentment or grief about her fathers death next to her was lucius who had continued to grow until he was a head taller than his father lucius was wearing the fascinum though the amulet was hidden under the folds of his toga he saw his son exchange glances with young verus or aurelius as everyone now called him the emperor himself had recently acquired a new cognomen he was antoninus pius now so named by the senate ostensibly in recognition of his filial piety in discharging his duties to his adoptive father including his insistence that the senate vote divine honours to hadrian but many people thought the granting of the cognomen pius was to thank antonius for saving the lives of a number of senators whom hadrian would otherwise have put to death in the last days of his reign i had rather save the life of one innocent citizen than take the lives of a thousand enemies antoninus had remarked he had none of hadrians restlessness or brooding nature he was known for a placid temperament and a gentle sense of humour under his benevolent rule the bitterness that had marked the end of hadrians reign had almost faded from memory at last the speeches and rituals were done antoninus pius carried the urn containing the ashes of hadrian across the bridge and entered the mausoleum in the vestibule a niche housed a statue of hadrian to the right a passageway lined with marble sloped gently upwards as it followed a spiral course the ramp made a full circle ending in a chamber just above the entrance and from this room another passage led to a circular chamber at the very center of the building niches had been carved in the wall to make room for the urns containing the ashes of hadrian sabina and ceionius the chamber was large enough to provide a resting place for many emperors to come thus the mausoleum was both a monument to the past and an expression of faith in the future men died but the empire of roma would go on and on here was a place to house the remains of generations not yet born marcus watched as antoninus placed the urn in its niche he felt the sense of sadness and release that comes with the ending of an era hadrian the inveterate traveler had reached the end of his final journey a banquet followed exhausted from standing all day marcus excused himself early apollodora left with him but lucius stayed behind saying that he wanted to keep aurelius company how fortunate we are that those two have become such close friends marcus said to apollodora as the litter carried them home for that happy outcome as for so much else we have the divine hadrian to thank apollodora made no reply she only nodded and closed her eyes as if she was too tired to speak when they arrived home she went directly to bed despite his weariness marcus felt restless it was often so on days when he was called upon to take part in ceremonies and rituals such events filled him with a nervous excitement that made it hard to sleep he paced his garden for a while then went to his library amyntas knowing his masters habits and anticipating his needs had left a lamp burning for him marcus surveyed the scrolls in their pigeonholes identified by dangling tags and on a whim pulled out a volume from the late suetoniuss imperial biographies suetonius had recently come up in conversation with young marcus aurelius who had expressed astonishment that marcus had never read the mans work are you telling me that you possess one of the very first copies given to you by suetonius himself and youve never read it unbelievable really you must read them marcus located the other volumes and piled them on the table then began to skim through the text from the sternly moralistic augustus power had passed to the dour tiberius who had ended in utter debauchery and left the world at the mercy of the monstrous caligula whose bloody death had led to the reign of the hapless claudius cuckolded by one wife messalina and probably murdered by another agrippina who had put her son nero on the throne and been rewarded with death after nero had come four emperors in quick succession galba otho vitellius and then vespasian the bland but competent general who had left the empire to his sons first the popular titus then the suspicious and cruel domitian there suetoniuss account ended but marcus needed no historian to tell him about the reigns of nerva trajan and hadrian marcus could see why the biographies were so popular the stories told by suetonius were brutal funny and shocking the people he described were for the most part appalling had caligula really given his horse incitatus a stall of marble a manger of ivory purple blankets and a collar of precious stones all in preparation for making him a consul had nero really tried to kill his mother by putting her on a collapsing boat had domitian invited guests to a black room where he treated them like men already dead and then released them making a joke of their despair what amazing and terrible times marcuss father and grandfather and greatgrandfather had lived through and how very little marcus knew about their lives as the first faint light of dawn began to emanate from the garden marcus realized that he had been reading all night he went to bed thinking that an hour of sleep would be better than none and dreamed of mad emperors when he woke despite having slept so briefly marcus felt strangely energetic after a leisurely breakfast with his wife and son he invited lucius to take a walk with him put on your toga he said and wear the fascinum is this a special occasion father any walk across the city of roma is a special occasion a litter carried them across the field of mars and deposited them at the new bridge that crossed the tiber marcus wanted to gaze at the mausoleum without the distractions of a crowded ceremony he had done so on many previous occasions but that had been before hadrians remains were placed inside the building seemed different to him now more complete hadrian had desired a monument for the ages marcus had no doubt that the emperors sepulchre would still be standing a thousand years hence father and son walked to the pantheon they stepped inside to admire the statues of the gods and the extraordinary sense of light and space created by the lofty dome and the oculus that pierced it here too was a monument that would surely stand for all time a worthy tribute to the gods and goddesses it celebrated their stroll took them to the flavian amphitheatre the greatest gathering place ever created where all roma came to see and be seen and to witness spectacles of life and death nearby stood the colossus of sol once a statue of nero which was the closest nero had come to being deified marcus remembered the ambition of apollodorus to construct an equally colossal statue of luna that dream had died forever along with his fatherinlaw apollodorus was hardly ever talked about in their household due to the circumstances of his death it occurred to marcus that lucius knew very little about either of his grandfathers marcus decided that he must make a point of telling his son all he knew about their forebearers even the mysterious greatuncle who had been a christian from the amphitheatre it was only a short walk to the temple of venus and roma for years marcus had labored to realize hadrians novel conception of a twofronted temple the result was surely one of the most splendid buildings on earth in the sanctuary of roma priests were performing a rite in honour of the city in the sanctuary of venus a newly wedded couple burned incense at the altar praying to the goddess to bless their union look how happy they are said marcus youre of an age to marry now son should i expect that someday soon perhaps father the young man actually blushed thanks to his friendship with young aurelius chances were good that lucius might join the house of pinarius in marriage with one of the most prominent families in the city perhaps once again the pinarii might serve as consuls and vestals as they had in the days of the kings and the first centuries of the republic the steps of the temple took them down to the sacred way they walked through the ancient forum found as bricks but left clad in marble by augustus and on to the much grander forum of trajan where they ascended the spiral stairway to the top of trajans column this was marcuss favourite view of the city he remembered the day the statue of trajan had been lowered into place when disaster had very nearly struck how young he had been then on the way back to their house on the palatine marcus on a whim decided to drop by the senate house though there was no meeting that day with lucius beside him he burned a bit of incense at the altar of victory and said a prayer goddess grant victory to roma and defeat to her enemies watch over the empire which you delivered to augustus protect roma from all those who would cause her harm whether from without or from within why had he asked lucius to take this walk with him reading suetonius had given him the idea the details were all a jumble in his head but marcus had been left with a vague impression that the world had progressed since the days of augustus in the rush of daily life one tended to forget what a special place roma was one tended to forget too how strange was the past and how much better in every way was the world of the present moment thinking of the outlandish tales in suetonius remembering the stories his father had told him and reflecting on his own memories of a life that had begun in slavery but delivered him into the company of emperors and the care of the divine youth it seemed to marcus that the world had passed through a series of terrible trials to arrive at something resembling a perfect state or as perfect as mortals could make it he had done his part to create the stable contented truly civilized world that would be inherited by his sons generation time would pass and the world of hadrian would surely give way to the world of marcus aurelius and then what standing before the altar of victory with his son beside him senator marcus pinarius felt a rush of optimism what did the future hold even the gods had no way of knowing authors note empire is a novel about life in the city of rome from the reign of augustus the first emperor to the height of the empire under hadrian it spans the years ad to in a previous novel roma i followed the same family line from the origin of the city to the rise of augustus and the end of the roman republic in some ways the time span portrayed in empire is one of the most accessible periods of history the major historians including suetonius tacitus and plutarch are widely available to readers around the world in the original latin or greek or in numerous translations and even the most minor written sources inscriptions fragments of poems etc can be tracked down by a determined reader the archaeological evidence is very rich the entire city of pompeii was preserved when vesuvius buried it in ad some of the major buildings of the era are still standing such as the pantheon and excavations in the city of rome continue to yield fresh finds like the chamber believed to be the lupercale of augustus the discovery of which was announced in january more evidence comes from numismatics and worldwide trade in roman coins on the internet has made large sharp images of even the most obscure coins widely accessible with all these sources to draw on the period is much favoured by modern historians who produce more books every year about the roman empire than any person could ever hope to read and yet for the novelist the period poses a special problem the emperors or rather emperorcentricism when i wrote roma i faced a very different challenge the sources of information for the first thousand years of the city are far more limited yet the narrative offered by those sources is almost unimaginably rich legends of demigods and heroes stories of social upheaval and violent class struggle history as a pageant of powerful families factions and personalities all striving to fulfill their particular destinies the challenge was somehow to find room for this teeming cast of characters in a single novel with the end of the republic and the rise of autocratic rule the storyline changes class conflict and individual heroes and villains recede its all about the emperors their personalities their families their sexual habits their often flamboyant lives and their sometimes bloody deaths the story of rome becomes a sequence of biographies of the men who ruled the empire everything and everyone else is secondary to the autocrat thats alright if you want the emperors to be the focus of your fiction as in robert gravess i claudius or marguerite yourcenars memoirs of hadrian but autocracies where all power is concentrated in very few hands where even the boldest generals serve at the whim of their master and even the best poets bend their talents to flatter the autocrat do not produce the kind of largerthanlife heroes who populated roma like coriolanus or scipio africanus instead stripped of any hope of being able to affect the course of human events or even their own lives people seek diversion in spectacle and empowerment through magic or they turn inwards pursuing mental or spiritual enlightenment rather than military glory or political action such a milieu makes for a very different sort of story than the one told in roma heroes and villains give way to survivors and seekers its popular these days to compare rome to the united states but life in the roman empire was probably more like life in the repressive soviet union the soviet empire never found its trajan or hadrian but its not hard to picture stalin as domitian readers of empire who wish to read the original sources can begin with suetonius who wrote biographies of the first twelve caesars from julius to domitian plutarch wrote biographies of otho and galba tacitus in his annals and histories wrote about the period from tiberius to the year of four emperors we have no ancient biography of nerva or trajan but the thread is picked up in a work called the historia augusta which tells us about hadrian and his successors given the biases and methods of these ancient authors there is reason to doubt the veracity of all these works making sense of their mixture of the true and nottrue keeps modern historians busy dio cassius is another important source though the books of his roman history that cover the period after claudius survive only in fragments and in abridged form josephuss the jewish war describes the bitter conflict between rome and jerusalem plinys natural history is full of historical details hopefully more accurate than his scientific observations the letters written by his nephew pliny the younger give us a vivid portrait of his times including the eruption of vesuvius the paranoid reign of domitian and trajans ask not tell not policy regarding the troublesome christians our major source for the life of apollonius of tyana is a fanciful account by philostratus who lived a hundred years later purportedly a biography it might better be called a novel poets and playwrights also provide many historical details and images of daily life under augustus we have virgil horace and ovid under nero petronius seneca and lucan under later emperors quintilian martial and juvenal the joke about two fifteenyearolds versus one thirtyyearold comes from the oldest known joke book a greek text called the philogelos the laughterlover i first heard it from mary beard when she delivered the annual sather lecture series at the university of california at berkeley in the joke as originally recorded does not mention trajan but it suits him a later emperor julian made his own joke about trajan in his satire the caesars when trajan visits the olympians zeus had better look out if he wants to keep ganymede for himself the sophist dio of prusa who appears in the novel is better known as dio chrysostom goldenmouthed an epithet applied to him by later generations it is dio in his discourse who tells us that sporus had something to do with the death of nero who otherwise might have continued to reign this is j w cohoons translation with italics added it was solely on account of this wantonness of his however that he nero lost his life i mean the way he treated the eunuch sporus for the latter in anger disclosed the emperors designs to his retinue and so they revolted from him and compelled him to make away with himself as best he could indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be emperor for all time seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive where poems are quoted in the novel the translations are my own tacitus annals tells us that lucan spoke his own verse as his dying words historians conjecture he quoted pharsalia the poem by statius casting earinus as the cupbearer of domitian is silvae earinuss song is from lucretiuss de rerum natura on the nature of things a previous version appeared in my novel arms of nemesis martials poem celebrating the arrival of trajan in rome is epigrams the lines by virgil used to describe ceionius are from the aeneid the poem by hadrian is known to us from his biography in the historia augusta almost all the sources cited above can be found in english translation and in searchable formats on the internet one merely has to open a search engine and start looking my own research led me almost daily to bill thayers site lacuscurtius a remarkable fountainhead of information that includes the texts of suetonius tacitus plutarch the historia augusta dio cassius dio chrysostom samuel ball platners a topographical dictionary of ancient rome william smiths a dictionary of greek and roman antiq uities and much more beautifully presented and intelligently annotated the home page is here httppenelopeuchicagoeduthayereroman home html another site of special interest is jona lenderings livius wwwliviusorg his illustrated text of philostratuss life of apollonius has become an old dear friend i plan to post more links of interest to the readers of empire at my own website wwwstevensaylorcom in uncertain times longtime relationships matter more than ever keith kahla has been my editor since alan nevins my agent since and rick solomon my partner since thank you all and special thanks to my friend gaylan dubose author of farrago latina who kindly read and commented on the galleys another old dear friend though we never met is the late michael grant when i was a boy growing up in goldthwaite texas grants were the first serious books about the ancient world i encountered as my interest grew i discovered more of his works wherever my curiosity led it seemed there was a book by michael grant on the subject from biographies of cleopatra julius caesar nero and jesus to books about the etruscans gladiators roman coinage and the ancient historians themselves it was grants translation and notes for ciceros murder trials specifically the oration for sextus roscius that inspired to me write my first novel roman blood catilinas riddle the venus throw and a murder on the appian way upon which grant kindly commented were inspired by his translations of cicero in selected political speeches deep into my research for empire i found myself without a compass in the brambles of the roman thoughtworld where astrology stoicism the ancient gods and the new cults all become tangled together it was grant who showed me a path with two brilliant books the world of rome and the climax of rome with gratitude for all that michael grant has given me and continues to give me i dedicate this book to his memory
