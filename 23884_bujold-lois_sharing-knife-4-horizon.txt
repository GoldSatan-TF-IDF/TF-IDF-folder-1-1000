the sharing knife volume four horizon lois mcmaster bujold the drowntown day market was in full spate fawns nostrils flared at the strong smells fish clams critters with twitching legs like giant crawdads packed in seaweed frying funnel cakes boiling crabs dried fruit cheeses piles of used clothing not well laundered chickens goats sheep horses mixed with it all the damp tang of the river gray stretching so wide its farther shore became a flat blur in the winter morning light the leadcolored water shimmered in silence beyond the bright busy blot of folks collected under the bluffs that divided graymouths uptown from its noisierand fawn had to admit more noisome riverside the muddy banks were lined with flatboats at the ends of their journeys keelboats preparing new starts and fishing and coastal vessels that came and went more in rhythm with the stilltenmilesdistant sea than with the rivers moods the streets dodged crookedly around goodssheds rivermens taverns and shacksall built of dismantled flatboats or in some cases not dismantled but drawn ashore intact on rollers by oxen and allowed to settle into the soil the owners of the latter claimed to be all ready for the next flood that would try and fail to wash the smells and mess of drowntown out to sea while uptown looked down dryskirted it seemed a strange way to live how had she ever thought of the rocky creek at the foot of her familys farm back north as a river fawn shoved her basket up her arm nudged her companion remo and pointed look theres some new lakewalkers here this morning at the other end of the square where all the bigger animals were displayed by their hopeful owners two women and a man tended a string of half a dozen leggy horses the three all wore lakewalker dress riding trousers sturdy boots shirts and leather vests and jackets not so different in kind from the farmers around them yet somehow distinctive more distinctive was their hair worn long in decorated braids their height and their air of discomfort to be surrounded by so many people who werent lakewalkers upon reflection fawn wondered if anyone else here realized the standoffishness was discomfort or if they only thought it highnosed disdain she would have seen it that way once mm said remo unenthusiastically i suppose you want to go talk to them of course fawn dragged him toward the far end of the market the man pulled a horse out of the string and held it for a farmer who bent and ran his hands over its legs the two young women looked toward fawn and remo as they approached their eyes widened a bit at remo whose height clothes and long black braid also proclaimed him a lakewalker patroller did their groundsenses reached out to touch the strangerkinsman or did they keep them closed against the painful ground noise of the surrounding farmers the southern lakewalkers fawn had seen so far tended to lighter skin and hair than their northern cousins and these two were no exception the taller womangirlshe seemed not so very much older than fawn anyhowhad hair in a single thick plait as tawny as a bobcat pelt her silveryblue eyes were bright in her fineboned face the shorter woman had redbrown braids wreathing her head and coppery eyes in a round face dusted with freckles fawn thought they might be patrol partners like remo and barr they seemed unlikely to be sisters morning fawn called cheerfully looking up at them the top of her own dark curls came up just past the middle of remos chest and not much farther on these women at almostnineteen fawn had given up hope of gaining further inches except maybe around and resigned herself to a permanent crick in her neck the reddishhaired woman returned a nod the bobcat blonde seeming uncertain how to take the odd pair addressed herself to a height halfway between them morning you all interested in a horse weve some real fine bloodstock here strong hooves one of these could carry a man all the way up the tripoint trace and never pull up lame she gestured toward the string well brushed despite their winter coats who gazed back and flicked their tufted ears beyond the lakewalker man trotted the horse toward and away from the farmer who stood hands on hips frowning judiciously i thought lakewalkers only sold off their culls to farmers said fawn innocently the redheads slight flinch was more from guilt than insult fawn thought some horse traders suppressing a grin she went on anyhow no at least not today what i was wondering was what camp you folks hailed from and if you have any real good medicine makers there the blonde replied at once in a practicedsounding tone lakewalkers cant treat farmers oh i know all about that fawn tossed her head im not asking for myself two braided heads turned toward remo who blushed remo hated to blush hed said because the awkwardness of it always made him blush worse than the original spur fawn watched his deepening tinge with fascination she could not sense the flick of questing groundsenses but she had no doubt that a couple went by just then no im not sick either remo said its not for us are you two together asked the blonde silverblue eyes narrowing in a less friendly fashion lovers together fawn guessed she meant to imply which lakewalkers were emphatically not supposed to be with farmers yes no not like that fawns a friend said remo the wife of a friend he added in hasty emphasis we still cant help you medicine makers cant fool with farmers the redhead seconded her companion dags a lakewalker fawn shouldered forward keeping herself from clutching the lakewalker wedding braid circling her left wrist under her sleeve or brandishing it leading to the eternal explanation and defense of its validity and hes not sick exactly he used to be a patroller but he thinks he has a calling now for making he already knows lots and he can do some some amazing things which is why he needs a real good guide to help him along his next step whatever it is even dag did not seem sure to fawns concerned eyes the blonde turned her confused face to remo youre not from around these parts are you are you an exchange patroller neeta said the redhead with a proud gesture at the blonde is just back from two years exchange patrolling in luthlia the blonde shrugged modestly you dont have to tell everyone we meet tavia no im not exchanging exactly said remo we came down from oleana on a flatboat got here about a week back im ive fawn waited with grim interest to see how he would describe himself run away from home deserted joined captain dag nocamps muleheaded campaign to save the world from itself he gulped and fell back on my names remo a tilt of the braidwreathed head and a bouncing hand gesture invited him to continue with his tent and camp names but he merely pressed his lips together in an unfelt smile tavia shrugged and went on we came down from new moon cutoff camp yesterday to sell off some cuhorses and to pick up the weeks courier packet clearly identifying herself and her partner to this tall dark northern stranger as patroller women carrying mail between camps being a patrol task fawn wondered if shed recognize patroller flirting if she saw it and if it would be as dire as patroller humor the best medicine maker in the district is at new moon tavia continued but i dont think hes taking apprentices that would be arkady waterbirch fawn hazarded the one they say is a groundsetter that last had been a new term to fawn but the local lakewalkers seemed to set great store by it at the redheads raised eyebrows she explained ive been asking around for the past few days whenever i saw a lakewalker in the market they always start by telling about the makers in their own camps but they all end by mentioning this arkady fellow tavia nodded makes sense why is he not taking apprentices fawn persisted all the medicine makers shed ever met had seemed hungry to find new talent for their craft well unless that talent was trailing a farmer bride is he full up she added conscientiously not that dags looking to be an apprentice necessarily he might just want to um talk the two women exchanged guarded looks neeta said youd think arkady would be looking for a new apprentice about now im not so sure he was pretty upset about sutaw he took a lot of shafts about it he wasnt even there thats the complaint that stings the most i gather uncertain if the girls would explain this camp gossip to a mere farmer fawn nudged remo he cast her down a pained look but dutifully asked what happened tavia rubbed her round chin and frowned a couple of months back one of the youngsters at new moon was badly mauled by a gator when his friends ran to the medicine tent for help arkady was out seeing another patient so his apprentice sutaw went to take the boy on he groundlocked himself and died of the shock when the boy did remo winced fawn quelled a chill in her belly remo said wasnt there anyone else there to break the lock the boys mother but she waited too long some other youngsters but of course they couldnt realize there was a lot of bad feeling after between the parents of the mauled boy and sutaws tentkin but its pretty much settled down now arkadys been keeping to himself not that you can tell the difference said neeta he always was as grim as a knife maker maybe a new apprentice would be good for him she smiled at remo your friend could ask i suppose but youd likely better warn him old arkadys kind of difficult sometimes yeah remo shot an ironic look at fawn thatd be right interesting the two girls from new moon cutoff were picturing dag as a young patroller like remo fawn realized she decided not to try to explain the more difficult aspects of her lakewalker husband hes not banished not really the new moon man finished counting coins into his wallet from the farmer slapped the horse on the rump in friendly farewell as it was led away and turned back toward his companions fawn was reminded that her market basket ought to be piled high and handed off to remo to lug by now well thank you fawn dipped her knees ill pass the word along the two returned nods the shorter girls bemused the taller blondes a trifle grudging though both watched after remo with considering glances as fawn led him off across the square once more but their attention was soon diverted as another potential customer strolled up to eye the horses remo looked back over his shoulder and sighed in regret barr would have charmed their socks off fawn dimpled only their socks id think barr would be more ambitious least to hear him tell it remo blushed again but protested theyre patroller girls theyd keep him in line but after a longish glum moment added if they wanted to fawn shook her head smiling come on remo cheer up we got us a wedding party to fix a flash of color caught her eye and she stepped along to a fruit cart to bargain for blocks of dried persimmon and bright round oranges packed in straw both astonishing southern fruits she had tasted for the first time only a few days ago another graymouth woman sold fawn a jar of molasses sweet as the maple syrup cooked up on the bluefield farm each spring if with a much stronger stranger flavor it would go well with biscuits fawn thought or maybe with something using up that last barrel of wrinkling apples that had ridden with them all the way from oleana so said remo thoughtfully as they made their way to the next vendor on fawns mental list if dag wants to find himself a medicine maker that much why isnt he doing the asking around fawn bit her lip youve heard him talking about it havent you oh sure couple of times hes said even more to me but dags a doer not a talker so if he keeps talking but doesnt do it seems to me somethings wrong somewhere what her steps slowed hes scared i guess dag are you joking not physically scared some other kind of scared i dont have the words for it but i can feel it scared he wont get the answers he wants maybe scared hell get the answers he doesnt want hm said remo doubtfully as they wended back to the riverbank and up the row of flatboats to where the fetch was tied fawns thoughts reverted to the horrific tale of the groundlocked apprentice that could be dag all right a youngster in danger a desperate fight for survivaldespite being partnerless he would dive right in and not come out with him it wouldnt even be courage itd be a blighted habit when dag had first talked about giving up patrolling to become a medicine maker to farmers it had seemed a wonderful plan to fawn it would be a safer line of work it wouldnt take him away from her and he could do it all on his own without needing other lakewalkers without needing other lakewalkers to accept her to put it bluntly all of these promised benefits appeared to be untrue on closer looksee my thoughts are all in a tangle dag had complained to her what if it wasnt just his thoughts what if it was his ground as well which would be no surprise after all the chancy groundwork hed been doing lately miracles and horrors maybe he really needed another maker to help straighten it all out groundsetter fawn rolled the word over in her mind it sounded mysterious and promising her chin ducked in a firm nod as her feet rapped across the fetchs gangplank the wagon roads from the lower to the upper halves of graymouth wound around the far ends of the long bluff but several sets of stairs zigzagged more breathlessly up the steep slope they were built inevitably of old flatboat timbers generously enough for folks to pass four abreast in places dag turned his head for a quick glimpse of the busy riverside laid out below with the gleaming river receding into level haze in both directions he breathed in the cool air of this midwinter noon contemplating the array of people about to officially become part of well his family he supposed tent bluefield the growth of it had happened so gradually over the weeks of their disastrous quest dag was almost shocked to look back and realize how far theyd come and not just in river miles yet here we all are the fetchs party climbed two by two in the lead wheezed berrys uncle bo gnarled riverman the one member of the young flatboat bosss family back in clearcreek who had volunteered to come help her on this long journey beside him thumped hod an arm ready to boost bo along but dag judged the wheezing misleading bo was as tough as the old boot leather that he resembled and the knife slash in his belly was almost fully healed hod had become far more than a mere boat hand after all their shared adventures being as near as madenonevermind to adopted into the fetchs family berrys elevenyearold brother hawthorn came next his pet raccoon riding on his shoulder both boy and animal sniffing the air in brighteyed curiosity there had been some argumentation over whether a raccoon was a proper ornament to a wedding party but the creature had ridden with them all the way from oleana and had become something of a boats mascot over the downriver weeks dag was just glad no one had extended the argument to daisygoat equally faithful and far more useful a bit more of hawthorns swinging wrist stuck out of his shirtsleeve than when dag had first met him and dag didnt think it was because the cloth had shrunk with its rare washings when his strawblond head finally grew to overtop that of his sister berry he would be an impressive young man three more years dag gave it forever hawthorn moaned dag tried to remember when three years had seemed forever next the bride herself supported by fawn fawn had spent a good long time earlier this morning with her clever fingers plaiting berrys straight hair usually tied at her nape up into lakewalkerstyle wedding braids somewhere in the drowntown day market fawn had found fresh winter flowers either local to these southern climes or grown under glass dag was not sure shed arranged all the big white blooms she could fit in around berrys strawgold topknot with ivy trailing down in the silky fall of hair behind her own hair shed gathered into a jaunty horsetail at her crown with sprigs of scarlet flowers seeming to glow against the dark curls climbing behind the two women dag enjoyed the effect there had been no time for new bride clothes in these hasty preparations so far from home but there had been a lot of laundry done on the fetch yesterday after fawn had returned from the market with remo shabby and travelworn the whole partys workaday garments might be but they were all clean and mended as they reached a turn in the stairs and reversed direction fawns little hand gripped berrys in a gesture of encouragement berrys workhardened fingers looked unusually cold and pale dag had seen berry face down raging shoals snagging sandbars rough rivermen sly goodsdealers murderous bandits knife fights heartbreak and hangings high water and low as the riverfolk put it with unflagging courage any who would dare chuckle at her prewedding nerves had never faced a wedding ceremony themselves dag decided fawns brother whit climbing beside dag had chuckled merrily at his sister and dag six months ago when theyd tied their knots in west blue he wasnt laughing now and the corners of dags mouth tucked up at the pure justice of the moment no one looking at fawn and whit together would take them for anything other than brother and sister even before they opened their mouths both had the same dark curls and clear skin and though whit topped fawn by a head he was still a sawedoff bluefield more height he would likely never gain but his shoulders had broadened this fall as the strain on his shirt seams testified and without losing his stillsometimesannoying humor his eyes were graver more thoughtful more than once lately dag had seen him start to let fly with a witty or halfwitty barb then stop and swallow it instead he too had come a long way from west blue enough to be ready for his wedding day no probably not few folks ever were enough to be ready for all the days that followed that also was a matter of learnasyougo in dags experience but i think he will not betray her he sent an encouraging glint of a smile down at his brotherinlaw in farmer parlance tentbrother in lakewalker terms and thought that whit had met the tests of both roles whit put his shoulders back and managed a ghastly grin in return behind dag remos and barrs long legs took some of the shorter uneven stairs two at a time in step with each other either would likely be shocked to learn dag now thought of them as part of his peculiar farmerlakewalker family tent but dag imagined both partners would admit to being his patrollers as difficult as their present circumstances were dag was glad they had become entangled in his little band whatever one might name it one lakewalker among farmers was an oddity three were a start maybe they all exited the walkway into uptown dag stared around with interest this being his first jaunt up the stairs to the bluff today was nearly windless in the watery light but dag imagined that in high summer uptown would catch whatever mosquitoremoving breezes there were the streets better drained than those below were not as muddy and were laid out in tidy blocks with boardwalks lining themmore sawedup former flatboats no doubt the houses and buildings looked substantial less haphazardly cobbled together free of highwater stains the people seemed not too different boat bosses and goodsshed men drivers and drovers innkeepers and horseboys some of the women seemed better dressed if more soberly than the fancy getups worn by the girls from the bedboats tied along the drowntown shore the graymouth town clerks office was not the front room of some villagers house as dag had seen back in tiny west blue but a separate building two stories high built of sturdy brick probably floated downstream from glassforge in faroff oleana fawn pointed out the brick to hod who grinned in recognition and nodded the fetchs party clumped up onto the porch and inside berry and whit had ventured up here the requisite three days ago to register their intent to wed and to secure an appointment with a recording clerkthe town employed several dag understood the big busy room to the right of the entry hall had to do with boats and the shipping business to the left with land records berry and whit both gulped grabbed each others hand and led the way upstairs to a smaller quieter chamber the rather bare upstairs room held a writing table by a window and half a dozen wooden chairs pushed back to the wall not quite enough for the crew of the fetch hod saw that bo took a seat with fawn and berry dag rested his shoulders on the wall and crossed his arms and barr and remo after a glance at him did likewise the wait was neither long nor uncomfortable at least not for dag he wouldnt vouch for whit who kept readjusting his shirt collar in a few minutes a man carrying a large record book and a sheet of paper bustled in dag judged him maybe a decade older than whit or berry he might have been a cleanly goodsshed clerk working up to owner he looked up to see dag and stepped back with a small uh his eyes flicked down over the hook that served in place of dags left hand to the long knife at his belt back up to his shorttrimmed if still unruly hair and across again to barr and remo with their more obviously lakewalkerstyle hair and garb both remos long dark braid and barrs shorter tawny queue were decorated for the occasion with ornaments newmade from shark teeth and pearl shell ah the clerk said to dag can i help you fellows find the room youre looking for theres a marriage registration due next in this one the bluefield party yes were part of that patrol dag replied amiably he gave a nod toward berry and whit who popped to their feet smiling nervously the fellow dag took to be the clerk tore his gaze from the lakewalkers to glance at his paper and say whitesmith bluefield and berry clearcreek both ducked their heads whit stuck out his hand and said they call me whit im clerk bakerbun said the clerk who shook whits hand and after a brief glance at fawn nodded at berry miss clearcreek how de do he laid his big book out on the table right we can begin do you each have your principal witnesses yes said berry this heres my uncle bo and thats my little brother hawthorn both rose and nodded hawthorn tightly clutching his raccoon which made a noise of indolent protest whit added yeah and this is my sister fawn and her husband dag bluefield his gesture taking in dag made the clerk blink im sorry i thought you were a lakewalker said the clerk to dag he looked up into dags goldtinged eyes wait you are a lakewalker whit raised his voice to override the inevitable spate of questions and these here are hod remo and barr all friends and boat hands from the fetch which is berrys flatboat out of clearcreek oleana see theyll sign as witnesses too she goes by boss berry down on the river by the way he smiled proudly at his betrothed berry usually had a generous grin beneath wide cheekbones that made her face look like a friendly ferrets now her smile was stretched thin with nerves the clerk looked at hawthorn who grinned back more in the usual clearcreek family style ah um this youngster looks to be well under twenty years of age he cant be a legal witness not in graymouth but berry said i could sign i been practicin protested hawthorn he undid one arm from under the fat and sleepy raccoon and held up inkstained fingers in proof and now that buckthorn and papa was killed last fall im her only brother i did promise he could said berry i didnt know im sorry hawthorn bo added gruffly oh come on let the little feller sign it wont do no harm and itll mean the world to him to both of em well the clerk looked nonplussed i dont think i can it might compromise the validity of the document should it be challenged dags brows drew down farmer customs could be so baffling all that paper and ink and fuss over property and witnesses he considered his own wedding cord wound around his upper arm concealed beneath his jacket sleeve braided by fawns own hands and containing a thread of her live ground proof of their union to anyone with groundsense she wore its twin on her left wrist peeping like a hair bracelet from her shirt cuff humming with a bit of dags ground in turn not that any lakewalker camp wouldnt seize on a wedding as an excuse for a party and not that the tentkin on both sides didnt mix in till you were ready to wrap some spare cords around their necks and twist but in the end the marriage was solely between two people tracking its traces in their inward selves even if the couple should be cast among strangers the cords silently spoke their witness for them never mind hawthorn said whit to the crestfallen boy i bought berry and me a new family book to start and you can sign in that cause its ours and doesnt belong to these graymouth folks he added to berry its my first wedding present to you see her pale face lightened in a real grin whit reached into the cloth bag hed been toting and pulled out a large volume bound in new leather of the sort in which goodsheds kept their records he laid it on the table opening it to the first blank white page dag was thrown back in memory to the aging family book hed seen at west blue threequarters full of entries about bluefield marriages births and deaths and land or animals bought sold or swapped which he and fawn and for that matter whit had all put their names in as principals or witness that volume had been the latest of a series going back over two hundred years all carefully kept in a trunk in the parlor the precious family books would pass in turn along with the farm itself to whit and fawns eldest brother and his bride as the fourth son whit was on his own and dag guessed not sorry for it now fawn measured the books thickness a good two fingers and grinned ambitious whit hawthorn looked it over in approval evidently consoled would the old clearcreek family book pass to hawthorn then not to berry it was all so backward to the way a lakewalker eldest girl inherited the family tent from her mother hm said the clerk in a tone of doubt but did not pursue his quibble he laid his own big book its leather cover stamped with graymouths town seal on the table beside whits and opened it to a new page if im to make two clean copies best we get started he sat at the table drew the ink pot toward him shot back his cuffs selected a quill from the jar and looked up again at berry and whit state your full names your parents names and residencesor if they are deceased places of burialyour dates of birth places of birth and occupations it took a few minutes to get all this down twice the fellow did have nice handwriting dag decided leaning over for a peek since this caused bakerbun to stop writing and stare over his shoulder in alarm dag returned to his wall space berry gave her occupation as boat boss and after a moment and fiddler whit after the briefest hesitation said not farmer but boat hand dag fancied he could almost hear the twang as whits last tie to west blue parted next do you give your sworn words you have no impediments no other betrothal marriage or indenture they both murmured their nays although berry winced a little at the other betrothal part good thats easy muttered the clerk you came up from drowntown so i dont guess you have any substantial property to worry about i must say drowntown folks dont usually bother to come up here to us for this but thats drowntown for you i have the fetch said berry the clerk hesitated flatboat you say not a keel thats right we dont have to count flats what about you whitesmith bluefield i have my earnings for the trip the clerk waved this away real property land a house a building for business expectations of inheritance no not yet whit amended with a distant look i have a family dueshare from the farm in west blue but i dont rightly know when ill get back to collect it its not much anyhow the clerk frowned judiciously you should have your papas house and the hill in clearcreek berry bo put in you and hawthorn the clerk came suddenly alert do you know how it was left what terms i cant rightly say dont think no one in clearcreek even knows berrys papa is dead yet he disappeared on the river last fall see along with her older brother so thats what this trip was for mainly to find out what had happened to em which we did do a sudden spate of questions from the clerk drew out the information that the house was substantial or at least large and rambling and the hill too steep for farming but where berrys family harvested the timber to build their yearly flatboat was a good square mile in extent and no one knew for sure if berrys papa might have left hawthorns guardianship to some other relative than berry in the event of his death a notion that clearly alarmed hawthorn very much any records were back in clearcreek fifteen hundred river miles away this is all very confused said the clerk at last rubbing his nose and leaving a faint smear of ink on his upper lip i dont think i can register this marriage what cried whit in alarm in chorus with berrys dismayed why not its the rules miss to prevent theft by runaway or fraudulent marriages which has been tried which is why the rules im not a runaway said berry indignantly im a boat boss and i got my mothers own brother with me yes but your marriage would give whitesmith here some claims on your property that your other kin might not want to allow or if that house and hill is all left to the tad here as your papas only surviving son he presumably owes you some dueshare but hes too young to administer it ive seen this sort of tangle lead to all sorts of fights and disputes and even killings and over a good deal less property than your oleana hill in graymouth maybe cried berry but bo scratched his chin in worry better you should wait and get married back in clearcreek miss said the clerk but it could be four or six months till we get back there said whit sounding suddenly bewildered we want to get married now yeah fawns baked the cake and fixed the food and everything put in hawthorn and she made me take a bath something like this sort of problem must have come up before dag pitched his voice deep to cut across the rising babble of protest in a town with as many strangers passing through for trade as graymouth gets couldnt you just leave out all mention of the property let the clearcreek clerk write it all in later i should have kept my fool mouth shut muttered bo sorry berry the distress from the folks assembled in the room was rising like a miasma around dag and he closed himself tighter against it thats what the marriage registration is for to settle all these critical matters said the clerk not that id expect a lakewalker to understand he added in a low mutter dont you fellows trade your women around like bedboat girls but with big knives and not near so friendly dag stiffened but decided to pretend not to hear although remo stirred in annoyance and barrs sandy eyebrows rose the clerk straightened up cleared his throat and gripped the edges of the table there have been variances made from time to time he said whit made an eager noise the fellow puts up a bond with the town clerk in the amount of the disputed property or a decreed percentage when he brings back the proper documents or witnesses to prove his claims he gets it back less a handling fee or if his claims dont fly the womans kin comes to collect it for damages what damages said hawthorn curiously but bos grip on his shoulder quelled him whits nose abruptly winkled just how much money are we talking about here well the worth of that hill and house i suppose i dont have that much money the clerk shrugged helplessly weve still to sell off the fetch said berry dubiously but it wont run to anything near the value of our place in clearcreek and besides we need that money to take home to live on next year remo glanced at barr and cleared his throat barr and ianyway i still have my salvage share from the cave he offered i could uh pitch in barr swallowed and with an effort got out we whit bo and berry began vigorously explaining to clerk bakerbun all the reasons why his legal demand made no sense the clerks shoulders stiffened and his face set fawn slid back under dags arm and whispered up to him dag this is crazy these graymouth folks have got no right to whits money or even some partfee they didnt work hard or bleed or risk their lives to earn it wedding papers shouldnt cost that much do you think its a cheat does that fellow figure us for upcountry folks just bleating to be skinned how would i know she cast him up a significant look dag sighed and eased open his groundsense despite the discomfort pressing on him from all the suddenly unhappy people sharing the room less the raccoon who was now dozing on a chair his ground feels more stressed than sly he whispered back but if hes setting up to angle for a bribe im blighted if ill let my tentbrother pay it not for this fishing for an illicit bribe would be easy enough to handle just troop downstairs in a body and loudly demand explanations from as many folks as possible the truth would out and then the clerk would be in hot water dag didnt take the fellow for that sort of foolish no dag guessed this mulishness as overblown conscientiousness crossed with an underlying contempt for odd shabby people from drowntown arguing with the man might merely make him climb up on his high horse send whit and berry off on their journey unwed and be happily confirmed in his low opinion of the morals of river folks dags annoyance increased irrelevant as all this paper ceremony seemed to dag it meant a lot to whit and berry both so far from home possibly even more to whit than berry this being his first venture into the wide world and anxious to do right by his hardwon river maiden blight it the happy day that fawn and berry had worked and planned so hard to create should not tumble down into distraught confusion not if dag could help it and i can quite quietly from behind the clerk he stretched out his left arm and with his ghost handground projectionshaped a reinforcement for persuasion such subtle work was invisible to all eyes here but not to barrs or remos inner senses remos eyebrows climbed barrs jaw dropped then his lips shaped outraged words you dare dag did not attempt too much detail just a general trend of feeling you like these hardworking young folks you wish them well you want to help them out that faroff clearcreek woodlot isnt your responsibility let that lazy clearcreek village clerk do some work for a change these youngsters are going to go away up the river and youll never see them again no problem for you such a cute couple he let the reinforcement spin off his ghost fingers and into the back of the clerks head as an added bonus the clerk wouldnt have a headache for the next several days necessarily dag accepted the little backwash from clerk bakerbuns ground into his own so as not to leave the man blatantly beguiled the clerk rubbed his forehead and frowned you say youre heading back upriver right away yes pretty soon said berry its irregular but i suppose i could leave out mention of the disposition of the property he paused in an internal struggle if i put in a notation for the clearcreek village clerk to add the information later its his task properly very sensible dag rumbled he followed up with a wave of approval with no groundsense the clerk would not be able to tell whether this happy feeling was coming from outside his head or inside fawn glanced appraisingly at the clerk at barr and remo at dag and pressed her lips together the clerk rubbed his forehead again then turned a brighter look upon whit and berry you seem like nice young folks i guess im obliged to get you off to a good start after that events followed a course more like what dag had experienced in west blue the clerk had a set of standard promises written out prepared to lead the couple in their spoken responses he seemed surprised when both were able to read them off the paper for themselves each adding a few variations stemming dag supposed from clearcreek and west blue local custom whit and berry bent and signed both books the clerk signed and stamped and the witnesses lined up to take their turns with the quill the clerk seemed equally surprised when he was not called upon to countersign anyones x bos handwriting was labored but legible as was hods but only because hed been practicing along with hawthorn fawn caught her tongue between her teeth and wrote her name square and plain she hesitated over what to put for occupation glanced up the page at whits entry and settled on boat cook she then looked up suddenly awkward dag whats our place of residence uh just put oleana for now really she gave him an odd look that even his groundsense could not help him interpret bent and scribbled dags turn came next and he also found himself unexpectedly flummoxed by the empty inviting occupation space patroller not anymore medicine maker knife maker not for sure vagrant mage his own unsettled ground gave him no clue in some desperation he chose boat hand too it wasnt a lie even if it wasnt going to be true for much longer remo after his name signed pearl riffle camp oleana and patroller adding after a check up the page at the general trend of things and boat hand barr copied him berry and whit made sure hawthorn had his turn in the new bluefieldclearcreek family book whit hovering with a handkerchief ready to mop any accidental blots none occurred and it was done apparently or at least whit and berry blew out their breaths looked at each other a bit wildly and fell into a heartfelt hug and kisspart joy but mainly relief the clerk dutifully shook hands all around and offered congratulations dag made sure the company did not linger he didnt know how fast his persuasion would wear off though he hoped it would last for some days by which time the events would be well blurred in clerk bakerbuns mind by the press of his other work and he would be in no mood to reexamine the dodgy fixup no more than i descending the steps to drowntown berry shot a wide grin over her shoulder at fawn fawn grinned back in equal delight theyd switched places whit and berry holding hands hard fawn clutching dags hand scarcely less tightly barr and remo followed but when they came to a landing where the stairs doubled back barrs grip fell on dags shoulder hold up dag he growled dag came to a halt staring blandly out over the riverside fawn turned surprised by barrs tone remo after a glance at the two tense faces waved whit and the rest of the party on whit raised his brows but thumped on down the boards after the rest of his new clearcreek inlaws barrs strong teeth set through them he said you planted a persuasion on that clerk fellow dags eyelids fell rose in that peculiar daggish iamnotarguing look he got sometimes it could be very aggravating fawn knew to the person on the wrong side of the nonargument she touched her lips in dismay i thought that might have been what happened back there though she could not perceive groundwork directly barr and remo evidently had remo didnt look angry like barr but he looked plenty worried in his own way more so than usual that is you tore the blighted hide off me for trying to plant a persuasion in boss berry that time and i didnt even make it work said barr dag blinked again and waited patiently and unencouragingly he didnt deny this either fawn noted so how come you get to persuade farmers and i dont remo offered uneasily it settled the fellow down you wouldnt have wanted to let all his nonsense about land and wills and dueshares wreck the wedding would you no butbut thats not the point or maybe it is the point persuasions allowed if its a good deed mine was a good deed i was just trying to get remo to come back to pearl riffle with me which is what i was sent after him to dothat wasnt just a good deed it was my duty if youre gonna make up rules for me and then go break them yourself how can i trust anything you say maybe you shouldnt said dag dryly before barr could get out some heated response fawn cut in dag you didnt leave that fellow beguiled did you of course not so you took in a little of his ground ill just have to add it to the collection spark fawns mind ran down all the bits and pieces of strange grounds that dag had absorbed into his own during these past weeks either through the trick of unbeguiling all the folks hed done his healing work on or the odd experiments with food and animals or the darker deed of groundripping the renegade crane its getting to be a pretty queer collection yeah well yeah barr started to renew his protest but was stopped by his partners grip on his arm remo gave him a headshake fawn wasnt sure what else passed between the pair except that something did remo said we can take this up later lets catch up with the others its fawns birthday too remember yeah i need to get back to the fetch and finish cooking dinner fawn put in anxiously barr let his breath blow out he shot one last glower at his fellow lakewalkers but produced a smile for fawns sake youre right its not the time or the place to settle this he added in a mutter its going to take more time and a bigger space remo gave a satisfied nod dag said nothing though his lips twisted they all started down the stairs once more fawn could only think im in barrs camp on this one the combined weddingandbirthdaysupper chores didnt fall too heavily on fawn as everyone pitched in to help dodging around the little hearth in the kitchenandbunk area at the rear of the fetchs cabin she served up the inevitable ham potatoes and onions but also fresh fish from the sea golden yams the bright oranges and chewy sweet dried persimmon and molasses to go along with the last of the salt butter for the biscuits bos gift was a new keg of beer and if it was darker in color and stronger in taste than the paler brews fawn had encountered up along the grace valley well maybe it wasnt made that way just to hide the murkiness of graymouth water because it did a fine job of washing everything down the birthdaywedding cake was mostly apple flavored there had been a debate over candles as properly a birthday cake should have them but a wedding cake was decorated with flowers hawthorn had begged for candles mainly for the fascination of making dag light them so fawn put thin beeswax sticks on top and flowers around the edge hawthorn happily had his eyebrows nearly singed off as dag waved his hook and fawn presumed ghost hand across the top and nineteen little flames sprang up behind with a satisfying foomp confronted with the bright warmth reflected in dags flickering smile fawn realized shed been too busy fixing up the party to think of a wish watching whit and berry grin at each other she considered wishing them well but really thats what this whole day was about for everyone the birthdaywishingcandles part was all fawns own with a sudden catch of her breath she thought i wish to go home it wasnt homesickness exactly because the last thing in the world she wanted was to go back to her parents farm in west blue shed been fascinated by life on a flatboat but the fetch had been a very cramped shack floating down a very wide river and not always bow first either and anyhow it had come to the end of its travels fawn wanted a real house planted in solid ground all her own hers and dags with an iron cookstove i want my future she wanted these people in itshe glanced up at them all dag whit and berry remo and barr hawthorn and bo and even hod waiting to applaud her when she blew out the flames and with an ache so abrupt it hurt her heart she wanted the new ones in it the shadowy children she and dag had not yet made together i want us all home safe wherever our real home turns out to be she took a deep deep breath shut her eyes and blew until the lights no longer glowed red against her eyelids when the clapping started she dared to open them again and smile after cake came the presents birthday and wedding both normally wedding presents were practical items to outfit the young couples new house or farm or tent if they were lakewalkersthe same aim fawn understood if different in detail but whit and berry still had a long way to travel to get back to the debatable house in clearcreek so any presents had to be small light and packable barr had somehow come up with new shoes made of redbrown alligator hide for both berry and fawn which actually fit and not by chance hed slyly sneaked off old shoes to compare hawthorn and hod proudly presented fawn with a bound blank book found at the same place whit had bought his but smaller to fit in her saddlebags and likely in their budget fawn gave two new pairs of cotton drawers each to whit and berry because shed found good cotton cloth readymade in the market here cheaper than raw cotton fiber back in oleana and it was all too splendid to pass up the straight seams and simple drawstrings had kept her fingers flying the past few days but it wasnt as if she hadnt made drawers for whit before underclothes being one of the first things her aunt nattie had ever taught fawn to sew for good measure shed made up a pair for orphaned hod who wiped thrilled tears on his shirtsleeve when she surprised him with them then disappeared into the dark recesses of the forward cabin to put them on right away too shy to parade them for the company he did make whit come look before he put his trousers on again which whit agreeably did whit had a funny look on his face when he came back and fingered his own pairs thoughtfully before folding them away with rather more care than hed ever shown to fawns takenforgranted work before whit and remo then tiptoed out mysteriously leaving fawn and berry smiling at each other while everyone else took care of the cleaning up of all the gifts this day had brought gaining a sister ranked the highest in fawns heart berry too had grown up sisterlessand had become not long after hawthorn had been born motherlesswithout even the older female company afforded fawn by her mother and her aunt nattie when berry was smaller the house in clearcreek had been run shed told fawn by a succession of older female cousins but one year no such woman could be found when it was time to launch the flatboat and catch the rise so papa clearcreek had simply packed all three of his children along on his sixmonthslong roundtrip to the amazement of all their kin no young clearcreeks gratified their dire predictions by falling overboard and drowning so hed taken them every year thereafter it seemed a colorful life to fawns eyes but flatboats and keelboats both were thin of female companionship she suspected berry thought fawn was whits best present to her too loud clumping from the front deck brought the whole company out to find whit holding the reins of a small piebald mare and remo muffling the smirk of a successful conspirator dags chestnut gelding copperhead sharing the pen with daisygoat pinned his ears back in jealousy but dag promptly settled him down to fawns utter shock whit handed the reins to her here you go he said to make up for me making you leave your mare in west blue berry bought you the saddle and bridle and remo came up with the saddlebags the gear was secondhand but looked to be in good condition someone had cleaned it up though if id known what horses go for in graymouth id have brought warp and weft along to sell here whit remo oh its all rightmy window glass went for a jawdroppin price too whit allowed shrugging off her hug in smiling embarrassment berry was right to make me hang on to most of it till we got down here he tossed a salute at his new wife and old boat boss who accepted it with a contented nod wait said fawn to remo isnt that one of the horses those lakewalkers from new moon cutoff were selling in the square yesterday yep i took whit back later remo said smugly dont worry this mares sound lively little thing rising four i think they were only culling her because shes too small to be a patrol horse truly the mare looked as if shed have to take two steps to leggy copperheads one but she also looked as if she wouldnt mind fawn fell to petting her with delight berry less horsesavvy stroked her mane more cautiously and i found out those girls tent names too by remo standards he sounded almost cheerful what girls asked barr oh just some girls theyre gone now huh barr regarded him with some suspicion but then was drawn into the general admiration of the new mare after fawn took a first short ride up and down the muddy riverbank dag watching closely she let hawthorn and hod try her gift horses paces too they settled the mare back aboard tied to the rail opposite copperhead with an armload of hay all around at length fawn went back inside trying to think of a name the first blackandwhite thing that came to her mind was skunk which seemed both unkind and ungrateful she would have to think harder after testing the level of beer left in the keg they all settled around the hearth with their tankards fawn was just sighing in contentment and considering asking berry to get out her fiddle and give them all some tunes as a birthday present fawn wouldnt have to pack when whit said suddenly hey dag what did you get fawn for her birthday ah said dag he looked down into his tankard in discomfort i was trying to make her a surprise but it didnt work out he took a sip and added yet anyway oh what asked fawn in eager curiosity given that he only had the one hand dag hardly ever attempted carving or any sort of complicated craft work it came to her almost at once hed meant making lakewalker groundwork magic to farmer eyes although fawn had nearly trained herself out of using that word but it seemed his attempt had failed whatever it was and he was feeling the failure especially after whits grand present of the mare she added sometimes you have to give up on the surprise part remember your birthday when i gave you one sweater sleeve dag smiled a little and touched the finished garment which he was wearing now against the damp chill seeping back into the boat as the bustle of dinner wore off indeed spark thing is you already knew you could finish that promise you didnt have to stop and invent knitting first all right now you have to say said whit leaning back you cant trail that sort of bait across the water and then just haul in your line aye give us the tale dag said bo a bit sleepily a tale is as good as a coin some places well reluctantly dag shoved his hand down into his pocket leaned over and deposited a black walnut still in its shell on the hearthstone the farmers around the fire all looked blankly at it and at dag but barr and remo both sat up which made fawn prick her ears too dag what in the world did you do to that poor walnut asked remo its ground is all shiny dag touched the hard ridges with a finger rolling the greenblack sphere around on the stone then sat back and stared glumly at it a shell protects and shields life it seemed a good natural essence to try to anchor an involution on the way a knife maker anchors an involution into the bone of a sharing knife although that cup is made to hold a death and this was going to hold something else dag had made his first sharing knife bare weeks back in the aftermath of the horrors of the bandit cave barr and remo had been wildly impressed having met dags knifemaker brother dar fawn had been less surprised ive been trying and trying to think dag went on what might protect farmers the way ground veiling protects patrollers absent gods dag how could farmers veil said remo its like turning your whole ground sideways to the world it gave me conniption fits when i was first trying to learn not even all lakewakers can catch the trick of it dag nodded not disagreeing but see fawn cant feel me in her marriage cord the way i can feel her in mine the way any married lakewalker does but last summer i was able to do a shaped reinforcement in her arm that let her feel something like it leastways for a while until her ground absorbed it again it wasnt the same thing but it accomplished the same end fawn nodded vigorously it was better actually old cattagus said you cant tell direction with regular cords just if your spouse is alive or not but i could tell which way you were from me roughly anyhow barrs brows rose from how far away over a hundred miles part of the time fawn added scrupulously i dont know if it would have faded at bigger distances remos brows climbed too see the thing is dag went on nobodys trying to do groundwork on farmers except to sneak some healing now and then out of pity which as like as not leaves an accidental beguilement or the occasionalhe cleared his throatillicit persuasion the strongest makers dont much get outside their camps and patrollers dont do complex or clever making if you show clear talent for making said barr they dont send you for patroller so how did you ever get let out on the trail dag i was a difficult youngster dag scratched his head ruefully but did not expand although eight people perked up in hope of the story i dont know whats not done because its impossible or whats not done because its never been tried or tried and kept secret or discovered and then lost again that still doesnt explain why you wanted to give my sister a walnut for her birthday said whit i thought she could put it on a string wear it like a necklace she probably would just like you wore that sillylookin straw hat she wove you that hat was very practical dag said defensively so whats the use of a walnut again dag sighed none apparently i wanted to make something that would protect her ground what from fawn asked dag took a short breath anything people like crane for one fawn refrained from pointing out that the renegade had actually threatened her with a perfectly ordinary steel knife not with any magic whats going on in that murky head of yours beloved also maybe some sort of shield could blur or soften farmer grounds so they wouldnt strike on lakewalker groundsense so hard dag went on so she wouldnt fawn realized he meant have to walk around groundnaked in front of lakewalkers so that her presence in a lakewalker camp wouldnt disturb the neighbors in other words said berry slowly youre thinking of something that would work like those washpan hats that barr made up were supposed to and didnt barr winced it was just a stupid joke he muttered i said i was sorry a few slow smiles around the circle as the crew of the fetch recalled the uproar back at pearl riffle when barr had hoaxed a gang of flatties into believing they could protect themselves from lakewalker magic by wearing iron helmets iron helmets werent usual boat gear but iron cook pots were the results had been pretty entertaining for a time fawn thought if barr ever encountered any of those fellows again hed better be ready to run really fast oh my dag said whit his eyes suddenly aglow if you want something for lakewalkers to sell to farmers for cash money youve hit on it magic up a bunch of these walnuts and you could likely peddle them at any price you wanted to name yeah said bo and by the next afternoon at the latest thered be folks selling off fake ones too itd be a right craze it would he looked suddenly thoughtful a feller could make a killing if he timed it right absent gods dag wiped his left sleeve across his forehead a look of some horror rising in his eyes i never thought of that youre right i just wanted to protect fawn makers wouldnt but if never mind it doesnt matter i couldnt make it work anyway dag said fawn if it involves my ground wouldnt you have to work with my ground like you did um with that extra reinforcement in my arm yes well maybe not just like that although that would certainly make selling ground shields to farmers an unusual enterprise with an effort he untwisted his reminiscent smile it might need to be bonded to its user yes custommade the way sharing knives are bonded to the grounds of their pledged donors he added in explanation all around and fawn thought it was a high mark of how far theyd all come that what he got in return were understanding nods dag heaved a despondent sigh except that all ive been able to do so far is make an unbreakable walnut really said berry rocking back in doubt hawthorn entranced by this promise of more lakewalker magic scuttled up to go find a tripoint steel hammer and test the proposition many thwacks later entailing flying chips from the hearthstone and turns taken by barr and remo everyone agreed that it was one blighted unbreakable walnut all right whit scratched his head and stared at the little dark sphere thats pretty useless i admit you wouldnt even be able to eat it oh i dunno drawled bo i spect you could win bets with it wager some o those big strong keeler boys they cant crack it and watch the drinks roll in he shared a long speculative look with whit who said say dag if you dont want that ol thing can i have it no cried fawn dag made it for me even if it doesnt do what he wanted yet and anyhow you arent planning to go tavern crawling with bo tonight are you berry gave whits hair a soft tug which made him smirk no she said definitely he aint fawn scooped up the walnut and thrust it into her own skirt pocket it was growing dark outside the cabin windows she noted with approval there was one advantage to a midwinter wedding early nightfall bo put another piece of driftwood on the fire and berry rose to light an oil lantern fawn caught dags eye and gave a jerk of her chin as planned dag levered himself up and invited the crew of the fetch out to a nearby boatmens tavern for a round of drinks on him hawthorns helpful observation that they hadnt run out of beer yet was ignored and hod and bo shepherded him off fawn paused to exchange a quick farewell hug with berry who whispered thanks in her ear yep fawn murmured back i spect well be out most of the evening but hawthorn and hodll make sure bo doesnt stay out all night dont you worry about us she added after a moment im sure well make plenty of noise clomping back in she left berry and whit holding hands looking at each other with matching terrified smiles and sneaking peeks at their new bed nook formerly the boat boss had slept in one of the narrow threehigh bunk racks at the side of the kitchen just like her crew except that her bunk had been made a tad more private by curtains strung on a wire fawn and berry together had rearranged the bedding last evening in the space freed up by the soldoff cargo making two little curtainedoff rooms on either side of the aisle the task had ended with them going up on the roof for a really long nice private talk berry as she put it wanted a pilot for the snags and shoals of the marriage bed because while berry was a brave boat boss and an experienced riverwoman and a couple of years older than fawn fawn had been married for a whole six months so fawn tried her best to explain it all at least berry was smiling and relaxed when they came back in whit in the meanwhile had taken a long walk with dag and returned looking pale and terrified fawn took dag aside and whispered fiercely you know if it was just whit id let you exercise your patroller humor to your hearts content but i wont have any of it fall on berry you hear dont fret spark i controlled myself dag assured her eyes glinting gold with his amusement i admit it was a bit of a struggle two virgins oh my really said fawn with a surprised peek around dags side at whit hunkering down to warm his hands at the fire i would have thought tansy mayapple oh never mind theyll be fine hed promised her now as they strolled away into the darkness after the rest of the crew and fawn turned to look over her shoulder at the glow of the lantern hung up on the fetchs bow dag repeated theyll do fine spark i sure hope so fawn reflected that it was likely just as well that everything about this wedding was as different as it could possibly be from the one that berry had planned back in clearcreek with her dead betrothed alder no reminders because while bad memories were plainly bad it was the good memories lost in them that hurt the worst the tavern was crowded and noisy tonight so after dag had done his duty buying the first round fawn bequeathed her barely sipped tankard to the table and drew him back outside for a walk despite the dark partway up the steps to uptown fawn found the lookout point that shed spied earlier that day she ducked under the rail around the landing and picked her way along the damp path inadequately lit by the halfmoon riding overhead between fitful clouds at its end a board propped up between two piles of stones made a smooth dry seat with a fine view over the serene river all hazy silver in the night mist in summer fawn guessed couples came here to spoon even for northerners like themselves this wasnt quite outdoor spooning weather she cuddled in gratefully under dags right arm though the view was romantic and dag shared warmth generously it was plain he was not in a romantic mood he was in his worrywart mood and hed been stuck in it for days if not weeks plenty long enough anyhow fawn fingered the walnut in her pocket and said quietly whats troubling your mind dag he shrugged nothing new after a long hesitation while fawn waited in expectant silence he added thats the trouble i guess my mind keeps looping and looping over the same problems and never arrives anywhere different same paths do tend to go to the same places tell me about them then his fingers wound themselves in her curls as if for consolation or courage then his arm dropped back around her and snugged her in maybe she wasnt the only one feeling the chill when we two left hickory camp at the end of the summerwhen we were thrown out when we left fawn corrected firmly a conceding nod my notion was that if i walked around the world with my eyes newopen for a time the way youve made them be i could maybe see some way for farmers and lakewalkers to work together against malice outbreaks because someday the patrol wont be perfect and a malice will get away from us again not in the wilderness or even by a village like greenspring but by a big farmer town and then well all be in for it but if lakewalkers and farmers were already working together before the inevitable happens maybe wed have a fighting chance i thought the fetch was a good start fawn offered good but so small spark eight people and thats counting you alongwith for six or so months of trying so thatd be um sixteen folks a year a hundred and sixty in a decade in forty years um a long hesitation while fawn secretly tapped her fingers in her skirt six or seven hundred and if the crisis breaks next year and not forty years from now then it wont be any worse than if you hadnt tried at all anyhowreally youd think despair was his favorite cornhusk dolly the way he clutches iti think your count is way off there was all my kin in west blue you talked to and those teamsters from glassforge and cress that you healed in pearl riffle and all her kin and boatloads of boatmen along the river and your show at the bandit cave with crane gods dag theyll be talking about that up and down these rivers for at least as many years as folksll be trying to wear those stupid pots of barrs this river ive figured out is a villageone street wide and two thousand miles long its been a great place for you to tell your tale because river folks get around to gossip and swap yarns like they were barter and sometimes change each others minds even when you arent looking on dag shook his head the absent gods may know what kind of path i blazed down the grace valley i sure dont did i light a fire or was it all a damp sputter and right back to the gloom why are all or nothing the only two choices here fawn asked tartly what i think is dag looked down brows rising at the resolve in her voice what i think is youre trying to carry a lazy mans load inside your head youre trying to lift the whole world all by yourself in one trip no wonder youre exhausted youve got to start smaller smaller how much smaller can i get dag motioned down at the riverbank by which fawn guessed he meant to indicate their modest flatboat a rhetorical reply in any case so she paid no heed to it your own ground i know its true because you told me so yourself and you never lie to me the first thing a maker has to make is himself but nobody ever said he had to do it by himself do you have a point spark she ignored his stung tone and answered straight out yes its true for cooking or sewing or boatbuilding or harness making or crafting arrowsso i dont guess its false for groundwork before you tackle any new job first you have to get your own tools in order clean and sharpened and tidy and laid out ready to hand the main tool for groundwork is your own ground and yours from everything everyone has ever told me about such things has got to be in the most awful mess right about now what i think you need is another maker not a farmer girl much as she loves you and not just a couple of earnest patroller boys as much as they want to help because they dont know beans about that trail either but instead someone like hoharie or dar fawn took a breath shaken by a moment of panic when she realized that dag unlike any member of her family ever was actually listening to her the notion that a man so strong might actually change or do something differently on the basis of something shed blathered was alarming back when shed longed in vain for any sign that she was heard had she ever imagined also accepting responsibility for the results well theyre in my lap now she gulped so so ive been asking around every visiting lakewalker i could get to talk to me up in the day market i asked about the best medicine makers in these parts they told me about a lot of different folks but the one they all talked up is a fellow named arkady waterbirch seems hes to be found at a lakewalker camp called new moon cutoff which is lessn thirty miles northeast of here right off the trace not much moren a days ride away for ol copperhead she added in anxious appeal they call him a groundsetter whatever that means dag looked taken aback really that close if but then he rubbed his forehead with his left arm and smiled ruefully oh gods spark wouldnt i just but it wont work it would be dar and hoharie all over again dont you see his teeth set in unfond memory ive patrolled down this way a time or two these southern lakewalkers havent got any more use for farmers than the ones back in oleana doand more land jealousy what with the camps being squeezed up between farmer areas and with malices so seldom found in these parts the farmers dont even give their patrollers that thin gratitude we get in the north though when a southern patrol does find a little sessile bout once in a lifetime youd think it was the wolf war breaking out again the way they carry on anyway i doubt the pair of us would be any more welcome at new moon cutoff than we were at hickory lake maybe maybe not if we made it plain we were just visiting seems to me it was mainly your tentkin who thought i was a problem they had to fix mm said dag fawn swallowed or you could go without me at least to see the man and ask id be all right staying with berry and whit youre the light that i see by spark im not letting go of you again the flash in his eyes reminded her of the lantern reflection off cranes knife blade held tight to her throat that had shimmered across dags face just before just before then well both go and ill deal with whatever im dished out if its no better than hickory lake itll be no worse either and i survived that she pulled the unbreakable walnut from her pocket and rolled it curiously in her hand what youre doing now all by yourself isnt working you say if any of the rest of us could help you we would have by now time to try something else stands to reason dag and if this arkady fellow doesnt work out either well at least you can scratch him off your list and be that much farther along she watched his face scrunch up in doubt so intense it looked like pain and added i cant be happy while youre hurtin we have some time to pass anyhow waiting down here at the edge of the world for the cold to end before we travel youve kept all your promises to show me the river and graymouth and the sea now you can just show me new moon cutoff for dessert and if its not as fine as the sea at least itll be new to me and thatll be good enough she gave a determined nod which made him smile if a bit bleakly if thats what you really think spark he said then ill give the fellow a try two days of cold rain masked dags disinclination to travel to new moon cutoff so fawn did not badger but she did draw barr and remo into the project when the next day dawned clear the three of them had dag on the road north if not early at least before noon barr and remo claimed to be interested in buying horses for a better price than found in the drowntown market where the flatboat men not wishful to join keeler crews bid for mounts to carry them back home on the tripoint trace fawn wasnt sure dag was fooled because he looked pretty ironic about it all but he didnt say anything cutting fawn rode rather guiltily on her new mare now named magpie three sets of saddlebags were piled onto copperhead led by his master the patroller men strode or tried to outside of graymouth the road became a quagmire it was nearly impassable to wagonsthey paused several times to offer help to farmers with wheels stuck up to the hubs and once the man was so desperate that he even accepted the offer despite the three tall strangers being lakewalkers though his thanks afterward were brief and worried cast over his shoulder as he urged his team into motion once more pack trains of horses or mules made fairly good time on the hoofpocked vergea couple of them passed by southbound bringing in loads of cotton tea and other mysterious local goods to the river port barr however complained bitterly about slogging in his farmermade boots new bought in graymouth dont they fit right fawn asked i thought you said youd broken them in do they leak no more than youd expect said barr but look he raised one knee to display a boot from her saddle fawn looked blankly down at it there must be ten pounds of mud stuck to each foot fumed barr fawn glanced at remo standing with his hands on his hips and grinning at his partner and realized that his boots though damp and stained were largely clumpfree hey remo how come your boots arent like that remo held out a leg and smugly rotated his ankle my cousin made these for me theyre groundworked to shed the mud cheer up barr dag advised smiling faintly ill help you fix them when we make camp tonight didnt you learn how to renew leatherwork when you were on patrol back in oleana well yes but he usually sweettalked one of the girls into doing it for him remarked remo staring off artlessly over sodden fields i was going to say renew yes but these boots have never been worked at all i thought that needed to happen while theyre first made usually but ill see what i can lay in said dag its not like i havent done trail fixups on leather gear bout ten thousand times they trudged onward past a hamlet boasting an inn of sorts but they still had two hours of daylight left for walking only fawn looked back in regret when dusk descended they found a high spot off the road to make a camp fawn was not impressed with its comforts although the boys did get a fire going despite the damp she unpacked their food and shared it around dag and barr were soon heads down over the offending boots dag quite adeptly it seemed to fawn instructed barr in how to persuade them to be more waterproof muddy boots soon to be unmuddy boots but which would not then walk on their own nor force their owner to dance through the night nor stride leagues at a step so much for glamorous lakewalker magic wicked necromancy rumors of cannibalistic rites if only other folks could see these fellows as i do hey fawn remo called from beyond the firelight where hed been rustling around along a weedchoked drainage ditch want an alligator no she cried back in alarm i dont want one had he found one how big could it smell her new shoes from there if so would it be angry and if remo caught it instead of being promptly bitten in traplike jaws as his carefree enthusiasm deserved would he make her try to cook it remo came tromping back out of the darkness with a wriggling form stretched between his two hands boot magic was temporarily abandoned as barr jumped up to look too dag unhelpfully sat on his log and grinned at fawns expression which would have annoyed her more except his grins had grown too rare lately its small said fawn as the beast was eagerly presented to her gaze a foot and a half of struggling lizard remo had one hand firmly clamped around its long snout and the other stretching its lashing tail it hissed protest and churned its short legs trying to claw its captor just a baby agreed remo they hatch from eggs they say like chickens the bulging yellow eyes with vertically slit pupils looked even less friendly than a chickens baby or no this was not fawn sensed an animal that would welcome cuddling bos tale of the boy the bear cub and the thorn would have come out very differently in the end if the boy had drawn the barb from the paw of a creature like this when the oleana boys had finished exclaiming over the catch they then squabbled over whether to let it go again fawn gave this plan no encouragement even barring what horrors a malice might make of such a creature those things grew presumably into what had mauled that boy at the lakewalker camp and if she volunteered to cook it it couldnt end up introduced alive into her bedroll later although she supposed the boys would be more likely to try that game on each other than on dag they werent her own brothers their ruckus would still disrupt her sleep they toasted the meager fragments over the coals fawn found that alligator meat tasted like some off cross between pork and the boiled crab claw she had tried in the drowntown marketand like campfire smoke of course but everything tasted of that it would beat starving but fawn did not foresee a future in alligator farming treating the skin did keep the patroller boys occupied for the rest of the evening leaving fawn to cuddle with dag in their reptilefree bedroll in a vain attempt to get warm when the camp finally settled for the night she murmured into his collarbone dag mm i thought what you and remo discovered about unbeguiling back up on the grace was pretty exciting i figured youd be talking about it to every new lakewalker we met instead i dont recall as youve even spoken to any lakewalker weve passed he gave an unrevealing grunt the verbal equivalent to that thing he did with his eyelids she decided i been wondering why not fawn finished refusing to be daunted he sighed it wasnt quite that simple yes my trick works to unbeguile farmers im sure of that part but i still dont know what the effects are on the lakewalker to be taking in all that strange ground im willing to experiment on myself im less willing to put others at risk till i know he broke off what what i dont know yet she wanted to reassure him to say well at least were heading in the right direction to find out but for all she knew shed dragged them out on a fools errand tomorrow wouldmighttell you will let this arkady fellow know all about it though wont you promise oh yes he breathed stirring her curls sleep spark midday on a side road striking west from the trace they passed from fallow fields into woods dag guessed they were crossing out of farmerowned land onto that of the lakewalker camp the camp itself came up sooner than hed expected only a few miles farther on magpie recognizing her former home tried to pull ahead and for the first time fawn had to rein back to her companions walking pace the road climbed a low rise that proved to be a former river bluff and dags heart gave an odd lurch when he glimpsed the familiar glint of lake water through the leafless trees ive been long away from home this patrol this cutoff was an old watercourse of the gray river which had ages ago looped thirty miles west instead leaving this crescentshaped lake and the groove of land in which it lay a quarter mile along the crest the road dodged left again descending to the shallow lake valley a spur curved back down the slope into the woods just past where the tracks met two flanking tree stumps cradled a peeled pole across the road at knee height not so much a gate as the idea of a gate less cursory were two armed patrollers taking their turn at this light camp duty between patrols they watched dags little party approach with alert curiosity dag presumed their open groundsenseshis was nearly closed just nowassured them that their visitors bore no ill will oh hey said remo his spine straightening its those two girls who were selling horses at the drowntown market last week oh barr followed his gaze brows climbing aha so partner why didnt you take me along to help buy that birthday horse huh didnt think you were interested in horses said remo blandly they all paused before the level pole well if it isnt the quiet fellow from oleana said one of the patrollers who had redbrown braids wreathing her head how de remo what brings you here her taller blond companion looked approvingly at the boys curiously at dag and doubtfully at fawn the redhead added more anxiously that piebald mare is working out all right isnt she remo ducked his head and smiled hi again yes the mares fine fawn nodded friendly confirmation from atop magpie who stretched out her nose and snuffled at her former handlers weve just brought our uh friend dag here along to see that arkady waterbirch fellow you two told us about remo having apparently become spokesman dag was inclined to let him continue he merely added a nod and touched his forehead in polite greeting then he wondered exactly what fawn and remo had said about him because the two women stared at him in some surprise he rehitched copperheads reins around his hook and waited barr chipped in with a fine white grin hi my names barr id be remos partner who he forgot to mention im from oleana toopearl riffle camp way on up the grace real malice country up north there yknow seems he also forgot to tell me your names he trailed off invitingly there followed an exchange of pleasantries in which barr smoothly managed to extract the patroller girls names tentnames projected patrol schedules family situations the fact that the tall blonde had just returned from exchange patrol but the shorter redhead had never been beyond the territory of her home camp and whether either had any pretty sistersor ugly brothers dag would have been tolerably amused if he hadnt been so tired and strained remo listened with growing impatience giving up on waiting for a natural break in the flow he gripped barrs arm and overrode him and where would we find maker waterbirch oh said the redhead tavia she swung around and waved her arm toward the lake if you follow this road down and take the righthand fork along the shoreline youll pass the medicine tent about half a mile in old arkadys is the third tent after that set apart theres these two big magnolia trees flanking his front path you cant miss them she glanced up at the listening fawn collected a nudge from her blond partner neeta and added if you follow this side road off east here back down the slope theres a shelter and camp for farmers who come here to trade has its own well and all your farmer friend can wait there shes with me said dag tavia gave him a politely embarrassed smile her blond partner frowned farmers arent allowed in camp said neeta the shelters not bad and there should be a stack of firewood for the hearth nobody else is there just now dags jaw set we go in together or not at all remo and barr exchanged alarmed looks dag said remo uneasily we just walked two days to get here if fawn isnt allowed in neither this place nor its people are any use to me if we start now we can be halfway home to the fetch by nightfall wait wait said barr as dag made to turn away but when dag paused and raised his eyebrows he could not immediately come up with a counter fawn whod listened to this exchange with her fist stuffed in her mouth took it away to say placatingly its all right dag doesnt sound like anybody would bother me at that shelter and i could build a fire i could wait out there for a while anyhow while you go in and talk to the man and then wed see no said dag um who is she to you asked tavia my wife said dag the two patroller women looked at each other the blonde rolled her eyes the alarm in barrs eyes was shading over into panic blight it boy i dont know what bur is getting under your saddle im closed down as tight as that walnut i cant possibly be leaking any mood vile as that mood was growing tavia glanced at dag and addressed herself prudently to remo what did he want to see arkady for anyway its complicated said remo helplessly a complicated problem with groundwork fawn put in and medicine making likely not something to discuss in the middle of the road you two arent either of you makers are you the blonde looked offended but barr added hastily yes probably this arkady fellow should be the one to decide a couple of patrollers really arent fit to guess what a maker would want i know im not thats why were here he blinked and smiled winningly at the women i thought it was important enough to walk two days for and in bad boots at that it seems crazy to stop just half a mile short if you cant let fawn in and believe me i know how stuffy patrol leaders can be about camp rules couldnt one of you go in and ask him to come out here and talk and then whatever got decided would be off you and on him where it belongs barr blinked eyes gone liquid as a soulful puppys dag could have sworn his blond queue grew fluffier even as his smile brightened to near blinding remo pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed tavias brow wrinkled but a crooked smile was drawn unwillingly from her in response well she said weakly all growled dag or none barr made pleading hand gestures and kept smiling in a way that reminded dag of bos story about the fellow who grinned a bear out of a tree some forms of persuasion it seemed had nothing to do with illicit groundwork because tavia rubbed her neck and repeated well i suppose i could walk down quick and ask him sure mind after that itll be up to him tavia you are a jewel among gate guards cried barr barr its just the sensible thing to do said remo quellingly he gave tavia a respectful salute of thanks she strode off with a saucy glance over her shoulder that seemed equally divided between the two patroller boys neeta shook her head silence fell for a time as neeta retreated to a more firmchinned patrol stance and remo rubbed his chapped hands and stole glances at her at length fawn said i suppose we could go water the horses at that well while we wait take a look around dag grunted but didnt balk when she reined her mare around and led off barr followed grabbing remo and bringing him along the farmer trade camp proved to be a large clearing the shelter three log walls with a fieldstone hearth snugly roofed all tidy and in reasonable repair remo and barr drew up several buckets of water and emptied them into a trough where copperhead and magpie gulped enough to make it seem worthwhile when they returned to the gate tavia was just turning onto the bottom of the road a tall man striding at her shoulder blight barr muttered remo this is the first time ive seen your talents have a use yeah barr muttered back i find them useful this is just the first time youve ever appreciated them as the pair climbed nearer dag studied the groundsetter warily arkady waterbirch wore clean trousers shirt and an undyed wool coat to the knees open in this moderate chill his hair was blond streaked with gray pulled back in a neat mourning knot at his nape in the pale light of this winter noon it shone silver gilt his hairline was not thinning yet but seemed to be thinking about it as he drew nearer still dag eyed his tawny skin with fine lines at the corners of his eyes and around his mouth and found himself unable to guess the mans age his silvering hair said older his unweathered skin suggested younger in any case he was likely not far off from dags own generation his hands too were smooth with the cleanest fingernails dag had ever seen even on a medicine maker his eyes were bright copper shot with gold the general effect was a trifle blinding what the mans ground was like dag could not tell until he opened his own shuttered most of the time since since crane really as the makers gaze swept him in turn dag grew conscious of his own travelworn appearance two days of trudging through the mire and sleeping rough last night had returned him to his patrol look clothing shabby and sweatstainedalthough thanks to fawn neatly mended cropped hair uncombed jaw unshaved because theyd all been eager to leave last nights damp camp and move along most of his old scars were covered by his clothing but for the first time in a while dag felt an impulse to hold his maimed left arm behind his back the boys were tidy enough for patrollers their youth dag thought with an inward sigh could have made rags look good on them though they did not know it fawn still atop magpie was her own fair small strong self brown eyes bright with hope and worry every scant inch a farmer girl he was reminded of the day shed told the formidable captain fairbolt crow to go take a jump in hickory lake during another notaltogethereasy introduction and almost smiled as the maker came to a halt and took in the folks awaiting him he seemed more and more nonplussed after a second sweeping look over the party pausing on remo he addressed himself to dag tavias tale seems a trifle confused but if thats your boy there i can tell you right now he hasnt the ground to apprentice for a medicine maker hes a patroller born if youve come all this way for a different answer than you had at home im sorry for it because i cant give it to you remo looked taken aback no sir he said hastily thats not what were here for and dags not my father hes my um captain i guess captain nocamp the illfated crane had dubbed dag the name seemed to be sticking along with a few more unwanted gifts the coppergilt eyes narrowed on dags hook arkady said more gently ah you may have been misled by rumor on a day with the right wind at my back i can do some useful things but i dont make miracles im afraid theres not much i can do for your arm that injurys far too old dag unlocked his voice im not here about my missing hand sir im here about the hand that came back so bluntly confronted dag found it hard to explain his needs its not remo whos interested in training for medicine maker its me arkadys eyes flew wide surely not makers talents if you have them should have shown by age twenty even a groundsetters potential should be starting to show by age forty i was long gone for patroller by then and no one much could have stopped me my makers calling was delayed but everything changed for me this year from my name to my ground dag swallowed anyhow fawn put in dag doesnt just think he can be a medicine maker hes been healing folks all down the grace and gray valleys he fixed hods busted kneecap where the horse kicked him and cresss infected gut and chicorys busted skull and that other fellows cut throat after the fight at the bandit cave and who knows what all else there and he healed bos stab to his stomach that we all thought sure was going to kill him and he made a sharing knife before that he did patrol healing on the trail i guess but since last summer all this other has come roaring out i dont know why now but talent he has he needs instruction so as not to make bad mistakes from not knowing things which is a regret i could tell you all about arkadys head rocked back his eyes narrowed at dag then fixed on remo have you seen this he demanded yes sir said remo well the kneecap i saw later after it was part healed and i wasnt there for the woman at pearl riffle but all the rest yes and more said barr his lips twisting if so why wasnt he invitedsnatched upby the makers at one of those camps along the river all the folks he healed were farmers said fawn arkady recoiled he wheeled on dag in a voice of suppressed fury he said you unspeakable fool you went and left all those poor people mad with beguilement dags lips curled up no sir because between fawn remo hod and me we cracked unbeguilement as well i could see it was the first thing had to be done if i meant to be a medicine maker to farmers which i did and do all three new moon folks were staring at dag openmouthed and seeing not much he still held his ground veiling tightfurled none could tell if he was concealing lies or truth only that he was concealing himself youre raving said arkady abruptly and i cant be dealing with a renegade im no renegade said dag stung on the raw are you so sure old patroller he was going to have to unveil open himself to those coppergold eyes and whatever lay behind them which he hadnt wanted to do at this gate or at all he admitted to himself deserter said neeta suspiciously she glanced at fawn and her voice grew edged with scorn oh of course its obvious banished for farmer loving back in oleana no although the latter had come too close to being true i resigned from the patrol in good order my old camp captain knows where i went and why the problem was huge complex with snarled strings running down into the most intimate aspects of his ground and up and out into the whole wide green world blight its impossible to speak this tangle plain but fawns eyes were urgent on him he must not disappoint her appalling trust renegade deserter banished or just plain mad its clear youre unfit to be a medicine maker said arkady coldly off with you get out of this camp he began to veer away fawns hand went out in pleading he did not glance at her we pretend to save farmers thought dag but in truth we turn our backs opening his ground here now felt like tearing off a bandage stuck to a halfhealed wound dag nearly expected to see blood and pus flying for the first time in weeks he extended his ghost hand in its full power and groundripped a strip from the back of the makers left hand right down to the matter blood burst from it like a cat scratch arkady hissed and wheeled back open at last to the man dag bent before the density of his ground a subdued brilliance like the sun behind a cloud what arkady would make of the dark mess that was presently dag there was no guessing the makers face worked with ripples of emotion shock outrage chilling anger arkady touched the bleeding scratch with the finger of his other hand the blood stopped flowing some floating part of dags mind marveled ah he can do groundwork on himself dag said in a deadlevel voice open as you were i could have reached in and done that to the artery from your heart just as easily at your first heartbeat it would have burst and youd have been dead in the next and im walkin around loose out here if im not to turn into a real renegade a man who just needs killin i need some kind of a pathfinder because right now im almost as lost as ive ever been save for after wolf ridge and the death of kauneo nothing would ever be as dark as that again the realization was oddly consoling the two gate guards both had their knives out tense with alarm but arkady waved them back he was plainly shaken his lips moved on anamesutaw he straightened himself fastidiously flicked the trailing red drops from his fingers inhaled and said coldly that was an inexcusably clumsy piece of groundsetting if you were an apprentice of mine id have your hide for groundwork that ripped into a patient like that all the blood seemed to drain from dags head so deep was his relief hes seen this he knows what it is it looks normal to him its a known groundsetting technique not malice magic im not turning into a malice dag only realized hed fallen to his knees when fawn appeared at his side her voice anxious dag are you all right are you laughing or crying she pulled his hand away from his face his shoulders shook im not sure spark he groaned both i think only now when it was so abruptly removed did he realize just how much that secret terror had been riding him sapping his strength had he been a fool maybe not arkady rubbed his chiseled chin and at length sighed you all had better come down to my place i dont think i can deal with this in the middle of the road all of them sir said neeta with a dubious look at fawn they seem to come as a set yes all tavia tell the women ill be having four guests for lunch today he walked over and extended his right hand to dag indeed i need a hand dag took it hauling himself upright again a halfmile walk leading the horses brought them all to arkadys place and fawn stared in astonishment after her experience at hickory lake camp shed thought she knew what lakewalker tents were like crude deliberately temporary log cabins usually with an open side protected by hide awnings clustered in kin groups around a dock space or central fire pit the dwellings shed glimpsed at pearl riffle had been similar this this was a house two huge trees laden with dark green leaves like drooping tongues but not a blossom in sight at this seasonbracketed a stonepaved walk atop a foundation cut into the slope and lined with fitted stones several rooms rambled built of silverygray weathered cedar planks roofed with splitwood shingles and connected by a long porch the windows gleamed with real glass barr and remo fawn was consoled to note also stared openmouthed by camp standards it was practically a palace dag seemed less surprised but then fawn wasnt exactly sure if he was paying attention after his brief scary breakdown at the gate hed recovered himself and was looking awfully closed again they tied the horses to the porch rail and followed arkady into what appeared to be a main room pausing to wipe their feet after him twice once on a mat outside and again on a rag rug just inside the door the far wall had a whole row of glass windows and a door onto an unroofed porch overlooking the lake a large hearth to the right was fitted up for cooking which fawn suspected might include cooking up medicines by the hearth stood a sturdy table waist height for working but near the windows was a lower round one that seemed just for eating it boasted real lathemade chairs with stuffed cloth cushions tied on at hickory lake folks had mostly made do with trestle tables and upended logs you can wash your hands at the sink arkady directed and busied himself with his water kettle and a teapot of all things fawn guessed that he was buying time to think about what to do next hed said almost nothing on the walk from the gate beyond laconically pointing out patrol headquarters and the medicine tent bracketing the entry road those too had been plankbuilt and houselike beneath a lakeside window the tinlined sink had a water barrel with a wooden tap to its right a drain board to the left fawn filled the washbasin and took her turn with a cake of fine white soap watching while dag did his onehanded trick with the soap and water after her arkady she noticed paused to covertly watch that too the patroller boys followed suit the very dirty water was dumped down a drain where it gurgled through a wooden pipe leading outside it was all as handy as a wellfurbished farm kitchen and as hard to shift fawn fancied she could almost hear dag thinking sessile and not in a tone of approval they sat five around the table and watched while arkady poured out tea into fired clay mugs and offered a pitcher of honey fawn sipped the sweet brew gratefully wondering who was supposed to start and if it would be up to her to her relief arkady began soexpatrollerhow have you come to me new moon cutoff seems a long way from oleana he took a swallow and settled back watching dag narrowly it was adeliberatelybroadly worded question dag looked somewhat desperately at fawn where to begin spark he asked she bit her lip the beginning which would be glassforge i guess that far back all of it you sure if we dont explain how your knife got primed at glassforge you wont be able to explain what you did with it at bonemarsh and hoharie herself said she thought that was magery arkadys eyes widened slightly at the word who is hoharie hickory lakes chief medicine maker dag explained ah arkady went still taking this in do go on how about if i start said fawn their tale had to convince the groundsetter to take dag seriously despite dags running off to mix with farmers because if they could be let into the camp on this mans bare word they could surely be thrown out the same way plain and true nothing else would do just as well fawn didnt think she could tell fancy lies to that penetrating coppery stare it was coming on strawberry season last summer in oleana and i was going to glassforge to look for work on account of she took a breath for courage the intimate parts of this tale would be new to barr and remo too it was almost harder to speak it in front of them than this shiny stranger on account of as id got pregnant with a farm boy who didnt care to marry me and i didnt care to stay around and deal with what my life would be at home once it came out so the road dags patrol was called down there to help search for a malice that was running a bandit gang in the hills a couple of the banditsa mudman and a beguiled fellowsnatched me off the road because i was pregnant it seems remos eyes widened and barr blinked but both kept their mouths shut tight arkadys hand touched his lips so its true that malices need pregnant women for their molts yes said dag though theyll also use pregnant animals if they cant get humans its not actually the women they crave its the fastgrowing ground of the youngsters they bear and the the template of bearing to teach them how see i arrived almost in time there was this cave the malice ripped the ground from fawns child about the time i hit its mudman guards i was carrying a pouch with two sharing knives in it one primed and one bonded to me i tossed the pouch to fawn who was closer and she put both knives in the malice one after the other wrong one first confessed fawn the unprimed one i didnt know you couldnt have dag assured her he stared rather fiercely at arkady who in fact showed no signs of wanting to criticize this it had me by the neck at the time which is where these came from fawn went on touching the deep red dents marring the sides of her throat four on one side and one on the other so thats what those are said arkady startled into leaning forward and peering he drew his hand back before actually touching her i didnt think to find blight scars on a farmer those are the freshest ive ever seen that sort of ground injury doesnt often come our way down here barr leaned back his brow wrinkling belatedly figuring out just how close to a malice fawn had come she thought if i have malice fingerprints on me the malice couldnt have been more than an arms length off you know count yourselves lucky said dag dryly with this start he seemed willing to take up the tale in any case my bonded knife ended up primed with the ground of fawns child hickory lakes chief knife maker and i each have different ideas as to why but they dont matter now anyway on the way to take the knife to my camp and see about the puzzle we stopped at west bluefawns kinfolk have a farm just up that river valleyi thought theyd want to know she was still alive we were married there twice over once by farmer customs and once by ours here roll up your sleeve spark he shrugged awkwardly out of his jacket and rolled up his own left sleeve revealing the arm harness that held his wrist cap in place and above it his wedding cord that fawn had braided he normally kept his sleeve rolled down in front of strangers but fawn supposed this maker like a farmer midwife had to see what was going on in order to do his work so you just had to get past the shyness almost as reluctantly fawn pushed up her left cuff to reveal her cord that dag had braided dag hitched his shoulder forward does your groundsense say these are valid cords he asked growled more like yes said arkady cautiously fawn sighed with relief thank you for your honesty sir dag sat back with a satisfied nod we had some blighted stupid argumentation about that at hickory lake later arkady cleared his throat your tentkin did not welcome your new bride i take it your very young bride fawn fancied his glance at her added but he had the prudence not to say it aloud your aunt mari and uncle cattagus were pretty nice to me i thought said fawn in what defense she could muster of dags home wait dag you left out the glass bowl that has to be important it was the first time your ghost hand came out she turned to arkady thats what dag called it at first because it spooked him something awful but hoharie said it was a ground projection youd better tell that part dag because to me it just looked like magic there was this glass bowl dag waved his hand back at west blue just before we were wed it meant a lot to fawnshed brought it back from glassforge as a gift for her mama my tentmother now it fell and broke three big pieces and about a hundred shards fawn added in support all over the parlor floor she was grateful that he left out the surrounding family uproar angry as she sometimes was with her kin she would not have wanted to see them held up as fools before this arkady i dag made a gesture with his hook this came out and i sort of swirled the glass all back together through its ground id seen bowls like it being made back in glassforge you see its ground had a hum to it his lips shaped but did not blow a note arkady barr and remo were all staring at his hookno not the hook fawn realized at the invisible elusive ground projection that took the place of his lost left hand which she would never see but could sometimesshe suppressed a smilefeel dag eased back as did the other three lakewalkers and she guessed hed let the projection go in again first i heard about that bowl muttered barr to remo ye gods did you know about it remo shook his head and motioned his partner to shush before things came to the point at hickory lake dag went on there was that big malice outbreak over in raintree did you hear much about it way down here a little said arkady i confess the patrollers here follow the news from the north more closely than i do there always seems to be some excitement going on up your way raintree malice was more than that it promised to be every bit as bad as the wolf war in luthlia twenty years back worse because it was fixing to tear across thickly settled farmer country malice food on a platter arkady shrugged but you were from oleanayou said dags lips thinned fawn put in quickly raintree sent out riders for help hickory lakes sort of next door being in the far northwest of the hinterland fairbolt crowcamp captain at hickory lakechose dag to be company captain of the force they sent out explain about groundripping the malice dag dag drew breath and twisted his left arm turning his hook ghost hand displayed again or just referred to that thing i did to you at the gate sir for which i apologize but i had to anyway what did you make it out to be arkady reminded touched the back of his hand now scabbed and frowned at dag a projection for groundsetting applied too powerfully and damaging the overlying tissue deliberately i take it although there are occasions when such tearing is a valuable toolused rather more precisely i must say used vastly more powerfully and not at all precisely its the same as the groundripping a malice does said dag arkadys brows flew up surely not his eyes flicked toward fawns throat surely is said dag ive seen it coming and going and theres no mistakei can show you the old malice scars on my legs later like that glass bowl the first time i did it i was pretty upsetwe had closed on the malice and it was trying to groundrip one of my patrollers i just reached out dag drew breath free advice boys bought at the usual cost dont ever try to groundrip a malice its ground sticks to yours and is deadly poisonous thats how i got these scars he gestured to his left side generally he wasnt pointing to his body fawn realized but to its ground oh said arkady in an odd voice i couldnt imagine what had caused those dark ripples dag hesitated youve never seen a malice have you sir arkady shook his head ever patrolled at all when i was a boy they had me out a few times with the others my age but i showed for a maker very young ah the camping trips with the kiddies muttered barr i hate those the riveted remo poked him to silence so youve never seen a live mudman sighed dag ah no arkady added after a moment the medicine maker who trained me at moss river camp had a dead one that he kept on display dried though which made it hard to make out any distinguishing details it fell apart after a short while pity i thought and youve never seen a mudman nursery either thats going to make what came next hard to explain arkady paused for a long moment with a peculiar look on his face swallowed some first response and said instead try all right we found all this out bit by bit mind the malice before we did for it had taken a place called bonemarsh camp most of the lakewalkers got awaydags swift glance around arkadys house whispered sessile again to fawnbut it captured half a dozen makers it groundlocked them together arkady gave a little flinching hiss oh theres worse to come it anchored this huge complicated involution in their grounds to slave them to make up a batch of about fifty mudmen which the malice had growing from local animals a halfformed mudman is about the most gutwrenching thing youve ever seen by the way you want to kill it quick just for the pity of it when my company got back to bonemarsh we found the groundlock still holding the makers seeming unconscious id thought the lock would break when the malice died ysee but i was wrong worse when anyone opened their grounds to try to reach in and break the lock they were sucked into the array as well lost three patrollers finding that out thats astonishing said arkady fawns first fear that arkady would toss them out before they got their tale half told eased beneath his quelling reserve she thought he was growing quite engrossed he likes the parts about groundwork dag nodded shortly this was a very advanced malice the most fully developed ive ever seen and ah how many have you seen dag shrugged i lost count years back that ive slain with a knife in my own hand twentysix or so thats counting the sessiles which i do anyway back at bonemarshi stupidly tried to match grounds to steady the heartbeat of a dying maker in the array and i got sucked in too which is how i found out about the involutioni saw it from the inside and after that the story has to go to fawn because the next few days were all a gray fog for me fawn decided on a simplified version i came to bonemarsh with hoharie because dag had sent back for her help with this horrible groundlock thing none of the lakewalkers seemed to know what to do about it which made me about half crazy watching and waiting then hoharie tried some experimenti never did find out what though i think she suspected about the involution she did dag nodded anyhow then she was drawn in and mari who was in charge by then said no more experiments but that night i thought of one more if an involution is a cutoff piece of a maker or a malice which it seems to be maybe this leftover piece of malice just needed a separate dose of mortality in order to destroy it so i took my sharing knifeshe gulped in memoryand stuck it in dags leg because when i slew the malice back in glassforge hed said i could stick it in anywhere dag smiled and murmured sharp end first fawn smiled back i think it worked to give it into dags ghost hand the way his arm jerked up but hell have to tell that part fawn concluded dag frowned and scratched his head strangest experience i ever did have we all know what it feels like to have a body and no ground from being youngsters before our groundsense comes in or in veiling while i was slaved in the malices groundlock it seemed like i was my groundbut not my body i felt the knife come into me and i knew it at onceit had been bonded to me and still had affinity with my blood but fawns childs ground lacked affinity with the malicevery strange and pure it wasso there was no resonance no no calling to break open the knifes involution and release the dying ground so i broke open the involution myself and added some affinity from my ghost hand it was like unmaking a knife all backward it tore up my ghost hand something fierce but it destroyed the malices groundwork and cleaned out those poison spatters as well fawns sacrificewell with that little extra groundwork from megot all ten of us out of the lock alive he blinked at arkady who was staring with his hand before his parted lips as if to stifle an exclamation and added apologetically it wasnt like i saw it and figured it out and did it it was more like i saw it and did it and figured it all out much later remo said in downright peeved tones you never told me about all that dag you only told me about greenspring greenspring was the important part seemed to me fawn shivered in memory dag grimacing reached across the table to briefly grip her shoulder as he might console a young patroller arkady took his hand from his mouth and said so what was greenspring dag sighed when id recovered enough to ride we all went home by way of the blighted farmer village that malice had emerged under when we arrived we found some folks had come back and were having a mass burial of those who hadnt got out which was about half of a thousand people that first feast was the secret of how that malice had grown so quick so strong he shared a look of understanding with fawn who picked up the thread theyd finished planting the grownups mostly women and old folks and were just starting on the children she took a breath measured arkady and dared to say im told new moon camp lost a youngster a couple of months back there werehow many children in the row in front of that trench dag laid out all stiff and wan there had seemed no end to them one hundred sixtytwo dag said flatly the groundripping had kept them from rotting in the heat explained fawn and swallowed hard pale icechildren it didnt help as much as youd think arkady shut his ground just then fawn thought he went something more than expressionless at any rate it took me some thinking after said dag how greenspring was let to happen and what could keep it from happening again its an oleana problem in the south theres nearly no malices and in the far north theres nearly no farmers where theres both he held up hand and hook but was frustrated in a gesture of interlacing fingers fawn thought everyone could imagine it though it was plain something needed done and it was plainer no one was doing it and that we were running out of time to wait for someone smarter than me to try to figure out what thats why i broke with my kin and camp and quit the patrol they thought it was over fawn and it was but it was fawn led me to greenspring roundaboutly dag gave a sharp nod and fell silent i see said arkady slowly he glanced toward his front door annoyance flashed across his face but then shifted to a shrewder look he rose and was halfway to it when a knock sounded sticking his head out arkady exchanged murmurs with his caller fawn caught a glimpse of a middleaged woman who craned her neck in turn but did not enter arkady turned back holding a large basket covered with a cloth which he thumped down upon the table some lunch all around would be as well just now i think fawn remo and barr all jumped up to help arkady set out tools and plates dag sat more wearily and let them the break from the tension was welcomed by everyone fawn suspected even arkady the basket yielded a big lidded clay pot full of a thick stew two kinds of bread wrapped in cloths and almost to fawns greater astonishment than this farmerstyle fare what were identifiably a couple of plunkins spheres half the size of her head with brown husks cut open they revealed a solid fruit both redder in color and sweeter than the plunkin shed encountered at hickory lake why dont you have this kind up north dag she asked around a mouthful longer growing season i think he answered also around a mouthful judging from the munching all the northern lakewalkers at the table plainly thought it was a treat arkady explained that these were grown in the shallow ends of the crescent lake arkady did not pursue his interrogation while they atethinking or did he just have medical notions about guarding digestion nor did dag volunteer anything further the boys fawn thought wouldnt have dared to say boo but arkady wouldnt be feeding us this good if he wasnt at least thinking of keeping us would he or maybe he just reckoned wild patrollers like wild animals could be tamed with vittles finally growing replete fawn thought to ask arkady where did all this food come from who should we thank he looked a trifle surprised at the question my neighboring tents take it in turns to send over my lunches and suppers breakfasts i do for myself tea usually are you sick she asked diffidently his brows went up no he busied himself making another pot of tea while fawn and remo repacked the basket and set it outside the front door at arkadys direction he washed his hands again sat poured frowned at dag dag frowned back your wife said arkady delicately does not appear to be beguiled she never has been dag said have you not done any groundwork on her quite a bit time to time said dag but she never grew beguiled with me that was half the key to unlocking unbeguilement hod was the other half a sweep of arkadys clean hand invited dag to continue maybe this subject would be less fraught than greenspring you know beguilement can be erratic said dag painfully aware arkady grimaced like most young and foolish medicine makers i once tried to heal farmers the results were disastrous lesson learned fawn wanted to hear more of this but arkady waved dag on again dag sighed as if steeling himself for this next confession hod was a teamsters helper out of glassforgewe hitched a ride with his wagon down to pearl riffle my horse kicked him in the knee which made me feel sort of responsible i remembered what id done with that glass bowl and set myself to try a real healing which i did dopulled his broken kneecap back together good but it left him beguiled to the eyebrows which we found out when he made to follow us on our flatboat and fawn said take him along and maybe you can figure out why but if you leave him you never will and she was right come to it me fawn hod and remo all sat in a circle and traded around little ground reinforcements till we figured it out i dont think anyone who didnt have both a beguiled and an unbeguiled farmer to compare at the same time could have seen it remo said even i could see it once dag showed me i cant quite do the unbeguiling trick yet though arkadys glance went in surprise to remo and what did you see he asked dont tell him dag said fawn show him she felt uncomfortable volunteering to be the demonstration farmer but from his expression she suspected arkady had some pretty stiffset ideas on the subject that mere assertion would not shift elbows again said remo thatd do agreed dag watch close arkady as the ground transfers remo reached across the table and touched fawns left elbow she felt the spreading warmth of a tiny ground reinforcement she tried to decide if it also made her feel any friendlier toward the boy or made him look finer to her eyes since she already liked him well it was hard to tell arkady looked across at dag in some puzzlement so now watch again watch for a little backflow of ground from fawn to me almost as it flows from me to her its like it flows back through the reinforcement dag smiled and reached his left arm toward her right elbow as before she saw nothing but arkady sworethe first shed heard him do so she realized absent gods that explains it yes you just saw an unbeguilement the farmer ground tries to rebalance itself through a ground exchange the way it happens when two lakewalkers trade ground but if the lakewalker is closedrejects itit bounces back and sets up this odd um imbalance in the farmer ground which the farmer experiences as longing for another reinforcement obsession if the imbalance is bad enough no yes arkady reached up and almost mussed his carefully tied hair yes i see but not that alone is this why your ground is such a ghastly mess how many of these have you been doing his voice wasnt quite a shriek fawn stared at him with disappointment she felt dags discovery should be due much more applause i unbeguiled every farmer i did healing groundwork on of course once id figured it out that is dag added a bit guiltily fawn wondered how cress was getting along and then there were the oats fawn put in and the pie and the mosquito dont forget that that started it all your poor arm swelled up so bad you couldnt get your arm harness on after you groundripped that mosquito remember you took in ground from all those things said arkady in horror its a miracle youre still alive absent gods man you could have killed yourself aha said fawn in triumph i told you ripping that thorny tree would be a bad idea dag dag smiled wearily i sort of figured that out for myself sir well fawn and i did after a bit a properly supervised apprentice said arkady somewhat through his teeth would never have been permitted to contaminate himself with such dreadful experiments groundsetters apprentice you mean of course said arkady impatiently no one else would be capable of the idiocy dag scratched his stubbled chin and said mildly then he wouldnt ever have been able to discover unbeguilement would he might be a good thing i started out unsupervised is it still asked arkady dag lost his glint of humor no he admitted because then came crane arkady leaning forward to vent something irate sat back more slowly in a suddenly neutral voice he said tell me about crane the boys were there for that one dag said with a tired nod at barr and remo remo said crane was a real lakewalker renegade nastiest piece of work i ever did see which is why sir you shouldnt ought to call dag one awed till now by the groundsetter quiet remo flashed genuine anger with this arkadys head went back a fraction barr put in crane was an oleana man banished from a camp up there for theft and um keeping a farmer woman hed set himself up as leader to this bandit gang on the lower grace river taking and burning boats and murdering their crewshorrible stuff if it wasnt for us lakewalkers being aboard our flatboat would have been tricked like the others i think remo went on dag set us to gathering all the other boats and men that came down the river that day to make an attack on the camp and clean it out which we did dag um captured crane himself barr and i were up the hill dealing with another bandit just then so i didnt exactly witness he trailed off with a beseeching look at dag dag said in an expressionless voice i dropped him by groundripping a slice out of his spinal cord just below the neck once saw a man fall from a horse and break his neck about there so i had a pretty good guess what it would do that seems extreme said arkady in a nearly matching voice he regarded dag steadily he was holding a knife to my throat at the time fawn put in nervous lest arkady go picturing dag as some coldblooded killer and his men were about to get away with our boat i dont think dag had much choice if i had it to do over said dag well if i had it all to do over id leave more men to guard the boats regardless of how shorthanded it made us at the cave but if it were all the same again id do it again i dont regret it but it left me stuck with this last mess in my ground a general gesture at his torso arkady frowned judiciously i see arent you going to tell about the sharing knife said remo anxiously oh dag shrugged we found an unprimed sharing knife in the bandits spoils that theyd apparently taken off a murdered lakewalker woman crane was due to be hanged with the rest so i gave him the choice of sharing instead which he chose surprised me a little i boiled the old bonding off the knife and reset the involution and bonded it to crane and used it to execute him which was dodgy but everything else about the man was dodgy so i figured it fit first knife i ever made id like to have your camps knife maker look it over for soundness if i get a chance though im pretty sure theres no such thing as a halfmade knife it either primes or it doesnt and said arkady you thought you could do this why dag shrugged once more my brother is a knife maker at hickory lake so ive been around the process off and on but mostly i learned how from taking apart the groundwork of my knife at bonemarsh and ah arkady said the other kind of why what gave dag the right does he mean fawn wondered dag regarded him steadily back i needed a knife i hate walking bare a little silence fell all around the table you know dag said fawn slowly weve spent since last spring being knocked from pillar to post so bad its a wonder weve had time to breathe but when you lay it all out in a row like this dont you see a kind of pattern to things no said dag she looked up at arkady do you sir she thought his face said yes but he pushed back his chair instead of answering he said you folks look as though you all slept in a ditch last night pretty near fawn admitted infested with scary swamp lizards at that id think youd all enjoy a hot bath then said arkady this won blank looks from all three patrollers fawn appalled by a vision of heating pots and pots of water on the hearth said hastily oh we couldnt put you to so much trouble sir its no trouble ill show you a little smugly arkady led them outside and down some stairs from the lakeside porch to an area of flagged pavement at the far side was a remarkable setup a shower bucket with a pull rope on a post made private by a clothhung screen and a big barrel its bottom lined with copper over a fire pit coals still glowed underneath you can take the path down to the lake to get more water all you wantarkady pointed to a pair of buckets on a yokeand heat it in the barrel more woods in the stack behind those forsythia bushes put the hot water in the shower bucket soap up and rinse down soak in the barrel after take your time i need to go talk with some folks but ill be back in a while he paused and studied dag er do you shave now and then said dag dryly now then arkady went back in popped out a few moments later with a stack of towels and a new cake of soap and disappeared again this time for good fawn stared after him bewildered by this turn though not ungrateful do we stink that bad asked remo sniffing his shirt barr was too busy delightedly examining the mechanism of the shower to answer we arent too pretty compared to arkady fawn allowed and this keeps us occupied here for as long as he wants to talk to folks how many folks i wonder said dag sounding less impressed oh of course fawns gratitude faded in new worry how many people in the camp had more authority than this groundsetter that he needed to consult them it answered dags question if in an unsettling fashion not many but dag assisted fawn to take the first turn and then took one himself with apparent enjoyment she thought barr very gallant to volunteer for the last turn till he refused to come out again granted soaking in the barrel which steamed in the chill air was blissful he was still pickling in there when arkady returned to find the rest of them dressed and clustered around the hearth drying their hair dags system was to run a towel over his head once but remo fussed more over his than fawn did over hers arkady put his hands on his hips and looked dag over better he allowed i cant have you following me around the camp looking like some starveling vagabond after all am i to do so asked dag warily why its how apprenticing is done normally fawn almost whooped with joy but dag merely rubbed his newshaved chin i take your offer kindly sir but im not sure how long we can stay my work is up north not down here he glanced at fawn arkady answered the question beneath the question you can all stay here at my place for the moment including your farmer bride though its asked that she not wander around the camp unescorted fawn nodded glad acceptance of the rule though dag frowned a trifle which made fawn wonder belatedly asked by who youll just be watching and listening at first you understand said arkady at least till i can figure out some way to cleanse your dirty ground if i can dag flicked an eyebrow upward im good at listenin so am i to be your apprenticeor your patient a bit of both arkady admitted you askedno she asked he corrected under his breath if i saw a pattern in your tale i did i saw a man coming late and abruptly into groundsetter powers totally unsupervised making the wildest mess of himself you know sir you dont sound too approving but my two top notions were that i was going mad or that i was turning into a malice i like your version better arkady snorted normally the development youve experienced would have unfolded over five or six years not five or six months naturally you found it confusing andhow old are you midfifties dag nodded well your talents around fifteen years late showing to boot i dont know what you were doing all that time patrolling said dag briefly or why its all released now arkady continued dag smiled across at fawn do you think your farmer girl has something to do with it demanded arkady i admit i dont see how dags smile deepened my tentbrother whit who i grant has a mouth on him thats going to get his teeth busted one of these days once said he didnt know if i was robbin cradles or if fawn was robbin graves i think it was the second id pretty much lain down in mine just waiting for someone to come along and throw the dirt in on top instead she came along and yanked me out of it i will say sir it was a lot more restful than what ive been doing since but it was pinching narrow i dont hanker to go back in fawns heart lifted arkady just shook his head he turned toward the door took two steps then turned back oh dag he held up both his hands fawn saw it only by reflection but well enough at that barr and remo looked startled and impressed and dagdags face lit right up arkady has ghost hands too well have to see what we can do about your little asymmetry problem later said arkady among other things he jerked his chin at remo come along patroller boy ill show you where to take your horses dags apprenticeship began sooner than he or he guessed even arkady expected they were all at the table finishing breakfast from a basket sent to sustain the enlarged householdbread plunkin and hardboiled eggs with more teawhen after the briefest knock at the door a breathless boy burst in and blurted maker arkady sir maker challa says to tell you theyre bringing in a hurt patroller an if you would be pleased to step round very well said arkady calmly tell her ill be right along the boy nodded and departed as abruptly as hed arrived arkady swallowed his tea dag said uneasily shouldnt we go at once if the patrollers condition were that dire i doubt hed have lived to arrive said arkady you have time to finish your drink he set down his mug rose without haste and added for the real emergencies challa rings a big bell she has up on a post in front of the medicine tent two rings and three all the makers tents are within earshot one direction or another then we run now evidently they strolled dag gave fawn a hug goodbye nodded thanks at her whisper of good luck shrugged on his jacket and followed arkady out the morning was not young weary from their thirtymile trudge barr remo and fawn had all slept in although even so they were up before their host dag had wakened at first light with all of the uncertainties that had chased one another around in his head last night ready for more laps after taking remo to settle the horses yesterday afternoon arkady evidently deciding that dag cleaned up well enough to be displayed had escorted him to the medicine tent for introductions to his surprise dag had learned that arkady was not new moon cutoffs chief medicine maker that post was held by a much older woman saggy baggy and cheerful maker challa had eyed dag shrewdly and shown him around her domain introducing him in turn to the herblore master and his two apprentices and to her own partner a woman more nearly dags age they didnt ask dag as many questions as hed feared it was plain that arkady had discussed his odd stray with them already provisionally accepted but just what were the provisions a fiveminute walk along the shore road brought the medicine tent within sight it was a rambling gray structure like arkadys house and not much larger at the railing out front was a rig dag recognized from patrol procedure two saddled horses fore and aft of a makeshift litter of cut sapling poles challa and a lean brownhaired patroller were just lifting a more heavily built grayhaired patroller to his feet drawing his arms over their shoulders and aiming him inside at every step the older patroller mumbled ow ow ow well tapp said arkady with callous cheerfulness as they came up even with the group and what have you done to yourself nothing blight it snapped the grayhaired man whose plait was coming undone all i did was fling my saddlebags up on my horse just like ive done ten thousand times before i swear a fellows insides shouldnt come popping out just from saddling his blighted horse ow ow arkady opened the door for them the lean patroller bent to undo his partners boots then maneuvered him through the first room crammed with shelves devoted to records into a bright chamber with glass windows overlooking the lake all four of them helped lift the hurting man onto the narrow bed at table height that stood out in the center of the room tapp was clammy and gasping with pain but he still eyed dag and his left arm curiously arkady and tapps partner between them shucked him out of his trousers and challa briskly rolled down his drawers to groin level raised her white eyebrows and pointed at a reddened bulge at the side of his abdomen yep said arkady come over here dag and tell me what you sense tapp watched dag uneasily who the blight is he clean up your mouth tapp chided challa if a fellow cant swear at a time like this when can he tapp complained not in my tent said challa firmly tapp snorted then winced yes maam makermaam his wandering gaze returned to dag arent you a patroller he asked querulously not one of ours courier i was once said dag now um arkady waited with cool interest to see how dag would explain himself you know how we exchange young patrollers to other camps in the hope that someone else will have better luck knocking sense into them said dag yes said tapp you can think of me as an exchange maker on trial dag cleared his throat and added its only my first day see arkady challa no cried tapp you always turn your hamhanded novices loose on me arkady grinned calm yourself tapp dag heres just observing he lifted a suddenly sharp coppery gaze to dag and what do you observe dag cupped his right hand above the bulge and reluctantly opened himself his sudden move lifting his bags likely split open a weak place in his belly muscles and a piece of his gut has worked through and has got itself twisted around pretty bad its all hot and swollen which doesnt help a thing id guess he tried to tough it out too blidag glanced at challa watching him as closely as arkadytoo longi dont need a litter i can ride the partner barked a laugh the very words tapp glared at him and made it worse getting here dag went on how far out was your patrol a twoday ride the partner said we were up northwest almost to the banks of the gray sometime on the ride his gut got knotted back on itself like this and the hole swelled tight and now hes in a bad way and no mistake im thinking hes lucky it wasnt a threeday ride arkady tilted his head in reluctant respect very good and what would you do about it dag said cautiously i knew a fellow up in a place i once patrolled had something like this the makers stuffed his gut back inside somehow persuaded the hole shut and put him on camp rest till it finished healing i dont rightly know how the gutstuffing part was done if theres no torsion and the rip in the muscle sheet is large enough you can actually do it pressing with your fingers said arkady i did it that way five times on the way here tapp complained but my gut kept falling out again till it all swelled shut challa winced arkady sighed and i suppose you insisted you could eat too not after the first day tapp said in a smaller voice arkady rolled his eyes and muttered patrollers he drew breath and turned again to dag twisted and tight as this is now its going to take some careful groundsetting to restore the gut without rupturing it and spilling blood and rotting food into the abdominal cavity which is a recipe for infection dag nodded understanding like a knife wound to the belly correct challa if i may trouble you to dump a dense ground reinforcement into the inflamed area well see if we can relieve the tightness a bit before attempting to manipulate anything challa nodded laid her hands on the lump and closed her eyes dag sensed the flow of her unshaped groundgifting into tapps unhappy flesh the extra ground would support and speed the bodys own attempts to heal and so ease the swelling and pain the simplest of procedures any number of patrollers learned at least that much groundwork even the younger dag the focus of challas groundwork was much finer however and its density impressive while were waiting for that to take effect arkady went on let me tell you more dag willingly and tapp much less willingly were then treated to a detailed description of half a dozen other ways dag would never have imagined that folks insides could end up in places where they did not belong and what to do about it dag was especially impressed or appalled by the version that had the stomach squeezing through the little hole in the diaphragm where the gullet connected and ending up half on one side and half on the other about the time tapp must have been wishing hed never been born arkady wrapped up his talk and cupped his hands gently around the bulge dag extended his sensitivity to his utmost down and in arkady glanced up keenly at him then returned his attention to his task closing his eyes in concentration arkadys groundfingers shaped themselves in unfingerlike ways to gently widen the hole tease the gut knot apart and slide the strained tissue back inside in a sallow sweat tapp whimpered his partner gripped his hand hard and watched him in concern all patrollerhumor extinguished the power thought dag the power to so readily move matter through its ground was immense yet arkadys ground projection danced as delicately as if he were laying out flower petals that he was trying not to crush he persuaded the two sides of the ripped hole back together then set a neatly shaped ground reinforcement to hold them that way tapps strained face and grip eased and he lay back bonelessly on the table it had all been done in less than ten minutes without ever breaking the skin ill send one of the hamhanded novices down to your tent tonight to give you another reinforcement arkady told tapp and glanced up has anyone told his wife yet that hes home early i sent the boy said challa indeed tapps wife arrived in a few minutes more irate with worry and the tapp what did you do to yourself and it wasnt my fault conversation was repeated with variations arkady prudently gave most of his instructions to herbed rest and no food till tomorrow camp rest till challa decreed otherwise dag helped carry tapp back out to the horse litter and saw him trundled off escorted by his partner and his wife staring after them dag turned his hook this way and that trying to imagine the groundwork that would persuade half of someones stomach back to its proper position through such a little hole without bursting it under the heart arkady stretching his back beside dag said hell recover well if he doesnt overdo it didnt help that he was two days fooling around with the rupture and telling his patrol leader hed be fine before he even started home his partner says patrollers have no sense sometimes goes with the territory dag said sensible people dont go looking for malices i suppose you would know forty years at it sir huh i guess it would be about that he frowned at dags hook before and after the hand then because it looks like thats been off for about twenty years there aye said dag just about that but if arkady was angling for an old patroller story he was doomed to disappointment a more important question occurred to dag then sirwhy didnt you get cold and shaky after doing that groundwork arkadys head turned what do you after all my healings pretty much and that glassbowl episode knocked me on my tail my flesh felt like clay and my stomach heaved well then you were doing something wrong what well have to figure that out arkady rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand and stared curiously at dag but did not pursue the matter at once instead he turned dag over to challa while he went off to he said check on a few folks challa showed dag her tents recordkeeping methods more pleased than was quite flattering to learn that the shabby northerner could read and write they were interrupted once by a woman whose toddlers oozing sore throat had not responded to home ground reinforcements and a second time by a boy frogmarched in by his father in need of having his bloodied head stitched after a fight with his brother a rock seemed to have been involved presented as evidence or possibly a souvenir by the irate and dizzy loser as she worked challa kept up a gentle and seemingly habitual flow of instruction and commentary that dag drank inwith the growing sense that he was just the latest in a long line of apprentices to pass through her tent dag was painfully aware that he was of no help in stitching up the flap of scalp but at least his hook provided a useful diversion while the sewing was going on the boy ingenuously demanded the taleseverely abridged by dagof how the missing hand had been bitten off by a mudwolf then set his quaking lip and endured his own little ordeal under challas curved needle with fresh determination challa suppressed a smile and complimented his courage barr popped in then with the news that the lunch basket and arkady had both arrived back at the house dag paced silently beside him up the road his head awhirl with his mornings tutorials the range of things he didnt know seemed to be expanding at an alarming rate this lunch basket yielded ham sandwiches and plunkin swiftly consumed while fawn remo and barr cleared away the plates and crumbs from the round table arkady arose and went to one of his shelves he returned with a piece of paper and sat again across from dag instead of presenting it to read he turned it over and tore it in half now he said lets just see what it is youre doing thats giving you trouble watch ahwith your groundsense please what is he about dag opened himself and attended summoning the concentration of the morning against a drift toward a postlunch nap arkady eased the two pieces back in line held them down on the table and ran his thumb down the tear behind the barely perceptible ground projection the paper hissed back together he held it up and snapped it then turned it and tore it in half again fawn and the boys abandoned the sink and slid hastily back into their chairs to watch it had been so swift dag was barely certain what hed sensed but he dutifully positioned the halves on the table in front of him edged them together as best he could extended his ghost hand closed his eyes and found that strange level of perception down and in that he had first discovered while healing hod paper it seemed was much like felted cloth a mass of tiny threads all matted togethertorn away from one another now he was put in mind of how fawn had spun the threads for their wedding cords making the fibers twirl around and catch hold so freshly separated these fibers grounds still held the echo of their former friction this will be easy he smiled and drew his hook down the edges his ghost thumb persuading them back together and opened his eyes in consternation as the paper burst into flame along the line of his repair he beat it out in hasty embarrassment barr ducked the flying char and said its not anybodys birthday dag take it easy dag brushed futilely at the scorch marks on arkadys table sorry sorry im not sure what happened just there mmhuh said arkady leaning back with narrowed eyes and not sounding the least surprised as i thought youre expending far more strength than the task warrants and exhausting yourself prematurely the waste you shed becomes in this case heat but hods knee didnt burst into flames fawn objected adding after a reflective moment luckily that was a much greater task and living beings absorb ground on levels mere objects dont possess the cure for the unpleasant aftereffects you experienced the chill and the nausea isnt some special trick its the result of a general habit of efficiency in ones work dont do with groundsetting anything that can be done physically or even by another medicine maker pace yourself because you never know how soon another patient will turn up and never use more strength than is truly needed its not merely less wasteful its more elegant arkady rolled the last word off his tongue quite lovingly dag scratched his head in doubt barr sniggered i dont know as dag does elegant fawn bristled opening her mouth to begin some hot defense dag interrupted smoothly groundveiling drills when was the last time you and barr did your groundveiling drills remo back before whit and berrys wedding wasnt it remo shot an acid look at his partner yes sir he did not add you were there dag some former patrol leader had evidently cured him of any leaning to risky backtalk now half an hour down on the lakeshore will be a good place no one will interrupt your concentration there remo loyally arose glowered at barr and jerked his chin barr grumbled up and followed him out casting a last look of frustrated curiosity over his shoulder peace of a sort descended beyond an upward twitch of his silvery brows arkady made no comment instead he drained his mug of tea set it sideways to the table and with a sharp crack broke off its handle oh said fawn startled then closed her lips tight she glanced at the door through which the boys had left and folded her hands primly in her lap in a superfluous effort to appear small arkady pushed the two pieces across to dag try again dont try to contain the whole cup or even the whole handle although hold awareness of their essential ground in mind think surfaces again let your muscles do as much as possible hold the parts together tightly he broke off a tinge of color heated his cheeks er fawn lend me your hands over here said dag she nodded understanding rose licked her finger to pick up a couple of tiny fragments still left across the table deposited them again in front of dag and gripped the cup and handle fitting them back together just like the bowl huh her dimple flashed at him as if to say you can do it uhhuh dag shot arkady a challenging glance but the maker made no comment surfaces eh dag closed his eyes reached out till his hook clinked and dropped down and in finding the ground of the bowl of the handle of the two interfaces this fired clay had a rougher voice than the high chime of the glass bowl a mumbling little growl the recent break still vibrated with the rupture though the clay was far more inert than the ends of broken blood vessels that dag had several times worked back together but they still had a good catch the two flakes rose through the air seeking their slots catch catch finer and finer catchcatchcatchcatch and finer still good said arkady stop dag gulped and opened his eyes gingerly fawn released the handle which remained in place even more gingerly she grasped the handle and released the cup the mending held its warm she reported but not near so hot as that bowl was dag you could barely touch that bowl even after it stopped glowing she peered more closely i can just see a line in the glaze the two crumbs of stray clay were also back in place faintly outlined how do you feel arkady asked dag his voice and gaze were both level not bad said dag a little surprised somethings taken out of me sure but i dont feel dizzy or cold and my lunch is staying put this mending lacked the soaring exaltation and violent collapse of his prior ones of the glass bowl or hods knee or chicorys head it was more like interest and ease less exciting to be sure but less wearing i do admit arkady rose and returned with another wrinkled note he sat tore it in half and shoved the pieces across to dag once more try again less hard dag nodded understanding and aligned the scraps fawn slipped back into her chair still clutching the cup and watched wideeyed in anticipation of another conflagration her hand crept toward the damp dishcloth shed been using to wipe the table but then returned bravely to her lap this time dag deliberately slowed himself down drawing his ghost hand back until it was barely projecting he took his time easing along the rip peering warily through his lashes for any untoward flash of flame finishing he opened his eyes staring down at the repaired paper good as old strange he said in a way this is harder than hods knee the body seems to cooperate with its own healing in ways that dead objects dont huh said arkady you already know that do you dag glanced up to catch an unblinking frown arkady went on do that one more time more gently still if you can dag ripped the page in half himself this round smoothed it pulled it back together once more handed it to arkady good said the maker simply something of the same technique works to hold together skin as well best to save it for tissues you cant reach with a needle however that would be all of them in my case dag noted gently ah caught out for the second time the maker grimaced my apologies habit im afraid ill try to be more heedful im used to it said dag did arkady wince hard to tell but he only said that does bring up have you ever attempted a ground projection from your right hand dag shook his head it came out from the left side all on its own seemed like i thought it was well im not just sure what i thought it was fawn said loyally to me it didnt seem any stranger than the rest of what you did yes it was you first guessed it was something i should have that got delayed he smiled to remember just when shed said it too seems you were square on she shrugged stood to reason i thought try now said arkady right hand dag did nothing happened his ground on the right side remained firmly intertwined with the flesh that generated it just as always did dag mention said fawn that at the time his ghost hand first came out his right arm was busted all tied up with splints in a sling though i had to keep making him put it back in the sling arkady sat back really it was more a noise of surprise than disbelief thats interesting after a moment and another glance at the hook his brows drew down in puzzlement my word how in the world did you manage everything i had a little help said dag who you callin little fawn breathed at him dimpling deeply he couldnt help smiling back arkady rubbed his brow and sighed dag straightened selfconsciously clearing his throat besides me bein so lopsided he said you talked about doing something to ah cleanse my dirty ground what did you have in mind or was the cure for contamination like that for the aftereffects of groundsetting to be simple tedious selfregulation pace yourself could be pretty useless advice in the midst of some pressing emergency well i admit i dont know yet youre an odd collection of puzzles to turn up at my gate at first it seemed to me that my ground cleansed or healed or remade itself all by itself over time the way anyone absorbs a ground reinforcementor the ground of their food for that matter figured the problem was that id just taken in too much too fast both of those certainly though one might argue that any farmer ground is too much anyone or arkady dag frowned at the evasive wording except the ground i most choked on was pure lakewalker or considering crane impure lakewalker i actually found the ground of food strengthening at least after i learned to limit myself to the lifeground of things like seed grains instead of ripping right down to the matter fawn said yeah that mess you made of my pie didnt sit too well did it because it was cooked and dead do you reckon maybe said dag which reminds me i meant to try a live fish minnow he corrected hastily at her dismayed look arkady swallowed a noise of horror no no for the next several daysin fact till i give you permissiondont groundrip anything at least until i can get some sense of whether your disruptions are clearing on their own which reminds me he rose and went to his shelves returning with a quill a bottle of ink and what dag now recognized as a medicine makers casebook he laid them all out opened the book to a fresh page dipped his quill and scribbled he glanced up and added in an abstracted tone open yourself please a couple more minutes passed while he jotted what dag squinting sideways read as notes upon the present condition of his ground although between the handwriting and the abbreviations he could hardly guess what arkady thought it was arkadys own strange brightshadowed ground was equally unrevealing there said arkady finishing i should have done this yesterday it goes without saying thatno i suppose it doesnt you are to do no groundgifting till i tell you either understood sir said dag uncertainly no medicine making at all observation could only go so far as a teaching method its only the beginning dag chided himself youd think you were a sixteenyearold on your first patrol again stupid with daydreams of instant achievement he couldnt even argue but now theres the problem of greenspring since the problem of greenspring had been sitting out there all his life unnoticed yet all this attention to the particulars of his own ground here in this quiet southern camp seemed a long way from becoming help for the beleaguered north we dont want that ground contamination of yours spread all around the camp at least till we know how much of your present problems stem from it dag nodded reluctant acknowledgment about to ask but could i heal farmers they wont care how dirty with farmer ground i am he realized that the necessary unbeguilement would violate arkadys ban against taking in strange ground too he sighed resigning himself to his temporary he trustedquarantine dag mulishly chose to share fawns ostracism keeping to arkadys house when he wasnt on duty but the medicine tent brought the camp to him he divided his time between what traditional apprentice dog chores maker challa could think of that a onehanded man might do and close observing perforce he learned names tentnames personalities and more intimately grounds of a growing string of new moon folks what they made of him he was less sure but it was plain that a camp medicine maker must come to know his people over time the way a patroller memorized the trails of his territory barr and remo meanwhile wasted no time in going off to explore the camp at large with the result that theyd shortly cooked up a scheme to go out on patrol as exchange volunteers dag approved it would make good use of their time take the burden of feeding them off arkadys neighbors for a couple of weeks and pay the camp back something for their welcome here it soon came out that their gingerliness in presenting the plan was not because they needed dags permission but because they wanted to borrow dags sharing knife carrying a primed knife marked a patroller as tried and trusted and theyd both earned that from him in this camps patrol territory where not even a sessile had been found for over three generations dag was nearly certain to get his knife back intact it was his own workmanship not barr and remos dependability that dag doubted so the next afternoon he gathered up his knife and his nerve and sought out new moons senior knife maker her name hed been told was vayve blackturtle her work shack a neat cypresswood cabin overlooking the lake near its south end was instantly recognizable by the small collection of human thighbones hung to cure along its eaves as he climbed nearer dag found more unexpectedly signs of a garden surrounding itnot of practical food but of flowers even in this drab dawning of the year a spatter of bright purple and yellow crocuses poked up from tidy mulch beds and the unopened buds on the flowering shrubs were fat and red as he wasnt sneaking up on a malices lair here dag forced himself to leave his ground partly open so he hadnt yet mounted the porch steps when a woman emerged to stare down at him she looked alarmingly like a younger version of dags aunt mari lean and shrewd of eye her brown hair was drawn back in the usual mourning knot that makers wore while working but her soberly cut skirt and jacket were embroidered with recognizable dogwood flowers the stern air common to knife makers hung about her yet her look was not that of an offended reclusedag thought of darbut of open curiosity maker vayve m names dag bluefield he left off the nocamp part may i trouble you with a question about a knife oh would you be arkady waterbirchs prodigy ive heard of you step on up her roofed porch had hospitable seats with stuffed cushions the woven wicker creaked as dag lowered himself she took the next seat half around a low plank table dag wondered at her description of him hed certainly done nothing prodigious here he dragged the cord fawn had fashioned over his head held the leather sheath to the table with his hook and drew out the plain bone blade some weeks back up on the grace river i was called upon to rededicate and bondand primea sharing knife under emergency conditions more or less you were traveling with those two young patrollers who smoked out a nest of river bandits i heard all oleana men arent you youre a fair way from home dag decided not to pursue just what barr and remo had been saying about themselves and him we drifted downriver till we ran into bandits could easily be misconstrued as we were sent downriver to destroy bandits dodging awkward questions about how the partners had come to be trailing dag leaving out the preamble of raintree dag gave much the same truncated account of crane and his death to maker vayve as he had to arkady as he spoke her grim frown deepened a sharing knife she said is made as an instrument of sacrifice and redemptionnot of criminal execution this one was all three in its way crane paid far less than he owed but all that he had im not asking you to judge the morality of its making maam just its workmanship first knife i ever made see will it kill a malice the gossip i heard wasnt clear if you were a patroller or a medicine maker politely she left out the renegadedeserterbanishedorjustplain mad part how did you know how to make any knife at all my older brother is senior knife maker back at hickory lake camp in oleana ive been around the craft quite a bit time to time her brows twitched up in some doubt if lurking underfoot was all it took to create talent id have better luck with my apprentices but she picked up the knife and opened her ground to examine it holding it to her lips and forehead in turn eyes closed and open dag watched anxiously she laid it gently back on the table your involution is about four times stronger than it needs to be but its sound and shows no sign of leakage i see no reason it wouldnt break open properly when exposed to the disruption of a malice i grant it seems an unusually dark unhappy knife but primed knives are seldom chirping merry crane was as close to a mad dog in human form as makes no nevermind but he wasnt stupid i think he liked the irony of tying this around my neck dag admitted but it seemed this knife was safe to lend he would do so a damp breeze almost warm set the bones to faintly clinking along the eaves reminded of another concern he asked do you chance to have any spare blanks my brother usually did there were always more bones than hearts why do you ask she returned im without a bonded knife myself just now my old one was lost been meaning to replace it when i found the chance i should like to make it for myself under better supervisionif youd be willing maam it seems youre a trifle past an apprentices test piece she nodded at the knife on the table do you mean to take up the craft i dont know that id dare steal you from arkady no maam i just want more confidence if i ever have to face such an emergency again confidence nerve id call it she regarded him with a warring mixture of curiosity and disapproval that murdered womans bonded knife belonged to someone and it wasnt you and you took it without a second thought as nearly as i can tell i had thoughts in plenty maam it was time i lacked she shrugged this not being an emergency you would have to ask for the donation from the tentkin no bones were left in your care for the general need or by the kinless her expression and her ground both went a little opaque not at present in other words this dodgy oleana fellow was going to have to do his own begging perhaps he could later if he made more of a place for himself here vayve glanced up climbing the path to her shack were the two patroller girls dag had met that first day at the gate the leggy blonde was half veiled and not happy about something they looked up in surprise to see dag and he furled himself a little more slipping cranes knife back into its sheath and into his shirt both partners eyes followed it hello tavia neeta said the maker cordially what brings you up here oh vayve said neeta her voice distressed something terribles happened to my primed knifewell it was going to be my primed knife my father had promised it to me when i came back from luthlia but this morning when we went to take it from the chestwell look she mounted the steps slid the knife she was clutching from its sheath and laid it on the table in front of the maker the dry bone blade was cracked split up half its length traces of tattered groundwork still clung to it but its involution and the death it had contained were gone he swears it was fine when he last put it away and nobody dropped itwhat happened to it vayve can you fix it oh dear said vayve picking up the knife just how old was this neeta its not of my making im not exactly sure my father carried it when he was younger and his uncle before him did we do something wrongshould we have oiled it or or the maker turned the blade studying the split no that wouldnt have made any difference it was simply too old neeta the groundwork on knives doesnt last forever you know i was going to take it on patrol tomorrow the patrol barr and remo were joiningso the reasons for their urgency to volunteer were revealed one blond one redhaired dag didnt think he allowed his amusement to show in his face but tavia watching him inquisitively returned an uncertain half smile isnt there anything you can do neeta went on was my tentkins sacrifice just wasted then thrown into the air dag had been through this scene before with distraught younger patrollers he said gently if that knife was carried on patrol for many years it wasnt wasted even if it was never used on a malice it upheld us all the same neeta shot him a who the blight are you to say look but i might have taken this one to luthlia instead of the one grandmother gave me and used it last year on that sessile my patrol found and then wed still have had the other most young patrollers who exchanged north of the dead lake took primed knives from home along it was something of a customary fee for their training dag himself had carried primed knives to luthlia that way twice early in his long tally about half the patrollers returned ready to take up expanded duties none of the knives did a steady stream of sacrifice flowing northward you cant know that soothed vayve i believe that knife you took with you was quite old as well wasnt it their fates might simply have been reversed then maybe i should have taken both but neetas hands unclenched and she sighed she added wryly i just dont know when ill have a chance at another is all all of my tentkin are disgustingly healthy patroller humor but tavia put in more seriously no one ever wants to share around here nobody in my tent will give me a primed knife because nobody even has one mama wont even give me permission to bond to a blank she says im much too young neeta claims that in luthlia they say if youre old enough to patrol youre old enough to pledge in oleana too dag thought of his patroller cousin whod shared at age nineteen much too young both sides in this argument seemed right to dag which wrung his brain a bit or maybe it was his heart bestirring himself to give the young patrollers mind a more hopeful turn dag inquired so will you be patrol leader tomorrow not yet neeta said glumly then added but our camp captain promised me the next place to open up how many patrols does new moon cutoff field eight when were at full strength she frowned at him youre a funny fellow those oleana boys say youre obsessed with farmers you should stop by arkadys place and talk with my wife fawn said dag driven to dryness by her tone you could compare malice kills she slew one too did barr or remo tell you that up near glassforge and it wasnt a mere sessile her nose wrinkled it sounded pretty garbled you had to lend her your knife didnt you dag tilted his head were all lent our knives in the end but she can never share in return and glad i am of it but even that was only half true the strange tale of fawns lost babe was nothing he wanted to repeat here if the boys had actually had the wit to keep it close many lakewalkers never share eitherwerent you just now complaining of that dag had he realized an audience of three far from warm but bemused enough by this upcountry stranger to not bolt neeta had taken the last seat tavia leaned comfortably against one of the porch posts and vayve seemed in no hurry to return to whatever task hed interrupted he swallowed and swung abruptly into what hed come to think of as the ballad of greenspring much as hed explained it to arkady and to dozens before him dags words were growing all too smoothpolished with use but he hoped not so glib as to fail to carry the weight of his horror by the time he came to his description of the childrens burial trench his listeners eyes were dark with pity though their mouths stayed tight your answers simple enough it seems to me said neeta when he at last ran down chase all your farmers back south of the grace not that we want them you ever try to run a farmer off his land theres nothing simple about it said dag that parts too true said vayve a hundred years back new moon folks still used to change camps winter and summer then it got so that if you left your land for a season youd come back to find it cleared plowed and planted we finally had to hold our territory by sitting on it dividing tents between here and moss river and send folks from the camp council down to graymouth and get lines drawn on pieces of farmer paper to say we owned it absurd the cost to us of teaching farmers is nothing to the cost everyone will pay if we dont said dag stubbornly in your north country maybe said tavia everywhere we have to begin where we are with whatever piece we have in front of us never miss a chance to befriend and teach theres a task anyone can start vayve made a little gesture at dags upper arm the wedding cord beneath his jacket sleeve unconcealed from her groundsense she said dryly id say you took befriending a bit far oleana man not nearly far enough yet dag sighed rose touched his brow politely ill check back about those bone blanks good day maam patrollers over the next week dag grew increasingly absorbed by the work in the medicine tent not that he hadnt been in and out of the hands of the makers plenty before but this shift in his angle of view looking down the throats of such varied problems made a bigger difference than hed have guessed as a patroller hed never visited the medicine tent except as a last resort now as part of that last resort he found himself not only understanding but actually reciting that annoying maker chant of why didnt you come in sooner a halfdozen folks a day turned up with minor ailments or injuries although once a man was carried in with a broken leg and a day later more interesting and much more difficult an aged woman with a broken hip still more delicate was a woman with an ugly tumor in her breast which arkady was treating daily by pinching off its blood supply tiny vessel by tiny vessel his explanation of why he didnt try to destroy it by groundripping gave dag chillstumor ground could be nearly as toxic as malice spatter it appeared arkady began taking dag with him on his daily round of tent visits too although dag was uncertain how hed earned this advancement since though he might fetch carry or hold he was still not allowed to do even the simplest groundwork the old casebooks packed on the shelves once challa taught him how to interpret them proved unexpectedly gripping they reminded dag of patrol logs stained tattered with terrible handwriting and baffling abbreviations but also like patrol logs the more he read the more he began to see what was between the lines as well as what was on them the folks trickling into the tent showed dag how the makers treated some complaints the books taught him about things he hadnt yet seen and so he squinted at their pages daily till the light failed with his late start as a makers apprentice he felt urgent to catch up any way he could and he overcame his halting northcountry tongue to ask challa and arkady as many questions as fawn might his head was bursting with it all when he came back to arkadys place one midafternoon for a forgotten bundle of toothextraction tools to find fawn curled weeping in their bedroll he lowered himself beside her as she sat up hastily drying her eyes and pretending to yawn oh youre back i was just having a nap it always makes me all rumpled and funnylooking sleeping in the daytime but her smile lacked its dimple and her big brown eyes were bleak spark whats wrong he ran his thumb gently down the moist tracks from her eyes nothing she shook her dark curls abandoning to his relief her shaky subterfuge im just being stupid i guess its not nothing because youre not stupid tell me you can tell me anything cant you he hoped so because here so far from home and kin he was all she had she sniffed dolefully considered this nodded im just its just its all right at night when you come back and talk to me but its been so quiet all day since barr and remo left and i ran out of things to do she waved her empty hands i finished sewing the last of the drawers and i ran out of yarn for socks and theres not even any cooking or cleaning because arkadys neighbor women do all that its too gray and cold to sit outside so i just sit in here and and do nothing which isnt as much fun as id a thought she rubbed her face then said in a lower voice i cant possibly be homesick for west blue because i dont want to go back there maybe its just my monthly coming on you know how that makes me cranky he bent and kissed her damp temple contemplating both her notions it was perfectly possible as he well knew to be homesick for a place one didnt want to go back to and her monthly was indeed coming on all true he thought but incomplete poor spark he lifted her hands one by one and kissed them which made her gulp and sniff again nothing is just what the problem is your hands have got all lonely thats what theyre not used to resting folded up can you get medoes this camp have stores like hickory lake can you get me some more wool or cotton or something she frowned oh but i guess we dont have any camp credit here no we dont he stared down at her had his head truly been stuffed so full as to drive all care for her out of it each night her eyes had sparkled her lips parted as she listened eagerly to his tales of his day and so hed thought her content he should have noticed how shed had less and less to offer in return her days should be laden with new things right along with his absent gods knew her head was better built for learning than his had ever felt she sat up more sternly never mind me i promised id take whatever this camp dished out till you got what you needed and i dont mean to go back on my word ill be fine shh spark surely we can do better than that he hugged and comforted her as best he could till her faked cheer grew less wobbly then went to find arkady out of the question arkady said when dag finished explaining his request a farmer cant learn our techniques dag was unsurprised he forged on nonetheless i always figured to train her myself later but having her just settin around like this is a huge waste of her time and of a camp resource fawn can learn anything you can teachexcept groundworkwe always meant her to be my spare hands if ever i got out among farmers as a real medicine maker you havent seen it but i have when shes by my side farmers calm right down and stop being afraid of me despite what a starveling vagabond i generally look the women because they can see shes not scared and the men because shes so blighted cute they forget to worry about lakewalker death magic and if im ever to treat farmer women and girls which i guessd be about half my customers id need her with me before id dare touch them he thought of arkadys breasttumor treatment and other even more intimate womens ailments and shivered absent gods yes arkady finished the brief note hed been jotting about the tooth extraction set down his quill and frowned across at dag its not by any means concluded that youll be turned loose to treat farmers as for placing fawn here in the medicine tenti grant you she has clever hands but that bright ground of hers always open would be a distraction to patients and makers alike its not a distraction to me said dag these are the same fool arguments hoharie made back at hickory lake one little farmer girls open ground is only as much of a botheration as folks choose it to be lakewalkers can deal fine with fawn around when they want to yes but why should they want to dag bit his lip im a stranger here ive earned no trust from this camp i know i cant ask this of folks his eyes caught and held arkadys and he dropped his voice to his company captains growlnot a gift of dags that arkady had guessed at judging from his faint recoil but you can ive seen how this camp respects you and ive more than a notion by now of why you can make this happen if you choose and we both know it dag let his voice and his look lighten besides whats to lose try her for a couple of weeks if fawn doesnt work out here we can think of something else its not like me and my farmer bride are asking to join your camp permanent hm said arkady lowering his eyes and closing his casebook is that what you think well perhaps i could talk to challa and levan fawn was ecstatic when dag told her the news which made him right proud of his husbandly insight the next morning as he took her along to introduce to her new task makers at the medicine tent she skipped down the road caught his amused eye upon her stopped tossed her head then skipped again but she was walking sedately by the time they arrived dag watched her welcome carefully not above letting it be seen that he was watching challa was politely resigned levan the aging herb master had the air of a man with a long view enduring a temporary burden his two female apprentices and challas boy at first stiff and cold grew more pliant as they realized that fawn would be taking over many of their most tedious chores from washing pots and bedding to peeling stems and sweeping the floor as the first days passed her uncomplaining cheer and enthusiasm softened the older makers too within half a week more even camp residents stopping in for treatment or to pick up medicines ceased being surprised to find her about the place dags own heart was comforted and mind eased by having her so often within his sight and hearing and by her obvious happiness at being so gradually dag began calling her over to give him a hand as opportunities presented and gradually the other members of the tent became used to the picture the first time challa absentmindedly assigned a twohanded chore to the pair of them dag smiled in secret victory one morning as dag made to rise from the breakfast table arkady said wait dutifully dag sat back down have you made any further progress overcoming your asymmetry dag shrugged cant say as i have which seemed better than ive hardly given it a thought try now dag laid his right arm out on the table and attempted a ground projection with the same lack of results as before uhhuh said arkady and walked over to rummage on his shelves he came back carrying a couple of lengths of rope and a penknife after tying one rope around dags hook he bent dags left arm behind him and wove the end through the chair back and around to secure firmly in front dag cooperated uneasily there will that hold dag tugged i expect so right arm feel free dag wriggled his fingers aye fawn finished packing up the breakfast basket and slid back into her chair to watch she met dags look and grinned arkady had evidently paid better attention than dag had thought to fawns words about how his ghost hand had first emerged arkady lit a candle by waving his hand over it sat on dags right and picked up the sharp little knife you claim youve reattached blood vessels before in your farmer healing aye said dag watching in worry as arkady began passing the knife blade through the candle flame in hods knee and chickorys busted skull theyre stretchy and coil up when theyre busted but the ends seem to want to find each other again after just the bigger ones they got littler and littler till i couldnt follow them down and in without risking groundlock mm yes ive always wondered if the little arteries empty into a pool in the tissues and then the veins suck up the blood again or if theyre connected all the way through unimaginably tiny if only sutaw had advanced enough to pull me out of the deep groundlock i thought i might try well never mind that doesnt concern us today he held the knife in the air to cool lets give you something more interesting than a piece of paper to work on shall we he drew the tiny blade across the back of his own left hand slicing through a plump vein fawn squeaked as blood began to well arkady laid his oozing hand down in front of dag dag eyeing the red trickle with a mixture of alarm and annoyance attempted once more to coax a ground projection from his right hand his left arm jerked at its bindings behind him but from the right nothing what said arkady youre just going to sit there and watch while your teacher bleeds for shame dag dag flushed grimaced clenched and stretched his fingers shook his head sorry im sorry arkady waited then shrugged passed his right hand over his left the flash of ground projection went by almost too fast for dag to perceive and mopped at the drips with a napkin the bleeding stopped he tilted his head for a long moment eyeing dag in a shrewd way that made him feel even more of a fool yees arkady drawled perhaps taking the second length of rope he knelt by dags chair fawn give me a hand here i want to tie his feet firmly to the chair legs why asked dag no one does ground projections from their feet safety precaution fawn touched dags shoulder in encouragement and knelt on his other side she and arkady passed the rope back and forth and consulted on the knots fawn was inclined to be thorough dag craned his neck and tried to see what theyd done but couldnt quite he flexed his ankles against their restraints which held tight and waited while the pair seated themselves flanking him once more arkady cooked his knife blade in the candle flame again looking bland then abruptly he pounced across the table yanked fawns hand down in front of dag and sliced across its back ow she cried dag nearly fell over trying to lunge out of his chair safety for who you blighter he strained at his bindings clawed at the knot in front thought wildly of groundripping the rope apart then barely controlled his rocking as arkady continued to press fawns hand down squeezing to make it drip her eyes were wide and she gasped a little but she did not struggle to withdraw instead she looked hopefully at dag you can fix this cant you arkady purred in dags right ear blight your eyes dag growled arkady hadnt plotted this with fawn in advance hadnt asked her permission her surprise and distress had been spontaneous and loud in dags groundsense for all that shed quickly overcome both her pain lingered shivery sharp like shards of glass arkady let fawns hand go and leaned back as dag extended his right hand above it fingers not quite touching her pale skin the slice was barely half an inch long precisely placed across the blue vein dag forced himself to breathe to open his ground to concentrate down and in the back of fawns hand expanded in his perceptions the wider world tilted away he felt for the shuddering vein ends the ground of his right hand seemed to spurt and sputter blight you arkady ive no skill on this side skill or no dag managed to push his ground beyond the confines of his skin clumsily he caught up the two cut ends of the biggest vessel guided them back togetherthey seemed to seek each other which helpedand shaped a strongno not quite that strong rightground reinforcement to hold them there there he forced himself to calm lest he set fawns hand afire and do more damage than arkady had down and in he found the living fibers of skin and began weaving them back together farther down farther in he was broken from his beginning trance not by a groundtouch but by arkady simply slapping him on the side of his head dag came back blinking and shaken to the morning light of the room he inhaled looked down fawn was wiping the blood from her hand with arkadys napkin nothing showed of the attack but a faint pink line dag drew a deep breath you like living dangerously do you arkady arkadys shrug was devoid of apology it was time to move you along it worked didnt it now lets see that projection again his rightside projection felt weak and clumsy but it was there and again and again dag was lightheaded and nauseated when arkady at last ceased his badgering and allowed fawn to untie him dag shook out both his arms stretching his aching back the only reason he didnt then stand up and slug the maker across his closeshaved jaw was the sudden thoughtdoes this mean im almost over my quarantine on a bright day that breathed promise of an early southern spring fawn helped nola and cerie the herb masters apprentices pack up a handcart to take to the new moon camp farmers market the three young women dragged their load around through the sapling gate and down over the hill to the clearing where the horses had been watered that first day the tree branches were still bare against the cool blue sky but the buds swelled red and a few low weeds winked green in the flattened and brownish grass it was at last made plain to fawn why the medicine tents kitchen was always so busy after concocting enough remedies for the needs of the camp the herb master and his helpers produced yet more for the local trade some medicines were not so different from what fawns mama and aunt nattie compounded but maker levan himself did groundwork on others that made them much more effective andhe seemed to think this an important pointuniform unlike the cureall nostrums fawn had seen hawked in the drowntown market which dag claimed were mostly spiritsyou might still be sick but youd be too drunk to care barr had quippedthe lakewalkers made limited claims for their medicines dewormers for people horses cattle and sheep effective remedies for bog ague and hookworm neither plague to be found in west blue but common here especially in the long hot summers a bitter pain powder from willow bark and poppy just like the northern one fawn had seen dag use when his arm had been broken a tincture of foxglove for bad hearts a gray powder much trusted by the locals to sprinkle on wounds to fight infection in the clearing a number of lakewalkers unrolled awnings from under the eaves of the shelter and set up trestle tables beneath them today they offered mostly handwork of a sort fawn had seen before fine leathers that would not rot nearly unbreakable rope and cord a small but choice selection from the camp blacksmithtools that would not rust blades that would hold their edge fawn helped the two apprentices lay out the medicine tents offerings fetchingly on their table then they all settled down on upended logs to await their customers it wasnt long as the sun marked noon a few farmers began to trickle in to the clearing some driving rumbling carts or wagons some with packhorses or mules it would be a slow day nola informed fawn the market was busier in the summer when the roads were better most people here on both sides seemed to already know their business as well as one anothers names and deals were struck quickly and efficiently as when two cartloads of fat grain sacks were traded for several kegs of animal dewormer and some sets of unbreakable traces a wellsprung wagon drawn by a pretty team of four matched palomino horses swung into the clearing and five people climbed down a very welldressed farmer with streaks of gray in his hair a maidservant shepherding a small boy a horseboy who went immediately to unhitch and rub down the animals and what had to be the graying mans wife she was half a head taller than he but equally well dressed in a traveling skirt closefitting jacket and fine boots with her sandy hair coiled up in tidy braids she strode without hesitation to one of the armed patrollers lurking around the edge of the clearing and spoke to him after a moment he nodded if a trifle reluctantly and trotted away up the road look shes back muttered nola i see murmured cerie the little boy grabbed his fathers hand and towed him around the shelter to see the fascinating contents of all the tables the tall woman glanced over the array and walked straight to the medicine table fawn sat up and blinked as she drew closer despite her farmer dress the woman had the fineboned features and bright silveryblue eyes of a fullblooded lakewalker she looked down at fawn on the other side of the table with quite as much surprise as fawn looked up at her absent gods she said in an amused alto voice is new moon taking in farmers now wonders and marvels no maam said fawn raising her chin she almost touched her temple the way dag did then afraid it might be mistaken for some sort of mockery gripped her hands in her lap im just visiting my husbands a lakewalker from oleana though studying groundsetting with maker arkady for a stretch really uncertain what the womans exclamation meant fawn just smiled in what she hoped seemed a friendly way then the womans eye fell on the cord peeking from fawns left jacket cuff and her breath drew in she leaned forward abruptly reaching out then caught herself straightened and motioned more politely may i see that thats a real wedding braid isnt it fawn pushed back her cuff and laid her arm out on the table yes maam dag and i made them for each other back in oleana the little boy came galloping around the side of the shelter and suddenly shy clutched his mothers skirts and stared at fawn the man strolled after putting his arm possessively around the womans waist a brief stillness flashed in the womans face that hinted at groundsense extended how she asked sounding amazed dag wove his ground into his in the usual way for lakewalkers when we came to mine we found that my ground would follow my live blood into my braid as i plaited it and dag could make it stick blood i never thought of that the man was watching his wifes profile warily she glanced sideways at him raised her chin and said distinctly it doesnt matter i dont need it fawn wasnt sure what emotion warmed his eyes pride relief in any case the woman selected some pain powder some ague remedy and half their stock of the antinausea syrup highly recommended fawn had learned for morning sickness she paid for it all with good graymouth coin from a heavy purse and she and her husband and son returned to the wagon where the maidservant was setting out a picnic lunch who was that woman fawn asked her companions she looked like a lakewalkeris she from here she was said nola in a disapproving tone she was a patroller but about ten years back she ran off to marryif you can call it thatthat farmer following her they say he owns several mills in moss river city cerie added nodding toward the wagon and built her a house overlooking the river three floors high with flower gardens that go all the way down to the water was she banished she should have been said nola but her tent didnt ask it of the camp council banishing deserters is a joke sighed cerie hardly any of them come back so all it means is that their tentkin cant speak to them or visit them out there in farmer country if their kin chase after them and drag them back here they mostly just leave again at the first chance and hardly anybody wants to hunt them down and hang them some claim if anyones that disaffected its better to let them go before they spread their mood around the camp are there very many who leave cerie shrugged not really maybe a dozen a year compared to the unheard of at hickory lake that seemed like a lot to fawn and if the outward leak was like that at every camp in the south it would add up that peeled pole barrier at the camp gate only worked in one direction it seemed in a while three lakewalkers appeared from the rutted road an older woman and two sandyhaired adults they sat down to the picnic with the moss river family speaking quietly once the older woman stood up on her knees and measured the little boy against her shoulder and said something that made him laugh and once the lakewalker woman in farmer dress put her hand to her belly and gestured which won strained smiles from the others at length the family packed up made sober farewells and drove off the older woman turned her head to watch them out of sight then the three vanished up the road again fawns companions were looking impatiently at the shifting sun and their dwindling stocks of medicines and customers when a light cart drove up to the shelter drawn by a rather winded mare as she dropped her head to crop the scant grass a young man jumped down and fetched out some slat crates he glanced around then carried them up to the medicine table and went back for two more fawn peeked over to see they were jammed with a jumble of glass jars and bottles packed in clean straw almost as winded as his horse the fellow set down the last boxes and said im not too late good i dont have much coin but figure what these are worth to you cerie and nola actually looked pleased by the offered bartergood glass containers were always in demand in the medicine tentand circled the table to kneel down and inventory the boxes the young mans stare lit on fawn and he looked taken aback well hello there youre no lakewalker no sir the sir was a trifle flattering but there was no harm in it she recited her wellworn speech repeated to nearly every buyer theyd had today but im married to one my husband is a lakewalker from oleana learning medicine making here go on you dont look old enough to be married to anyone fawn tried not to glower at a paying customer she supposed shed know herself a woman grown when that remark began to be gratifying and not just annoying im nineteen people just think im younger on account as im so short she sat up straight so he could see she was much too curvy to be a child nineteen he repeated oh he looked about nineteen himself freshfaced with brown hair and bright blue eyes he had a wiry build like whit but was of course taller i guess your um husband must be pretty important to get you into the camp they dont usually let farmers past their gates here you know fawn shrugged new moon hasnt taken us on as members or anything were just visiting dag found me a job here when i ran out of stuff to spin and got to pining for home he used to be a patroller up oleana way but now he feels a calling to be a medicine maker to farmers she added proudly no ones done that before his mouth opened in surprise but thats not possible farmers are supposed to go crazy if lakewalkers use their sorcery on em a surprisingly accurate comment but maybe he was a near neighbor and so less illinformed than most dag thinks hes cracked beguilement figured out how to make that not happen she added honestly hes still working out whether or not itll do something bad to the lakewalker hes just a beginner as far as medicine making goes but he figures if he can make it work his notion is that oleana farmers need to learn a lot more about lakewalkers on account as we have so many more maliceblight bogle outbreaks up our way and its dangerous for folks to remain so ignorant he figures healing would give him a straight road to teaching people are there reallyare the bogles really bad up that way no because the oleana patrol keeps em down but their job could stand to be made easier the young man rubbed his mouth a couple of my friends keep talking about walking the trace maybe moving up to oleana is it true theres free land there just for the taking well you got to register your claim with whatever village clerk is closest and then clear the trees and rocks and pull the stumps theres land for the backbusting working of it yes two of my brothers are homesteading that way right up on the edge of the great woods the lakewalkers still hold my oldest brotherll get our papas farm of course yeah mine too sighed the young man he added after a moment my names finch bridger by the way my parents place is about ten miles that way he pointed roughly southeast im fawn bluefield returned fawn how de he stuck out a friendly workhardened hand fawn shook it and smiled back he added after a moment arent the winters tough in oleana nothing like so bad as north of the dead lake dag says you prepare for it lay in your food and fodder and firewood make warm clothes is there snow of course ive never seen snow here but once and it was gone by noon in these parts we mostly just have cold rain instead we have some nice quiet times in winter and its fun to have the sleigh out papa puts bells on the harnesses an unexpected spasm of homesickness shot through fawn at the recollection huh finch said evidently trying to picture this that sounds nice nola and cerie finished their count and came back around the table and finch dug in his pockets to lay out a few supplemental coins let me know how far this goes i need this and this and i cant leave without this or ill be skinned he took up all their remaining stock of antinausea medicine fawn raised her eyebrows you dont look old enough to be married either huh oh he blushed thats for my sisterinlaw shes increasing again and shes so sick she can barely hold her head up thats why i was let off chores to drive over here today well that nice syrups bound to help her keep her food down and get her strength back it doesnt even taste bad for medicine fawn sure wished shed had some back when she banished the bleak memory her own child had been lost to her before becoming much more than a sick stomach and a social disaster she had no call to picture her as a brighteyed little girl the size of that lakewalker womans halfblood child the bridger boy packed his medicines carefully on his cart then made two trips to a table on the other side of the shelter lugging half a dozen bulging sacks like overstuffed pillowcases fawn didnt see what hed acquired in return but he circled back to her table with a similar sack scantly filled he thrust it at her here you can have this fawn peeked in to find several pounds of washed cotton what else do you need i dont know how to value this she glanced to nola for help nothing its a present for me said fawn surprised he nodded jerkily i cant take this off you it was leftover no point in hauling it back home again well thanks he nodded again well um it was nice talking to you fawn bluefield i sure hope everything works out for you when are you starting back north i dont hardly know yet it all depends on dag um oh sure he hovered uncertainly as if wanting to say more but then glanced at the sun smiled at her again and tore himself away at the end of another half hour the last farmer bought the last item left on their table a jar of purple ointment meant for cuts on horses knees and rode off all three girls helped the remaining lakewalkers take down the trestles and roll up the awnings cerie and nola were cheerful at having a good haul of coin to show for the day as well as the valued glass they trundled the handcart reloaded with all their barter back up the rutted road fawn glanced back over her shoulder at the tidied clearing thinking this place isnt quite what it looked at first glance was anywhere she remembered the little river below the west blue farm in winter all hard rigid ice seeming utterly stillbut with water running underneath secretly eroding its strength until one day it all cracked and washed away in ragged lumps how close were these southern lakewalker camps to cracking apart like that it was an unsettling notion dag was watching fawn unpack the days lunch basket on the round table when the distant clanging of a bell echoed through the quiet noon arkady shot to his feet dropping his bread and cheese though he managed one gulp of hot tea before saying to dag come on and after a fractional hesitation you too fawn they sprinted up the road to the medicine tent arkady fell to a rapid gasping walk as they found themselves crowding up behind a makeshift litter being maneuvered through the door he grabbed dags arm i thought id have at least another week to drill you he muttered never mind youll do come along do exactly what i tell you and dont hesitate drop that hook itll just get in the way what about my contaminated ground for the next half hour we have more urgent worries dag rolled up his sleeve and worked on his buckles following after hed recognized the pregnant woman on the litter and her tentkin carrying it almost as fast as arkady had because hed visited her daily in arkadys wake somewhat to dags discomfiture arkady had dragged him along to every childbirth in new moon cutoff camp since his arrival as a terrified young patroller dag had once delivered a child on the great north road under the direction of its irate but fortunately experienced mother so he was long past mere embarrassment but he still felt an intruder in these womens tents two births had progressed quite normally and dag had been given no tasks but to sit quietly listen to arkady instruct him and try not to loom in the third the child had to be shifted into better position inside its mothers body which arkady accomplished with a combination of handwork groundwork and dag was almost certain lecturing it it was all a much more complicated process than dag had imagined what did you think women were stuffed with straw in there arkady had inquired tartly and gone on to explain that about once a year all the medicine makers apprentices in the area were assembled to witness a human dissection when someone gifted their body to the purpose at which all the shifting sparkling ground the young makers directly perceived was mapped to the secret physical structures that generated it arkady promised or threatened to make sure dag observed the next such demonstration but today dag would glimpse inside a body still alive maybe tawa killdeers complication horrified dag the mysterious nourishing placenta had grown across the mouth of her womb instead of up a side as it was supposed to her labor must rip apart the supporting organ long before the child could emerge to breathe without aid the result would be a dead blue infant and a mother swiftly bleeding to death the proposed treatment was drastic to cut the child directly from its mothers belly the chance of saving the child this way was good the mother poor without groundwork impossible but dag now realized why arkady had pushed him so hard learning to control blood flow in their practice sessions tawas kin challa and arkady all helped shift the pregnant woman up onto the waisthigh bed in the bright far room challa was already washing her straining belly with grain spirits as her sister pulled off her clothing a wad of cloth between her legs was bright with blood she didnt have a bonded sharing knife with her nor did any of her kin carry one a northern woman would have here dag snapped arkady open yourself down and in he grabbed dags left arm and positioned it over tawas lower belly the room tilted away before dag shut his eyes to concentrate on tawas ground he had one glimpse of her pale face her set jaw stifling outcry her sister held one whiteknuckled hand her frightened husband the other and challas boy coaxed her clenching teeth apart to insert a leather strap for her to bite the last time dag had seen a look like that was on the face of a fellow patroller closing on a malice staring down death eyes defiantly wide open arkadys voice in his ear placentas parting too soon and bleeding underneath let your leftside ground projection sink down and in spread it as far as you can hold pressure just like stopping any other bleeding wound but youre working from the inside out good dag shaped his ghost hand like a broad lily pad pressing against the inside of tawas womb his rightside projection as well from the opposite direction providing counterpressure the flow of blood between her legs slowed to a trickle from the corner of one eye barely open he saw challa lean in the flash of a sharp knife felt as well as saw flesh part two cuts one of the abdominal wall a second of the womb itself arkady worked across from her following the blade with his groundhands stemming bleeding dag caught a glimpse of a tiny slick purple body sliding out from the cut feetfirst the flash of the infants distressed but alive ground other hands took it from challa choking noises a thin wail one down one to go arkady muttered tawas pain and fear flooded dags ground which he had matched to hers as closely as a mans could match a womans he thought of the look on her face and endured hed soaked up the like before in roughand ready treatment of patroller injuries on the trail the sister and husband also partitioned the load of pain and stress the sharing rendering it more bearable to tawa the senior makers had mastered the trick of closing grounds to pain but not to the person and worked on steadily dag hoped the pair was watching out for potential group groundlock the sharing wasnt bearable to everyone the two herb masters apprentices had been holding down tawas ankles one was now headdown in the corner sobbing fighting black faintness her ground snapped shut her place had been taken over by a doggedlooking fawn she grinned back at the glint of his eye scared determinedconfident in him dag remembered to breathe now arkady murmured in dags ear you have to let go the placenta without letting go the pressure so we can get it out of there and close up let your projection slip down through the tissues a little tug on the cord oh good we have it all thats right hold arkady and challa together closed the inner cut he weaving tissues back together in a fragile splice she setting strong reinforcements then the abdominal wall the support here applied physically with curved needle and stitches more washing of the wrinkled flaccid belly with grain spirits then dry cloths and dressings tawas chest heaved tears of pain dripped down her temples but her eyes flashed and she nodded weakly as her sister displayed a blanketwrapped and redfaced little girl to her her husband was weeping unashamed overwhelmed you blighted should be dag thought not disapprovingly a small eternity passed before arkady murmured in dags ear again ease up gradually lets see where we are the vessels in the womb wall should close on their own at this stageits their good trick ah yes it looks like theyre behaving slowly dag withdrew his ghost hands the broad natural wound left by the placenta within tawa was raw but only oozing slightly she stifled a cry as his breaking groundmatch returned her pain to her he backed away and the kinswomen closed in to take care of the rest of the cleanup dag blinked aware again of his shivering body cold as clay fawn appeared under his shoulder they made it through the rooms other door and out onto the bright porch before he bent over the rail and heaved the sun strangely still seemed to be at noon dag felt as though it ought to be sunset arkady came out and handed him a cup of hot tea with a hand that shook slightly here dag clutched it and sipped gratefully arkady lowered himself to a seat against the wall warmed by the nearly springlike sun and dag sat beside him with fawn on folded knees at dags other side it was throwing you off the deep end of the dock but im glad you were here today we dont often beat those odds said arkady he didnt dag noticed accuse him of inelegant inefficiency this round will tawa live if infection doesnt set in ill send everyone who can give ground reinforcements down to her tent in turns over the next couple of days he added after a moment you kept your head well patroller usually my apprentices get wobbly first time we have to open up someone with knives i expect im older than your usual apprentice dag hesitated and ive opened up folks with knives before but never to save their lives ah arkady sipped dag shared a swallow from his cup with fawn and thought about the other complications of childbearing arkady had described to him the placenta tearing away from the womb wall prematurely hiding lethal bleeding till too late babies turned the wrong way round pinching off their own cords a child too large to pass its mothers pelvis without groundwork farmer midwives sometimes had to break such a child inside its mother and draw it out dead even with groundwork that was sometimes the only way how do you make such choices when its one life or the other dag wondered if arkady understood his question was practical not despairing arkady shook his head best chance usually it varies and often you cant know till its right up on you he hesitated there is one other you should know about and its not a choice sometimesvery rarely fortunatelythe placenta doesnt implant in the womb at all but roots in that little tube that runs from the sparkling organ down to it a child cant live or be born from there instead it grows till it rips the mother apart from the inside and she dies of the bleeding and rotting the pain is dreadful and the fear its not a quick death nor a merciful one what you must do if confronted with one of these is to immediately strip the lifeground from the conception you dont let the mother or kin argue with you you may be able to coax the material fragments down into the womb to be flushed out in her next monthly though often by the time you see it the tube is ruptured already and all you can do is lay in ground reinforcements and hope the body will clean up the mess itself groundrip said dag through dry lips like a malice like what the glassforge malice had done to fawns child by her set face he saw she realized this too groundstrip said arkady like a groundsetter in forty years ive only seen this three times and thank the absent gods that the first time i was with my own mentor who talked me through it i could not have done it else so that ground would end up in me just like your experiments with food im afraid yes its quickly absorbed but not it seemed quickly forgotten judging by the bleak shadows rippling through arkadys bright ground dag took a swallow of tea against his rising gorge fawn pried the cup from his fingers and took one herself possibly for the same reason ive never been sure said arkady if i wanted to pray id never encounter one of those again or pray that the next woman would at least encounter me in time dag had always known that senior medicine makers kept secrets of their craft not discussed with outsiders he was beginning to see why i always thought medicine making would be less harrowing than patrolling today was happy arkady finished his tea and grunted to his feet hold on to that dag followed suit for the first time he wondered why the brilliant arkady was wifeless since hed arrived at new moon hed been too blighted busy to notice that inexplicable absence he would ask challa he decided some other time because there were certain possible answers he wasnt up to hearing just now two nights later dag sat with arkady at the round table and armwrestled himself or at least tested his rightside ground projection against his left the left side always won which was a bit boring he glanced at fawn sitting by the fire and spinning up a bag of cotton shed acquired at the farmers market and thought he could devise a better practice drill and go to bed early with her at the same time very efficient arkady cleared his throat as the projections failed under dags inattention but before dag could recover himself a knock sounded at the door arkady nodded and dag rose to answer it two people his halffurled groundsense told him but without urgency unlike most night knocks for arkady he opened the door to find to his surprise tawa killdeers husband and sister how de folks come on in the sister shook her head we cant stay but the killdeer tent wanted you to have this dag she thrust a long narrow bundle wrapped in hemmed cloth into his hand we heard you were in want of one heard from who dag felt through the wrapping and knew the contents at once tawas greatuncle left it to the tent a year or so back explained the husband he was an exchange patroller to the north back in his youth wellthank you it was hardly a gift he could refuse even if hed wanted to which he did not a diffident smile turned his lips thank your tent and tawa we will new father and new aunt walked away into the chilly night happy unbereaved yes thought dag his hand closing on the gift he brought the bundle to the table and unwrapped it in the lantern light fawn came to his shoulder smiling at his smile as the human thighbone was revealed her smile faded dag ran his hand along the smooth length clean dried cured and ready to carve into a knife blank strong too bones donated by the very old were often too fragile to carve someone had scratched the donors name and tentname into the far end with a pin that part of the bone would be cut away when the tip was shaped to a malicekilling point dag would burn the name on the finished blades side he decided so that it would not be lost to memory in a distant and somewhat strained voice fawn said you going to make that up into a knife yes maker vayve as much as said if i could get a bone shed help me which was not a lesson to be scornedin either direction and bond to it yes he stroked the smooth surface its an honorable gifting it feels right see for something that intimate you want it to feel right cranes bones for example buried with him on the banks of the grace would have felt well dag wasnt just sure what theyd have felt like to a stranger but they would have given him the horrors fawn bit her lip drew breath i know thats a thing you wanted and i cant say nay to it but promise me youll not prime that thing while im still aboveground and breathing im not likely to spark but after she that doesnt bear thinking about in the natural course of events it was likely theyd both grow old together i was just remembering that horrid ballad which horrid ballad the one about the two patrollers that still didnt narrow the choices much but he realized which one she meanta dramatic tale in which two partners separated from their patrol found a dangerous malice neither carried a primed knife but both bore bonded ones the argument over which selfsacrificing loon was to share on the spot and which was to carry the news back to the grieving widow or betrothed depending had taken three heartwrenching stanzas it was a popular song in the north people danced to it not that similar events had never happened in real life but dag suspected the circumstances were not so tidy it was just a song he protested her mouth set mulishly promise me anyway i promise spark he kissed those lips to soften them after she drew back to search his eyes then nodded youd best believe it fawn returned late one evening from the medicine tent along with dag and arkadythere had been another child with an intractable feverto find the dinner basket left by their door with a letter propped up on it arkady read the inscription and raised his brows for you he said handing it to fawn courier must have brought it by surprised she made out her name and dags and arkadys place new moon cutoff camp in whits crabbed handwriting whit was a reluctant correspondent any letter from him had to be important she took it to the round table while arkady stoked the fire for his endless tea dag set down the basket lit the brace of table candles then came to her shoulder looking concerned anything wrong no not really she reported tilting the paper to catch the flickering light whits scrawl was actually legible in a painful sort of way whit says berry found a buyer for the fetch who wants it for a houseboat the fetch had been much better built than most makeshift crafts launched from the upper grace feeder creeks by venturesome oleana hill boys berry would be happy that her papas last boat wouldnt be broken up for timber or worse firewood daisygoat was slated to be sold with her floating home alas he also says berrys found them all work with a keeler boss she trusts heading upriver soon to catch the last of the winter fall all on the same boatwhit and bo and hod for hands hawthorn for boat boy and her for the fiddler berry had been holding out for just such a collection of berths though exactly when she would find it had still been up in the air when dag and fawn had left graymouth whit had talked idly about the whole crew joining the longplanned overland ride up the trace but the money would be much better this way whit says if we want to change our minds we should meet them in graymouth before the end of the week and if not to write and let him know when to look for us back at clearcreek ah said dag she glanced up at him i better write back soon or the letter might not reach him before they shove off so what are we doing dag when we started out for new moon i thought we might be here a few days but its already been more n a month dag delayed answer by going to the sink to wash his hand before dinner a ritual arkady insisted upon with more than maternal firmness fawn followed suit they laid out the contents of the basket and arkady brought over the tea before dag spoke ive hardly finished training up for medicine maker arkady pouring snorted youve hardly started id give you two years most apprentices take three or four two years said fawn dag merely nodded i begin to see why really said arkady medicine makers dont ever stop learning from each other and from their patients the common ailments become routine very quicklyand i will say youre the most relentless student ive ever hadbut some experiences cant be sped up you just have to wait for them to occur dag bit into his bread and butter chewed swallowed when would you guess id be fit to start actual groundwork arkady didnt answer right off instead he went to his shelf took down a familiar little book and paged through it he eyed dag steadily for an unnerving minute then with some danger of mixing ink and crumbs jotted a few notes and blew on the page to dry them tomorrow he said dag looked startled but pleased what about all my socalled dirty ground you were so worried about as i hoped the best remedy was time your ground is cleaning itself out quite nicely and will continue to do so as long as you dont contaminate yourself again the permanent cure of course is to stop doing that dag took a slow sip of tea thats not enough arkady if im ever to treat farmers and not leave them crazy with beguilement im going to have to go on absorbing all sorts of strange ground arkady glowered at him it was all mixed together in my head for a while dag went on but looking back im less and less sure how much of my upset was from taking in strange ground and how much was just from dealing with crane and his bandits which was plenty to give any thinking man nightmares mind and groundand emotiondo intersect on the deepest levels arkady conceded he glanced oddly at fawn dag nodded because for all the things i took inbarring crane it seems to me i just kept getting stronger and better at groundwork all the way downriver cept for the part about being untidy just what about having dirty ground unfits me for medicine making every bit of strange ground you take in changes your own ground and so how it works the results risk being uncontrolled dag frowned everything i do and learnblight every breath i takechanges my ground my ground cant not change not while im alive could be dirty ground is just something to live with like the bugs and blisters and weather and weariness on patrol roughandready may do for patrolling not for the delicate control needed for groundsetting groundsetting isnt so sweet and delicate as all that that ive seen your projection changes everything you touch with it my hand changes everything i touch with it always has anyway i want to change folks dag you cant treat farmers not at new moon cutoff what if fawn falls ill i will sure enough treat her arkady waved this away thats different oh how groundwise arkady sighed and rubbed his brow i can see im going to have to give you the set speech for my usual apprentices it starts out when i was your age but i suppose that wont do for you when you were my age fawn suggested helpfully arkady eyed her a little older than that not much i grant dag eased back and occupied his protesting mouth with another bite of bread he nodded to signal that arkady had his full attention arkady drew a long breath when i was much younger and stupider and vastly more energetic my wife and i were training up together as medicine makers at a camp called hatchet slough which is about a hundred and fifty miles northeast of here what wife fawn hadnt seen hide nor hair of a missus arkady since shed arrived nor more tellingly heard any word dag nodded understanding of the geography or of something else she wasnt sure if arkady saw the little flinch that wentwith tales of the ill fates of first wives would likely do that to dag fawn gulped and shut up hard we were both newly come into our full makers powers bryna had a special talent for womens ailments there were already hints that id be a groundsetter when i grew into myself it seemed we had more enthusiasm than sick or injured to treat at hatchet slough an excess of energy thats hard to imagine now being young we talked about the problems of our neighboring farmers she thought it a grand idea to offer treatments to them perhaps set up a little medicine tent at the camp farmers market next to the table for herbs and preparations our mentors put their feet down hard on that before it became more than talk of course but you can see how far our thinking had gone your notions arent new dag dags eyes lit but with unbeguilement you could really do that arkady made a little waitfortherest gesture a desperate farmer woman with a dying husband whod heard our loose talk came to bryna for help she went is this one of those failedandblamed tales dag said uneasily fawn shivered accusations of black sorcery could get a lone lakewalker beaten upor burned alive if the mob was vicious enough lakewalkers in pairs or groups were much harder to tackle no she succeeded the man wasnt even beguiled arkady drew another fortifying breath word got out another frantic farmer came and another i started going out with her one sick woman became deeply beguiled and began haunting the camp her husband decided shed been seduced and tried to waylay and kill me fortunately there were some patrollers nearby who rescued me and drove him off it all came to a head when there was a riot at the camp gates by the kin of some desperately ill folks trying to break in and carry us away by force it was repulsed with a lot of bloodied heads on both sidesone patroller was killed and two farmers the camp council decided to break the impasse by smuggling us out in the night we were taken in secret to moss river camp to continue our training the hatchet slough lakewalkers misdirected anyone inclined to search for us and that was the end of our experiments with farmers arkady sat up straight and fixed dag with a glare as i dont care to relive that nightmare you will stay away from farmers as long as you reside at new moon cutoff is that very clear dag returned a short nod like some unhappily disciplined patroller yes sir arkady said in a more conciliating tone of course that does not apply to fawn she doesnt trail a jealous farmer spouse nor does she have kin here to foment a riot shes not likely to create a camp problem he added after a moment at least not in that sense fawns brows drew down in puzzlement but what happened to your wife sir dag gave her an urgent head shake but whether it meant no dont ask or ill explain later she wasnt sure but arkady replied merely she works at moss river camp these days voice and expression both flat and uninviting so fawn swallowed the dozen questions that begged as guests here dag said fawn and i are of course obliged to abide by your camp rules i wont give you trouble sir fawn wasnt at all sure how to take the skeptical lift of arkadys brows but his tension eased he accepted dags assurance with a nod the maker opened his mouth as if to add something but then apparently thought better of it taking a belated bite of his dinner instead it wasnt till they were settling down in their bedroll laid out in the spare room at the houses farthest end that fawn found the chance to ask more so what was all that about missus arkady missus maker arkady i guess for a horrible minute i thought arkady was going to tell us shed been murdered by farmers but seemingly not dag sighed and folded her in close to him i had the tale from challa a few days back seems arkady and his wife worked together happily in the medicine tent here for years and years they were partners as well as spouses close as close but they had some of the same problems that utau and sarri had no children a sorrow that the hickory lake couple had solved radically by taking another member into their marriage utaus cousin razi not the usual course fawn had gathered but their toddlers were darling however many parents they possessed dag nodded not just no conceptions miscarriage after miscarriage getting worse as she grew older arkady was especially frustrated challa says because as a senior medicine maker he thought he ought to be able to fix it somehow seems thats why the miscarriages got more dangerous actually when the troubles werent let go early they were worse when they did break its not an uncommon problemive seen it in camps all over the north two exceptional people get stringbound and their tentkin settle back happily to wait for the exceptional children to start popping out and nothing happens kauneo and i he bit his lip she stroked his brow you dont have to say he nodded gratefully but went on anyhow we didnt have long enough together to find out if wed be more of that there was one month we had hopes anyway arkadys wife bryna she was getting older time was running out then suddenly she asked him to cut strings with her lakewalker divorce fawn nodded arkady wasnt too happy i reckon but he didnt fight it they divided up new moon and moss river medicine tents between them more or less and very soon after she got stringbound with a widowed patroller from over there they had two children before she had her change of life i guess theyre nearly grown by now fawn tried to decide if this was a happy ending or not half a one maybe you wonder why arkady didnt remarry even my groundsense doesnt help me figure what goes on in his head i do see hes a right sensitive man and maybe only partly from training his groundsense to a pitch like ive never seen do you think thats why hes so i dont know how to say it tidy maybe turmoil hurts him in his ground he raised his brows at her could be spark she cuddled in closer planting a kiss on his collarbone his hand tightened on her hip before they gave over talking in favor of other sorts of exchange she said so what should i write to whit and berry he sighed uncertainly what do you want to do spark she went still beneath his warm grip stemming her first thought before it could leap off her tongue i want to go home made no sense the west blue farmhouse would belong to her eldest brothers wife in due course dag had been all but banished from hickory lake all the home she had was right here beneath her a square of blanket on somebody elses floor and dag it was enough for two but not for three or maybe even more twins ran in fawns family two years in this place it seemed a huge stretch of time to her though dag no doubt saw it as a hiccup in his much longer existence a lot could happen in two years births deaths both her thoughts were spinning too wide and loose to snag sense she coiled them in a day a week a month that was all she could plan right now ive seen the rivers and it was all good except for that one mile and ive seen the sea id still like to see the trace in that lingerin spring youshe caught the word promised before it could escape to wound himtold me about whichever spring that turns out to be he ducked his head but didnt speak arkady had said how much time it would take to turn dag into a real medicine maker he hadnt exactly said outright that dag and his farmer bride were invited to stay here that long was that id give you two years an observation or an offer she drew breath ill write whit and berry that were not coming back to the fetch anyhow that floating home might already be passed to its new owner their things transferred to the keelboat is it possible to send a letter from here all the way up to clearcreek dag pursed his lips seeming to check his mental mapcourier routes and camp locations likely yes no guarantee of how quick itd get there though fawn nodded understanding it was a slow hard slog to wrestle a keelboat upriver four months or more from graymouth to tripoint compared to the six or so weeks it took to float down the overland route on the tripoint trace cut off the corner of the river route many miles shorter quicker for the horsed or the lightly burdened but unfriendly to heavy cargo they could leave new moon weeks or even months from now and still beat whit and berry home her thought faltered or to clearcreek anyhow where whit at least had achieved a real home now with berry and hawthorn she and dag would be welcome guests there fawn had no doubt she swallowed ill tell him if we dont all meet up back at clearcreek by strawberry season to look for another letter dag nodded again it was plain that tonight even he couldnt answer the question dag what will happen to us she didnt ask it she tilted back her head instead finding his lips for a wordless kiss dag took fawn along with him to vayves place to work on his new sharing knife feigning to need her clever fingers even more than he actually did by the time vayve had watched fawn help carve and polish the cured femur wait in apprehensive but attentive silence while dag anchored the involution into the bone and slice his skin with a hot knife to let his blood trickle onto the blade for bonding the maker had lost her rigidity at having a farmer in her work shack another little victory for fawns good nature and bright ground or considering how far into the core of lakewalker secrets this making was maybe not so little it didnt take dag as long to recover from the shuddering pain of setting this involution as it had when hed done cranes knifeif not elegant at least this one was not so anxiously overbuilt he set fawn to burning his name and the donors into the sides of the bone with an awl heated in a candle flame then borrowed her birthday walnut back from her skirt pocket to place before vayve vayves lips pursed as she took it up and examined it what was this practice in setting involutions its far too dense if so dag shook his head id another notion altogether hoped you might have some ideas its been in my mind for a while that id like to make something for fawfarmers that would work to protect them from malices like ground veiling does a patroller not the same way mind i dont see how farmers could twist their grounds sideways to the world the way we do it would have to be something else something any good maker could produce vayve looked startled you would have lakewalker makers expend themselves creating these shields for farmers how could we afford the time make and sell them like other groundworked objects you know we only sell trivial things these shields of yoursif they could be made at allwould not be trivial work so dont sell them for a trivial price dag glanced at his knife on the workbench its plain lines echoing the bone from which it had just emerged then over at another blank vayve had in progress hung on the wall the carving on that blade was elaborate later it might be decorated with shell inlay or colored stones the hilt wrapped with patterned leather some designs were exclusive to certain tents or camps proclaiming the knifes origin to the educated eye you could always tell southern work at a glance that way great pains and pride went into the makings in the north dag thought it was mostly just pain theres your spare time vayve dont you see it fawn put in dag started off with the notion of shielding just me and only then thought of farmers generally but i reckon such shields might work to protect lakewalker youngsters too like the nineteen lost at bonemarsh because it wasnt only greenspring hit with that sorrow stands to reason vayve fell suddenly silent so did dag blinking of course of course the intractable problem of how to persuade lakewalker makers to be interested in this wild notion of his evaporated with startling suddenness right before dags eyes vayves ground roiled with new thought why hadnt he taken his idea that one step further aside from the fact that his head had been stuffed so full of new things these past months it felt like bursting and he was so dizzy with it all he didnt know if he was coming or going maybe it was for the same reason no lakewalkers had taken any stepthey already had a solution to the problem or thought they did a young lakewalkers tentkin or patrol mentors were all intent on teaching ground veiling why tackle a problem sideways in chancy experiments that could cost lives when you already had a timeproven system dag took an unsteady breath and went on i was thinking that an involution might either be expanded into or anchor some sort of slippery shield that a malice couldnt get a grip on at least for long enough for the farmeror youngsterto run away if an involution can hold a dying ground why not a living one vayves brows climbed but a knifes involution breaks when its brought in contact with a malice dag ducked his head but it doesnt break from the outside it breaks from the inside from the affinity of the dying ground with the malice nearby its a sort of a vibration i didnt realize that for all the twentysix knives that had passed through my hand to their ends till i held one that had no affinity with a malice dag took a long breath and began the explanation again of how his former bonded knife had become charged with the death of fawns unborn child at glassforge and the tale of its final fate in raintree vayve asked far more and more detailed questions about the events than arkady had she proved especially fascinated with his account of the malices mudman magery as seen from the inside dag explained i recognized it as an involution of a sort too but huge and so complexanchored in the array of groundlocked makers the malice had slaved together it didnt just sit there passive like a knifes involution it was living off the makers in a sense it was the first i realized that magery is an alive thing im not sure just where a ground shield would get such aliveness though and it couldnt be working all the time or it would wear out too quick im thinking it would need to come awake only when challenged the way a knife only breaks when it actually enters a malice well said vayve slowly there would be four possible sources of ground in that moment the involution itself the person being shielded the immediate surroundings or the malice itself dag frowned i dont see how you could put enough strength into an involution to last more n a moment if it came alive like the magery i saw in raintree it would be clever if you could pull it from the malice itself mused vayve like grabbing an attackers arm and pulling him off balance more like grabbing an attackers arm and pulling it off said dag but no you dont want malice ground getting in you or on you its a deadly poison blight itself the surroundings could be anything no way to anticipate them said vayve that leaves the person being shielded that seems circular said dag trying to picture this if the malices touch spurred your shield to going said fawn how would you rein it in dag frowned i expect it would run down on its own pretty quick if it was using up a persons ground to live wouldnt that be sort of fatal um said dag scratching the back of his head they debated involutions and groundwork for upwards of an hour till the light falling through the open door of the work shack and dags grumbling stomach reminded him that their dinner basket had likely arrived at arkadys place they had not solved any of the problems but dags unsettlement felt curiously heartening maybe hed only stepped back or sideways and not ahead but at least he hadnt been dancing alone fawn was right makers need other makers like dags knifemaker brother dar vayve had plainly been doing the same task over and over in the same way for a long time unlike dar her mind hadnt set solid come around again if you think of anything else she told dag with a friendly smile as he and fawn made their way down her porch steps he smiled back you too the breeze whispered from the south the slanting sun burned through the damp air with surprising strength fawn could just picture the full spring that would come on in not many weeks more when the fat buds and shy shoots all unfurled in any case it was warm enough this afternoon to sit outside on arkadys roofless porch overlooking the lake seated on the bench pushed up to the plank table she crouched over her task her tongue caught between her teeth tracing with her curved steel cutter around dags new bonded knife laid upon a leather scrap the southern lakewalkers made their knife sheaths of elaborate tooled leather inlaid sometimes with silver or even gold but this one would be plain in the northern style simple and fierce like her thoughts she tried to make it her best work like holding yourself up stiff and straight in pride before the eyes of an enemy arkady wandered out of the house with a mug of tea in his hand peered for a moment over her shoulder then drifted to the porch rail leaning on it to gaze down over the slope thirty paces below dag sat crosslegged on the stubby dock his back to the house bent over his own task what is he doing down there arkady muttered querulously what does he have in those sacks a bag of nuts replied fawn not looking up from the cut she was finishing and a box of mice and a glass jar mice hes not groundripping them she added hastily as arkady straightened up he promised me hed be careful about that shed walked down to observe dags progress a short while ago shed brought him the nuts and the jar but made him catch his own mice there were limits to wifely support although the sight of several mice marching out of the nearby woods in a ragged line and jumping into the box under dags direction had been a memory to treasure he says hes about to give up trying to make a shield for the whole body like that groundworked leather coat he once had that he claimed would turn arrows the idea sort of worked but then the mice couldnt run or breathe forcing a second trip to the woods for more mice earlier and silencing fawns doubts about the enterprise dag could make lots of little trials quickly this way work through the mistakes and dead ends and scale up to say her later on much later on hes gone back to just trying for ground shielding madness arkady muttered if he can make it work fawn pointed out loyally it could save thousands of lives thousands arkady breathed gods he leaned and sipped his tea again staring down the slope with an unreadable expression when your husband first turned up at my gates arkady continued after a long pause i took him for a simple man if not a simpleton outright shabby grubby with that northern mumble that sounds like he has a mouth full of pebbles hes only so wordstiff when hes feeling shy and uncertain fawn defended he can talk like a stump speaker when the mood gets on him and he likes being clean as much as the next manwell unless the next man was arkadyhe just doesnt waste time pining for things he cant get right then hes good at enduring indeed murmured arkady he swallowed more tea ive spent my whole life in three camps you know ive traveled between them but never beyond them fawns brows flew up in surprise what you never rode down to look at the sea or graymouth and them so close arkady tilted his free hand back and forth my chosen realm runs beneath the skin it seemed a vast enough hinterland for me he stared again down the slope dag though walks with a foot in each world he straddles things outside and inside patroller and maker north and south he glanced at her lakewalker and farmer knife maker and medicine maker gods he may be the least simple man ive ever met fawn had no argument with that she bent her head for another cut finished it and said it goes with his knack for mending things that are broken i guess bowls bones hearts worlds maybe to fix things you first have to walk all around them see them whole and this all somehow comes down to sitting on my dock tormenting mice arkady almost ran his hand through his hair he did clench his nape knot what is he doing he repeated abandoning his mug on the railing he thumped down the porch steps and strode down the slope fawn watched him stand by dag speak wave his arms dags hand returned a level gesture when she looked up from her next cut arkady was sitting crosslegged too glowering at the jar into which dag was lowering a wriggling mouse by its tail they seemed to be still talking debating but when dag bent over again in concentration arkady did too fawn lined up her pieces and picked up her squarenosed awl to make holes for the stitching to come she would stain the leather black with walnut juice she decided and bleach the binding threads pale in contrast she glanced at the bone knife shed helped fashion with her own hands gods spare her heart her mortal foe would go most elegantly garbed in mourning colors soft as whispers against dags breastbone when he suspended the sheath from the cord around his neck her rivals dark dress would be sewn well to last for years decades longer if fawn had her wish if wishes were horses we all would ride she leaned forward and pressed the first pair of holes through the leather the oleana boys returned from patrol in a cold afternoon rain last gasp of the southern winter dag had just put another piece of split wood on the fire that warmed arkadys main room where theyd all clustered dag reading old casebooks arkady writing in a new one fawn knitting the partners were heralded by the thump and shuffle of steps on the porch and remos voice better leave our boots out here and everything else till it dries you know how arkady is about his floors a grunt of agreement a female voice said ill just stand in the doorway then fawn set aside her handwork and looked up in happy welcome dag straightened and turned his head curiously the door swung open and the patrollers entered stomping and blowing remo wore wet socks toes and heels peeking through the holes and barr wore none his feet pale and cold joints red where theyd rubbed in his boots both had hair plastered to their heads by the rain their wet jackets had apparently been hung on the row of pegs outside the door so shirts and vests were not overly sodden except around their necks but their trousers were flecked with mire in the pattern made by splashing hooves neeta her boots muddy stopped on the threshold she wore a sensible hat with a brim that shed the rain beyond her jacket neck and bore a laden withy basket welcome back said dag puzzled by the dark mood that hung about the partners neeta though equally damp smiled across at him as cheerfully as a spring flower i wont come in she called from the doorway my tent will be expecting me but the patrol wanted you to have this dag she hefted the basket he raised his brows going over to take it from her it seemed to contain a large smoked ham and some glass jars of what might be fruit preserves wrapped in cloth well thank the patrol for me he said a little nonplussed she grinned back at him her cheeks flushing pink with the cold her silverblue eyes sparkled like stars in a sunset sky its the least we can do sir theres this farmers market we always stop in at on the last day of patrol you see when were homeward bound its a bit of a tradition well im letting in the cold air arent i what from any other girl might have been an embarrassed giggle came out more of a silvery trill enjoy sir she remained staring him keenly up and down for another moment before she withdrew and let the door snick closed behind her remo glowering after her heaved a sigh barr snorted fawn relieved dag of the basket and lugged it to the round table nice ham she commented her own brows rose when she unwrapped the jewelcolored jars to discover the cloth was a madeup cotton shirt very neatly sewn in dags size dag tried to think what he might have done for neetas patrol to earn this tribute and came up blank hed only been doing groundwork in the medicine tent for two weeks theyd treated no extraordinary emergencies lately and besides the patrol hadnt even been here in any case neither returnee bore the air of a young man who had wooed and won dag was surprised generally exchange patrollers with the glamour of the exotic about them found it fairly easy to worm their way into the bedrolls of willing young patrol womeneasier anyway than it was for the local fellows the girls had been seeing all their lives the advantage was considered one of the many enticements to go on exchange all four youngsters in question were healthy and as far as dag knew unattached the interest had certainly been there the numbers came out even but barr and remo were plainly not relaxed or sated or goofy with delight or enjoying any other of the happy emotions a woman could induce in a mandag smiled across at fawn quite the reverse if grounds could be made visible theirs would be knotted into personal thunderclouds hovering over their heads dag said neutrally so how was your first southern patrol they could not have found a malice sessile or otherwise or the general mood would have been something quite different i dont want to talk about it remo said is arkadys bath barrel out there hot it was this morning said fawn the coals are still banked you could likely put some more kindling on and get it to catch good growled remo been thinking about that for hours he trudged out the back way why yes remo of course you can go first barr remarked airily to the closing door dag heard remos steps thump down the outside stairs barr flopped down on the braided rug in front of the hearth and stared bitterly up at the ceiling whats bit him fawn asked in wonder her gaze strayed to barr and you barr made an unconversational noise in the back of his throat not quite a death rattle did your ah courtships not prosper dag inquired genially taking his seat again he really didnt see how they could have failed which one were you sweet on again i couldnt hardly tell fawn picked up her needles and plunked down in the padded chair opposite but didnt start knitting again arkady had set down his quill and rested his chin in his hand spread fingers hiding his smirk listening shamelessly tavia sighed barr he waved his arms in the air tavia tavia tavia hair so soft the rest of heroptimistically large hand motions above his chestso soft too a man wouldnt get sliced up by her hip bones like that blond icicle remos drooling after not that it does him any good either the arms fell listlessly to the rug and the trouble with all this is prodded fawn tavias gone sweet on remo why why i like her way better than he ever would i bet i could make her happier too im an eversomuchcheerier fellow irony ah irony i gather from this that remo is er sweet on neeta dag inquired i shouldnt think she would find him repulsive he wasnt sure whether to hope to learn neeta was sweet on barr or not a truly creative patroller with a big enough blanket might do something with that array he elected not to mention the thought one mustnt shock the youngsters oh he was doing pretty good with her at first and i was getting all ready to catch tavia on the first bounce with his goodwill till he made the big mistake of telling neeta who you really were dag bluefield nocamp its no secret no who you were up in luthlia dag wolverine of leech lake camp dags stomach clenched oh but thats near a generation ago neetas just back from two years exchange to luthlia and full of it did you know they still sing ballads up there about captain dag wolverine of the wolf war one ballad growled dag and he didnt much care for it his wife kauneo had been a heroine of wolf ridge and her brothers and fortyodd others dag had merely been a survivor fawn eyeing him uneasily offered you cant blame folks for wanting a song to help them remember their war yeah well i dont want to remember it although the old memories no longer seared merely twinged he had time and fawn to thank for that besides that ballad got it wrong it carved up the truth to fit in its stanzas taught the wrong lessons barr groaned from the floor one ballad theres a couple dozen a whole cycle about the wolf war and neeta learned every blighted one of them while she was up there she can sing them all she did and as soon as remo let your old name drop she didnt want to hear anything from either of us except dag stories dag had endured infatuated youngsters and some not so young a time or two before at hickory camp word had eventually got round not to bother him or perhaps hed simply grown too old and dull it was always embarrassing but everyone always lived he sighed grimly trying to recall his methods of dealing with it it had usually involved having fairbolt send him out with a different patrol till things blew over not a method he could apply here alas lovely tavia barr went onbemoaned actuallylovely soft tavia tavia the fool girl has sheeps eyes only for remo remo lusts after neeta neetas besotted with captain dag wolverine who im not sure even still exists now if only fawn would yearn after me the circle would be complete but thats not going to happen we established that he vented a huge sigh so here i ride all alone at the tail of the pack train of love eating dust dag about to say something else paused in stiff suspicion just when and where did this establishin take place back on the fetch mumbled barr very early on very dag glowered down at the supine figure on the rug but his prey was too limp even for sport besides if fawn had suffered serious insult the corner of her mouth wouldnt dimple at the reminder remos taking forever said barr at last i think ill go wash up in the lake but the waterll be cold said fawn good said barr savagely convulsed to his feet and lurched out arkady muffled a snicker then let his hand fall to the table i suppose if were going to laugh at them we should do it now and not in their faces dag cast him a glance of apology sorry arkady i reckoned those two would have had their love lives all arranged by now the only thing more dismal than one lovesick young patroller underfoot in his hosts tent was surely two lovesick young patrollers dag wondered how soon the pair might be sent back out on patrol fawn said in a constricted tone is neeta going to be a problem dag no ill just avoid her it shouldnt be hard shell be patrolling ill be in the medicine tent fawn raised her brows but did not voice her opinion of his plan arkadys gaze sobered as he regarded dag what wolf war he inquired youve not heard of it theres a relief said dag it was just one of our many northern malice scuffles bout twenty years back thats where this went among other things he gave a vague wave of his hook the fading wolf war wasnt relevant to his current ambitions he didnt need to discuss it here he tried not to think hooray excuse me butcompany captain in luthlia arkady persisted it was a short career i thought you were a plain patroller from oleana i am i was it suited me better after he waved his left arm again luthlia is a hard hinterland a young mans country when i wasnt young anymore i went home how long were you actually up there bout ten years he grew uncomfortable under arkadys continuing stare what about it arkady was silent a moment then shrugged you keep surprising me is all i usually fancy myself more shrewd dag couldnt think of anything to say to that so he picked up the old casebook and tried to read again after a moment fawn returned to her knitting and arkady to his writing all more slowly with frequent glances to the lakeside windows by the time the partners had washed donned dry clothes warmed up returned dags knife and fallen upon the dinner basket like starving dogs their moods had improved fortunately in dags view fawn dared to ask was this southern patrol very different from your oleana ones barr and remo exchanged a hardtoread glance arkady chewing watched with interest no said remo slowly and yes yes barr nodded its funny what is asked dag i always thought id like it if things were looser out on patrol he jiggled his shoulders to indicate a desirable slackness then added though the alligator hunt was fun the farmers whose lands we crossed didnt want us to hunt their bears theyre too rare and valuable herethey want the bear grease and pelts and meat for themselves but they were happy to grant us all the alligators we could find the bigger the better wild pigs were free game too we came back with a stack of raw hides that we unloaded in that farmers market he took another bite of bread piled high with bright apricot jam from one of dags gift jars and chewed blissfully fawn made a face wasnt it scary did you hunt them at night she turned to arkady and explained up in oleana the lakewalker patrols cross farms at night to avoid disturbing folks you hardly know theyre out there no said remo you couldnt not around here theres way too much settled land youd run out of night we just rode across in broad daylight we didnt bother the farmers and they didnt bother us barr put in some sort of pretended not to notice us which felt odd some would nod greeting this patrol had a regular string of farmers barns we put up at or campsites in their woodlots the farmers expected a few coins for the use of them which the patrol leader doled out sothe farmers around here arent so ignorant of patrollers as i was back in west blue said fawn remo scratched his head i guess not thats good im not so sure encouraged by dags opened hand remo went on it seemed like there was nothing much for them to be ignorant of we were no more than a hunting party more party than hunting said barr his brow furrowing it wasnt how the new moon patrollers all slipped in and out of camp at night i didnt mind that it was how they were walking their patterns they were noisy they broke formation all the time to talk to each other they sang while walking blight youd never flush a mudman that way our patrol captain back at pearl riffle always said that could be your first sign there was a malice nearby even without the blight shed have had our tongues on a toasting fork for coughing during a pattern but here they just let the ruckus roll on he looked up at dag are all southern patrols like that or was it just this one dag swallowed his bite and chased it with tea ive only patrolled down here one season bout four years back i gather that the areas where theyve found a sessile within living memory arent quite so ah loose but theres no question that the more pressing likelihood of malices shapes us in the north shapeless said remo yes thats what this patrol felt like thats why its so important that southern patrollers exchange north said dag with a glance at the nowfrowning arkady not just for the extra hands they lend us but for the training they bring back home without them the southern patrol would be falling apart faster neetas more valuable for coming home than any two volunteers who stay on in luthlia im not sure she knows that said remo slowly this was her first patrol after coming back here with new eyes she was its like she was the only one there who realized what we saw and she was ashamed for her patrol mates and she hadnt expected to be wouldnt your patrol leader have trained in the north asked fawn i thought they had to hes been back a long time said remo decades i got the impression hed sort of given up he glanced up at dag was the patrol you walked with here like that not after a season with me along barr snorted tea through his nose remo ignored him to say but you werent the patrol leader you dont have to be remo chewed a bite of stew swallowed huh it seemed to fawn that word of dags new or old fame spread around new moon cutoff camp at an unsettlingly fast clip she supposed twentyfive gossiping patrollers dispersed to twentyfive tents added up atop all the folks whod met them both in the medicine tent by now dag wasnt just arkadys peculiar project anymore but a man of apparently more than local fame it made her wonder just what all else was in those ballads neeta had been passing alongfawn had only ever heard the one back in oleana and it had named no names dag hated it she could tell but as the longesttempered man fawn had ever met he endured politely mostly well he did give pretty daunting shrift to the merely curious unless it was a patient he was doing groundwork on when he turned the questions more gently children got straight if brief answers out of him but no one else could for the first time since theyd arrived dag began to get invitations to visit tents around the camp for something other than arkadys medicine walks any that didnt include fawn he refused bluntly any that did he took pains to point out to the issuer that fawn was confined to arkadys place and the medicine tent by camp council order then came an invitation that could not be refused dinner at the camp captains tent dag said in confusion that fawn shared new moon patrols captain was a member of the council both of us all of us your patroller boys and me as well arkady told him i expect most of the camp council will be there dag blinked you think we should go of course you should go this could be your chance chance to do what arkady paused fit in better he said at last i thought we were fittin in fairly good for practical purposes yes well said arkady vaguely they went it was a pig roast all outside at the tenthouse reallyof the camp captain making it seem to fawn quite like hickory lake for a change captain antan bullrush and his maker wife were older folks their children grown but there was still a crowd for dinner three tentheads all mature women who were council members this season spouses and families and grandchildren and since one of the council women was aunt to tavia both partners neeta looked especially pleased the cookout could almost have been a farmer clan picnic with different women bringing their dishes to share but when everyone was stuffed and the children gone off to play along the lakeside and lanterns hung in the trees a more select group gathered on a circle of upturned stumps and began to interrogate dag they asked about captain dag wolverine of the wolf war what they got told about was captain dag bluefield of the raintree malice outbreak with a side order of greenspring the wolf war was ruthlessly relegated to background though it had to come in a little to help explain how dags company had been able to go through the raintree malice like in fawns informed view a hot knife through butter but if the alternate tale was meant to turn aside interest in dags patrolcaptaining career fawn didnt think it was working all that well arkady chewed his thumb and said little watching his protege getting turned on this spit and sometimes spitting back he studied the faces of the council quorum and only winced now and then it was plain that he wished dag would take a more compromising tone it was plain to fawn that dag wasnt going to waste such a captive audience he sure didnt sound like he had a mouth full of pebbles tonight at length the circle broke up to seek desserts and judging from the bent heads to exchange franker opinions privately dag murmured to arkady any objection if fawn and i slip away early arkady pursed his lips no in fact that would be fine i need to stay awhile and talk to some folks dag nodded fawn refused to go without thanking missus bullrush properly but once that duty was done she allowed him to lead her off they stopped by patrol headquarters to check on their horses idling in the paddock there eating new moons fodder since their arrival then continued down the shore road in the darkening chill so fawn said hesitantly what was that all about dag scratched his head gently with his hook im not just sure we were being inspected right enough youd think they could come to the medicine tent for that do you think theyre deciding whether to let us stay for your two years maybe he chewed his lip maybe more dag bluefield new moon cutoff she shaped the name in her mouth camp names didnt just tell your place of residence if you bore one it marked you a member of some greater whole and even after the better part of a year trailing after dag fawn didnt know all the subtleties that implied is that something you would like strange he sighed at the end of last summer that could have been the sum of my ambitions it was exactly what i wanted from hoharie train up as a medicine maker together with you serve in camp let my tired feet rest from patrolling but hoharie choked on you and that was the end of it i think ive made it clear enough to these new moon folks that we come as partners or not at allthey wont make her mistake i wonder what mistake they will make he snorted hard to say spark his strong dry hand found hers and her cold little fingers stole warmth from it gratefully i do know arkadys not keen on spending two years of his time training me up as a groundsetter just to have me go off north and treat farmers if iwe became members of this camp wed have to abide by camp rules and discipline we he sucked a fortifying breath through his nose wouldnt that be something to have done though for the first time ever get a farmer girl accepted as a fullfledged member of a lakewalker camp would they i wouldnt stay for less i hope i made that plain fawn rather thought he had her brows scrunched she felt rattled and she suspected he did too this offerif it got madewasnt anything shed ever expected or planned on but then nothing about her life since shed met dag had been anything that she could have imagined back when shed first fled west blue my whole life is an accident but some of her accidents had been happy far beyond her dreams and she had surely chosen to put herself in the way of both good and bad when shed first set foot to the road am i dags greatest accident too at arkadys place dag lit a lantern against the cool gloom smiled slowly and observed seems we have the house to ourselves the gold glint in his eye wasnt only from the lantern light fawn dimpled back thats a nice change she said agreeably dag had been reticent about offering lovemaking since the patroller boys had returned only partly due to fatigue from his long training days and now occasional draining groundwork under arkadys supervision the partners laid their bedrolls in the main room and there was a door to close between but wooden walls did not much block groundsense tonight dag and fawn had a brief gift of privacy if they could seize it before the beer ran out at the pig roast they took turns washing up quickly in the sink then dag carried the lantern to their end room fawn unrolled their bedding and helped dag off with his shirt and arm harness he returned the favor folding down her blouse as though it were a flowers petals they stood facing on their knees skin to skin each leaning into the other for support and heat theyd made love in many different moods from merry to mournful tonight it seemed to fawn there was something almost desperate in dags grip gods spark he muttered help me remember who i am she hugged him tight he released his clutch in favor of a caress long fingers gliding over her bare back winding in her hair and she thought not for the first time that with all his touch being channeled through his single hand he paid it a more reverent attention and so as a consequence did she she whispered into his shoulder wherever we are you can always come home to me he bent his face to her curls handless arm tightening around her and breathed her in it was gently done she had no call to think of a drowning man drawing air always he promised they sank to their bedroll of residence dag woke slowly in a gray morning light feeling vastly better and he smiled to remember why fawn still slept he lifted his arm from around her coiled warmth then rolled over and opened his second eye at his face level half a dozen pairs of beady little eyes stared back at him in unblinking fascination you again he groaned at the field mice go on shoo fawn came awake at his voice sat up on her elbow and took in their visitors oh my word theyre back i thought you said youd got rid of them yesterday again i did well i thought i did i took the box halfway around the lake and dumped them in the woods dag contemplated these leftovers from his frustrating shielding experiments survivors all had they been especially determined theyd have to be to trek back across half of new moon camp id think a farmer girl like you would have more ruthless ways of getting rid of mice well if they were piddling up my pantry sure but the only crime this bunch committed was to fall in love with you death seemed too cruel a penalty for that her big brown eyes blinked at him in consideration beguiled he corrected austerely i dont think mice have brains enough to fall in love she dimpled i never noticed as it took brains there is that spark he creaked to his feet peered a bit blearily around the room found his slat box tipped it on its side in front of the staring micewhose heads turned in unison to track himand chivvied them into it carrying them out the door onto arkadys roofless porch he poured them over the rail they fell with only a few faint squeaks bouncing unharmed in the grass below and shocked out of their trance scampered away for now dag shook his head and trod back inside where fawn was sitting up lovelynaked and laughing behind her hand the poor things he grinned and opened himself to her bright ground as if basking in sunlight then went still blinking within her vivid swirl spun a brighter spark yet he knew it at once from that heartbreaking almostmonth that he and kauneo fawn had no groundsense it was his task to track when the brilliant changes in her ground signaled her time of fertility and switch to alternate forms of pleasuring each other for all the eight months of their marriage and before she had trusted him to do so how had he missed the signals last night blight it hed known it was almost time no not blight it never in the same breath with this that breath tangled in his throat in a ball of guilt terror and joy if hed taken one of challas surgical knives and laid open his own chest wall his heart could not be more exposed in this moment it might not catch more than half of all such conceptions never did many of the remainder failed in the first few weeks barely delaying the womans monthly it was one of the strongest if least discussed lakewalker social rules to make no comment upon those blazing signs in a womans ground unless she brought them up herself should he say anything until he was more sure when would that be fawn had been pregnant once before how soon would she recognize her own symptoms would they be the same for this halfblood child if that spark survived to become a child dag said fawn doubtfully you feeling all right whyre you lookin at me like that he fell to his knees beside her crouched gathered her up in his arms hugged her fiercely and protectively feeling as helpless as hed ever been because i love you he told her well sure she said a bit shaken by his fervor i knew that she hugged him back bemused absent gods what do we do now so when are you going to tell her dag arkady asked curiously dag refurled his reaching groundsense anxiously following fawn down the road toward the medicine tent she was off early to help the herb girls prepare the mornings load for the farmers market five dizzy days it had been since that careless hour in their bedroll he glanced up to find the oleana boys grinning at him over their tea and plunkin and clenched his teeth he could endure he supposed their smirking at him never at her for that alone he ought to tell her soon or pound them whichever came first its not going to bewere past thatgods that horror you told me about when it plants in the wrong place and id have tomy own first barr and remo looked blank safely past arkady soothed him dag let out a pent breath that other thinglike tawa killdeer not that either said arkady it looked this morning like a very nice implantation up in the right rear wall of the womb just where it should be and not twins as far as dag could tell lakewalker women almost never bore twins but when they did arkady had said there could be more problems the added stress on the mother cascading to other troubles or an even more bizarre tangling together of the childrens bodies and fawn was so little not that either dag reminded himself none of that a whole category of complications he could cross right off you know said arkady almost all apprentices go through a phase where theyre convinced theyre coming down with every new disease theyve just learned about i thought you were going to be the notable exception i suppose i didnt think it through quite far enough barr snickered dag didnt lunge across the table at him and took a moment to feel proud of his selfcontrol he needed some positive thoughts just now its the womens game remo assured him with all the certainty of his vast inexperience they look after all that stuff dag relax its not a game growled dag absent gods was i that stupid when i was your age i suppose i was and remos careless remark reminded him once more that fawn had no kinswomen here to wrap their care around her like an heirloom quilt barr shook his head ive never seen you dither like this dag ive never been faced with this before you young dolt its all new new to him at least old as the world entertainin am i dag snapped he rose abruptly come on arkady lets go talk out on the porch leave these two to their swill its breakfast barr protested in mock outrage we dont swill breakfast well maybe the tea allowed remo tipping back his mug arkady followed him out without protest dag slammed the porch door on their laughter it was better leaning on the railing in the mild air the sun was not high enough yet to warm dags back but it lit the golden haze across the surface of the lake and along the farther shore the first faint green breathed in the trees with a pink splash of redbud bright against stark gray branches and when arkady leaned alongside him dag didnt have to look him in the eye i dont know how it happened dag said arkady chuckled you cant expect me to believe that dags hand clenched the rail he bit back swearwords you know thats not what i meant i thought not till we were more settled till we knew what we were doing with this wedding trip behind us which has gone on so long now i suppose i better start calling it a marriage trip i even reckoned ita childwas something id let fawn choose where and when whenwhereshed be safe his grip tightened i dont know enough you are aware said arkady carefully nine out of ten women sail through this without special problems lakewalker farmer or half blood dag brooded those used to sound like good odds arkady gazed out over the lake new moon cutoff would be about the safest place you could find for this you do realize that thought had crossed my mind dag admitted maybe even safer than with her own kin certainly safer than somewhere in the north with just me trying to figure out how to go on then it might be time for a slightly more ah conciliating approach to people around here do you suppose arkady suggested mildly more adaptive what a delicate tongue you have arkady dag sighed and turned to lean sideways watching his profile reckon you could near make lace with it id be satisfied if i could make a good groundsetter arkady tilted his tea mug in toast to dag and drank but i think you know that by now dag stood silent for a while letting the balmy air caress his winter skin you could find another apprentice you always have where is the north going to find another dag n fawn service is service one man can only do his days work no matter where he is true enough so much rode on this pivot point of their lives so unexpectedly aimed at dags heart strange for such a tiny spark to weigh so heavily it might move worlds yet it all could still prove in vain dag reconsidered arkady with new respect how many times had he gone through these same gyrations only to have his hopes wash away in sorrow dag felt abruptly ashamed sorry to be dithering like this its my first time see it was surely as profound a ground transformation as any hed experienced this punchdrunk year when hed become first fawns patroller then fawns husband then captain makeshift mage then not a patroller at all an uprooted seeker a new maker and now once again fawn remade him fawns childs father when this is over i will be a different man how agonizing was it to begin such a transformation and then have it break off incomplete fawn would know he realized he added challa told me about you and bryna ah said arkady good and after a moment then youll understand dag nodded well some better than those two giggling louts indoors arkady rubbed his chin and stared out at the morning light eyes like two new copper coins and then he said a strange thing dont let fear swallow all your happiness dont forget to take joy dag gulped both of their grounds were nearly closed it was arkadys voice alone that hinted how hardbought this bit of wisdom might have been yet the words had been nearly toneless dag considered his most secret fear if fawn dies of this i will have killed her sure as if id led her out to battle on a ridge against impossible foes so was that fear for her or for himself hed known a couple of men whose wives had died in childbed it wasnt something a man got over despite how time wore away all things his remorse would be no novelty but i have a new bonded knife now i wouldnt have to get over this one not for long it was a peculiar enticement to courage gods he was getting morbid hed better tell fawn soon just so she could give him a dose of her calm good sense and cheerful optimism he could almost hear her voice stands to reason dag well once she got over being mad at him with justice if she threw things he wouldnt duck he decided gallantly ill tell her tonight he said we have a lot to talk about i reckon good said arkady an hour into the farmers market the medicine table had already enjoyed a fair sprinkling of trade with the bright weather and several days for the roads to dry since the last rain nola and cerie thought it might be busy enough for them to sell out early and take a few hours off in the sunshine fawn made cordial hellos to their regular customers smiling at faces starting to be familiar shed even begun to recognize folks rigs spotting finch whatshisname in his open cart as he drove in his mare was dark with sweat and stood quietly when he dropped his reins and vaulted down he strode quickly to the medicine table eyes seeking to her surprise fawn youre here youre here oh thanks be can i talk to you privately missus bluefield well sure i suppose so fawn looked around would over by the trees be private enough yes anything his hand stretched and clenched as if he wanted to grab her arm and hurry her along but didnt quite dare they came to a halt at the fringe of the woods in sight of the market but out of earshot not out of groundsense range naturally but she doubted groundsense could make anything more of the agitated farm youth than she did finchs tense face was damp with perspiration and flushed with exertion making his blue eyes look incongruously bright is your husband still of a mind to treat farmers he asked abruptly he watched her mouth with painful intensity as if expecting his hearts salvation to issue from her lips well in the north in due course sure but hes just an apprentice here hes not allowed his hand swept this aside as if he barely heard her his words fell out in a breathless tumble its my nephew sparrow my brothers little boy hes barely five hes got the lockjaw and its all my fault i let him run barefoot in the barn there was this nail went halfway though his poor little foot i was supposed to be watching him he cries and cries when he can the fever came on first the straining started last night the screams are bad but the silences are worse oh gods yeah i know lockjaw said fawn slowly violet stonecrops little brother died of it oh years back they were neighbors of ours when i was growing up in west blue i didnt see but violet told me all about it later horrifying descriptions can he come can your lakewalker husband help finch clutched her sleeve can you askhim whatever his name is please my sisterin law cries and mamas so mad she wont even look at me please can you ask him the clutch became a shaking grip painful its all so awful dag said fawn answering his least question while trying desperately to think dag bluefield he insisted on taking my name when we were wed the way lakewalkers do took a farmer name to be more lakewalker s funny she would have to catch dag alone not in front of everyone in the medicine tent she glanced at the sun near noon he might be back to the house for lunch or she could spare dag the decision because this one was going to be hard no matter what way it played out though with a youngster involved she didnt have a lot of doubt which way dag would jump she knew the camp rules as well as he did she could send finch packing back to his daylight nightmare and never share the dilemma it wasnt a good time for dag hed seemed so strained since the pig roast constantly looking at her as if wonderingwhat as if regretting how his farmer bride divided him from his people out in the wide world there were any number of folks sick or dying right this minute and what was one more arkady would surely forbid it if he caught even a whiff of the plan fawn wasnt even sure lakewalkers could do anything for lockjaw she hadnt seen a case since shed started work in the medicine tent this could cost dag his training and how much would that cost others down the line she let out her breath in a slow trickle knowing her choice was no choice at all i cant promise hell come but i can ask him come along finch exhaled in a long huff nodded seemed to realize at last that his grip was hurting her and let her go she looked up and gave a wave to cerie and nola watching her dubiously across the grass which didnt explain a thing but at least made it look like she wasnt sneaking there was a path over the wooded ridge that went nearly straight to arkadys place much quicker than going around by the gate the camps perimeter she had learned wasnt as tightly guarded as that gate made it appear nevertheless shed better not push their luck when they were almost in sight of the water she told finch stay here down in this little hollow arkadys place is just a couple hundred paces farther on ill bring back dag or or his word i might be a little while he nodded silently and hunkered down on a fallen log below the earthen banks turning his face up to a dapple of sunlight eyes squeezing shut fawn hurried down the path she found dag and arkady just finishing lunch packing up the basket the oleana boys had gone off somewhere good fawn said dag rising from the table in surprise i thought youd be at the market are you hungry she gave her head a quick shake he hesitated giving her that uncomfortable penetrating daggish look groundsense gods her skin might as well be glass are you all right somethings come up she told him not glancing at arkady can i talk to you private ah hm said arkady his brows lifting inexplicably perhaps its as well ill walk on back to the medicine tent dag you take all the time you need with a benign wave he took the basket with him setting it outside the front door well this was easier than shed expected so far she wasnt sure that was a good thing fawn waited till she could no longer hear his footsteps going up the path fawn dag began slowly theres something but she overrode him saying oh dag its so horrible huh he said warily no spark it wont be that bad ill be with you every its finch bridgers nephew poor tyke he stepped on a nail and got the lockjaw oh dag i know arkady wont like it but can we go to him hes only five years old dag blinked paused blinked again who rapidly fawn related what finch had told her can we go to him do we dare can lakewalker medicine makers even treat lockjaw dag replied with agonizing slowness ive read up on it in arkadys casebooks they do groundwork on the nerves and try to get enough water and food down between the spasms to keep the patient alive till the worst passes ive only run across two cases one was a woman at hickory lake came down with itafter childbirth gods theres anotherhoharie brought her through somehow didnt see that one only heard about ittent gossip another was a patroller caught way out on the big summer wilderness sweep up in luthlia the treatment failed he shared not right awaywhen he and his patrol couldnt bear it anymore do you think you could do that nerve work despite not having seen it dag vented a long sigh scratched his head how old did you say this youngster was again rising five finch says absent gods dag muttered the bridger farm is about ten miles off finch has a cart do you think we could get there and back before arkady um no likely not dag shook his head it can take days to pull someone through lockjaw or not i can pack up what we need for some overnights in two shakes of a lambs tail id really rather you stayed here and face arkady alone she shook her head vigorously dont you dare leave me to him hed make mincemeat of me its going to be bad enough when we get back anyhow it would be madness to send you into an upset farmer household without me to ease them along to know what lakewalkerish things need explaining to them and how that is unquestionably true he stared at her unnervingly well its not a very contagious sort of disease in the usual course of things you might be safe around it well of course if you didnt get too close she stared back at him perplexed what was he going on about here never mind once they got to the bridgers she would deal with things as they needed to be dealt with same as always she wet her lips marshaled what had to be said nowyou sure dag because if youre not i can go tell finch no myself that much at least she could spare him this could cost you arkady he smiled wryly down at her traced his thumb across her warm cheek if it does then his price is too high and im too poor an old patroller to afford him she gave a short nod swallowing the lump in her throat wed best bustle about then she went to their room to pack a sack and he went to arkadys work chamber to borrow a few items of equipment he thought he might need quite without permission and fawn suspected that wasnt going to go down too well with arkady either she returned to the main room to find him writing arkady a brief truthful note well it said hed been asked away to treat a sick youngster and not to expect them back at any particular time if he left out the word farmer in front of youngster it wasnt a lie nor even in all probability a concealment she led dag back to the sunspeckled hollow to find finch sitting on the ground with his arms wrapped around his knees his head bent when he heard them approaching he scrambled to his feet wiping his sleeve across his wet face he stared in shock at dag looking back and forthor up and downbetween them uh this is dag said fawn grabbing his left arm in a possessive hug snapping eyes daring finch to say boo defying him to stare at the hook and if he blurted one word about how short and young she was or how old dag was dag nodded politely finch sir finch gulped youre um he peered sideways and up and back to fawns tense face not what i expected generally not but folks get over it said fawn rather tartly then controlled her prickliness finch had enough troubles he didnt need to know what they might be sacrificing in his cause ive been thinking it might be more discreet if we were to circle around and meet your cart at the end of the road out of sight of the market i dont think itll make much difference in the end spark said dag still theres no point in going fishing for questions and arguments and delay since finch nodded vigorously this plan was adopted a quick walk through the open woods brought them to the head of the road not long after the cart arrived and dag helped her swing their sacks up into the back she sat next to finch and dag took the rearfacing seat behind them folding in his long legs with a sigh finch slapped the reins across his mares back urging her into as fast a trot as the roads would allow to dags eye the bridger farm looked not so snug and rich as fawns family place in west blue being more crowded and cluttered its flat yard still full of churned mud from the winter rains but it seemed to have all the essentials a big barn a large woodlot outbuildings in varied states of repair fences penning cows pigs and chickens if not their smell the unpainted wooden farmhouse was two stories high and foursquare dag followed finch into the dim center hall feeling they were a noisy invasion for a moment the hush seemed deathly and he thought too late not knowing whether to be grieved or relieved but a moan from abovestairs and a womans sob cured that impression as fast as did his reaching groundsense they clumped up the stairs into a crowded corner room on a bed that seemed far too big for him a small boy writhed in pain his lips were drawn back in the distinctive neargrin of his disease his neck rigid his breath whistling through his tight little teeth a young woman clearly his frantic mother was patting and stroking him as if she could coax his straining muscles to relax his grim grandmother sat on the beds other side holding his clutching hand and looking exhausted both stood and stared at the apparition of dag eyes filling with fear and desperate hope a few days earlier dag thought it would likely have just been fear dag swallowed and drew fawn in front of him like a human shield his own ground seemed to center itself drawn like a lodestone to the agony in the bed fawn he muttered deal with them i need to see to this he released his grip on her right shoulder and she stepped forward her motion catching the womens eyes smiling fawn gave her little knee dip and said brightly how de im fawn bluefield and this is my husband dag bluefield i guess finch has told you how he met me in the new moon farmers market dag heres training up to be a lakewalker medicine maker good of her to get that training up in right away to stop them from expecting such miracles as arkady could no doubt produce names were offered in return in thin voices cherry bridger the mama missus bridger the grandmama finchs mother stared at her careless son who had produced this lakewalker prodigy new doubt sapping old anger now fawn went on briskly the first thing dag needs to do with little sparrow here is take a look at him in his ground and then we can see how to go on from there so if you could just let him by maam she pursed her lips and picked the grandmother to draw out of dags way take off my arm harness first spark i doubt ill need it for anything here fawn nodded folded up his left sleeve and went to work on his buckles he bent his head toward her but watched the others out of the corner of his eye this ritual with sweetfaced fawn making short work of the ugly threatening hook always seemed to have a soothing effect on farmer patients dag wasnt sure if it was pure distraction or his display of vulnerability or a signal or just a show youve all seen a man rolling up his sleeves to get down to work well watch this dag rubbed the red marks left by the leather straps on his arm and slipped past the wideeyed women he abandoned his attempt to marshal a greeting for a frightened fiveyearold when it became obvious the boy was too gripped by his spasms to hear or understand he muttered in fawns ear now if it looks like ive gone in too deep or am staying too long slap me on the side of the head the way you saw arkady do hard as you have to can you do that she nodded firmly dag sank to his knees at the bedside the visible world already fading from his senses the swirl of its true substance rising to the fore behind him he could hear fawns cheerful voice raised in the beginner lecture now let me tell you all something about lakewalker groundsense the childs ground was roiling down and in the flare of fever was familiar by now not good but not the main problem the deep puncture in the foot hadnt been cleaned out properly and was hot and dirty and poisonous inside despite its deceptively healed surface skin but it was indeed the frenzied noise along the nerves that drove the relentless muscle spasms dag sent soothing groundwork twisting down their branches like releasing dye into a stream and felt the frenzy slacken he fought his way up and out before groundlock set in and came back blinking to a room that seemed awfully quiet he sat back on his heels looked around vaguely found fawn how long was i in bout ten minutes dag it was amazing you could just see his poor little muscles give way one by one a new figure had arrived clearly finchs older brother staring hard at the scene he held sparrows mother tightly around the shoulders is he better is he well she choked not yet maam dag told her regretfully just a temporary respite im going to have to go back in again when this wears off but each treatment buys some time first we have to get as much drink and food into him as the little fellow can hold to keep the disease from killing him of starvation and we need to go in and do a better job cleaning out that puncture well need boiled waterfawn can you see to it and some sort of soft rich food but easy to keep downi dont know fawn nodded i expect oatmeal boiled up with cream and honey would do for a start perfect the women anxious for something effective to do at last clattered out in a body the boys fatherwhat had they said his name waslark bridger that was ittook the chair formerly held by the grandmother finch leaned his forehead against the tall bedpost and closed his eyes papa uncle finch a weak little voice lark took up the boys hand hey chirping sparrow his voice was hoarse seeming unaccustomed to such softness good to hear from you at last your uncle finch has brought this lakewalker fellow here to help you out hes funnylooking said finch but hes all right the boys head turned grave young eyes found dag squinted sparrow must have agreed with his uncles assessment because he didnt recoil but said the first thing a child whether lakewalker or farmer inevitably asked what happened to your hand dag ignored the embarrassed rustle from the grownups and gave the child a straight answer wolf bit it off oh said sparrow sounding impressed as only a fiveyearold could but then more unusually blinked sympathetic tears did it hurt yes but it was a long time ago its fine now hey now its all right dont cry for me we still have some work to do healing you do you know blinks suspicion what kind o work i know you wont feel like it but you have to drink and eat as much as you canall your mama and fawn bring you your muscles are working harder than plowing a fortyacre field see and you need your food then fawn and ishes my wife that real pretty girl you just saware going to clean out your foot a bit more in a way dag was grateful for this task it would be visible to farmer eyes comprehensible reassuring though on second thought he wasnt sure he wanted fawn so closely involved with the wound he made finch wash his hands in preparation to help instead i hurt all over sparrow moaned to his papa ill bet dags initial groundwork was already wearing off by the time fawn came back with the boiled water the boy beginning to twitch and spasm as she set up their supplies dag went in again it was easier this time in that he had some idea what he was doing but he could feel the drain on his ground and he began to dread the long night to come when he came back up dag set the mother to coaxing a dose of the bittertasting pain powder down the boy fawn gave him a nod for the wisdom of that but fawn clearly didnt understand why he drew finch into the cleanout work in her place no sparrow whimpered as they turned him over and placed his foot across the towels on his uncles lap itll hurt papa dont let them i promise you itll hurt less n a wolf bite and thats the absolute truth dag intoned the resistant wriggling paused and dag marveled how well that specious argument worked on youngsters every time fawn familiar with the ploy grinned sideways at him dag threw a ground reinforcement into the little foot did his best to numb the nerves and bent to the nasty task onehanded he reopened the cut with one of arkadys sharp scalpels and with a syringe fawn filled with boiled water plus groundwork thoroughly flushed out the poisoned flesh working with finch to rewrap the foot in a bandage was much more awkward than working with fawn but the results were adequate after dag handed everything off to the grandmother to be boiled or burned more hand washing thinking uneasily of arkady and then it was time to go in after the childs sizzling nerves again they fell into a cycle as the day wore on into dusk ten minutes of groundwork gave twenty minutes of relief from the spasms during which sparrow either was coaxed to eat by one of the women or rested limply then the wrenching twitches and painful weeping would begin again and dag would kneel bow his head and slip back into his trance the fever remained high but they were giving the boys own body the means to fight back another brief respite and again as the task became familiar dag found space within it to think and wonder could a maker set up some sort of involution containing groundwork to soothe the frantic nerves something that would last better than half an hour at a time and why did this disruption remind dag weirdly of the ground of some snakebite victims meditating on that peculiar question he was only brought out of his trance by a sharp slap to his skull he blinked up in the lamplight to find fawn scowling at him in worry did i interrupt anything she asked no thank you that was right good blight hed thought he could send her off to another room to rest but it looked as though shed have to keep this night vigil right alongside him no one else here could even guess when his trance began to slip dangerously into groundlock they laid their bedroll on the floor and slept in snatches by morning they were both growing frayed when fawn next slapped him out of his trance he just grunted at her horribly irritated bending his aching forehead to the cottonstuffed mattress he closed his eyes why do you keep making him stop cherry bridger demanded nervously if he kept on couldnt he fix it for good and all because fawn rather snarled if dag gets groundlocked to spato a patient and the patient dies dag could die with him thats what happened to arkadys apprentice just before dag oh said cherry in a smaller voice i didnt know that time you learned farmers need to learn more about lakewalkers so they wont misunderstand how to handle them theyre a dreadfully nervy bunch you know highstrung delicately conveying that dag should be treated carefully dag was not ungrateful the afternoon was bad the evening worse and dag began to wonder if coming out with finch would turn into one of the worst mistakes of his life but sometime during the night his ten minutes of snatched sleep became twenty then forty when fawn woke him blinking after two hours solid he realized theyd turned some corner that and a good farm breakfast revived him enough to go on the lull between bouts lengthening sparrow had time in his restless misery to grow bored dag diverted him with what childrens stories he could remember from his distant youth or lakewalker ballads recast into tall tale he wished bo were here the other members of the boys family as they drifted in and out to help listened along wordlessly as the next dawn edged toward noon then night dag felt as though hed been stuck in this room for about a thousand years it was somehow decided not by him that he neednt stay by the bedside anymore but that someone would come get him when more groundwork was wanted which was now up to three and four hours apart he was led off to a real bed in another room with a washstand and fawn it was his first chance to speak with her alone in dayshed lost track of how many but shouldnt he have his wits about him for a talk so important he was fairly sure that he should and that he didnt so he let her pull the brightly colored quilt up over them both hugged her in hard and slept like a dead man fawn awoke tucked up under dags left arm so early in a misty dawn that the farmhouse was still silent she was wearing one of his shirts for a nightdress he was stripped for sleep as usual she stretched her neck to put her ear to his heartbeat then glanced up he was awake looking down at her slept out finally she asked yes i feel much better now his hand traced over her neck breast belly and rested there spreadfingered his expression grew curiously tender she gave him a sleepy smile what you amaze me he whispered every day you amaze me she cuddled in more firmly i think i have the better part of that trade she wondered just how refreshed he found himself this morning and considered lifting the quilt to check theyd made do with much less privacy than this back on the fetch time to time muffling early morning giggles in each others quick kisses but dags face grew serious and he sighed yet he made no move to rise talk then or maybe talk first then remember the night of the pig roast she kissed his collarbone yes she said encouragingly she stifled worry was he finally going to cough up whatever had been putting him off his stride since then about time i was a little distracted i was gods dag stop making excuses for yourself his mutter trailed off he drew breath and began again your fertile time was starting up and i didnt catch it i we i made you youre pregnant she froze in astonishment his chest had stilled not breathing a wave of shock seemed to rise from her feet through her lungs to the top of her head and for a moment she wasnt sure if it was good or bad or just immense because her whole world was turning inside out with a squeal of wild joy she lurched up and kissed him smack on the mouth oh oh his squeezed eyes flew wide he kissed her back hugged her hard released her only then did his chest collapse in a woosh of breath well thats a relief thought youd be mad at me spark is that why you blurted it out so blunt she stared confused and a trifle alarmed i admit this might notve been my first pick of time n place but you dont expect babies to be convenient not if you have a lick of sense arent you happy his arms tightened around her ecstatic confounded he hesitated taken by surprise but were married we knew this was bound to happen sometime thats what marriage is for surprised today sure but not not in general her nose wrinkled i suppose it could be like patrolling for malices theyre what you went out looking for but its still a surprise to find one that day his deep laugh rumbled in his chest and she was reassured not my first pick of comparisons spark the laugh faded except for the part about being scared scared when you went out after them again and again brave id say he shook his head his expression growing inward as if looking into long memory no that wasnt courage just a kind of numbness it was like id lost all affinity with the world now though oh gods i care so much i cant hardly breathe he dotted kisses all across her face quick almost frantic pecks and im scared spitless about to say itll be fine dag she paused as the complexities of their present situation began to creep back to her mind instead she said babies once theyre started come on in their time not yours you just have to scramble around as best you can she reached up and set her finger to his lips stopping whatever hed been about to say as her own memory gripped her the boy whod fathered her first lost child had feared only for his own threatened comfort hed greeted the news of its bare existence with anger rejection threats of unforgivable slander this astonishing man in bed with her wanted to remake the whole world into a safe cradle for her second or leastways turn his heart inside out trying shed a sneaking suspicion wisdom was to be found in some happy medium but on the whole she preferred dags approach you amaze me too dag she whispered he rolled toward her folded her in she nuzzled his chest hair then thought of yet another advantage to possessing a lakewalker spouse hey is it a boy or a girl too early to tell even for groundsense itll be another few weeks till anyone can be sure he drew her upward to kiss her again then added a girl could carry on our tent name his attempt at a neutral tone failed to conceal his hopeful interest but if she married a farmer shed take her husbands name fawn felt constrained to point out any boy who marries our girl will take her name and like it she giggled madly you sound so fierce he blushed i spose i am getting a bit ahead of myself spark truly uncertainty began to nibble away at her first joyful surprise because her attempt to picture the birth of this child foundered on the first question where somewhere between the surety of this mornings breakfast and the air dream of the childs future wedding lay a whole lot of todayswork and a need burning as inexorably as an hourmarked candle to get things settled laying in winter supplies on the farm every fall had taught her how to plan ahead how to make the future happen as it was supposed to well it had shown her one way she reckoned it hadnt taught her how to follow a longlegged lakewalker husband over half a continent that shed had to learn as she trotted along and she was still learning how do we do this wasnt to be simply answered just like mama and papa dags hand left off caressing her belly and found a lower spot to admire she eased her thighs apart to give him room then hesitated i suppose its safe to must be stands to reason most folks wouldnt even know at this point yes he said firmly i asked who arkady oh she digested this as well as she could through the distraction of his sweet tickling does he know that im oh yeah course he could tell if you could she blinked wait a minute did everyone know but me barr and remo too and now she hit him but it was too late to be convincing groundsense he sighed you just deal with it he licked down her neck youre smiling she suspected she was grinning like a chipmunk with its cheeks full actually so much for my dignity remember he breathed to take joy she was put in mind of what hed said when planning their wedding night that it would stand out sharp and clear when a thousand other nights blurred so far hed been proved right though they werent even up to a thousand days yet she opened mind heart and body to him as he set about making sure that along with all her other recollections of this remarkable morning she would remember that she was beloved after they washed up and dressed dag went in to give sparrow another treatment the boy seemed so much eased that finchs unmarried sister a girl of fifteen was left to sit with him midmorning found fawn and dag on their own in the farmhouse kitchen the rest of the bridger family having scattered to their relentless farm chores fawn rewarmed the pot of grits left out for them not too stiffly congealed and fried up ham and eggs to gowith they were half done with this meal when dag lifted and turned his head at nothing it reminded fawn of the way a cat stared at things no one else could see lakewalkers no wonder they made regular folks uneasy what said fawn just bumped grounds with neeta of all people whats she doing here looking for us fawn made to scramble up seemingly sit spark shes still riding in finish your breakfast you need your food he gave her a fond smile she smiled back deep inside her head an excited voice was still crying babybabybaby yesnoyes eep she wanted to jump up and run around madly preparing something but truly there was nothing much to do yet especially here except to eat her breakfast she swallowed the last bite of buttery grits then followed dag to the front porch neeta was just cantering into the farmyard mud splashing from the hooves of her sweating horse which shook its head as she pulled up and stood blowing through round red nostrils dag she cried sir youre alive had there been doubt dags left arm tightened around fawns waist whether possessively or in warning she wasnt sure am i in time neeta added breathlessly she cast an odd look at fawn her blond brows tightening as if in confusion or dismay or disappointment in a rather deliberate drawl dag said in time for what neeta i expect we could still rustle you up some breakfast she made an impatient swipe of her hand at the levity captain bullrush cant be more than an hour behind me and hes hopping mad you have time to get away if you hurry away where and why i cant believe antan bullrush has mayhem on his mind on such a fine spring morning no no of course not but you can still get back to camp slip past him no one need ever know you were here oh gods i should have brought another horse i can lend you mine if you like and i can walk home she dismounted and climbed the wooden steps as if to present her reins to dag at once dag stuffed his hand into his pocket i shouldve thought folks knew we were out didnt arkady get my note yes barr and remo said except they didnt tell us till the next night when the rumors were already all over the place an uneasy sigh trickled through dags lips so ah you want to begin at the beginning neeta he let a tinge of patrolcaptain sternness seep into his tonedeliberately perhaps for neeta straightened her shoulders yes sir well i guess old arkady wasnt best pleased when he found youd gone off was there a sick farmer lockjaw said dag shortly neetas mouth made an oh she looked briefly daunted but forged on i dont know what was going through arkadys mind but the next morning when you two didnt come to the medicine tent he told challa hed given you a day of rest except that nola and cerie piped up that theyd seen fawn go off into the woods the day before with some cute farmer boy and she never came back well cerie said she wasnt sure it was like that but nola thought it was and arkady just snorted wasnt like what said fawn taken aback that you had eloped with that farmer boy and dag had gone chasing after you both neetas lips thinned with as much disapproval as if she had discovered it to be true fawn gasped in outrage at the slander i never dag squeezed her to silence and removed his hand from his pocket but only to rub it over his face go on any gossip thats all over the medicine tent spreads all over the camp pretty shortly that night barr and remo told me and tavia about your note but they made us swear to keep our mouths shut which i for one was just as happy to do i still thought it could have been a false trail if youd gone off with blood in your eye i dont know how the whole garbled mess came to captain bullrushs ear but next morning he stormed down to the medicine tent to find out what was really going on he said he wasnt going to be having some blighted murder ballad play out in his patrol district he was even more livid when he found out the truth and that arkady hadnt warned him i heard they had the most ferocious argument they agreed to give you till last night to show up and explain yourself and then the captain was going to go looking for the answers which he is doing this morning oh sir neeta raised a distressed hand toward dag arkady and i had almost talked the camp into offering you tent rights i thought you fought so hard for your trainingdont you care about it anymore more than i can rightly say then there has to be some way to salvage this cant you have these farmers swear you were never here dag wanted fawn could see to slap neeta with a flat no and leave it at that but the habits of too many years spent shaping young patrollers cut in before he could gratify himself useless neeta antan would have the truth out in no time i wont lie but id be glad to grovel if you think it would help oh neeta nearly stamped her foot fawn thought she did clench her fists cant you please come away not yet one more day of nerve treatments will slice better n a week off sparrows recovery i figure have you ever seen lockjaw neeta she shook her head lips tight no but i hear its gruesome you heard right dag straightened and stretched as if girding himself leave your captain to me neeta its come on sooner than i would have liked but these questions were bound to get laid on the table sometime best to have it out and done sir you you blighted fool sir the bridgers will let you use their barn go take care of your horse patroller dag sighed youve used him hard this morning to no good purpose it looks like muttered neeta savagely she stalked off the porch and led her blown mount away around the house i could wish arkady hadnt taken it into his head to cover for me murmured dag i wasnt expecting that did he lie outright ah gods this is going to be hickory lake all over again im so sorry spark i dont think its the same said fawn sturdily sure puts me in mind blight if only id had more time to earn my place time to persuade i thought the scheme of a medicine tent in the farmers market was firstrate or could be made to be with unbeguilement get it set up and running in two years or three leave it behind as a seed when we did go north again planting ideas fawn tested the notion in her mind only works if youre going to stay and water and weed them and pick off the caterpillars huh he dropped a kiss on the top of her head its never simple is it spark captain bullrush bumped dags groundsense within the hour dag went out to wait on the top porch step leaning against the post fawn sat at his feet her face propped in her little fists neeta lounged on the steps opposite fawn one booted leg outstretched scowling the adult bridgers filtered out onto the porch too papa bridger and lark flanking the front door with their arms crossed mama bridger in her rocker failing to knit cherry and finch anxious on the bench beside her i expect captain bullrush will be wanting a word or two with me id take it kindly if you folks wont interrupt his say dag cautioned the bridgers fawns and my place back at new moon camp is at stake here finch ducked his head at fawn his source of many lessons on lakewalkers over the past four daysthough not that oneand said im so sorry i didnt know dag gave him a dry smile over his shoulder if you had would you have done any different finch glanced up toward the corner bedroom where his nephew lay peacefully sleeping i guess not not really me neither the little lakewalker patrol trotted slowly up the lane the camp captain naturally didnt ride alone hed chosen his age mate tapp to be his partner for this inquiry witness too probably not surprisingly barr and remo trailed after they looked relieved to see dag and fawn more confused to see neeta the four drew up their mounts in the muddy yard in front of the porch from his place in his saddle antan bullrush was almost eye to eye with dag he did not dismount but did ease his reins and lean on his saddlebow his bent back revealed as much of his state of mind as his mostly closed ground weary exasperation tempered by confusion and caution if hed been younger and less tired hed likely have been more angry dag understood that one bonedeep his eye fell on neeta in a way that made the girl flinch and what are you doing here patroller he growled she raised her chin im off duty sir im free to go where i like is that so she had the prudence to make no reply thankfully antan turned his gaze to dag and went on i see your intelligencer has run ahead of us so which of the tales was true northerner was this an elopement or an errand of mercy it was a fiveyearold boy with lockjaw sir dag touched his fingers to his temple in a habitual salute that had very little actual salute in it to his credit the captains face set in what might have been a sympathetic wince a flicker of his groundsense extended he glanced after it toward that corner room then nodded i see its as well to have the facts straight i suppose even if they werent the facts he might have preferred told him it couldnt be an elopement remo muttered might have been an abduction though barr said judiciously or mock judiciouslywith barr it was hard to tell i might have believed that a sharp downward jerk of antans fist demanded silence from the pair papa bridger stepped sternly forward without this lanky fellow and his little wife i believe wed be burying my grandson today dag turned his left arm in what would be a palmdown calming gesture if hed had a palm on that side the faint threat from his hook and reminder of his sacrifice were just a bonus for antan he figured antan took in the array of bridger eyes upon him and said to dag a trifle through his teeth we would do better without the audience here theyre on their own porch observed dag youre in their yard antan looked sulky but couldnt very well deny this what i think said fawn abruptly standing up is that its time to get everyone here introduced to each other sos theyll have no excuse for talking over each others heads and she proceeded to spend the next several minutes doing so antans attempt to glower continuously at dag kept getting interrupted by having to acknowledge names and little life stories by the time fawn had worked through everything including tapps recent gut problems it was plain that antans plan to keep this on his own familiar termsa stern patrol dressingdown was slipping through his fingers antan stared at the farmers rubbed his face grasped at straws how many folks know about this excursion of yours by now dag just the ones here or moreneighbors kinfolk fawn answered neighbors married sisters inlawsall sorts of folks have stopped by to help in the past few days its how farmers do things you know sir uh huh so any notion that this could be kept a secret is hash afraid so sir said dag understanding his drift and its hopelessness as i tried to explain to neeta but i believe she was only thinking about half of the picture neeta glanced over her shoulder at all the bridgers and blinked uneasily antan gave neeta an illdealwithyoulater look he said to dag did arkady make it clear to you that this sort of thing was forbidden he made it clear he thought it inadvisable and explained why dag hesitated it was clearer to me that i couldnt turn away from a youngster dying in that much agony and still be a fellow i wanted to shave every morning antan was plainly moved by this lastbut not far enough if we have a repeat of what happened over at hatchet slough my patrollers will bear the brunt of it he glanced at tapp at neeta seeing broken heads or worse dag was moved toobut not far enough a good idea badly carried out is not the same as a bad idea with unbeguilement i believe arkadys old notion of setting up a medicine tent in the farmers market would be an orderly way to try a new thing without riots at your gates it wouldnt have to be hatchet slough again antan rocked back in his saddle is that the bee you have in your brain dag nodded oh gods was this the time place and man for this argument never mind keep going because someday when all the malices are gonewhen that long evil doesnt mold us anymorewho will we lakewalkers be ive seen a boatload of possibilities this patrol its not too soon to start trying new things especially here in a lot of ways the south is a vision of the future of the north antan had gone rigid like a man fighting inside his own mind as well as outside listen to me northernerits my calling to hold new moon cutoff to defend it lest our traditions and our blood be destroyed by inches dag snorted our traditions really where did you exchange when you were a young patroller antan south seagate the camp captain replied uneasily pretty far south for north that is so when did new moon hold its last tenyear rededication i know what a traditional camp looks like and its nothing like new moon if you were traditional youd put a torch to every house in it because traditional lakewalkers dont defend we run new moon has gone as sessile as its farmer neighbors and youre only clenching your hands so tight because you have so little left in them antan looked down at his reins and with an effort undid his whiteknuckled fingers from around them he frowned across at fawn id think youd be newly interested in defending whats in front of you dag dag shrugged id be very happy to return to new moon and continue my training he spared a glance at glowing fawn regarding him in unshaken trust absent gods would i be happy for that and would you swear not to do anything in secret like thisa wave around at the bridger farmagain silence then can i have a medicine booth so i wouldnt have to be secret longer silence thats groveling neeta muttered through her teeth fawn had hunkered next to her on the step dag heard her whisper in return dagstyle yep watch n listen dag went on more urgently the future is happening right here every day you can swim or you can drown but you cant choose not to be in the flood i suppose the real insight is that its always been that way he took a breath i think we should start learning to swim antan snapped men like tapp and me have youngsters to defend too everyones youngsters not just our own dag gave a conceding nod but swept his hand around in a loop that took in not only fawn but neeta and the oleana boys finch and sparrow and his sister upstairs if you really mean everyones youngsters lakewalker and farmer alike then im with you because they may be our charges now but they will be our judges when the waters fall blight said antan slowly and here i thought you were just dangerous because you were a softhearted fool youre a real renegade arent you ten times more than that poor bandit fellow you knifed up on the grace well sir and what kind of an answer was that not a denial gods you make me dizzy i sit here listening to you any longer im like to fall off my blighted horse listen northerner we didnt have a problem till you walked in no question that the fastest way to rid ourselves of it is for you to walk out again i dont have time for this fawn looked off into the air but her voice grew distinctly edged my mama used to say to me what you dont have time to do it right but you do have time to do it over antan broke from her cool stare and returned to scowling at dag youre not my patroller dag bluefield absent gods youre not even anyones tentkin here if youre so set on dealing with farmers you can take it up anywhere you likeexcept within the bounds of my camp and whatever mess youve started here can chase after you and not end up at our gates my training dag began you should have thought of that earlier i did then you made your choice so theres no blighted point in me sitting here arguing with you is there just dont come back to new moon we wont let you in again he wheeled his horse away then his eye fell on barr and remo sitting stricken on their mounts ah he reined in you two are you coming with me or staying with him remos lips parted in surprise he looked at neeta and back to antan could we stay at new moon sir you can apply your patrol leader told me that you were exceptionally disciplined patrollers oh not me sir barr said in a sweetly cheery tone ive been hanging around with renegades way too long my ground is totally corrupted ysee you wouldnt want me in your patrols something untidy might rub off on them wits maybe antans teeth clenched in something not much like a smile right then you can bring dag back his horses and gear his gaze swung to remo scythelike and you remo looked in anguish at barr neeta dag ican i have a little time to think about it sir you can have till your partner leaves antans arm veered to neeta you go get your horse and catch up he jerked his chin at tapp enough of this fools errand back to camp as the patrollers turned away barr edged his horse up to the porch i guess ill be back tomorrow with copperhead and all any messages tell arkady no dag could hardly tell arkady he was sorry for going out because he still wasnt only for not coming back tell arkady im sorry for how things worked out but will you keep arguing for me back there as long as you can because antan bullrush isnt the only authority at new moon and your mouth has nothing more to lose you at this point barr grinned like a possum and reined after the others after following dag upstairs to watch him treat sparrow fawn returned with him to the bridger kitchen to find a family conference in progress that reminded her of table talk at home in west blue they all had plenty of rude things to say about captain bullrush anyhow well yes but i have a deal of sympathy for antan said dag as cherry bridger pushed tea mugs in front of them both but he as much as tossed you out on your ear said cherry finch hunched his shoulders and looked guilty the man was trying to protect his camp dag repeated arkadys story of the tragedy at hatchet slough not quite in arkadys words but that was a long time ago said finch before i was born its present memory to folks like captain bullrush and arkady though dag swallowed tea shook his head i think antan senses his ways are starting to be outworn but hes got nothing to put in their place so his only answer is to hold harder theres a lot of folks like him but dags trying to change all that fawn put in proudly dont load my boat too heavy spark one man cant change all the world any more than he can change which way the wind blows the most he can do is learn to read that wind and sail it i figure a fellow can get quite a cargo safe from shore to shore if he can do that he scrubbed his face gods listen to me all wind and water and nonsense no wonder it all slips through my hand i need some good farmer dirt to ground me spark its all about time see i deeply do not understand time and groundsense is no help its stuck in time like everything else he glanced up at a ring of blank faces and ducked his head sorry too many winter nights out on patrol with nothing to look at but stars its like to make a man strange fawn thought she could nearly hear the bridgers thinking stranger but no one said it aloud so what do we do now dag papa bridger put in with heavy emphasis you two would be welcome to stay here for as long as youve a mind lark nodded shortly and cherry and mama bridger murmured something bolstering fawn tried to picture it could they make a life as permanent guests in that upstairs room doing what well she knew farm chores she could pull her weight but she suspected there might be objections to dag taking up medicine making for farmers this close to new moon and with a baby in some other womans house though cherry bridger made a tempting substitute kinswoman theyd be safe for a time at least finch leaned forward elbows on the table face serious fawn do you remember those friends i told you about who were talking about moving north yes i passed on what you told me about your country and it tipped the balance we decided someday should be this spring we thought wed all go together because the trace is no place for loners weve been getting our supplies in ordersage asked his sweetheart to marry him and come alongwe were all to start this past week but then sparrow got sick and i was all distracted i was to take the brown mare and two pack mules for my dueshare and my supplies and tools papa bridger and lark nodded sage has a wagon so theyll be going slower than a pack train i figured to catch up when well i figured to leave one way or another if sparrow had died finch had meant to flee the farm in shame he meant fawn nodded understanding mama bridger sighed im gladfinch glanced at dag took a deep breaththat its not going to be like that but i still want to catch up with sage and the boys what i wondered washave you ever been on the trace sir dags brows flicked up ive never walked it end to end all at one time ive ridden or walked most sections ive never been north of alligator hat finch said the nearest villagesome fifteen miles up the trace fawn had learned charmed by the name shed wondered if they in fact sold alligator hats there but you sir finch went on if you were meaning to go home after allif you threw in with us nowyou might be a sort of guide mightnt you he looked anxiously at fawn of a sort said dag he too looked at fawn question in his eyes im not the medicine maker i meant to be yet she nibbled on her bottom lip before youd half a mind to jump into this with no training but patrol medicine before i was a blighted fool a menace a mighty lucky menace if so and its not like you grew more ignorant for our two months with arkady it sure feels like it arkady opened my eyes to a whole new realm its been right humbling maker vayve tooi thought i knew all about knife making from watching dar but vayves style was quite a bit different between em i feel like someone took my skull and shook it like a bottle of cider and the corks about to pop out you dont have to be the best medicine maker in seven hinterlands although she suspected arkady might be yeah arkady sets a high bar though i wonder if some of that isnt your mamas voice in the back of your head she does make you crazy you know that dag but all you really have to do is be better than what folks have now and be there dag shook his head gloomily maybe you can find another medicine maker up in oleana wholl take you up on your terms arkady cant be the only good teacher the gloom lightened slightly point spark he scrubbed his hair studied her you want to go home truly if they were going north this year it needed to be soon early pregnancy was no picnicshe remembered the sickness and minddraining fatiguebut late pregnancy would be even worse for travel hers anyhow yeah we need to go before i get too round to move dag was endearingly nervous for her health during a concern she treasured after the frightening isolation of her first experience but she was more nervous for what would come after she had never been much for other peoples babies though shed always expected to quite like her own still just how scary was it to be handed a baby you couldnt hand back she didnt need a substitute kinswoman she had a real one now in berry bluefield best thing whit ever did for me if fawn was going to end up having a baby in someone elses house she wanted it to be berrys place in clearcreek useless to try to lie to a man with groundsense but she at least managed i want what you need a crooked smile i think i need to go home too we need wethree not wetwo she heard that and had to smile back dag straightened go home and get started arkadys wrong about one thing it does make a difference where you put your hand on the lever but were not going anywhere without our horses well have to see what barr and remo or barr leastwaysbrings us barr brought arkady also copperhead magpie and two heavily loaded packhorses dag strolling out onto the porch when he sensed them stared openmouthed at the train barr was riding copperhead himself but trailed a strange horse bearing an empty saddle and his bags dag looked in vain for remo and his heart sank at that absence it had been two days since captain bullrushs decree of expulsion dag hadnt expected barr back before yesterday noon at the earliest a hundred things might have delayed him most hopefully some barrish persuasion to reverse antans ruling the longer dag had waited the more his hopes had risen but barr surely wouldnt have packed all that gear just for a quick return to new moon and for pitys sake how had he obtained all those horses whats all this dag asked bemusedly returning barrs wave of greeting arkady overrode the answer what does it look like you unutterable fool i told you how it would be did i not did i not arkadys outward appearance was typically fastidious barring riderumpled clothing and a few wisps of hair escaping its knot but the roil in his usually serene ground and look of wild exasperation in his eyes put dag forcibly in mind of a cat that had been stuck in a barrel and rolled downhill you broke your word to me arkady went on i didnt seek to sir the problem came to me and i couldnt turn aside did you have the first notion what was being thrown away no of course you didnt patrollers antans a bull and youre a mule the only one who really understands is challa and even she didnt come in on my side side said dag his glance at barr was not enlightening barr wasnt actually staring up at the sky and innocently whistling but he might as well have been its unconscionableunconscionable dag admired arkadys ability to even pronounce such a jawbreaking word while sputtering with rage but he was still adrift here if arkady hadnt been sent out to offer dag a pardon why was he here just to vent his feelings to waste a talent like yours still worse to turn you loose on the world onetenth trained and wholly unsupervised so since that pack of fools wont let you come back to new moonarkadys voice dwindled im coming with you dags jaw dropped what you heard me arkadys eyes sought the dirt im coming along with you to continue your training till its complete to my satisfaction where north i suppose thats where youre going isnt it your wife will be homing like a pigeonwomen in her condition generally do you know that much was obvious dag wanted to say not to me but came up instead with arkady you mean to ride the trace with us arkady nodded its eight hundred miles and more you do know that he nodded again more shortly whats the longest youve ever ridden at a stretch arkady raised his chin twenty miles for how many days arkady cleared his throat one and how long have you ever gone without a bath arkady glared but didnt deign to answer that one he straightened his shoulders and dismounted barr followed suit the maker rather absently handed the young patroller his reins then stepped up to the porch is new moon going to allow this dags staggered wits were finally beginning to work again if this offer was real he should fall on his knees and thank the absent gods was it do they even know youre out here theyll figure it out snapped arkady i warned antan and the rest of those ditherers on the camp council if they imagined i was bluffing well theyll know better next time you cant live on the road the way you do in camp dag looked away at the tree line along the road hazy in the damp warmth of the late afternoon looked back caught arkadys evasive eyes square it looks like im going to have a lot more people on my hands this trip than i expected i cant be your nursemaid and barr cant be your servant i will not crumple into a heap from a horseback ride thank you said arkady through his teeth not even one eight hundred miles long the world under the skin is your home hinterland but the world outside it is mine my road my rules can you accept that about as well as you ever did i expect arkady returned their stares held each other for an uncomfortable stretch then you can begin by taking care of your own horse dag said at last the barns around back arkadys glare turned scorching barr looked very alarmed but after a long hesitation arkady merely said all right and took back his reins as he started around the house he added over his shoulder when i return i want to inspect what you did to that boy with the lockjaw lines drawn clearly enough dag nodded acceptance this still left barr holding the leads of five horses although copperheads ground showed signs of recent heavy persuasion that and the geldings tenmile jaunt this morning doubtless explained why he wasnt trying to tear strips out of his trail mates just now dag took him and magpie off barrs hands barr yielded gratefully wheres remo dag asked barrs face went bleak he stayed ah an unexpected exchange dag frowned after arkady barr is arkady bluffing with this crazy gambit holding himself hostage to force the camp council to knuckle under and take me back the corner of barrs mouth tucked up i think he thinks he is im sure they think he is dag nodded somewhat relieved understanding then shot him a sharper look then whats the use well i got him this far i figured the rest would be up to you yeah challa made medicine arkady made medicine makers fawn might dub it the difference between corn and seed corn when going off to break new land the latter was clearly the more valuable so would it be better to call arkadys bluff or the camp councils with a slow smile dag thought neither best of all would be to grab your gift of seed corn and run before the original owners could demand it back ill tell finch we can all be ready to start north tomorrow said dag and led the horses off toward the barn their departure in the morning was much delayed but with only fifteen miles to cover till their first planned stop they hadnt really needed to be off at dawn dag and barr readied their horses with patrollers efficiency but either finch or his mama kept thinking of lastminute items to add to his packs in a strange way it reminded fawn of her leavetaking at west blue after her wedding minus the wedding finch too was a younger child with no land and a meager dueshare and his space was needed for the next generation even more than his hands were wanted for labor his family wasnt glad to see him go but they werent arguing very hard against it either his mamas feelings were likely the most mixed his papa seemed pleased hed found a grownup guide even if he still found dag unsettling arkady and barr just baffled the bridgers despite barrs entertaining the family at dinner with an account of their journey on the fetchalthough hed glanced at mama bridger and left out the river bandits to fawns relief bos tallest tales could scarcely have won wider eyes the great river barely thirty miles west of here plainly seemed an exotic world to them i was more ignorant than that once time seemed tilted as if ten years of change had been packed into her last ten months fawn shook her head in wonder and kicked magpie after longlegged copperhead finch kept twisting in his saddle and waving though once they turned onto the road and the budding trees hid the house he set his face forward eagerly enough it was barr and arkady who kept glancing back fawn suspected barr was still wishing remo might change his mind and chase after them and arkady had similar hopes about his camp council arkady wasnt used to losing arguments fawn reckoned she dropped back next to barr as they rode along in the soft spring air he was encumbered with the two packhorses but they seemed to follow without protest where did you get the horses and gear she asked its all arkadys i gather he barely tapped into his camp credit even after mounting me though one whole packsaddle is crammed with nothing but his medicine stuff he didnt want to leave behind i had to remind him to pack clothes barr grimaced he said if he didnt take the portable medicine tent the council wouldnt believe he was serious is he serious barr smirked dag is huh it was a promising day for their start pale blue overhead pale green alongside and as the warming afternoon wore on fawn found herself nodding then yawning and slumping fighting heavy eyelids and seductive visions of laying a bedroll beneath the bushes and taking a long nap she blinked awake briefly at the shock of realization i really am pregnant her fatigue the past few days at the farmhouse had enough other excuses that shed not noticed it creeping up on her if not for dags groundsense this would be her first suspicion she stared down at her stomach neatly clad in her riding trousers in a mixture of awe and alarm this time can i get it right sleepy spark dags voice jolted her awake fraid so she mumbled maybe i could tie myself to my saddle the way you say couriers sometimes do i have a better idea why dont you come over herehe indicated his lapand we can double up the way we rode into glassforge she smiled at the memory what about magpie shes lakewalker trained shell follow well if you think itll work copperhead stepped alongside and fawn knotted her reins on her mares neck and let dag help her slide across she tucked up reasonably neatly arm around his back her cheek to his heart and sniffed clean cotton and warm dag happy nose this is so nice she murmured cuddling in tight but i wont close my eyes i dont want to miss a mile of the tripoint trace although so far all the miles had looked rather alike flat farm country broken up by shaded brown watercourses at least all the looming trees bearded by swags of that gray hanging moss were different from oleana bald cypress and magnolia and live oak what a dozy afternoon spark at dags murmur she unglued her eyelids what what did i miss about four miles of nothing swamp mostly i slept for an hour she squinted hoping she hadnt drooled on his shirt your arm must be ready to fall off itll stick but were coming up on alligator hat oh dag stopped to let her down and she seized an invigorating stretch before remounting magpie they trotted after the others which also helped bounce her awake alligator hat seemed typical of the small villages straggling up the trace a few dozen wooden houses were set back from the road with gardens of varying neatness some front gates bore painted signs advertising rooms and stall space for rent for weary travelers a sturdy bridge led over a weir for a mill the road widened into a square around which clustered businesses that served both the local farmers and the trace a couple of alehouses a neat twostory inn with its own large stable out back the village clerks office another livery signs for harness and repair a wagon wrights and a big smithy finch waved his arm and led their caravan around back into the smithys yard a large wagon was set to one side tongue to the ground it was newpainted green with fine curling yellow stripes the wheels picked out in scarlet under its arching canvas roof fawn glimpsed a female shape fussing with some baskets the double back door to the smithy was flung wide a red glow winking from the forge inside where a bulky young man waited with his hand on the bellows near the door in the better light a tall lanky young man held the head of a big brown mule scratching its poll and making soothing murmurs in its long ears no twitch looped its creamcolored lip even though it rolled its eye in worry a wiry young man held its back hoof trapped between his knees on his leather apron a nail in his mouth a hammer in his hand he glanced up briefly at finch and waved the hammer calling around the nail be righ wi you then returned to shoeing the mule the clack clack of hammer on hoof echoed around the yard the nail went in neatly and he wrenched off the protruding point clinched it and filed it down he sprang back as he released the hoof but the mule merely sighed and leaned into its ear scratching the two young men grinned at each other then the lanky one tied the mules rope to a ring on a post bulky lanky and wiry all came out to the yard despite his friends broader shoulders it seemed the wiry one was the smith because he greeted their party with the air of a host finch you made it he came up as finch and the rest dismounted and asked more quietly and anxiously hows sparrow then blew out his breath with relief when finch replied that his nephew was going to be all right wiry glanced in some confusion at the rest of the party clearly wondering if they were customers off the trace what can i do for you folks shoeing repairs it seemed to occur to finch for the first time that four strangers and six beasts were rather a lot to spring onto his friends travel party unannounced he hastened to make introductions this is dag bluefield whos the fellow we owe sparrows life to hes a lakewalker medicine maker who wants to go north to oleana and treat farmers and this is his wife fawn bluefield which is why i guess he glanced at fawn and evidently decided it wasnt necessary to add shes a farmer fawn made her little knee dip the three boys gaped at her in wonder and after a second look at dag the usual surprise and this is dags um friend arkady waterbirch whos going along with him and barr umdid you ever say your last name barr will do the patroller said staring with interest at these farmer nearagemates barr who had always looked like a puppy next to dag seemed suddenly an older dog and these are my friends sage smithwiryash tanner that was bulkyand indigo axe lanky with deeply tanned skin despite the recent winter a long face and an impressively beaky nose the woman meanwhile had hopped down from the wagon and strolled over to the group sage reached out and grasped her hand and this is my wife calla he announced with shy pride indigos her little brother the latter hardly needed stating calla axe smith was half a head taller than her new husband as tall and lanky as indigo with the same warm skin long face and beaky nose black hair scarcely longer than her brothers was cropped in fine wisps around her head she wasnt beautiful but fawn imagined that once she outgrew her youthful awkwardness she might be striking fawn had trouble guessing her age but thought calla might be even younger than herself which would be a nice change except that indigo looked to be in his late teens like the other boys so calla had to be older than that how de said fawn with another eager knee dip im right glad to hear theres to be another married woman in the party are all those folks going with us calla said not sounding at all delighted she frowned coolly up and down at the mismatched couple of dag and fawn indigo regarded them downright warily dag knows the trace finch put in hes been all along it this is our rig sage pointed proudly at the wagon seeming oblivious to his wifes standoffishness although dag glanced at her sharply what do you think of the new paint finch calla did the stripes yeah said finch in admiration its beautiful but its big for the trace what do you have to pull it asked dag in a tone of friendly interest six fine mules sage jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the sturdy beast hed just finished shoeing the team and their tack were callas dueshare callas family used to make harness calla gave a little grimace but sage went on with undaunted enthusiasm i have all my tools aboard and my new anvil papa gave me as long as a smith has his anvil he can make every other tool he needs to make every other tool you need six mules will likely do till after the hardboil river unless you need to pull out of a mud hole dag said but theres at least three long hillsmountain passes reallynorth of the ferry that will need more to get this weight up them most folks who take wagons on the trace do it in groups and double or triple the teams on those slopes hauling the wagons up in turns dag surveyed the animals standing in the yard if you hitch on finchs two mules and our two packhorses and maybe take part of your load up separate itll likely do you want to be sure you pack harness for the extra pairs though sage took in this new information with vast interest thats good to know we only had the one spare set ill beg an extra set from papa before we go are you going to break land fawn stood on tiptoe to look over the tailboard at the array of tools and supplies neatly arranged inside sage pointed out yet more features of his rig including a folded feather bed calla frowned in faint embarrassment but didnt blush do you know which part of oleana youre going to try yet no plowing for me that would be finch and ash im heading to tripoint sage took a deep exultant breath where tripoint steel comes from i have to see that really you might do well there dag extended his left arm and turned his hook which hed been holding nearly behind his back till now it was a couple of tripoint artificers made this for me oh yeah when what kind of steel did they use for that little springtongue back of the curve there thats clevergives you a pinch grip doesnt it light but strong sage was the first person fawn had yet met who if not tonguetied altogether by dags maiming asked about the arm harness and not the hand dag she could see was rather cheered by this and the two fell into a discussion about the merits of tripoint artificers that threatened to run on till everyone else fell over fortunately an older woman came out from the frame house bordering the yard and called is that you finch will you be wanting dinner she proved to be sages mama missus smith leading to a repeat of the introductions all around she looked taken aback to be presented with five extra mouths to feed within an hour of the meal and dag instantly volunteered to take his share of the party down the street to the inn this however she rejected indignantly especially after learning about sparrow necessarily the next move in the dance although dag didnt seem to realize it was for fawn to dip her knees again and say cheerily how de maam what can i do to help out which won a slightly more approving eye and an invitation into the kitchen in callas wake dag grabbed her in passing to whisper you dont have to do this spark the inn will feed us and you can have a rest she whispered back no this is better were going to be traveling with these folks for the next six weeks best chance ill get to see where they come from he hesitated then nodded understanding fawn glanced up at the rambling but not large house we might like a room at the inn later though because ive a suspicion all the boys are going to end up in bedrolls in the smithy loft which will be dry and free but not as private his lips twitched point spark he let her go turning back to the men to help deal with fodder and beds for the fourfooted guests the kitchen featured an iron cookstove of the sort fawn had coveted up on the grace rivernot a northern import but a homebuilt imitation that had been presented by papa smith to his wife after seeing a real one at graymouth by the time fawn had exclaimed over it been shown its features and assured mama smith that it was as fine as any tripoint work the ice was in a fair way to being broken at least enough for going on with but the kitchen also harbored an unmarried daughter and two unexpected daughtersinlaw wives to sages older brothers the boys who were slated to be the next generation of alligator hat smiths six women in one kitchen was a crowd indeed as the guest fawn seized bottom place in the pecking order of work flow dislodging calla whod only been there three weeks unexpectedly upward tall gawky calla seemed more tense than grateful mama smith her daughter and both sistersinlaw displayed a decided coolness toward calla too which puzzled fawn truly there were way too many women in this house already not to mention smiths in the smithy but calla seemed very much in support of her young husband and his northward trek fawn would have thought callas mamain law would be softened by that as she was plainly fond of her youngest son but fawns musing had to wait while they put out food for finally fifteen adults and two toddlers in the kitchen and dining room and spilling over into the parlor and then there was the washing up dag had slipped away before dinner to secure their inn room so was able to free mama smith from her dilemma of which family members to dislodge in her packed house to gain a decent bed for unforeseen married guests as fawn had guessed finch barr and arkady were offered bachelor space next to ash and indigo in the smithy loft though fawn could see mama smith was a bit doubtful about arkady barr had done well through dinner repeating some of his milder river anecdotes in the few edgewise spaces given him fawn had said heartening things about oleana dag had let finch describe his adventures with sparrow making his shyness look wise and mysterious arkady had said nothing at all fawn didnt think any of the household took his welldisguised terror for anything but standoffish lakewalker pride which was likely just as well she wondered if hed ever been inside a farmer house before last night barr did help him get his bedroll up to the loft fawn waved goodbye in the gathering darkness and let dag escort her across the square the inn room proved small but pretty and clean and wonderfully quiet dag guaranteed it free of crawly pests fawn gave her husband a hug for finding it then rested her head on his chest with a tired sigh are you all right he asked stroking her hair it was a long day for you plenty more of those to come no im fine i do wonder whats going on with sage and calla though i liked him pretty well but shes cold as a fish and his family doesnt like her one bit but nobody vented to me usually in a family that big theres at least someone wholl tell their complaints to anyone listening you cant shut them up dag hesitated didnt you realize realize what calla and her brother are both half bloods fawns hand stole unwilled to her belly spreading protective fingers no she said slowly i hadnt realized that the departure in the morning from the smithy yard was even more of an uproar than the one from the bridger farm as he tightened his girths for the secondno third time and swung up on copperhead neatly avoiding a welcoming cowkick dag found himself falling into his old patrol leader habit of doing ground checks on every person animal and piece of equipment in range the result was actually heartening young healthy and in repair pretty much summed it up well with a couple of exceptions on the young part including copperhead but with a portable smithy and a portable medicine tent together with folks who knew how to work them dags party was vastly better prepared for the trace than most travelers my party really speaking of habits because he was fairly sure sage thought of it as his party and finch as his and for all dag knew ash felt the same arkady was the one certain exception despite dags stern remarks on selfreliance barr as silent conspirator had made sure arkady and all his gear were loaded in good time giving him no excuse to either break back to new moon in a panic or drag his feet hoping for an envoy of peace to pelt up the entire smith family turned out to send their son off to his new life in the scary north with lots of little presents popped into the back of the wagon at the last moment a couple of folks from ashs family turned up too in the mob it took a while for dag to notice that there seemed to be no one at all for calla and indigo there might be half a dozen sound reasons for this starting with prior goodbyes like finchs but dags mind picked at it anyway as a sixmule wagon seven riders and four pack animals turned onto the trace and struck north it was another dry day thankfully the trace along here was well maintained by the villages that lived on its bounty with deep creeks sturdily bridged shallow ones with fords that nearly qualified as paved even the mud puddles today were minor to be splashed through cheerfully and not yarddeep traps for wagon wheels after a good nights sleep fawn rode along on magpie with her head up taking in everything unaware of how busily that bright ground in her belly swirled selfmaking of the highest order now there was true magic world magic after an hour the caravan sorted itself out and settled into the rhythm of the road the way here was wide and straight dag took the chance to ride up alongside finch trailed by his pair of plodding pack mules fawn cast dag a curious glance and kicked magpie up on finchs other side finch gave them both friendly smiles making it easy for dag to start known sage long oh years his papas was the closest big smithy to us so wed go every couple of months for repairs and special shoeing and whatnot stayed the night in alligator hat usually we two tads used to play together while the work got done as we got bigger his papa and big brothers let us work together alongside them they taught me a lot finch vented a nostalgic sigh and ash hes more a friend of sages than mine lives near the hat his family has a poor strip of a farm so he always knew hed have to find another way hes been talking about the north for years and ah calla and indigo fawn shot him a look across finchs saddlebow aware as the boy was not of the reason for dags newly acute interest in half bloods and hers dag could just about see her ears prick up they used to be sages neighbors when they were younger their folks had a harness shop on the square dag considered his next question carefully were calla and indigos bloodlines known to their village bastardy was not a lakewalker concept any child born to a lakewalker woman was a full member of her tent whether the parents were stringbound or not as long as the father is a lakewalker too dag reminded himself farmers held a stricter view of paternity tied as it was to their inheritances if these siblings were the secret gifts of some passing patroller dag didnt want to be the first to explode their lives with the news he finally settled on tell me about their parents fawns brows twitched she gave him an approving nod hed evidently got that one right good oh yeah you would be interested in that wouldnt you finch said blithely their papa was a lakewalker maker from moss river he left his camp to marry their mama but he took her farmer name just like you did fawns funny im not sure how they first met something to do with their trade i think dag relaxed a little fawn asked what happened to them they werent out for the sendoff this morning were they oh no eight ten years ago alligator hat had the worst outbreak of yellow feverthey still call it the fever summer indigos whole family came down with it his mama and little sister died but indigo and his papa and calla got better fawns eyes widened oh my fawn had only seen the south in its more idyllic seasons dag was just as glad shed be spared the full summer when the heat came down like a hammer and you near choked on the water in the air and mosquitoes patrolled in clouds almost as bad as northern luthlian bogs and for more months running and lethal fevers of half a dozen sorts raged unchecked till the laggard frosts then what well their papa took a long time recovering and was pretty unhappy at that the harness shop failed from the loss of the work of his wifes hands or from having the heart torn out of the household and of him maybe it was dags turn to grow uneasy while his groundwork might aid fawn in some dire illness hed never pictured being deathly ill himself at the same time he finally set indigo and calla with his wifes sister and went back to his people at moss river camp he abandoned his children said fawn indignantly no not really he visited and brought their aunt and uncle horses and hides a couple of times a year and other presents for themcash money when he had it indigo and calla were happy enough on her farm when they were younger i guess dag was uncomfortably reminded of the renegade cranes tale if crane had had a more cooperative sisterinlawor a more cooperative campmight he have worked out some less disastrous fate so was it the rigidity of the north or was it cranes own chaos that had been the problem or both fawn peeked over her shoulder at the wagon rumbling maybe twenty paces back sage and calla on the box indigo riding alongside out of earshot for now and when they got older she asked it was all right till lately finchs lips thinned just the last year or so there were these accusations i didnt think much of them i mean sure indigos good with animals but a lot of folks are calla took it to heart though indigo says accusations of what asked fawn er finch cast a sidewise look at dag lakewalker sorcery or powers anyway indigo got in a lot of fights about it and then of course if anything bad happened just bad luck to folks he was mad at or who were mad at him there were suspicions it wasnt luck but some doing on callas part and indigo got into even more fights over those defending his sister oh dear said fawn anyway it got so bad their aunt made their papa take them to moss river for some sort of testing i guess they might have been allowed to be lakewalkers if theyd passed whatever it was but they didnt and the camp sent them back which you would think would have stopped the rumors but it didnt some people fawn sighed testing said dag a kind of lakewalker magic i guess weaving or something which doesnt sound too sorcerous to me i didnt understand it when indigo tried to explain im not sure he did either practice marriage cords do you think said fawn across to dag touching her own might have been too bad they didnt know aboutnever mind and then what well luckily this spring sage went sweet on calla and things started working out i was a little surprised she took to himshes four five years older mostly older girls look at you like youre a flour beetle in their bread dough a distinct sigh anyway indigos notion is that up north they dont need to tell anyone about their lakewalker papa so no one will have reason to give them trouble anymore dag considered this plan it struck him as overly optimistic true fellow farmers wouldnt be able to tell the pair were half bloods but most lakewalkers would know with one glance at their grounds and theyd certainly run into lakewalkers sometime but for the moment he just said mm fawn said rather carefully i got the idea sages family had taken against calla some is it her age shes not that much older and there are plenty of other girls around alligator hat just as poor one of sages sistersinlaw had no dueshare at all i guess some of his family believed those stupid rumors though really if calla did have powers id think youd want them on your side he did not deny the familial coolness dag noted the bones of the tale all lined up true with one joint possibly missing although it would be easy enough to check now that dag knew where to look well said fawn i hope things work out for them all sincerely waving fawn to continue her amiable chatting with finch dag held copperhead back till the mule wagon came alongside he eased closer to sage driving and touched his temple to calla and to indigo riding beyond fine mornin for your start sage nodded and came back friendlylike with i take it for a good sign calla sat up and turned her head stiffly dags way watching him as if she feared he might leap from copperhead and attack her dag was reminded of his height his hook and his generalwhat was that phrase arkady had usedstarveling vagabond air he really did need fawn by him to make him look tame yet calla should be far more used to lakewalkers than the typical farmer girl her alarm was something more particular dag smiled vaguely at them all and opened his ground indeed sages ground was planted with an illformed persuasion fading as it was absorbed over time he showed not a trace of beguilement however interesting callas attention sharpened as did indigos both plainly possessed a residual groundsense callas much the stronger likely not the doubled vision of the world fullblooded lakewalkers could call up of lightshot shadows more weighty and true than the forms that cast them but dag would certainly seem suddenly more there to them when he opened like this did they understand why surely this couldnt be new to them what said calla curtly eyes narrowing tension quivered off her tight ground like noise from a badly tuned fiddle indigo was less strained but alert maybe fawn could help dag puzzle out the halfblood girl they were both young women dag scraped for inspiration and came up with i was wonderin sage happens that my wife fawn is lately with child which is partly why were heading home just now shes holding up right well so far but she does get weary in the afternoons im thinking it would ease her to have a liedown in your wagon later when the riding starts to exhaust her callas face fairly cried no but before she could speak sage said cheerfully why sure wed be happy to help her out shes such a little bit of a thing she wouldnt add more to my load than a sack of feathers thank you kindly ill let her know dag switched his reins from his hook to his hand and raised his left arm as if in acknowledgment he let his ghost hand trail out and spread like a net passing through the back of sages head defusing the tattered persuasion into nothingness accepting the faint ground backsplash sage just smiled at him blinking calla looked worried but deeply uncertain as i thought good dag went on if theres anything i can do for you folksanything at allhis eyes bored into callasdont wait to ask ive helped train a world of young patrollers about your ages theres not too much i havent seen before if calla was struggling to manage rudimentary ground powers and it certainly appeared that she was she needed all the help she could get but she should have had help before now blight it what had her maker father been thinking or was she a late bloomerlike dagdismissed because someone mistook not yet for not she has to trust me first which wasnt going to happen in their first hour of acquaintance patience dag they had weeks before them just like a new patrol he nodded and reined copperhead away arkady and barr were trailing their pack string out of range of the kickup of dirt from the wagon at barrs wave dag joined them arkady frowned at him what did you just do to your ground just a little cleanup i flushed some old groundwork out of sage it would have been absorbed in a few more weeks but i wanted to see exactly what it was that boy with the lockjawnow thisyour ground is going to be back in the same mess in no time if you keep this up dag shrugged afraid so dont do that isnt going to be a good enough plan out here we need to come up with something else what i was hoping you might get some new notions once you had more cud to chew on youre the brilliant groundsetter arent you arkady gave him a look between annoyance and amusement dont try those trainer tricks on me i invented them well then dags lips curled up in hope two days without a new problem to bite on and already arkady was getting restive dag just had to keep him moving north and wait barr apparently wrenching his mind away from a disturbing vision of arkady as a cow said to dag so what was the groundwork ah said dag this may prove to come under what arkady calls medicine tent work which means if i explain it to you its in aid of someone and not for taletelling barr took this in this means if i gossip about it you pound me this means you dont gossip about it period barr opened his free hand in cautious agreement and set it again to his thigh i believe calla tried to persuade or beguile her sweetheart sage said dag and failed near as i can tell persuade him to do what asked barr it seemed to be what a farmer might call a love spell arkady snorted pointless the boys besotted with her i wonder if she realizes that dag was put in mind of fawn when hed first met her lumbered with desperate selfdoubts how could all these young women not know how lovely they were i dont see my way clear yet but i figure if i wait and watch it will all lay itself open to me meanwhile we have these two youngsters here with more than a touch of groundsense and no one at all to instruct them how to go on with it they seem to behe glanced at arkady and picked his worddamaged oh said arkady straightening in his saddle hooked you dag repeated finchs tale more or less of the two young half bloods blundering between worlds finding no clear path or paths deliberately blocked dags curiosity grew in a baffled voice barr said but you just met them yesterday dag they dont even like us why are you taking them up dags and arkadys matching looks had barely intersected on his skull when he continued oh fawns pregnancy of course you want to study half bloods now dag drew breath that too but do you also remember when i met you and remo why did i take you two up i dont know said barr reminded he glanced back over his shoulder at the empty road where to his obvious discouragement no wayward partner galloped to catch up i dont know he looked for aid to arkady who merely shrugged i dont know that i can put a name to it either but it touches the heart of what marks a true maker i promise that you didnt get me out on this mad road just because dag can do some tricks dag exchanged a salute evenall for arkadys considering nod then turned copperhead to catch up with fawn fawn was glad for the invitation to nap in the wagon and hardly needed dags hint to want to make friends with calla but the trace so fascinated her she stayed upright on magpie for the whole of that afternoon the landscape was much the same as it had been since graymouth now fiftyodd miles behind thema succession of swamps woods woods in swamps cleared fields on the higher ground and little villages the good weather brought out not only local trafficfarm wagons and riders and pack mulesbut road crews they passed gangs of men and boys shoveling up barrows of dirt from the verges to raise the crown above the wet or filling in low spots with wagonloads of gravel it seemed to be a point of pride for each village to maintain the famous road in its vicinity fawn learned to spot the debatable boundaries between townships by the ruts during a midafternoon break they were passed by what fawn thought of as real trace traffic a caravan of some forty northbound mules loaded high with crates of valuable black tea a muleteer strode along for every three beasts fellows whose rough looks would have alarmed her before her time on the river though now she could see they were merely exflatboat crews working their way home they stared back at the bright wagon and at her and calla but didnt make rude hoots or anything indigo complained that the caravan would grab off the best campsites and their beasts eat all the new spring grass and leave a lot of alarmingsounding mule diseases in their trampled wake but sage allowed amiably that their party could likely find other sites some farms bordering the road made a bit of coin renting fenced pastures by the night for just this purpose with seventeen animals to feed this was tempting despite everyones youthfully slim purses although the smith women had loaded on enough gift grub for people that no one was going to have to cook for the first three days but just before sunset they came upon an open meadow along a watercourse that no one seemed to be demanding payment for not too eaten down by prior visitors so they pulled off the still brown channel was overhung with creeperlaced cypresses and thick with mysterious shadows and birdcalls and fawn was grateful for the lakewalkers making an alligator patrol before bed all they stirred up was a family of scurrying animals that looked to be the unlikely offspring of a possum mating with a turtle dag accused denied that ancient or recent lakewalker magery had anything to do with the armorplated possums when the boys poked them with sticks they rolled up like pill bugs inspiring a brief round of creatureball till they unrolled and scampered indignantly away sodden with fatigue fawn fell into their bedroll pleased to learn the night song of a mockingbird from the circle of dags arms the next thing she knew morning light tickled her eyes this days start was quicker but not so lively she wasnt the stiffest climbing up onto her horse again arkady seemed creakier but his chill squint defied anyone to comment dag and barr mirrored each other in a series of patroller stretches accompanied by a rude rhyming challenge chant that set them both laughing but allowed them to lunge up onto their mounts without groans indigo was fun to watch helping sage hitch up their mules when he talked to the beasts coaxing and cajoling and praising fawn could almost imagine them talking back or at least signaling with their big floppy ears it wasnt near the overwhelming effect dag had on micefortunately as being followed about by half a dozen entranced mules might get awkwardbut put her in mind of it but by that afternoon not all the charms of the trace could keep her upright in her saddle she crawled into the warm and creaking shadow of the wagons canvas roof with a thankful moan and didnt wake till the light was growing golden her mouth felt as if shed been chewing on cotton but at least her limbs didnt seem to be dripping off recalling her mandate to make friends she went forward to the box calla stiffened at her greetings but sage obligingly scooted over so she might sit up on his other side long way to tripoint fawn observed invitingly gazing down over the harnessed backs of the mules she liked the way their ears bobbed like swaying branches as they walked briskly along yep agreed sage though we have a good pace going so far if we can keep it up it might take us a week to hit the barrens and maybe two after that to make the hardboil river ferry which will be about the halfway mark folks say the barrens dag had explained to fawn were a twohundredmile wide tongue of ancient blight extending due east from the western levels that had for long divided north from south for most of a millennium the only way across had been around either down the gray river or up the eastern seaboard it had only become safely passable again a few hundred years ago because malices did not come up on old blight no lakewalkers patrolled that waste and no farmers attempted to wrest a living from its stillbitter soils without camp or village markets folks crossing it had to pack all their own supplies rumor made it bandit country which went with the lack of patrols fawn supposed i saw a bit of the barrens when we were passing down the gray on the fetch fawn offered scrubby country all sandy and flat and no river towns at all quiet stretch but it was still a relief when we got past it and saw green again this triggered a string of interested questions from sage about their river journey inevitably their encounter with the awful river bandits infesting crooked elbow came out but fawn downplayed it in favor of explaining as much as she could about dags dreams for healing the divisions between her people and his shed thought his notion of a lakewalker medicine maker treating farmers might draw calla out but the young woman kept stubbornly silent fawn tried a more direct lure explaining how dag she hod and remo had among them cracked unbeguilement that memorable day back up on the grace it wasnt something either a lakewalker or a farmer alone could have figured out it took all of us working together this finally startled a question from calla your husband can unbeguile folks he can do no end of groundwork these days arkadys even better this news failed to cheer up calla if anything she looked fearful yet fawn couldnt see how a girl with a lakewalker maker for a father could be afraid of groundwork didnt you ever watch your papa making calla shrugged i was a child i couldnt tell that he was doing anything more than sewing leather oh right groundsense didnt come in till a person was more than half grown and calla had been barely that when her mama had died and her papa had left her with her farmer kin calla added after a moment in an oddly wistful tone folks always wanted to buy his work though harness and bridles and saddles it was plain but it was extra pretty somehow and it never broke she straightened jaw clamping as though she regretted letting even this mild memory escape i remember that said sage for a little while fawn was able to get sagebut not callato reminisce about growing up in alligator hat and she offered tales of west blue in trade then indigo cantered back from scouting ahead claiming to have spotted one of those rentable pastures too fine and cheap to pass up arriving at the site everyone agreed he was right and they turned off for the night sage drew the wagon to a halt in a stand of pecan trees just coming into leaf overlooking a sparkling creek much too shallow to conceal alligators fawn approved he went off to find the farmhouse and offer his coins and fawn followed calla down from the box glad to have unmoving ground under her feet the two came briefly facetoface and fawn smiled brightly why do you keep bothering me said calla through her teeth id like to be friends weve a long road ahead why fawn should feel a maternal regard for a girl five or six years older than herself was hard to explain but she did or maybe not so hard seems im newly interested in happiness for half bloods if you really wanted to increase happiness you wouldnt be making more half bloods snapped calla and strode away fawn blinked a bit discouraged that did not go well yet keep trying she made her way over to the lessprickly indigo who was starting to unharness the mules thinking up some unexceptionable praise for his animal handling as darkness fell dag walked the perimeter of the pasture in pure patroller habit but sensed no danger for a mile in any direction he wandered back to the creek and eased himself down on a rock listening to the gurgle of the water and the munching of the mules copperhead came over and lipped his hair and dag took a moment to impress upon the gelding again that there were to be no random attacks upon his pasture mates tonight magpie being more ladylike needed no such persuasion the two horses wandered away downstream in search of sweeter grass dag became aware that he was being stalked more or less a thin figure approached from the shadows as cautiously as a hunter sneaking up on a bear or a catamount or some other dangerous beast that might turn and rend he sat still and waited before long callas hoarse voice demanded what do you want beg pardon said dag what is it that youll take to leave me and mine alone dags brows drew down missus smith i truly do not understand that question dont make mock of me her voice was sharp but with a quaver at the end he reckoned a year of living with fawn must have made him more fluent in female he could already tell it was going to be one of those conversations maam im not id take it as a privilege to help you out and your brother though its plain youre the more gifted in groundsense someone should have taken you both in hand before this we dont need help we dont need lakewalkers her voice went lower and if possible more bitter lakewalkers dont need us maybe not at moss river but not all lakewalkers think like that what was that test finch was talking aboutweaving your ground into a cord what about it you should have passed her voice went lower still indigo didnt so i didnt dags brows rose you deliberately failed they would have separated us kept me thrown indigo away everyone else had left us one way or another i wasnt going to do that to him not again whose idea was it to go north yours or his or the boys always talked about it but it was just talk after moss river i wanted to get away from everything so bad but it was too dangerous to go by ourselves i had enough magic to make us targets but not enough to protect us we had to have the others we had to seems sensible thinking to me dag said cautiously pleaseher voice brokedont take that away from us dag held his ground open wide in the hopes she might sense he told no lies you talking about that attempt of yours to persuade sage you sensed it a sharpdrawn breath dont touch it you ill give youi dont know what i dont have much money but i can give you some absent gods i dont want your money a long pause ive only got one other thing and from the scrunch in her shoulders not something shed be pleased to part with not to him dag was startled bemused and more than a little offended absent gods no youre young enough to be my daughter you know sos your wife a brittle pause oh full blood you have to be older than you look granddaughter now thats going a mite too far he didnt know whether to laugh or be horrified calla stood rigid it seemed it might be a fixation of yours younger women dag said sternly fawn and i are a long story that you might learn more of if you listen but in the meanwhile dont talk ignorant rubbish fawns earned every bit of loyalty i can give her his voice slowed we have a fair trade going on that way calla flinched it finally clicked in oh gods im slow i take it you believe you magicked young sage into marrying you and taking you and your brother north you know i did lakewalker his family suspected his sister told me to my face sage wouldnt have looked twice at such a horsefaced rack of bones without it dag began to speak hesitated and reversed the order you figure your spell is still holding he hasnt treated you any different the past couple of days it was a safe question there had been a couple of happy grounds in that feather bed just last night together with some faint distinctive creaking from the wagon that sheltered it of course its holding or hed have cast me off by now well no if youd had the training you should have youd know those sorts of persuasions are absorbed over time and have to be renewed to keep working that groundwork of yours faded weeks ago in any case i cleared the last of it out of sage early yesterday a faint cry choked off she quivered like a filly about to bolt stand still dag used his old patrol captains voice she froze rigid straighten up girl and gather the wits you were born with im not saying your initial persuasion didnt cause sage to take a second look at you because i think it likely did but it was what he saw that made him stay he doesnt love you because you magicked him dags voice softened he loves you because youre lovable the kindness nearly broke her as the sternness never would once again dag was reminded of fawn tears laced her gasp but she steadied her breathing and listened oh my she was listening with all her heart now heres your chance old patroller go carefully more to the point he went on sage was never a bit beguiled by you and for the same reason that my groundwork on fawn doesnt beguile her your heart was entirely open to him so your grounds flowed both ways and he never choked on the imbalance so as he loves you and as you like him right well tooand both your grounds prove ittheres not a reason in the wide green world you cant rub along as well or better than any other married couple you could have set your persuasion into any other youth in alligator hat you picked well when you picked sage i think you know that oh though you might care to clear the air with a confession its bound to make it easier between you not to be hiding that useless secret and it will straighten out your ground for your next lessons in groundwork hell hate me welldag scratched his head for showim not saying he wont be a touch unsettled but he knew about your powers before and they didnt scare him off none he might be flattered a tall handsomealarmingolder girl plucks him out from all the other fellows he might even be proud he could tell by her stillness that this was a completely new thought to her and if he has any questions he can bring them to me or arkady i meant it when i said ive helped a passel of youngsters learn to manage their groundsense and trust me some of them were even more thorny than you you may not need moss riverin fact it seems moss river was exactly what you didnt needbut you need someone to show you how to go on shed moved close enough for him to see her her hands clutched her hair but i dont want this these powers then you can choose not to use them but thats not a choice you can make before youve learned to command them until then youll just be blundering around in the dark bumping into things and hurting yourselfand maybe othersthrough ignorance for the first time her silence grew considering and not just frightened i can choose not to be if you learn enough and what i cant teach arkady surely can chance has given you a prize this journey absent gods girl seize it i mean to calla made a faint confused noise and dag explained arkadys my teacher you have a teacher at your age dag chose to ignore the second part of that yes and fawn teaches me too shes taught me more this past year than i imagined possible the whole world teaches me new things every day now that shes made me alive to it again you teach me what do i teach you calla stared in bewilderment what half bloods need to start with i expect there will be more surprises as we go along he rose from his rock gave her his softest salute i can hardly wait good night missus smith uh good night mister bluefield he tracked her trudge back toward her wagon and her waiting husband he was reminded that he had a bedroll warmed by a waiting wife but detoured through the nearby trees a long pale shadow detached itself from a pecan bole as he neared do you think she has the makings of a maker said dag to arkady in some small useful ways undoubtedly i hope you dont mind me volunteering you sir no a shrewd pause all in all that was well done from arkady who was quite capable of prefacing his milder critiques with you gormless hamhanded halfwit this was true praise i hope so sir said dag i surely do over the next few days fawn was heartened to see arkady chatting often with calla riding beside the wagon or even sitting on the box barr helped indigo with the animals with each of the half bloods tucked under a suitable lakewalker wing dag rode alone during fawns fatigue naps she watched him curiously over the tailboard turning that walnut in his hand and brooding over it hes working up to something swampy alligator hat lay over a hundred miles behind them when they first hit rain and even then they only had to pull the wagon out of mire once and warp it across swollen fords with ropes twice coming into the last stretch of farmland south of the barrens ash tanner led them aside some miles for a planned rest at his uncles farm where they were made welcome despite the surprise additions to the party the animals were set to graze for a day and the people turned to topping up their supplies for the pull ahead that afternoon dag and fawn retreated to their bedroll which theyd laid in the most private corner of the tanner barn loftalthough fawn suspected not for the reason their comrades thought they were left strictly alone anyway which likely suited dags purposes just as well climbing down afterward dag led her off to seek out barr and arkady a roof on posts along one side of the barn sheltered a work area free of the misting rain barr had their saddles and bridles up on sawhorses giving them a cleaning if arkady was doing anything besides keeping him company it wasnt apparent to fawn but they did break off some chat as she and dag came around the corner dag set her in front of him hand on her right shoulder wooden wrist cuff resting on her left i need you two a moment he said to the lakewalkers barr set down his brush and rag arkady leaning against a post with his arms crossed lifted his eyebrows what in the world did you do to fawns ground asked barr its all shiny he closed his eyes tofawn supposed see better didnt quite make sense and she surely couldnt feel it but a vague discomfort filled her to be the focus of his uncanny attention as for arkady she didnt even attempt to read the intent stillness of his face well said dag thats what i need you to help me test barr try to plant a persuasion in fawns ground er what kind whatever youre best at it doesnt have to be well shaped thats fortunate murmured arkady dag shot him a quelling look ill lift it right out again if you succeed just anything hesitantly barr approached and started to lay his hand on her breast glanced at dag and prudently moved it up to her collarbone he frowned at the walnut that lay there held by a cord plaited of her hair the walnut was not pierced but trapped in a woven net that continued unbroken into the braid circling her neck huh he said after a moment i can sense her groundshes not really veiledbut the work slides off like rain on a window good dag turned her obediently she shuffled around he dropped his hand away and said now arkady try to groundrip her the way i did you at the camp gate my first day arkady cocked his head and made a short gesture nothing happened he blinked came closer and lifted her hand in his his other finger traced a line across the back fawn felt a twinge like winter sparks in a wool blanket interesting he said in a neutral tone her ground seems to dimple away as i try to grip it dag have we really done it fawn said breathlessly made a ground shield for farmers he sighed uncertainly maybe enough to protect you from ordinary persuasion or beguilement and the sort of groundripping ia person can do but a malice is much more powerful and i dont know how to test for that its not like im going to set you out as bait maybe someoneshe glanced at barrcould get a patrol to take a volunteer farmer out somewhere to try it up north maybe where the malices are thicker or at least try it on their youngsters dag shook his head im still not sure this shield would work on lakewalker grounds theyre too active so try one on barr and find out barr gulped er all right makes sense fawn said its too bad we dont have a lakewalker child to try it on maybe later brightening dag told arkady at least ive half solved the problem of how to turn it off all fawn has to do is remove the necklace and the link to her ground will break thing is shed need me to do all that groundwork over again to link it back to her in the ideal design the farmer would be able to take it on and off at will leastways ive proved the principle of the thing arkady gave him a thoughtful nod i didnt think youd get this far brows tightening he took up fawns hand and stroked it with his finger again she shivered at the prickle now i hesitate to guess how far you can take this dag watched her hand intently that contraction seems to be a natural response of a sort after i was near groundripped by the raintree malice mari said my ground was so tight nobody could get in to help me had to take her word for iti was out cold she said shed never seen anyone look more like a corpse and still breathe even if it doesnt protect farmers from malices it seems it protects them from lakewalkers fawn said like barrs cookpot helmets for real it changes things um she glanced up at barr and arkady what aboutdagssomeone at hickory lake once told me that because farmers couldnt veil their grounds it was like they were walking around naked to lakewalker eyes what is this doing for that and dont be polite she added sharply tell me the truth in ground veilingbarr held up his hand and turned it edge onits like the lakewalkers ground slowly gets thinner and thinner till it vanishes from the inside it looks like the worlds ground does the same like going back to being a child when you couldnt sense at all with this your grounds density is all still there but its like im seeing it under moving water i cant make out the details if you see well being dressed in thin cloth was better than parading around stark fawn nodded satisfaction she wrapped her hand around the walnut what an extraordinary birthday present this is turning out to be should i keep it on she asked dag yes i want to see how long that involution will hold up sharing knives may last a lifetime but lesser work fades sooner thats going to hold awhile i wager said arkady fawn slipped the walnut pendant inside her blouse i wonder how one would work on calla or indigo like on a farmer or like on a lakewalker dags eyes narrowed huh good question spark his gaze strayed to her middle if theyre starting to trust me enough ill ask them to let me try later not now its going to take me some days to recover from this talk to calla before you offer such a shield to sage advised arkady i wouldnt want her to take it amiss ive just about got her taking food from my hand so to speak but shes still nervy he paused its been quite a while since ive instructed a beginner ill give her thisat least she doesnt have any bad training for me to undo dag nodded understanding a sly smile slipped over his mouth and vanished by which fawn guessed he was pleased that arkady was taking his new student seriously over the next days the swampy alligator country fell behind villages grew poorer and farther apart and the road surface deteriorated with fewer bridges and worse fords in places with softer soil the way was beaten down into a broad track between earthen walls that rose higher than their heads farms were replaced by piney woods in the growing heat the trees breathed a delicious and oddly northern smell that made dag smile for no reason fawn could see but she was glad of it nonetheless local traffic thinned out their only company on the road became others sharing the long haul more folks were headed north than south what with the rivers disgorging their travelers onto the trace at graymouth they passed gangs of flatboat men walking home and were passed by speedier horse pack trains including some lakewalker kin carrying trade between camps they played leapfrog with that tea caravan for days and when fawn dag and barr proved conversant in river talk ended up getting to know some of the muleteers by name the last village before the barrens going north or the first after coming south guarded a ropecranked ferry a smaller version of those fawn had seen up on the grace the crowd trying to cross at the riverbank held them up for half a day on the other side the road climbed again the piney woods grew more ragged and sad then thinned out into scrubland inhabited only by mice hawks rabbits and wild pigs the shadeless stretches turned headachehot roadside camping spots with both water and grazing became harder to find as prior travelers beasts of burden had eaten the scanty fodder far back from the road two days into the barrens and their novelty had worn off for fawn to be replaced by her nausea of pregnancy this lasted till she fled from the campfire one morning to retch in the bushes and arkady with an incredibly smug smirk produced a bottle of that lakewalker stomach medicine from his pack he only made dag grovel a little for it in the evenings arkady took dag aside for maker groundprojection and sensitivity drills and dag retaliated by making barr and arkady do patroller groundveiling drills the results of the latter left dag frowning one evening they camped with some friendly flatboat boys who knew the clearcreeks and exchanged much river gossip including garbled accounts of the gruesome events at crooked elbow which dag fawn and barr tried to amend dag treated a flatboat boys sore foot and seized the chance for his beginner lecture on lakewalkers fawn wasnt sure which of these left arkady rubbing his forehead but at least it was a thoughtful rub the lack of grazing proved worse than the company had anticipated and the feed grain theyd so prudently packed along from the tanner farm ran low then out but late one afternoon ash whose turn it was to scout ahead came cantering back all excited the fertile valley he described seemed too good to be true but a few miles farther on at a dip where a river ran between high rocky walls and around a bend they found a broad sweep of meadow flecked by wildflowers that glowed like green glass in the leveling light dozens of dogwoods lit up the woods like white flower fountains new leaves fawn realized werent just pale green but shades of bronze and copper red both people and animals greeted the sight with the same joyful sigh this bliss lasted till sage who had gone into the woods bordering the bluffs to gather firewood came bolting back out waving his bloodied ax in the air and screaming snakes hundreds of em and theyre all rattlers fawn about to unsaddle magpie scrambled back aboard and pulled up her toes what there cant be hundreds objected finch snakes dont travel in herds sage you just panicked yeah how many did you really see said ash two three although he prudently unshipped another longhandled ax from his pack actually said dag slowly wheeling about and scanning the rocky slopes disturbed and attentive silence fell broken only by sages panting everyones faces turned to follow dag like beguiled mice there are hundreds dag continued those ledges up there are full of snake dens they coil up in snake balls to get through the cold times see theyre all just coming out of their winter sleep finch swung abruptly up onto the drivers box next to calla you can get up to a couple of hundred rattlesnakes at a time in the bigger dens dag went on blithely indigo looked in longing at the rich grass all the tired hungry animals had their heads down tearing at it we could all hole up in the wagon i guess butwould they bite the mules and horses they might dag said more usually theyd just slither off but with so many so thick around here an accident becomes more likely cant you lakewalkers like persuade them to stay away asked fawn nervously if you can summon your horses cant you um unsummon snakes ash raised his ax if we all worked together i bet we could clear them out of here permanent arkady remarked as if to the air the most common snakebite victims ive treated are young men beer is frequently involved mostly the bites are on the arms but one fellow managed to get bitten on his ear and one well i trust it happened in his bedroll because it would have taken a great deal of beer to account for it otherwise bedroll said fawn snakes are attracted to body heat dag explained they like to cuddle up with you under your blankets in snake country patrollers learn to wake up very carefully yeah muttered barr especially if there are other patrollers around a white grin flickered over dags mouth that didnt reassure fawn one bit their bedroll would be laid out on the grass tonight dag it wasnt loud enough to be a wail exactly but it was quite pitiable nonetheless he gave up some inner vision which she resolved not to ask about till they were miles from here and motioned to barr and arkady come on lets show these farmer boys and girls a patroller snake drive arkady sighed in a must i sort of way but didnt argue when dag assigned him to the other side of the little river he picked and waded his way across and trudged up the opposite slope calla indigoyou want to learn how to do this no said calla and um said her brother it might be a good trick to know if you ever get snakes on your porch or under your house before your children find em dag remarked an arrested look came over callas long face after a brief silence she nodded and joined dag after another moment indigo trod reluctantly after barr sage gulped gripped his ax and followed calla dags voice faded in the distance rising and falling in his patrolleader lecture cadence as he led them upstream and angled into the woods fawn stayed atop magpie if i ever find snakes on my porch ill yell for dag she decided firmly she couldnt spot them at first but she could see the grass quiver here then there then over there then seemingly everywhere and she could hear the rustling growing louder then at the waters edge sinuous diamondpatterned forms in brown and dirty white appeared thick spadeshaped heads questing first in ones and twos and then in tangled dozens the rattlesnakes slid into the churning water and were swept downstream swirling in clotted mats like tangled branches on the opposite bank arkadys snakes approached in neat ranks of ten across and entered the water in a synchrony that unfortunately broke up as soon as they encountered the rocks and dags snakes dag and arkady called rather rude critiques upon each others snakeherding styles across the water the important part fawn decided was that they were all going away dag barr and arkady and their reluctant apprentices moved down the valley in a wide ragged line passing out of sight around the rivers curve in about an hour they all came trudging back the rest of the company had finally unsaddled the horses and unharnessed the mules a task somewhat impeded by the big sticks everyone was carrying mules may safely graze dag announced cheerfully by the time those poor snakes get out of the water theyll be chilled through and then nightfall will keep em sluggish it should take them a few days to find their way home again barr put his hands on his hips stared down the valley into the setting sun and shook his head you know if anyones camping downstream of us theyre going to be in for quite a surprise to give the animals time to graze their fill they made a late start from what fawn now thought of as rattlesnake vale she was grateful to be on the road before any of the wet and surly inhabitants returned as the day wore on she could see that they were finally passing out of the barrens streams grew more common and trees taller and more abundant climbing out of the watercourses to crown the heights once more there were no farms as yet though dag said roving herders brought their flocks up for spring grazing a debatable country the southerners called it northern and the northerners called it southern another day dag assured her and the trace would begin its long descent toward the valley of the hardboil river the largest eastern tributary of the great gray south of the grace after that theyd soon reach the ferryand beyond dag promised her green mountains like vast rolling waves fawn stayed awake on magpie all that afternoon just for the excitement of the thought they passed their first crossroad for a hundred miles and soon after that another plainly rutted with wagonwheel tracks riding ahead between arkady and dag so as to eat the least road dust fawn spotted the return of local traffic a few riders and walkers not burdened with camping gear a farm wagon or two a man a boy and dogs with some sheep the passersby stared and a few times glared back and fawn was reminded that not everyone might be as friendly toward a mixed party of farmers and lakewalkers as the rivermen had proved like the rivers the road passed through places yet was apart from them no ones native country and everyones a space where strangers had to get along with one another will or nil fawn was suggesting they ought to send barr ahead with finch tonight to scout for their campsite just in case when arkady turned in his saddle coming up around the wagon at an easy lope was a pair of rangy lakewalker mounts their riders were probably partners fawn thought couriers perhaps you couldnt tell a patroller man from a patroller woman at a distance by their clothes but as they neared fawn saw they were one each both fit and tall with hair in single braids the woman wore a long dark leather coat loosely open in the warmth split up the back for riding her black braid swung behind her still as thick as fawns arm where it was cut off bluntly to clear her cantle her partners braid only made it past his shoulders thinning to a sad tail at the end the womans face turned curiously toward them as their horses blew past she had the coppery skin of a true northerner and her eyes flashed gold great hair murmured arkady dag stared too fawn wondered if either man had even noticed the fellow i know that coat dag stood in his stirrups staring harder could it be he raised his hand to his mouth and bellowed sumac the woman reined in her mount so hard it nearly squatted on its haunches wheeling around in almost the same stride she too stood up in her stirrups dag switched his reins over and waved his hook the womans gold eyes widened in an equally startled voice she yelled back uncle dag dag grinned as his niece trotted back to him and pulled up her mount he gave copperheads rein a sharp yank as the gelding attempted to snap now be nice to the family old fellow redwings are too rare to waste sumacs eyes gleamed with laughter i see you still have that awful horse i see you still have my awful coat it actually fit her less loosely than it had her older brother years back but then dars eldest had been a skinny pup during his youthful stint in the patrol it had then descended through sumac to her younger brother dag had thought it lost you bet i do i made wyn give it back soon as he got home from his final exchange youll like thislook she twisted around in her saddle and lifted her thick braid see that scratch across the back is that new it was dyed red barely visible against the black leather bout a year old my patrol ambushed a malice just going off sessile above eagle falls one of its mudmen yanked a boar spear away from one of my patrollers which i made him eat much dirt about lateryoud have been proud the spear point would have gone straight in and out my chest wall and just ruined my new shirt but instead it skittered across my back i let it knock me the rest of the way down and came up rolling then got inside the swing with my knife and did for the mudman very tidy dag concealed the skip in his heartbeat and gave this tale a proper deathshead patroller grin she had not told this story at home or he would have heard about it before this with reproaches first time that ratty old garment paid for itself i do believe after all those years of carting it around they were interrupted as the wagon rolled past dag waved on a concernedlooking sage and calla and the boys with the pack animals as well barr stared over his shoulder handed his pack string off to ash and came trotting back to them fawns eyes were wide looking across dags saddlebow at tall sumac is that your old magic coat that was supposed to turn arrows dag sumacs gaze flicked with equal curiosity toward little fawn ive not tried arrows rain and spears definitely ive become very attached to it tatters and all i paid torri beaver a pot of coin to renew the groundwork when last i was home though she offered to make me a new one for not much more i had her leave the scratch in for bragging rights er you dont want it back do you uncle dag not me you keep it my patrolling days are done sumac rolled back in her saddle fine lips pursing doubt replacing the merriment in her slitted eyes in truth i hardly recognized your ground i hardly do recognize it well its been what over a year since we crossed paths when were you home last this fall just about a month after you left i was told so youve heard about um everything and in so many different versions her voice slowed so is this your infamous farmer bride uncle dag dag lowered his eyelids let them rise sumac redwing hickory meet fawn bluefield my wife you may observe our marriage cords if you please sumac turned her head blinked twice it seems dirla and fairbolt were right about those she could have said it seems papa and grandmama were right about those dag breathed relief or maybe sumac was just being polite he trusted that her past few years as a patrol leader under fairbolt crow had taught her a little more leaderly tact however much she scorned the mealymouthed making me dag bluefield ah nocamp at present he went on her black brows quirked but she let that pass somissus bluefieldi guess that makes you my aunt fawn eh the two young women regarded each other in mutual contemplation of this absurdity sumac shook her head uncle dag who would have guessed and after another moment what in the world is wrong with her ground nothing its a little experiment of mine a ground shield for farmers groundwork you its a long tale fawn put in dags studying to be a medicine maker arkady here is teaching him hes a real respected groundsetter from the south sumacs astonished lips shaped the word medicine arkady touched his temple in an almost daglike salute arkady waterbirch new moon cutoff at your service hed been almost expressionless listening to all this family gossip but now his lips lifted a trifle maker waterbirch sumac returned a courteous nod looking deeply bemused barr cleared his throat and barr from pearl riffle camp up on the grace dag supplied barrs um with me barr smiled sunnily most young men did when first exposed to sumac most all men did actually the tears came later sumac nodded all around and introduced her partner or follower and this is rase from new elm camp i took a returning exchange patroller down to new elm last fall then stayed on a bit to help train their youngsters rase here is coming back with me to hickory for his first exchange im looking forward to meeting the famous fairbolt crow rase confided to dag dag quelled the impulse to say something unnerving and chose instead youll be made welcome we send out far more patrollers than we ever get back we how easily that old habit of speech slipped in fairbolt will also work your tail off but itll be good for you so im hoping sir rase nodded earnestly blight but trainee patrollers were getting younger every year dags halfopened groundsense noted a primed knife in the boys saddlebags at least hed come prepared about to turn and lead them out onto the road again dag followed fawns arrested look to sumacs knee and noticed for the first time a bouquet of a couple of dozen fresh rattlesnake skins hanging from her saddlebagsto dry presumably a similar lashing hung on the other side tails down free to swing and rattle interestingly as she rode barr choked arkady twitched his brows dag resolved not to be the first to break down and ask indigo came cantering back to them dag are you coming or should we wait for you or what dag waved at him were coming sumacs eyes lifted to the receding greenpainted wagon youre with them she said but theyre farmers its another long story well be making camp sooncare to join us she glanced at her partner and up the long road ahead wed planned to reachnever mind of course i wouldnt miss this tale for anything dag let fawn introduce herabsent godsnew niece and rase to indigo who rode off to let the others know what was happening barr fell behind to talk with rase not much younger than himself dag sumac fawn and arkady rode abreast at an easy walk its actually your fault i spent the winter at new elm uncle dag sumac confided to him oh and me so not there she grinned when has that ever stopped anyone from blaming you no it was your marriage adventure did it of course grandmamas been pressing me forever to bring home a husband to help prop up the tent and you know how much she loves me being in the patrol dag nodded full understanding at this last sarcasm of all his sins inspiring his niece to stay in the patrol was the one that most irked his family and he hadnt even done it on purpose lately even papas been wading in on her side or at least not on mine not that he ever was on mine but youll never guess who put in the next oar omba with her elder son safely stringbound and her two younger children apprenticed to makers and happily courting dag hadnt thought his tentsister would be quite so concerned of course not mama you know when redwings start to argue she just ducks out and goes to pet her horses its likely how she survived all these years it was fairbolt fairbolt sumac shook her head at this defection i was joking around with him about when the next company captain place would open upwell half joking half angling you know the way it is when youre trying to get information out of fairboltand he flat out told me id be a shooin for itas soon as i returned to the patrol from my childyears then he went on about massape and greataunt mari ah said dag without you to hide behind it seems im the new prime target for the redwing matchmakers well you are destined to be the next head of tent redwing she jerked her chin making her heavy braid swing shouldnt that be mama im afraid cumbias always thought of your mama as a sort of placeholder ive long plotted that when grandmama passes ill change my name back to waterstrider just to show her although i suppose it couldnt show her anything by then from the far right of the row the intently listening arkady made an inquiring noise fawn turned her head to him and put in helpfully dags mama cumbia only had the two boys dar and dag she persuaded omba waterstrider to change her name to redwing when she married dar sos shed have a girl to carry on her tent it was sort of like an adoption i reckon sumac shook her head mama being the youngest of six girls theres no shortage of waterstriders at hickory lake camp i have about a thousand waterstrider cousins and grandmamas good for another forty years just for stubbornness i guess by which time i likely wont care but she does make me so mad sometimes uncle dag never could do anything right for her not that he wanted to discourage one of his few partisans but dag groped for his supposed maturity and managed cumbia never had an easy life nor very rewarding or not the rewards she wanted sumac shrugged and sighed i know oh feh of all the ways grandmama makes me crazy the worst is when i end up going on about her like this dont listen dag you and me both youngin howre cattagus and mari he asked to put her at her ease again she brightened still wheezing and bickering i love greatuncle cattagus ill give fairbolt this if i could make a marriage like mari and cattagus or like massape and him it wouldnt seem half bad so um said fawnit would be fawnwhered you get all those snake skins sumac sumacs eyes sprang wide and if that wasnt the strangest thing id ever seen wed taken a short cut across the barrens to reach the trace and went to ford a river and found all these drowned snakes halfdrowned snakes came a bitter voice from behind dag glanced over his shoulder at rase who seemed to be reminded of some grudge i told you to use your groundsense said sumac entirely without sympathy anyway we stopped to collect as many as we could the skins will fetch us some useful coin at the ferry i figure rase put in it had us in a puzzle how all those rattlers came to be washed up there i wondered if thered been a flash flood but sumac said there was no other sign of it the barrens are a queerer place than id thought he shook his head in wonder dag smiled benignly camp that night was lively with the exchange of tales dag eventually confessed to the snakes to dags relief fawn and barr took up much of the burden of explaining raintree and their river journey sumac had less to offer but her words seemed just as exotic to the entranced farmer boys describing a quiet winter patrolling out of new elm a camp some forty miles west of the trace that covered most of the territory between the barrens and the hardboil rase had been a trainee in her patrol and showed every sign of the usual hopeless infatuation sumac tended to engender in young men dag did not waste pity on his plight if he was any goodand she wouldnt be taking him back to fairbolt if he werent one of the younger crow girls would doubtless make short work of him one way or another the boy might never see his home camp again dag stifled a grin watching his niece across the flickering firelight dag found himself curiously unsettled she was like a breath of bracing northern air to him a song of his lost home he did not regret his exile one glance at fawn was still enough to lift his heart near into his throat in wonder hed cut off the weight of his past like shearing through a towrope and he had no desire to drag that barge again but yet still sumac threw curiously unsettled glances back ever since dag had returned from luthlia maimed and strange when she was rising fifteen shed made a bit of a hero of her only redwing uncle unlike neeta she had few illusions about himshed surely seen him at his worst many timesbut everyone in the family knew shed chosen the patrol over the knifemaking apprenticeship her father had offered because of him all her adult life hed been the same dry patroller fellow the one kinsman who never criticized her choices as solidly planted as her favorite tree she could not have been more startled if a hickory tree had risen up shaken the dirt from its roots and run off with a farmer girl leaving whatever hammock end shed had tied to him lying forlorn upon the ground despite any confusion in her heart she was polite and even friendly to fawn as the tales of malices and river bandits medicine making and walnut magery wound on dag trusted she realized fawn was his partner not his pet she managed choked but sincere congratulations at the news of their impending child and a wholly sincere gleam of evil delight that was pure sumac when she said i cant wait to tell them at home when dag made his habitual bedtime patrol of their camps perimeter that night arkady fell in beside him in a voice remarkably neutral even for him arkady said interesting woman your niece she is that how old is she dags brows rose hed thought arkady shrewder at estimating folks ages than anyone hed ever met let me think i was about twentytwo when she was born because it was the year i was patrolling up on the great north road so she must be um almost thirtyfive now shes dars secondborn see her arrival was greeted with much relief and rejoicing in tent redwing i can tell you ombas credit with our mama rose immensely she does not appear to be stringbound no betrothed not as far as i know one wonders why not no tragedies im not sure she would have said shes certainly had serious suitors omba calls them the string of bodies dag could feel arkadys slow blink in the darkness dag set aside a truly overwhelming temptation to tease arkady and said seriously youre a subtle man when it comes to folks insides if you can figure it out and tell us tent redwing would be grateful ive patrolled with her a time or two she doesnt hate men she doesnt prefer girls granted her first few dewy suitors were crushed by dar but they werent up to her weight anyway after that she kept em out of sight naturally naturally the family stopped worrying that shed make a mistake some time back now i suspect the family has started wondering if even a mistake might be better than nothing to think omba would know was unjust sumacs parents were loyal to each other even if dar was a difficult man shes more of a puzzle than she looks at first glance yep rather like her uncle that way hm arkady wandered off into the darkness dag watched him go hm indeed a cracking thunderstorm blowing in hard just before dawn ended their nice dry spell by the time everyone turned out to settle the spooked animals and recapture windscattered gear gray daylight arrived but it wasnt till midmorning that they set off through the trailing drizzle blearyeyed fawn let dag talk her into riding inside the wagon he and barr were protected in the boatmens rain cloaks fawn had fashioned back on the fetch at least the boiling brown creeks in this more settled country were mostly bridged again fawn wasnt sure whether to be surprised or not that sumac and her partner elected to trail along with them at the wagons pace just till the ferry sumac rode between dag and arkady chatting animatedly whenever the rain eased fawn supposed she and dag had a lot of catching up to do arkady didnt seem to be saying much but he didnt come up on the wagon box at all that day to continue callas lessons edged out of the prime spots at sumacs stirrups by their seniors barr and rase trailed a trifle disconsolately but camp that night was not nearly the sodden misery fawn expected because finch and indigo scouted out a rundown barn that its owner let to benighted trace travelers the roof leaked and the old boards thrummed in the gale but it beat huddling together under the wagon all hollow the clouds broke up into a humid pale heat by the next noon as they came to the edge of the hardboil valley quite as wide as that of the grace the shining ribbon of river wound through springgreen woods and fields that steamed with the recent rains as they slithered carefully down the muddy road fawn caught her first glimpses of the ferry town which bore the arresting name of mutton hash and of the ferry itself which seemed to be the familiar flat barge hauled from shore to shore by a ropewound capstan but here two big boats worked in parallel one coming while the other was going the water was wider than fawn had imagined over half a mile and mutton hash the biggest settlement shed seen for weeks not a mere village but a lively river town as they neared she could make out boatbuilders and goods sheds hotels and liveries brewers bakers smiths a ropewalk tanneries and horse dealers and she marveled at how comfortably familiar it all seemed to her now there was also she discovered as they arrived near the riverbank a line for the ferry backed up for two blocks besides local wagons riders and a lot of foot traffic the entire fortymule tea caravan had somehow got ahead of them again such a clot seemed to be an expected thing because the way down to the landing was lined with booths and hawkers selling food drink and goods to the bored and waiting travelers fawn stood in her stirrups and sniffed inviting smells meat pies funnel cakes beer honeyed tea sounds toosomeone was playing a fiddle quite as well as berry did quick and sweet the fiddler started an old river song the music dancing high and low and fawns heart caught she kicked magpie closer the fiddler was a lean tall woman standing on a stump to the side of the road elbow sawing her blond hair drawn back in a lank horsetail shining in the sun berry shrieked fawn in astonishment berry looked up and grinned across the heads of the crowd clustered around her seized a breath before a repeat to whip her bow through the air in greeting and continued with her tune she looked much less surprised than fawn felt hawthorn stood at her feet holding out bos shapeless felt hat when he craned his neck and spotted fawn he plunked the hat down between his sisters tapping toes and elbowed his way toward her by the time he arrived shed slid from her saddle and was able to give him a heartfelt hug which he didnt even shrug off in boy embarrassment oh my hes taller than me what are you doing here fawn demanded waiting for you partly mostly waiting for whit to finish fussing with his little pack train what pack train is everyone all right oh sure cept my raccoon eloped halfway up the gray hawthorn frowned in memory of this defection fawn didnt think there was any oh sure about it but she gave up the urge to shake him as berry finished her tune and cried lunch break try mama flintridges dried peach pies over there best in the valley she jumped off the stump stuffed her fiddle in its leather bag grabbed the hat and passed through the throng to fawn collecting a few more coins on the way the hugs this time were mutual berry sis you made it we figured if we were going to cross paths at all this would be the place wheres whit and the others berry swung an arm toward the river he has a day job working the capstan on one ferryboat and hods on the other bos keeping an eye on our horses and gear at a place across the river farther from the taverns dag and barr dismounted and made their way to berry rather more easily than fawn had in time to hear this folks glanced at the tall lakewakers and edged back mostlythen stared openmouthed when they exchanged happy hugs with the grinning fiddler how did you all end up here asked fawn i thought youd taken berths on a keelboat bound for tripoint we did and i do believe upstream keelboat hauling was a shock to whithed thought he worked hard on a farm anyways our fool boat boss managed to get his hull stove in by a floater just above the mouth of the hardboil we made it to shore and worked back to the village there but it was plain that boat wasnt going anywhere for some time not to mention wed lost half its lading to the wet well we heard there that the ice hadnt even broke up yet on the upper grace but the hardboil was clear so we found berths on another keel headed up to mutton hash that being as high as we could get by boat mutton hash marked the head of navigation for the hardboil river the trace crossed the hardboil not by chance fawn guessed just below some thirty miles of impassable shoals and rapids the hazard that gave the whole river its name legend had it there had once been a bridge and a city upstream at a narrow high point but both were fallen into the mists of time buried by the encroaching woods fawn nodded whit always was divided in his mind between the river and the road berry continued this way he gets some of both i was agreeable because i figure itll cut three or four weeks off the trip home if were to build another flatboat before the fall rise well need that time might we get there in time to plant a kitchen garden too did you get the letter i sent you in graymouth yep thanks you didnt come all this way just on the chance of meeting us did you because we werent sure till the last wed even be coming home this year no but weve been keeping a lookout all the same we knew from asking at the ferry that you two hadnt passed ahead of usdag is memorable all by himself and when the pair of you are together folks notice i wont say we havent been lingerin a bit in hope but i want to start north soon before your brother buys any more horses she made a face the ferry pulled into the landing with shouts and a rumble as the gangplank was laid out walkers and wagons heaved up the slope and the crowd shifted as the new passengers hurried to take their place while some of the tea caravans younger and less jaded mules were taking exception to their offered boat ride hawthorn dashed down to tell whit about the arrivals whit came thumping up grinning like mad hugged fawn and wrung dags hand you made it hoped you might hey i bet i could squeeze you on right now thanks but were not alone said dag were traveling with some other folks young homesteaders theirs is that green wagon up there sage is a blacksmith going to look for work in tripoint fawn added even better bring them along i have so much to show you whit glanced back at the filling ferry a big fellow guarding the gangplank clearly the ferry boss was glowering after him but i have to go back to work now cant quit in the middle of a day it wouldnt be right ill talk to you more when you get aboard unless you end up on hods boat and then hell tell you all about it berry or hawthorn will take you to our digs i guess wheres remo barr stiffened a little he stayed at new moon whit blinked oh why there was this girl said fawn as the simplest answer which had to suffice as the ferry boss followed up his glower with a bellow whit waved and ran back to the boat whit seemed both changed and unchanged he was definitely broader in the shoulders he plainly retained his sometimesalarming enthusiasm for the new if his ability to stick with a tough job to the end was improved by his marriage so much the better as dag led them all over to introduce berry and hawthorn to the company fawn decided to save her most important family news for some less crowded moment whits ferry slogged all the way across the river and back again before their turn came to clamber aboard fawn thought the boat rode alarmingly low in the water when the ferry boss finally slid the gate pole across whit and the southern boys seemed to become instant comrades whit because he was a friendly cuss and the others because theyd heard so much about him that it likely felt they already knew one another despite their growing up not thirty miles from the gray the hardboil was the largest river some of them had yet seen and they were agog with it under the ferry bosss amused eye they were permitted a few turns on the fourman capstan dags attention was mainly taken keeping copperhead from picking a fight with all the strange horses jammed up around them some of the other travelers eyed the lakewalkers suspiciously but the ferrymen evidently saw enough of their sort as to excite no comment at least not out loud well sumac drew covert stares but if any of the men were thinking rude thoughts the lakewalkers doubtless kept their groundsenses furled in this crowd and so could take no offense as she led magpie across the echoing gangplank onto the northern shore fawn thought with a thrill were halfway home dag was unsurprised when berry led them two miles off the trace to another farm with a dilapidated barn cheaper to let because it was not so near the road it offered good pasturage though important as their mob of hungry animals joined the six horses that whit had acquired since whit had started this whole venture with a mere pair and the clothes on his back it seemed good progress except for his new beasts being near breakdowns yet on closer look his selections were shrewd most of the animated racks of bones needed no more than worm medication rest and grain which whit had already supplied a couple showed signs of prior abuse now stitched patched and plastered all mares whit when he arrived from the ferry at sunset pointed out to dag by the time we get to clearcreek ill know which ones i want to cull and which i want to keep for breeding dyou think mamas colt darkling might be ready to cover them by next fall a light of equine enterprise shone in whits eye whit was ecstatic to find that sage was an experienced farrier and the two promptly put their heads together on a problem of corrective shoeing for one of the mares the companys animals being overdue for a rest they also obtained an extra day of pasturage and shelter from the farms owner in exchange for a promise to shoe one of his horses it seemed to dag that an uneven burden had fallen on sage but the young smith was willing and the other boys all turned out to help him as best they could hes not afraid to get his hands dirty was praise for a man whether northern or southern arkady was let off from any ragging about his cleanliness when he supplied value by doing ground checks of all the new acquisitions to sort the serious from the remediable problems as a result whit took one of his mares back to the mutton hash market the following morning and returned with a different one so it was late in the afternoon before whit whipped out his newest prize to show off it was a crossbow with a spring steel bow and a cranking mechanism for cocking the work of some tripoint artisan i got it in trade from a brokedown keeler back on the gray whit explained eagerly turning it in his hands to point out its notable features which seemed to be all of them the farmer boys were drawn to it as swiftly as if it were fresh apple pie everyone wanted to try it at once except sage who wanted to take it apart and see if he could copy the mechanisms an operation whit was unwilling to allow just yet i only have seven bolts for it whit explained i used to have eight but i lost one already not having a lakewalker around to help me find the misses he made a sad face fawn frowned turning one of the short steeltipped bolts in her hand i guess i couldnt make arrows for this bow i suppose sage might oh hey actually i was hoping you would make me some wooden ones for practice bolts that is i dont want to lose any more of the fancy steelhead ones just on target practice fawn brightened a trifle sure i could try anyhow the mob of them went off to set up a target at the end of the pasture then retreated to shooting distance to flip a coin for turns the lakewalkers leaned on the pasture fence watching at least till the first frenzy wore off as the rattle of the ratchet rose in the air dag could tell that barr rase and sumac were all itching to try out the new toy arkady was less impressed its rather crude the range is short and the firing rate is slow a lakewalker bow maker could craft a much finer one dag pursed his lips a lovely unbreakable longbow yesin about two weeks plus a week to recover but ive seen those tripoint artisans shops once they were set up for it they could likely turn out one of those crossbows in a day more than one if they organized their hands arkady sniffed quick and cheap yeah but if they can turn out twenty to our one it wouldnt matter if a few broke or didnt work quite square they could just swap out and still be miles ahead and thats no poor instrument as it standsits as good a working as my cuff bow which has held up for years with just minor repairs dag considered his specially adapted bow crafted to bolt into his wrist cuff in place of his hook which had turned him into a tolerable archer again after his maiming and his tripointmade arm harness generally which had gifted him back his life as a patroller he dug in his pocket found a copper cray and handed the coin to arkady look closely at this arkady mystified accepted it if you found this somewhere not knowing what it was how would you judge the metalwork well the raised image of the crayfish is actually quite fine and the lettering of course so tiny but clear to readarkady squintedsilver shoals city mint one cray and making things perfectly round is harder than it looks i suppose aye yet when we all visited the mint at silver shoals back when we were coming downriver on the fetch we saw the machine that stamps these out a hundred at a time one of these disks is a little work of art tens of thousands of em become farmer magic arkady raised his brows dag plowed on theyre counters memories of trade and labor that a man can put in his pocket and carry across a continent they make things move with my groundsense i can summon my horse from a mile away with enough of these the folks at silver shoals can summon a fortymule tea caravan from eight hundred miles away and the ground density and complexity of a big river city like silver shoals is a making in its own right you see a farmer town as a making said barr his forehead wrinkling at this new thought i do what about a lakewalker camp then that too of course arkady made to hand the coin back dag grinned and said keep it theres plenty more where that came from he paused a moment to contemplate the ratcheting thwack and laughter of the crossbow practice and his smile faded now imagine a city like silver shoals or tripoint turning out those crossbows the way they turn out coins and putting them into the hands of thousands of farmer boys like ours over there and now imagine a city like that and all those boys and all their bows falling into the grip of a malice blight you dont even have to imagine i saw the raintree lakewalkers last summer put on the run by a bunch of farmers even less well organized and equipped than that the raintree malice was wasting its farmer troops right and left from not knowing how to handle em yet but it would have learned better if wed given it more time sumac leaned forward on the fence to tilt her face at him eyes cool and shrewd huh so there was more of a bee up your butt when you left hickory lake than just the way the tent redwing treated your farmer bride wasnt there uncle dag arkady winced at the crude but vivid turn of phrase but by the tightening of his mouth it was plain that he followed the argument i wouldnt have learned that from papa sumac went on he made out you were just besotted i think fairbolt gave me a hint there was more to it and so did mari fairbolt and i talked about the wider problems just before i left said dag he understood the shape of the world is shifting under us and we cant go on standing still and not fall finding our new footing wont be a task for one man to finish but its surely a task one man can start he took a breath i dont know if im doing the right thing but i do know im walking in the right direction rase hadnt said a word but he was listening at least that spring peepers the noisiest frog per half inch that dag knew of had taken up their earsplitting chorus in the farms woodlot and pond when he rounded the corner of the barn to make his bedtime patrol he stopped short when whit called unexpectedly over the racket wait up dag his tentbrother a lantern swinging from his hand fell in beside him whit cocked his head listening to the peepers maybe i could stuff cotton in my ears tonight im sure glad i didnt have to court berry by squatting with my naked tail in a puddle and screaming for hours till she took pity on me dag choked on a laugh you just had to put that picture in my head didnt you maybe thats why the lady peepers pick their mates to shut them up that makes a persuasive sort of sense you know dag started forward once more only to stop again when whit said dagdoes fawn seem a little peaked to you not quite her usual cheerful self concerned dag turned to face him does she seem so to you seeing her every day i might not notice subtler changes and of course her ground is so bright and busy right now with its making it tends to overwhelm everything else id thought she was holding up real well all things considered but if you think not maybe i should huh said whit making didnt she tell you yet tell me what well dag supposed he had an equal right to this announcement were expecting a childwould it be coaxing lumps from fate to say our first childin the early winter fawn says shes hoping itll be around my birthday though i think that might be a bit early whit stepped back a pace eyes and mouth both wide before he laughed in astonishment hey ill be an uncle and berry will be an aunt how about that oh i cant wait to tell them at home his black brows drew in wait a minute what of all those tricks you were telling me about before berry and i got married for delaying things dag hoped whit couldnt see the heat in his cheeks in this dimness well nobody said they were perfect tricks accidents happen even to lakewalkers you know i guess i was um distracted whit blight him sniggered dag ignored him with what dignity he could muster and trod off once more whit tagging after well if shes increasing that accounts for it said whit sounding satisfied to have his mystery solved shorttempered too i bet heh not noticeably dag growled they walked on in silence for a few moments after that an accident or accidentally on purpose dag hoped his own mind wasnt playing tricks on him to that extent what threat had new moon cutoff offered him after all to make him want to claim his wife so irrevocably at just that moment a threat of ease he had to admit the offer of a life like arkadys gentle protected usefulness was a real temptation as much for the usefulness as for the protection but not there not in the south dag counted time in his head all those weeks and miles gone by already and the tiny fire within fawns womb had not faded or faltered but had clung with dogged sparklike determination maybe itll be a girl he allowed himself to think strong like her mama maybe it was finally safe to let himself start thinking of that new spark as a real person original and astonishing maybe oh my heart it almost hurt to have it stretched so far beyond its formersafe secret shriveledboundaries yet by whatever chance they had arrived he was not sorry to be on this road five days later dag was rethinking that belief it hadnt been wrong merely much too simpleminded this was nothing like the northward leg hed pictured back when he and fawn had left hickory lakea vision that actually took him some effort to recalljust the two of them a lingering spring and plenty of bedroll time together yet the whole point of this journey had been to put fresh pictures in their heads because the old ones hadnt seemed up to the new tasks they faced he could hardly complain because his scheme was working to excess he turned in his saddle to look back over the cavalcade sixteen people and twentyfive animals made nearly a fullsize patrol without a patrols training he wasnt quite sure how hed been elected patrol leader still his old system of giving as few orders as possible because every time you did people would come to expect them and then badger for them and then grow too stiff to move without them seemed to apply here as well this disparate clump of folks was blending better than hed hoped the river crew was used to frequent dealings with strangers which helped ease the less traveled alligator hat boys sumac accepted the bluefields as her esteemed uncles tentkin with barely a bump and rase wouldnt dare say boo to her so that settled him arkady kept his own counsel as usual but dag knew he was taking it all in berry calla and fawn had swiftly formed a sisterhood and it was only now after watching them pass tasks smoothly from hand to hand helping one another and laughing together over various female jokes that dag realized how painfully isolated fawn had been at new moon cutoff the medicine tent had tolerated her for dags sake but not one lakewalker woman there had truly taken her up to teach her the ways of their inner world which led him to a very unexpected contemplation of sumac as odd woman out in this company neither farmer woman nor patroller man maybe that was why she rode so often beside oddman arkady but fawns eyes wide with wonder as the company climbed day by day up into the true mountains made his every effort worth it the hillsides tilted up higher and steeper until she noted with a flatlanders alarm the sky had shrunk by half as if stolen away tiny rivulets trickled over cliffs to fall like spun thread into secret crevices lined with pink splashes of mountain laurel fern fiddleheads unfurled into delicate fronds around dark and abundant springs green anklehigh umbrella apples sheltered spring beauties and bloodroot and the white and pink trillium after which fawns mother had been named cascaded in waves down the slopes all familiar northern wildflowers that made her smile in recognition i finally see why you wouldnt let us call those hills around glassforge mountains she told dag there are mountains up in northeast seagate even bigger than these dag said so tall its winter on top all year round and the snow and ice never melt off youre pulling my leg said finch nope seen it with my own eyes said dag floating up all white against the blue summer sky the peaks and ridges like something out of a dream i wonder if you could make a trade in that ice said whit thoughtfully pack it down in the summer and sell it to folks it would be a lot of work climbing a mountain that high said fawn in doubt and ice is heavy maybe it could be slid down somehow actually said dag folks in those parts cut ice from their ponds in the winter and store it in cellars packed in straw it lasts longer than youd think that sounds a bit more practical said fawn huh said whit the things you learn travelin i might try that at home once hed carefully described what they would be up against dag let the farmer boys sort themselves out to tackle the first big mountain pass that dawn the four pack animals were unloaded and added to the wagon traces and the wagons cargo reduced bo was left at the foot of the pass to guard their gear because he really wasnt quite as recovered from the belly stab of last fall as he made out and hod set to guard bo the plan was to make it to the top by midday and down as far as the first good stopping point then send some of the boys and the unloaded pack animals back to bos camp for the night the other half of the party would rest up till they arrived next day then continue the almost equally painstaking descent using rocks and logs to help brake the wagons wheels and prevent a disastrous runaway after that would be another four days of relatively easy travel up another long running valley before they had to do the drill again everything went according to plan till they were halfway up the hill at midmorning and came upon another wagon blocking the road dag flanked by indigo rode around it to encounter a bizarre sight the team hitched to it consisted of three mules and a skinny horse blowing and marbled with wet and dried white sweat one of the mules a wheeler was down on its knees tangled in the traces a woman knelt next to it weeping a burning brand in her hand a rough weak voice issued from the depths of the wagons raised canvas cover light its fool tail on fire thatll get it up missus what are you doing to that poor mule cried indigo in outrage she turned up a red tearstreaked face crisscrossed by brown hair falling from its topknot in messy strands she might have been any age between an exhausted twenty and an equally exhausted thirty her shirt sweatstained and skirt dirty its fallen and it wont rise and pull i can see that said indigo if you got that rig up this far with just those spavined beasts its likely spent youre crazy to try to drag a wagon that size up this road with only two pairs our wagon has five pairs and its barely making the grade its all we have one mule died two days back so we put the horse in they have to get us up theyre all we have who you talkin to out there vio came the hoarse male voice again dont you go talking to strangers from under the stuffy canvas a childs voice began crying dag reluctantly opened his groundsense as the man lurched out to the drivers box on his knees his face was fishbelly white his arms shaking as they propped him up he peered around suspiciously in addition to the man the wagon seemed to hold two children a halfgrown girl also sick lay on a pallet a toddler boy was tied inside by some sort of harness likely to keep him from falling over the side and under the wheels and he fretted crossly at the restraint hed likely howled before and would howl again but just at the moment was still working up to the next spate the womans gaze drifted to dag she recoiled grouse help theres a lakewalker fellow on this road where what the man staggered back inside then crawled out onto the box waving a boar spear keep away you you wont have our bones is he crazy muttered indigo fevered i think said dag not that he couldnt be crazy as well dag wheeled copperhead out of range of the wavering spear point and bellowed back down the road where sages wagon had halted and the other riders were starting to jam up fawn berry i need you here the two women rode up and dismounted taking in the scene and dag backed off slightly to avoid unnerving the distraught travelers further vio burst into ragged sobs at the sight of such friendly female faces the man slumped to his knees behind the box bent over the seat still clutching the spear he could barely lift under fawns soothing murmurs and berrys crisp questions it wasnt long before their tale tumbled out the basswoods were a poor couple with no dueshares from a village south of the hardboil who had fled their life of drudgery in hopes of the rumored free land in oleana sage and finch left their animals and walked forward in time to hear most of the sad story fawn looked over their rickety rig with a shrewd eye you two are a mite underequipped for homesteading its good land mind but it takes a lot of hard labor for better than a year usually before you could expect to live off it though i suppose if you could make it to the grace valley you could get day work there and build up your supplies thats the life we just left said vio grouse growled from his slump not going back not going back to be scorned and made mock of well said berry the exboat boss who for all her youthful blond looks didnt suffer fools gladly if you cant go up and you wont go back it looks like youll just have to set and starve on this here hillside whichll save you steps i reckon but dont set that silly mule on fire it cant tow you up this mountain nohow its best if you turn around now said dag reluctant to draw attention to his scary lakewalker self but feeling the need to voice support of berry even if you somehow made it to the top here there are two more passes farther along the trace that are as bad or worse youll founder anyways you still have to shift your rig to the side sos others can get by said berry firmly vios weeping increased inside the wagon the children plum and owlet heard their mothers distress and began to cry along dag saw the sympathy in fawns eye and guessed what was coming sage she said were bringing half our animals back down for another go anyhow what if you brought your team back later and hitched it on with theirs their animals could have a rest while they waited then with seven pairs to pull this wagon would go up the hill in jig time indigo scratched his head actually if we hung together to the next pass we could hitch on all our mules to each wagon in turn and wouldnt have to do all that shuffling around with the packhorses vio stopped sniveling and looked up in hope would you could we oh please say yes grouse the fevered man mumbled something about kill us in our beds which his wife ignored in her fresh concentration on indigo grousell make better sense when this bog ague spell passes off one more day i promise and hell be back on his pins oh please oh my so cruel oh you shouldnt ought to have said it if you didnt mean it which was how that night they all ended up camped at the top of the pass in a chill fog instead of lower down in some more pleasant location and dag and arkady were pressed into trying to force bogague remedy into a halfdelirious man who fought them every step grouses terror took the form of swearing and abuse mainly his wife was helpless in the face of it but berry lent a hand and a voice that settled him as swiftly as a drunken keeler arkady was less taken aback than dag expected his prior experience with difficult sick farmers seemed to be wider than hed quite let on dag walked his perimeter patrol wondering if anybody was going to stumble over a precipice while trying to take a piss tonight and if arkady had any headache remedies in his pack strong ones he paused arrested by the feel of horses and riders coming up the trail behind them honest folks had little reason to dare the trace after dark and sensible ones none here in this mist only made more blurry by the meager light of a halfmoon bandits preyed on travelers in these unpeopled stretches he extended his groundsense anxiously a very familiar ground bumped his dag strode down the road in time to see three riders loom up out of the milky haze remo and neeta and tavia absent gods dag remos aggravated voice echoed weirdly in the damp air its blighted time we caught up with you dag was able to avoid the confrontation that night only because arkady was already asleep in his bedroll but in consequence he and arkady were cornered by neeta and her little company at first light the next morning it would be optimistic to call it sunup it was more of a brightening fog water droplets beaded on blankets gear and in everyones hair dank and chill the crackling flames of the patroller breakfast fire not quite out of earshot of the farmers wagons seemed wan and pale much like the people clustered around it in this orangeand gray light even arkady looked unshaved roadworn and bleary i thought wed catch up with you before youd reached the barrens neeta explained earnestly we might have too if only wed been allowed an earlier start remo said to dag we wasted the first five days on antan bullrushs attempt to wait you out i told him arkady might be bluffing but you wouldnt be when he finally let me ride out to the bridger farm to check you were already four days down the road yes said neeta and then we wasted another two days arguing about it all it took the camp council to finally overrule the captain we should have gone after you courierstyle and swapped out the horses along the way but antan wouldnt even authorize that we had good luck in the road and weather said dag i pushed us along he wished hed had a few more days to push the farther the better anyway said neeta youve no need now to travel another foot north weve won arkady squinted curiously barr lurking at his shoulder frowned im pledged to the north and to my bluefield tentkin said dag and these farmer youngsters are relying on me to be their guide on this road which is all new to them ive more or less promised to see them safe to the grace valley leastways he gave arkady a hooded glance naturally i hope arkady will ride on with us i havent even begun to show him all the north has to offer theres a lot to see and learn yet neeta said no sir you dont understand i mean weve won you everything dag to be let back in camp and tentrights despite the farmer girl and the medicine booth at the farmers market maker challas actually become very interested in that since youve shown her all about your unbeguilement trick arkady blinked so did dag barr looked around i have a better idea why dont you all come north with us at least for a while were bettern halfway there and i was told last fall not to come home without you remo ive a suspicion nothing about pearl riffle camp will look the same to me but id like to finish up proper before making a clean start doing whatever else you might too remo shook his head you dont see ive found a new place for myselfa place that doesnt think im dirt under its boot heels i dont have to go back and crawl on my belly to get a place in a good patrol new moon really wants me shedding his imagined sins as a snake sheds its skin along with his past and his faultfinding familydag could understand the appeal of the southern camp to the boy wants isnt the same as needs said barr new moon cutoff has enough patrollers there isnt a camp north of the grace that would make that claim he glanced meaningfully at tavia who touched her lips in doubt neeta tossed her head barr can suit himself we were sent to escort arkady and dag home she did not dag noted add fawn to that tally anywayshe turned to arkadysurely youve had enough of living rough sir at your age we can whisk you right back to your own comfortable house its all being kept for you arkady rubbed his sleeve across his eyes gods i cant think when im covered with trail filth dag didnt see that arkady was any grubbier than anyone else but he bit his tongue on saying so fawn and sumac had been collaborating on rustling up the breakfast tea sumac rose and wordlessly handed the first sweetened cup to arkady he took it with a grateful grimace and sipped sumac looked neeta over rather coolly no ones going forward or back for another day if our animals are due for a rest your mounts must be in worse case from covering the same distance in twothirds the time dag cant leave his party scattered over ten miles of trailit would be very poor patrol procedure at the very least we need to get everyone safely to the bottom of this pass and reorganized theres plenty of time to think about all this later after breakfast dag said i agree arkady looked around the circle of faces and shrugged dags the trail boss neeta doubtless sensed she was being outmaneuvered by the older woman but couldnt muster a reasonable objection since it was quite true about the horses with the reminder of breakfast the debate broke up amongst growling stomachs and was prevented from reforming by the bustle of breaking camp after lunch dag overheard sumac murmur to arkady when were lower down ill show you a patroller trick for finding warmer water to wash in that would help sighed arkady it had taken a full day to get the party to the top of the pass but only cost half that to descend the other side it likely aided things that the cantankerous grouse remained bedridden in his wagon as his wife seemed the more sensible half of the couple ash and indigo helped her out they all made it to the bottom without losing any wagons over the edge of the twisty road despite having to shift two fallen trees and a small rock slide along the way between the mist lifting and the lower elevation it was a soft warm spring afternoon by the time theyd found a new campsite in the valley more bustle followed to get the four southern boys and whit fed and off back over the pass to fetch bo hod and the rest of their gear they likely wouldnt traipse in again till the following afternoon when dag finally went to look for arkady he was nowhere in sight nor in groundsense range did you see where arkady went he asked fawn um said fawn what sumac took him off into the woods to find him a warm bath she said dag raised his brows at her well arkady did take his scented soap and his towels and razor she added after a moment sumac had a blanket which i guess you could want for a bath and after another shyer moment do you suppose theyve gone to scout for squirrels dag drew breath not sure fawn eyed him uneasily you dont think its your duty to go after them do you on account as sumac is your niece and get my other hand bitten off no sumac is a woman grown and arkadys not an ineligible suitor arkadys maker bloodlines were plainly as superior as they could be and the age gap between the pair was something dag wouldnt have dared remark on fawn sighed relief a slow smile lifted dags lips at a vision of arkady and tent redwing tangling with each other if he were to be dragged home as a prize by sumac dag had no doubt arkady could hold his ownblight dar wouldnt last five minutes and cumbiawell arkady would doubtless be exquisitely polite to cumbia but she wouldnt budge him half an inch from any course hed chosen dont get ahead of yourself old patroller arkady and sumac were both complicated people which might or might not help them suit theyd not drawn each other out very deeply in front of dag arkady seeming content to listen to dag and sumac reminisce concealing his vulnerable heart a man would be wise to do so with sumac and arkady was a wise man still sumac and rase had meant to leave the company days ago back at the hardboil and be a hundred miles closer to hickory lake by now maybe the reunion with good old uncle dag wasnt the sole reason for her delay and then had come neeta and the hot breath of competition if of a rather indirect kind dag suspected sumac wasnt used to rivalry over men seldom a thing she had to deal with when they all followed her like ducklings though as a patrol leader she was trained to quick thinking and action in an emergency and if arkady went south tomorrow it was unlikely they would ever cross paths again poor squirrels dag murmured they havent a chance fawn grinned up at him maybe we should go find some of our own if sumac can spot a warm creek in these woods seems to me you could too a fine plan spark ill fetch our soap and blanket which direction shall we scout any but northwest i think the squirrel menace is likely covered in that direction right when dag smiling went off to find barr and warn him of their afternoons planned absence he found neeta and tavia at the boys elbow have you seen arkady neeta demanded i have to talk some sense into him he went off to get his bath i believe which way i didnt see him said dag with perfect truth and with less perfect truth added downstream wouldnt you think southeast as the creeks ran here come on tavia said neeta arkady shouldnt be wandering around in these woods on his own its not safe i dont think he went far and i doubt hed care for your company dag observed hes a man who likes his privacy tavia set her heels at the alarming thought of interrupting maker arkady at his bath the pair were sitting on a log still arguing when dag and fawn snuck away in their own right westerly the languid afternoon was everything dag had dreamed of back when hed still been envisioning this as a wedding trip deep in the woods he and fawn found a creek trickling over clean rocks into a sunlit pool as warm as the season could give with their bedroll even warmer laid beside it on a sundappled bank of soft green horsetails mountain wildflowers abounded but despite their decided lack of hurry when they strolled back to the quiet camp arkady and sumac were still not there the mountain ridge theyd just crossed blocked the sun early casting the woods into cool shadow under a stillluminous sky those shadows were thickening when dag at last spotted arkady and sumac emerging from the fringe of the trees he rather thought the pair supplied their own glow leaking through their halfclosed grounds they stopped and unlinked hands then arkady turned to arrange sumacs loose drying hair falling like nights shadow to her hips combing it through his fingers fortunate fingers it took dag another moment to realize what was different about arkadybesides the obvious his silvergilt hair was no longer in its mourning knot but braided down the back of his head and then set in a loose queue to his shoulders a northern stylesumacs handiwork nevertheless and quite maddeningly neither made any interesting announcements but slipped back into the reduced camps dinner routine almost separately the basswoods kept to themselves but fawn calla and berry teamed up to grill the trout remo and barr had collected from the nearby rushing river neeta watched arkady in concern but either had the sense not to badger him or was too caught up in the evening camp chores and horse care to get the chance dag wondering if he ought to ask arkady his intentions decided that was the wrong end of the stick as the stars came out he cornered sumac pleasant afternoon he inquired genially very you likewise i suspect not to pry he could feel her smirk in the shadows of the tall blooming tulip tree theyd ducked behind youre dying to pry well i do feel a certain responsibility for my partner sumac tilted her head back and remarked as if to no one in particular i do like a man with clean hands who knows what to do with them should i ask you if your intentions are honorable intentions are like wishes you dont always get them arkady is a right sensitive man if strong in his own way you couldif you dag strove for neutral wording he could be hurt i am aware her eyes glinting in the shadows grew serious at last we talked talked dag tried to imagine arkady talking it was an effort what about a lot of things what we had in common for one like what said dag they were not an obviously matched pair for all that he suspected subtler compatibilities that dark smile again i dont think ill tell you but you were rightthe mans insight is unholy dag cleared his throat did he um tell you anything about his first marriage with bryna oh days ago oh dag stumbled on a weeks not very long to make up your mind after fifteen years of avoiding whatever youve been avoiding yes im off to a late start and hes worried it could be his and brynas sorrows all over again he does feel it might be better not to get stringbound till were sure things will work out sos i wouldnt quit the patrol and turn my life upside down for nothing wed both be glad of your blessing though not seeing why his blessing was worth a pigs whistle it took dag a moment to decode this he imagined it why yes arkady by all means impregnate my niece the family will be ecstatic except that they likely would be by now its time you see said sumac simply after fifteen years ive had so much practice at sorting out what i dont want it doesnt take that long to see what i do even if ive never seen the like before how long did it take you and fawn to decide on each other er several weeks honesty compelled well two days several weeks to get up the courage a flickering foxgrin well then she drew breath when i was twenty i knew everything about my future now i know nothing but i do know your partner will go north when i do so you can say thank you sumac thank you sumac dag echoed dutifully and added more gently all the joy in the wide green world to you two her lips eased in quite the softest smile hed ever seen on her toughgirl face she nodded gravely sumac proved right about arkadys sense of direction neeta however did not give up and turn around in part because remo had been argued into a tizzy of indecision by barr tavia said little but the upshot was that when the reunited company at last took the trace north again it was swollen to twentythree people and an entire drove of horses and mules leastways dag reflected it made them a more daunting target for bandits the trace here ran for three days travel up a slot flanked by running ridges vast green skyblocking humps it was a thinly peopled country a few hamlets carved out of what little flat land the valley offered supplemented their meager livings by supplying the needs of travelers grouse recovering from his ague attack enough to take the reins on his wagon box eyed the land hungrily but any vale with a creek bottom worth having was clearly already taken inevitably whit saw and recognized the birthday walnut around his sisters neck rather than having to talk his tentbrother into being his next target dag found him to be an eager volunteer dag was at first inclined to seek some private spot for the trial then recalled the show hed put on with crane and his first sharingknife bonding the memory was disturbing and he disliked doing complex and chancy groundwork with an audience but this crowd was captive and mostly friendly his own words came uncomfortably back to him never miss a chance to befriend and teach around the campfire that night dag took on his next major making the first few minutes were spent sorting out whose hair whit was to borrow to supplement his own tooshort curls his sisters or his wifes they settled on berrys she made a face as fawn did the snipping filching a generous blond hank whits thicker fingers proved considerably less deft at cord braiding than fawns especially when his added blood made the mixed hair slippery everyone gathered around the lakewalkers watching more wideeyed than the farmers when dag straddled a log behind whit and helped him draw his ground out into the growing length of braid so thats how they did those wedding cords murmured tavia indigo scowled in fascination his fingers rubbing one another as if in troubled memory the little sack of black walnuts had ridden with dag all the way from hickory lake sifted to the bottom of his saddlebags and forgotten on the river journey taking up one now he rolled it between his fingers feeling an unexpected shiver at this reminder of home he glanced up at sumac watching over arkadys shoulder and managed a smile any hardshelled nut would likely do to anchor this involution but dag was glad of these arkady knelt at their side watching closely as dag hook harness removed held his long arms around whit his chin resting on the boys shoulder his fleshly fingers worked with whits to slip the nut into the net of hair while his ghost fingers shaped the involution out of their own substance catching up and winding in whits ground suggest you ease down dag muttered arkady in his ear youll turn yourself inside out going that deep indeed maker vayve too had accused dag of overbuilding his groundwork dag eased down he and whit together lifted the hair necklace over whits head and the walnut pendant fell to touch his skin framed by the open collar of his shirt dag opened his ghost hand and let his involution go setting his jaw against the tearing pain his belly shuddered and his feet went cold arkady breathed sharply through his teeth sumacs lips parted in a wince remo whispered ow and smoothly like a spreading stain the shimmering ground shield spread out through whits skin all over his body top to toe yes well now what asked whit fingering the walnut didnt you feel that asked sumac not especially whit looked up and blinked what are we done already yep dag eased upright and stretched and clenched his fingers grimacing as the tension unwound in his back whit leaped up and capered around the fire demanding that barr and remo describe what they saw with their groundsenses grouse basswood apparently still waiting for the humansacrificeand cannibalism part to start blinked and said in a disappointed voice is that it he didnt do nothing now do berry said whit in a burst of enthusiasm and hawthorn hawthorn crowed assent bo thumped him on the side of the head hod hovered grinning hesitantly and me berry clutched her hair and laughed uneasily ill be snatched bald arkady eyed dags slump on the log and said may i try the next one dags head jerked up and he squinted in surprise arkady cast him a nod sumacs encouraging grip on arkadys shoulder pushed him forward barr gave dag a hand up dag staggered and stood a moment with his hands on his knees till his lightheadedness passed arkady swallowed taking dags place on the log fawn repeated the operation on berrys hair with her sewing scissors and a lot of female consultation about just where to cut to best conceal the growing back you lakewalkers have to give me some of your ground reinforcements later on these here finger cuts berry said sternly as she seated herself with the hair strands laid out in front of her sos i can play my fiddle at the chorus of volunteers she nodded in satisfaction and began berrys bloodstained hair braiding was considerably neater than whits and swifter arkady caught up her ground on his second trydag was impressed and wound it into his involution with seeming ease arkady did complex and delicate involutions in his work from time to time any sharingknife maker or senior medicine maker dag thought ought to be nearly as practiced and adept his hopes rose if more makers than dag and the admittedly extraordinary arkady could be taught this technique it became far more than a stunt it might even be a solution although even arkady gasped when he let his shaped involution go his face draining sumac caught his arm and held him upright till his breathing steadied best stop for tonight said dag that gives us three different samples to study the groundwork on each was slightly different and dag wasnt sure which would be best when he had perfected the skill he decided he would go back and redo fawns although he didnt think her shield overbuilt if anything he wanted to make it twice as strong for her and for the childhe rather thought by now it was going to be their daughter though the shield made it hard to be suregrowing so swiftly within her that didnt look so bad said vio watching berry this is just what they let us see grouse grumbled berry and barr then flummoxed each other when he attempted a ground reinforcement on her pricked fingers and had it slide off arkady was called over to consult well the shield repels groundwork all right said arkady stroking berrys hand and frowning it doesnt seem to care if the intent of the groundwork is good or not you can break the shield by removing the necklace but id rather you didnt just yet berry studied his slightly haggard face and nodded understanding my word yes it would be like sinking the boat youd just launched ill just wash my fingers good and tie strips on them for the night theyre only little cuts theyll be fine in the morning dag caught arkadys glance see why it wont be finished till i figure out how to make the shield something the farmer can take on and off something to think about to be sure arkadys shoulders were as bowed with fatigue as after emergency medicine work but his coppery eyes gleamed with excitement what i dont understand said grouse is why you lakewalkers would want to do something that stops you from doing things really this seems pointless murmured neeta its not lakewalkers i want to protect farmers from said dagnot entirely leastwaysthough i expect that might have some interestin consequences its malices blight bogles grouses face screwed up another farmer who didnt quite believe in a menace hed never seen and barely heard ofor he wouldnt be so anxious to move north dag reckoned vio looked more wary the show over the company broke up to seek their respective bedrolls as the night breeze sighed in the trees dag hugged fawn close she cuddled in tight under their blankets and said that was well done dag well started maybe it all seems a long way from done to me mm she said but stop and think about how far youve come since last year this time he hardly needed to sense her clouded ground to feel her little spurt of memory a ripple of tension across her back under his only hand hm how far weve both come she went on more quietly last year this time id already made my big stupid mistake and was just working up to running away from home in a panic well not panic exactly desperation maybe he let his fingers seek those back muscles rubbing the remembered strain out of them no more desperation for you spark not if i can help it me let me think out walking my thousandth routine patrol i suppose before chatos courier called us down to glassforge id spent too many years just about one bad nights sleep away from tossing it in and sharing and was getting mighty tired of that state of mind i do remember that her slim little fingers chased bad memories out of his muscles in turn could you have imagined us here now could you have pictured doing such a making as you did tonight gods no nor any other making not in my wildest dreams my dreams mostly not being good dreams see there you go then her lips pressed a warm circle on his collarbone then curved up i spose the advantage of being a gloomy cuss is that all your surprises are good ones he snickered point spark the following afternoon brought them to the foot of the next pass where they made an early stop to sort out the most efficient plans for getting the wagons up it with a dawn start dag hoped the whole company could make it to the bottom of the far side by tomorrow night that vale rugged and almost as unpeopled as the barrens was the last where this land humped up like a giants blanket folds the trail at its head would lead over and down into the settled country approaching the grace valley dag felt a funny little flutter in his belly at that thought spark and i and our youngin are coming home it would be a home to make carved new out of unknown territory even though their sort of homesteading was unlikely to involve chopping trees and pulling stumps on his bedtime perimeter patrol that night dag became aware he was being shadowed by neeta maybe he needed to vary his habits he was getting too easy to ambush he reluctantly slowed his steps and let her come up to him not anxious to reopen the argument about his direction of travel nice night she remarked ayup it was starspangled the cool darkness drenched with the green scents of spring alive with bug and frog songs you knowshe touched his sleeve her smile turning warmyoud be welcome in my bedroll what had she been inspired by sumacs ploy did she mean to seduce him into turning south what was this with all these lovely young women flinging themselves at his head this season and where were they all when i was twentytwo and could have done something about it the depressing answer not born yet presented itself rather inescapably first calla then neeta although calla hadnt hardly meant it neetas was a dodgier proposition on that score well thats a right flattering thing to say to a fellow my age neeta but you know im stringbound he reached to touch the cord coiled on his left arm above his harness incidentally shifting his right arm out from under her grasp neetas smile of invitation didnt waver shes a farmer shed never know wouldnt be able to read the changes in his ground neeta meant thats not the point he needed to nip this in the bud hard and fast but not perhaps cruelly forgive me kauneo for using your memory so but kauneo had been a patrol leader herself and would understand i think you do not see so ill explain once only i loved a patroller woman very much you might again no never again never while i breathe will i trade hearts with a woman who i could have the duty to order into harms way youre talking about wolf ridge arent you it was a great tragedy but a great battle sympathy shone in her eyes like starlight actually it was a pretty stupid battle since for two weeks afterwards i was too dizzy from blood loss to stand up i had plenty of time to lie there and think about ways to have done it better and one of the things i figured out was that if i had it to do all over i would have sacrificed the whole company and her brothers and all to save her without remorse or regret this is not a fit state of mind for a patrol leader or captain which is why i never willingly took up those duties again she started to speak he overrode her one of the things i love best about fawn is that shes not a patroller woman and never will be or could be shes an opposite to kauneo in every way possible short instead of tall dark hair instead of winterred brown eyes not silver not my equal in age or groundsense farmer instead of lakewalker how much farther can you get i can look at her all day long and not stir up one painful memory except for the brightness of her ground in that his two wives were blazingly alike he gulped at the thought and wondered why hed never allowed himself to think it before give this notion over neeta youll just embarrass yourself and me to no good purpose there are better young men for you young idiots she snorted they grow older in due course growing into old idiots there was evidence she stood rigid dag wondered in despair how else he might say youre a cute young thing but your tactics are transparent and i wouldnt touch you with a stick without offending or crushing her he surely wasnt the most ornamental addition to any womans bedroll and he rather thought neeta hadnt thought of him in those terms till nowindeed the first time theyd met before shed learned his ancient history shed looked at him like a spring beetle found crunched underfoot but the tinge of hero worship was a dilemma fortunately before he could tangle himself up worse with his tongue she raised her chin bravely turned and strode away she was too much a proud patroller woman to flounce which relieved him only slightly dag hoped hed discouraged this approach to the argument about their direction of travel for good and all although the possibility of neeta sending in her partner as a second wave did cross his mind and then he didnt know whether to laugh or wince he trusted tavia had more sense neeta had a problem more pressing than what man she might or might not attach to her bedroll dag wasnt sure how much of a show shed made of herself back at new moon cutoff to win both permission for the arkady retrieval and command of it but he had no doubt that for her to drag back to her camp without the groundsetter would be a considerable comedown still worse to return all alone if remo and maybe tavia both bolted north although dag suspected antan at least would be quite pleased if she came back without dag and fawn had her camp captain set her up to fail not a nice thought though dag could understand antan yielding to the temptation to undercut his badgering young patroller and teach her a sharp lesson the sharper for having brought it on herself so all in all dag was not surprised come the dawn mist to find neeta and her little patrol saddling up to climb the next pass along with them it was a long and busy day fortunately and by the time theyd been forced to cooperate on a dozen tasks theyd established an unspoken pretense that the prior nights conversation had never occurred at least she didnt seem heartbroken and dag could hardly fault her for her determination even if it wasnt going to do her any good after the labors of the pass the following days start was made later by a pouring rain but the ragged gray clouds blew out by noon the sun emerged and a hot bright steaming stillness overtook the rugged country their cavalcade strung out along the miry road just outpacing the first crop of mosquitoes whining in the woody shade in the damp air even quiet voices echoed off the rocks dag found himself riding together with fawn whit and berry at the head of the line everyones feet dangling beside their stirrups despite the lazy heat he was pleased to note fawn upright and staring eagerly around not as fatigued as shed been of late how many folks live in clearcreek would you guess she asked berry maybe seven hundred in the village but a couple thousand up the whole valley i was wondering what was the right size of place for dagdag and arkady nowto set up their trial medicine tent too little and there wouldnt be enough customers to keep them busy too many and theyd be overwhelmed likely silver shoals would be too much to start with i dont know about tripoint its bigger than silver shoals said dag i dont know if well have time this summer to take you up there and show you the city it would be something to have ridden the whole trace from graymouth to tripoint agreed whit still i want to take berry up to west blue too and i dont think thered be time to do both whit was plainly eager to show his new bride off to his family as well he should be dag thought ive about got calluses on my backside from the trace already said fawn maybe you could bring back my mare and her foal though and my sack of plunkin ears which aunt nattie was keeping for me oh i thought wed all go together said whit sounding a little disappointed well well see how close is your place to the river berry not much moren a mile up the clear creek we launched our yearly flatboat right into the crick from our land so youre really almost in the grace valley do boatsand rivermencome in off the river is it like a river town nearly clearcreek landing which sits at the crick mouth is turning into a village in its own right cept for washing away now and then in the floods are you thinkin of more trade for dag its a fact them river boys do themselves a world of hurt time to time even without the fevers that said dag and something fawn said once that the river was like a village one street wide and two thousand miles long ive been thinking for some time that if i want word to get around about what im doing the river folks would ride courier for us berry nodded in approval if dag was not a riverman a riverbank man would clearly be the next best thing in her estimation it would be a help to me and hawthorn if you and fawn and arkady was to keep our house while we was gone down with the yearly flatboatthat is if we get a boat built for this falls rise whit still has a mite to learn fore im ready to make him boat boss and take up managin the goodsshed id like at least one more trip on the river fore i get landed on shore like fawn she jerked her chin toward her tentsisters middle whit smiled innocently i dont suppose said fawn you have a pond on your place berry why we do in fact fawn brightened really planting plunkin in her mind already dag could see clearcreek oleana was looming larger in his future every day he began to think he might deal with it right well my word this is a strange country said fawn looking around where did all the trees go there wasnt blight here was there dag the woods had opened out with only a few tall red oaks their bark laced with black scars growing out of a riot of green scrub no forest fire said dag there was a big summer drought in this valley a few years ago its all coming back real good looks like fawn peered under the flat of her hand at the new growth climbing the valley walls that must have been quite some fire whit squinted ahead into the hazy distance huh funnylookin fellow there wanderin our way heyis he naked dag followed his glance opening his halfclosed groundsense a big shaggyhaired man with oddly mottled skin was limping southward down the middle of the road dags breath drew in his back straightened and his feet sought his stirrups as his mind burst in twenty directions at once like a covey of startled quail blight its a mudman dag stood in his saddle and bellowed over his shoulder barr remo we got us a mudman fetch out the boar spears sumac blight where was sumac and arkady they werent in his groundsense range if a live mudman was here on this road its malice master could not be far off not nearly far enough but dag straining couldnt sense it yet it came to himgods where had his wits gonethat they hadnt been passed by any southwardbound traffic all morning all the night before how long fawnpanic was making dags world turn reddrop back to the wagons make em stop get all the farmers together and stay there one flying wit at least dropped a featherexplain to the ignorant ones whats going on fawn had her reins tightened up while whit was still closing his gaping mouth right she said simply and yanked magpie around dag wheeled in the opposite direction wrapped his reins around his hook drew his steel knife and clapped his heels to his geldings sides copperhead bolted forward into the breathless light by the time fawn reached the basswoods wagon which was first in line every patroller in the company was streaming past her in aid of dag weapons brandished barr and remo had reacted the quickest but neeta tavia and rase werent much behind vio basswood stood up on her wagon box gripping the curved canvas roof and staring in horror as grouse sawed the reins and brought them to a creaking halt her face draining she screamed hes killed him ye gods he just rode that poor man down and killed him fawn turned in her saddle and craned her neck in the heathazed distance dag was pivoting copperhead around the fallen mudman she abruptly realized what vio thought she was seeing fawns grim hookhanded lakewalker husband suddenly running mad and brutally attacking without reason an innocent unarmednot to mention unclothedtraveler no cried fawn that wasnt a man it wasnt human it was a mudman a mud what said grouse glaring and scrambling for his spear malices make them up out of animals and mud by groundwork magic ive seen the holes they come out of they make them up into human form to be their slaves and soldiers and theyre horribly dangerous you cant reason with them or anything even though the malice gives them speech they lose all their wits when their malice is slain oh never mind grouse had his spear out but was aiming it in the wrong direction at fawn and at berry who had ridden up panting fawn had thought whit was behind her but instead hed turned again and followed the patrollers if at a cautious trot inside the wagon the toddler burst into wails at all the shouting mudmen eat children fawn put in desperately the shambles are dreadful after did vio need to know this maybe she didnt need to be made more afraidshe seemed close to faintingbut she needed to be afraid of the right things rase and neeta came galloping back is it dead are there any more fawn called rase checked just long enough to gasp out that ones dealt with no more within groundsense range so far dag sent us to find sumac and arkady he spurred on that pair had fallen behind more than once lately and fawn hadnt given them a thoughtat least not about their safety between them sumac and arkady were clearly proof against any predator these hills harboredwolf bear catamount or rattlesnake a gang of mudmen was a different proposition all the other farmers in the company came up to cluster in the road goggle and demand repeated explanations pressed fawn finally said look i dont think i can explain mudmen to you not and be believed just come look at the evil thing why dont you she turned and led them wagons and all up the road to the site of the gory slaughter dag and whit had dismounted dag released copperheads reins and prodded the body with his foot whit looked as if he was working up the nerve to do the same blight it dag was saying this area is supposed to be well patrolled he glanced up fawn i told you to keep back no dag she said firmly these folks have to see just like your young patrollers oh he scrubbed his handwas it shakingover his face yeah fawn slid from her mare took the reluctant vio by the hand and dragged her forward the mob trailed look at it see look at its jaw practically a muzzle and those furry ears and all that coarse hairit likely started out as a bear wouldnt you say dag she tried not to look at its bloodied throat torn out in one slash of dags reaching war knife with all the power of his arm and copperheads stride behind it black bear oh yes dag agreed absently hes its naked said calla hesitantly naked is good said dag means it hasnt killed folks and stolen their clothes yet fawn realized from their openmouthed staring that this was the first mudman alive or dead that most of the young patrollers had ever seen too dag pointed out a few more distinguishing features still with the toe of his boot then glanced up at his whole mixed audience this one is so crude and bearlike because its the work of a malice in its first molt the malice might even still be sessile which would be good news for us as a malice goes through molts and gets stronger and smarter its making gets better till you cant hardly tell a mudman from a real human by eye lakewalker groundsense can tell at once though their grounds are their grounds are just not right all the young men jostled forward for a closer look with the enthusiastic hawthorn pushing through to the front fawn let vio shrink back vio was trembling and teary from seeing and smelling the welter of blood and her little girl who came out from the wagon and grabbed her skirts burst into tears in sheer contagion the toddler tied in the wagon just howled on general principles grouse clutching his spear and looking frantically fearful his world suddenly full of new dangers but with no clear target to attack turned on his wife and snarled shut them up it seemed mean but fawn had to admit vio did get a better hold on herself controlling her snivels and shuffling off to manage her children a respite of sorts vio was beginning to learn something fawn thought if only that the world was not what shed imagined bo hadnt pushed forward and he didnt look much surprised but his seamed face screwed up in a dubious scowl his glance of dismay was not at his lakewalker companions though but at the surrounding ridges dag too backed out of the crowd and stared up and down the road gold eyes slitted reaching with his groundsense a little relief lightened his features and he muttered ah good theres arkady truly in a couple of minutes the strays rode up sumac jumped down and strode to him sorry we fell behind there we were just talking from their undisheveled looks fawn thought this was likely true though they both had the weights of character to appear unruffled even when half undone arkady eyes wide dismounted and approached the corpse his hand sought his belly and his face worked as he swallowed thats the most grotesque making ive ever seen yep said dag try to imagine the power of the groundwork that can turn a bear into well this inside of two weeks intrigue fought the nausea in arkadys face can i dissect it now are you mad no of course not now later well see said dag with any luck you can have your pick of the litter said sumac ill bring you all the mudmen your heart desires im not sure my heart desires any arkady admitted but its absent gods but that things so wrong do you eat them asked ash hunkering down in fascination this won gagging noises from all the patrollers present except dag who said only no the flesh is tainted lakewalkers do skin them sometimes said fawn remembering a certain bride gift not to use the leather said dag just in special cases when the pain was too great and mere victory wasnt revenge enough fawn suspected dag looked at sumac who looked back sizing each other up sumac cut across the moment saying simply well what next patrol leader fawn thought she could see the weight of responsibility descend like a hundredpound sack of grain on dags shoulders he sighed scout i reckon north wouldnt you say sumacs lips pursed that thing could have been running for home but we havent felt any blight sign south of here we dont have enough patrollers to split up and run a proper pattern we havent seen any traffic from the north all day said dag nor from the south sumac pointed out but i agree north seems the best bet should we send a courier for help closest camp to here would be laurel gap i reckon she turned her head and called anyone else here ever been to laurel gap camp the other patrollers returned negative mumbles sumac muttered blight i dont want it to be me but it might have to not yet leastways said dag right now were in the middle of nowhere knowing nothing which doesnt make much to report sumacs eyes glinted indeed open your ground to me her brows went up a faint flush tinged her highboned copper cheeks but she evidently complied dag looked her up and down nodded without expression pick a partner and ride up the road a piece no more than five miles see if you find any blight sign ill try to organizedags eye swept the companythese he sighed right sumac swung aboard her horse looked over not the patrollers but their mounts evidently judged barrs the swiftest and said barr follow me arkadys hand lifted as she wheeled away but fell back unseen the two scouts loped off up the road mud spinning from their horses hooves fawn puzzled over that last exchange between uncle and niece oh of course dag had been checking to be sure sumac hadnt conceived before sending her out it wasnt just his general protectiveness pregnant women as fawn had painful reason to know were preferred prey to a malice on the verge of a molt the womens natural making made them beacons walking bait their new ground shields might presently be protecting fawn and berryshe touched the walnut at her throatbut what of vio or calla the lakewalkers would know even if the women didnt yet she reassured herself theyd take precautions children were a malices next most favored morselsshe glanced uneasily at the basswoods wagon where the crying had died down all right said dag raising his voice to carry everyone move up to that next little ford he pointed toward a shallow creek crossing the road a hundred paces farther along we better grab the chance to water the animals we have to make ready to run sudden that it shifted everyone farther from the disturbing sight and smell of the dead mudman was just a bonus fawn figured setting an example she retrieved magpies reins and marched along briskly a quarter hour later dag found himself saying to sage no you cant take your anvil he ran his hand through his hair in exasperation if a malice is close our best chance of escape is to abandon the wagons and run mounted if you farmers get caught within range of its ground powers it could seize your minds and then you wouldnt believe how ugly things can get you rescue each other first then weapons and animals then food if theres time but no more absent gods every lakewalker child is taught this by age five the wagons are all we have cried grouse you cant stop to defend things but my anvil said sage its everything to me dag fixed him with a stern eye more than calla er sage fell silent if it doesnt fit in your saddlebags leave it chances are said fawn we can circle back later and collect our gear again if we live and if we dont live we wont need it anyway right sage still looked torn whit put in helpfully sage your anvil would be the last thing thieves would run off with it takes two fellows just to lift it not if its still in the wagon they can just take the whole rig well have the mules said fawn cleverly not suggesting that a malice could just chain up its mudmen slaves to haul it all off good girl dag gave her a grateful nod sage wavered then resigned himself to unhitching his team indigo helping dag hurried to greet remo and neeta returning on foot from scouting up toward either ridge nothing up on my side within groundsense range reported remo mine either said neeta no physical signs either just animal tracks and old travelers camps dag eyed the high ground overlooking them with disfavor that there was no hostile eye up there spying on them now didnt mean there hadnt been an hour ago or any time this morning should we feed folks while we can asked fawn she was thinking as always dag said hand snacks only dont light a fire everything waited on sumac and barr the company was actually closer to the next big settlement riding forward than back and the passes were about the same climb in either direction at least the road behind was known to the farmers now but until they actually located the malice it was a guess which direction was truly safer if the malice proved sessile hed go after it with a quarter patrol without hesitation dag decided but if it was more advanced sense demanded they go neither south nor north but cut across country west to laurel gap camp and the nearest reinforcements or did it dag imagined dragging this whole gaggle of farmers over fifty miles of broken terrain mudmen in pursuit and bit his lip he would certainly have to send a pair of patroller couriers swiftly on ahead reducing the farmer youngsters lakewalker guardians by two he turned to more immediate calculations rase let me see your sharing knife the boy already had it out of his saddlebags and slung around his neck good he pulled it out on its thong and displayed it dag ran his hand lightly over the sheath a good making seems sound he said aloud if we take on a sessile youll be the centerpiece of the attack this is the experience you came north to get it just came on a little sooner than you expected is all rases nostrils flared in pride and fear yes sir whose hearts death is in there my greatgrandfathers about two years back i see dag touched his forehead in respectful salute hows your ground veiling have you been keeping up your drills with sumac as his patrol leader rase surely ought to have been yes sir good i carry a primed knife too but ill hold mine in reserve its lucky we have two knives in this patrol said rase that wasnt luck that was preparation know the difference preparation you can control he gave the young patroller an encouraging grip on the shoulder which made rase flash an earnest smile reminded dag turned away to rummage through his own saddlebags his new bonded knife came to hand first and he slipped its strong braided cord over his neck and tucked the dark sheath into his shirt next sifted farther down he found his primed knifedodgy first and unsupervised making that it was the sheathed bone itself lay lightly on his chest but the weight of ugly memories it held dragged like sages anvil well if the renegade cranes cruel deeds had any redemption this was it he turned to find fawn watching him her dark eyes grave her lips moved as if to speak then pressed closed she gestured down the stream instead so uh whats the matter with arkady the maker sat on the creek bank in the midst of a patch of green horsetails his head bowed to his knees the mudman likely the trained sensitivity that makes good makers also unfits them for patrol malice spoor hits them too hard fawn frowned at him youve been doing sensitivity drills with arkady for the past two three months whats that going to do to you dag sighed im not real anxious to test it well just have to see she came nearer her little hand rose to trace the walnutstained knife sheath hidden under his shirt i suppose you have to wear this just dont dont do anything stupid with it all right remember what you promised not while im aboveground and breathing her words echoed in the hollows of his mind i wont forget she nodded sternly abruptly he lifted her up hugged her twirled her around and kissed her on the forehead what was that in aid of she puffed in pleased surprise righting herself as he set her back down nothing just because she ducked her head in a firm nod thats a good reason the farmers were bickering with one another and with the patrollers but all were making steady progress at sorting out mounts for a retreat so dag didnt attempt to interfere packsaddles were rapidly refitted for riders emptied of their loads and padded with blankets inevitably dag supposed the basswoods socalled riding horse had no saddle he wondered whether it would be better to distribute the two children with their parents or with the best riders which would be a couple of the patrollers assuming everyone headed in the same direction he foresaw another argument there ah gah his brain was doing that mad thing again running unstoppably and repeatedly down every possible and impossible scenario even though he knew blighted well that the world never delivered him his expectations fawn brought him a chunk of cheese wrapped in cold pan bread left from the morning he munched it along with a few swallows of flat tepid water from his water bottle while he walked a tense perimeter along the turbid creek and around the toonoisy camp his groundsense straining outward it was still arkady and not dag who first lifted his head from his knees and turned his face north dag jogged to join him as arkady stumbled out onto the road and looked up it arkadys lips parted in horror and he went greener than when hed first seen the mudman sumacs horse was galloping wildly toward them the stirrups flapped and swung from its empty saddle every patroller in range turned to stop the runaway with a summoning so hard that the poor beast tumbled to its knees it grunted up and stood trembling lathered white between its legs and down its shoulders dag ran up looking it over for blood or wounds trying frantically to remember if sumac had been wearing her leather coat when she rode off in the heat it wasnt tied behind the cantle arkady touched the empty saddle and groaned no shes a redwing dag said through his teeth she lands on her feet we are survivors he whirled and bellowed whit fawn berry get those blighted farmers mounted up patrollers to me people scurried yelled stomped argued the patrollers led their horses up and stood in a ragged line awaiting orders in an agonized voice arkady said go dag looked up a mile off a horse bearing two riders popped over a rise into sight and his groundsense range simultaneously wait dag said arkadys face lifted following his gaze it felt almost uncouth to be watching an expression so painfully exposed a mans last hope returned to him gods sumac dag thought if the pair of us dont have heart failure before this is all over it wont be your fault and then she could inherit her captaincy clever girl agonizing minutes passed as the laboring horse cantered nearer as soon as they hove within shouting range barr called excitedly we found the malice its just up the road a ripple ran through the patrollers like the strain through a mob of horses milling at the start of a race barr pulled up among them sumac more or less fell from where she clung behind barrs cantle down into arkadys arms a drowning man couldnt hug his log any harder than he did her her braid was coming undone tendrils of black hair plastered around her flushed sweating face strained lines of pain framed her mouth and eyes and she was breathing hard but her gold eyes blazed like fires she pushed arkady away enough to find her feet but didnt shuck off his anxious hand supporting her elbow nor his tender one that prodded her scalp though she did wince she was wearing absent gods be thanked the coat her ribs bore only bruises though the knot on the back of her skull was swelling like an egg this malice looks like its just barely out of its burrow she wheezed its advancing down the road with a guard of twentytwo mudmen but theyre moving slow seventeen mudmen now said barr they none of em have clothes or arms at all except for rocks and sticks and numbers dag muttered and the malice likely it means to supply itself with our weapons and gear itll have to think again about that plan dag we can take it said sumac looks like it almost took you oh well she tossed her hair back in a mockery of a feminine gesture and grinned i didnt collect worse than a knock on the head and you should see the other fellas grant you that malice is nasty and strange absent gods its strange said barr its the first you ever saw said dag how do you figure well sumac said but even ifits huge dag seven foot tall at least ugly as mud but it can barely move for its great big belly sticking out the whole time after wed run headlong into its guards and were fighting our way back out again it never stopped waddling along it cant be covering more than two miles in an hour so i make it two three hours till it reaches here the mudmen can move faster dag jerked his thumb over his shoulder as we saw by their scout i reckon sumac said the malice looks like a sessile about to molt except for its being out on the road ive never seen one that close to splitting if so good for us if its awkward but its menace is in its ground powers not its pseudobody dag chewed his lip very few decisions left here till he committed them all irrevocably to action rase are you up for facing your first malice yes sir dag nodded grinning darkly the old excitement running molten through his veins i thought you were tired of this game old patroller a live malice was never just a training exercise but absent gods this sounded close to it so lets teach these youngsters a few tricks the better to keep them alive on the day when dag would not be there and the malice would not be so soft whit flanked by fawn had come up to the edge of the crowd when sumac had arrived now he shouldered forward to say dag can i ride with you he touched the walnut at his throat dag said automatically no i need you to lead the farmers berry and fawn can do that whats the point of making this ground shield if we cant try it out indeed that was going to be a problem if he kept making shields for people he loved blight whit if i ever make shields for reed and rush ill happily stake them out as bait not you fawn said if your shields are ever to make us farmers be partners to lakewalkers and not just backward children in your eyes it has to start somewhere seems to me youve said a word or two about a man starting where he is well here we are she would quote dag back to himself he weakened i suppose he said someone has to hold the horses thanks sir you be careful whit said fawn sternly dont go turning that into the stupidest thing i ever said i shouldnt like to explain it to berry or mama right sis whit gave fawn a hug and dashed off to collect his horse arkady goes with the farmer party of course dag narrowed his eyes at the maker who praise be didnt protest so do you sumac sumac opened her mouth hesitated youre still dizzy from that knock on your head your horse is spent and if it all goes sour someone needs to know how to get these farmers to laurel gap which reminds me barr go swap out your mount for a fresher one barr scurried miraculously sumac didnt argue but allowed the concerned arkady to lead her off she was blinking rather hard as if her vision wasnt quite meshing in minutes more dag was leading five patrollers and one west blue boy at a canter up the road while berry and fawn rousted the rest to ride south dag wanted to put as much distance between the attack and fawn as he could to give the farmers their best chance if they needed it and if they didnt well one of the young patrollers could play courier and close the gap quickly enough a mudman troop horsed could do the same but these all seemed to be afoot so far and lets keep it that way dags safe scheme to leave his tentbrother with the horses foundered at once on whits crossbow his little patrol was too short on archers to forgo the weapon or its most experienced wielder he reordered his plan of attack in his head yet again in time with copperheads swift stride barr he called over the hoofbeats wheres our last good cover before we come up on em which would be soon already and despite his closed ground dag could feel the dry shock in his midsection that told him a live malice was nearby depends on how much theyve moved since we hit them barr called back right up there i think he pointed to a rocky outcrop almost overhanging the road the tail of a spur from the western ridge sheltering a seeping rivulet not many trees beyond all fire scrub and brambles well be able to see trouble coming so will the malice dag thought but waved his hook in acknowledgment they swung into the sheltered space to find signs of its having been used as a campsite by many prior travelers the patrollers dismounted and began arming themselves dag flung himself off copperhead and scrambled up the steep slope to the ridgelet flanked by barr on his knees he parted the blackberry canes and poison ivy with his hook arm and peered out into the hot green afternoon the road drew a groove through the recovering scrub winding down to the next stream crossing and up again an open space of a good mile a quarter of the way across it the malices band trudged toward them dag could see the creature clearly head and shoulders above its mudmen its body was indeed massive its gut enormous its gait clumsy and bizarre still on the trace murmured dag id have thought you and sumac would have driven them to cover by the way five down or no i dont thank you two for teaching them to fear lakewalkers or how to fight us sumac should have known scout doesnt mean alarm we were flying around a bend and ran into them quicker than we expected just beyond that next rise they were more spread out then barr whispered back theyve only moved on about a mile since dag squinted into the shimmer trying to number mudman heads gave up and said to barr count em has it changed barrs younger eyes narrowed intently his lips moved twentysix now hey that cant be right dag didnt think sumac had miscounted it must have drawn in its scouts for defense and to replace the fallen which is no bad result this close to the malice dag didnt dare open his groundsense to check but he saw no sign of flanking mudmen moving through the nearby scrub any more distant mudmen were not a tactical consideration the enemy was closing the gap if at a shambling pace let them do most of the walking good dag slid back down to the clearing the horses had been tied patroller style that is reins wrapped up so as not to trail and heavily persuaded to stay together because you wouldnt want to physically tether a horse you might need to summon nor risk leaving the poor beasts helpless if no one returned to release them he rechecked copperhead then turned to order his patrol keeping his voice low all right we have the advantage of this rise here which i mean to keep as soon as the malice and its mudmen are in bow shot if they havent spotted us and turned tail first i whit tavia and barr will try to take down as many as we can till we run out of arrows after that its a wild pig hunt with spears and knives except pigs arent smart enough to gang up on you and mudmen are try not to get separated and become a target and keep an eye out for anyone who does dont stop to finish off your mudman if its too disabled to move but be aware theyll keep coming at you even when hurt as long as their malice is alive and remember the mudmen are just a noisy diversion the only target that counts is the malice and getting rase and his knife up to it try to circle behind it rase the patroller swallowed set his shoulders nodded forced his hand clutching the knife slung around his neck back to his side dag drew breath and went on swiftly im shifting your usual partnerships around neeta and remo both will partner with rase flanking him like linkers because they have the best ground veiling to be that close to the malice and neeta has some experience neeta flashed a nervous but pleased smile and ducked her chin that leaves barr with tavia and whit with me that pleased barr certainly whit blinked in shy pride without whit along dag would have partnered rase guiding him in to his first kill whit had slain bandits mudmen wouldnt shake him unduly but if the ground shield failed the boy risked groundripping oralmost worsemind slaving if the latter happened dag hoped he wouldnt have to do more than clout his tentbrother on the head to put him out of the way till the malice went down but that wasnt a task he dared leave to anyone else he did not voice the risk not wanting to put whit off his stride we dont have to worry about surrounding the malice once its close to our position its moving so slow that when the mudmen are out of the way well almost be able to overtake it walking butlisten close whit because this is where it gets different than a pig hunttaking on the malice is more like attacking a big bear and not one of the cute black bears you find around here but a big northern grizzly its strong it swings around fast and it can knock a man thirty feet if it connects with you only the sharing knife will kill it so you concentrate on the mudmen and leave the malice to rase and his partners got it yessir said whit eyes wide all right get a drink or a piss now if you need to keep your grounds shut tight no talking from here on tavia and barr find your best shooting positions whit stay by me dag went to copperhead and collected his adapted bow and arrows he hitched his quiver over his shoulder unbolted his hook from its wooden wrist cuff and dropped it in the leather pouch at his waist seated the bow in its place and locked it down he tested the draw strings dry and sound whit came bounding up swinging his crossbow and dag thought to whisper dont cock that thing till i fire my first shot noisy ratchet whit nodded understanding except for an occasional faint clink of gear or snort from a horse dags makeshift patrol was moving in proper uncanny silence now he had nothing to do but find a good line of sight from the cover of the rocky rise hunker down and wait for things to go wrong the malice stopped barely two hundred paces off a little to their right where the road started to bend around the outcrop it seemed to sniff the air swinging its great hairless head back and forth seven feet tall at least and dag guessed from its livid mottled skin that its initial lair must have lain among gray rocks which didnt narrow it much thousands of dells cracks caves and overhangs lined this valley the malice looked quite odd standing out naked in the sunlit green space it belonged hidden in cold shadow where spring didnt reach and ice lingered and its monstrousness might be concealed dag didnt know how much those glittering toohuman eyes lurking under brows like their own little limestone overhangs could see in this light he prayed the other patrollers had their grounds furled as tightly as his own shielded whit would be an ambiguous glow in its groundsense a smudgy something alive yet elusive it could likely sense the horses by now growing uneasy behind the rocks it certainly sensed something because it snorted and a dozen of its mudmen left the road and began to wade through the waisthigh scrub toward the outcrop even the mudmen flinched from last years thorns on the dry blackberry canes which crackled as they fought through them the angle between dags position and barr and tavias was not as wide for crossfire as he would have liked but their elevation was excellent yes thats perfect come closer you suffering brutes yes dag held his steelheaded arrow loosely nocked and waited some more whit was watching him crossbow clenched and bolt at the ready with his eyes going wider and wider as if to cry now now now dag knelt up leisurely taking his first and last chance for a perfect shot he would try for an eye on that approaching possumman or it might once have been a rabbit the peculiar relaxation overcame him that occurred when all decision making was over as when an arrow had been released but not yet found its target speaking of which he drew settled released yes he hissed brainshot the possumman squalled once fell thrashed and went still dag nocked and drew again while the wild cranking of whits crossbow mechanism stuttered beside him his second arrow flew just before whits first dags brows twitched up at the thwackcrack of whits heavy bolt striking a mudmans arm a belly or brain shot would have been better but he could swear that bone just broke within its short range the weapons projectiles packed an impressive punch from the corner of his eye he saw more arrows dart out two hits followed by roaring and howling the mudmen boiled forward crunching madly up the slope which was just fine as long as the arrows lasted whits next ratchetandthrum resulted in a clear miss but after that was a hard hit that knocked a looming tufteared foxman backward down the slope dag was not yet out of arrows when the few mudmen remaining on their feet began to turn tail or at least withdraw toward their master dag didnt bother counting the ones down just the ones still up some had arrows sticking out of them at odd angles and shrieked in pain but they werent stumbling nearly enough to suit dag the malice had actually knelt down its vast gut resting on the road between its spread knees but it wallowed upright again as its dozen remaining guards drew back around it dag let his bow arm swing down out of the way and drew his war knife all right it wont get any better out of bolts whit started to let his crossbow fall but dag said hang it on your back you might get the chance to collect a few of your misses or hits whit shrugged the carrying strap across his chest and took up the ash spear he had borrowed from sage the boy yelled once in excitement as they began to run noticed that everyone else was advancing in dead silence and clamped his mouth shut dag let him plunge ahead and spend his eagerness threshing a path through the thorny scrub for which the waving spear proved unexpectedly useful barr and tavia wove down the slope to his right with the sharingknife threesome close behind them they spread out around the malice its mudmen responded by throwing rocks with which this country was only too well supplied their whistling power was nasty but fortunately the aim was mostly bad though remo yelped as one bounced off his shoulder the malice turned around and around roaring horribly but did not retreat closing and careful dag expended two of his last four steeltipped arrows putting mudmen down to stay another pair lurched toward them one ran up on whits spear ripping it from his hands but then falling over its impalement in a tangle dags war knife opened his mudman from groin to breastbone whit paused to yank back one of his bolts from the fallen creatures leg shaking it free of gore a cudgelwaving mudman charged toward rase bowling barr over swiftly dag sent an arrow after it as his threesome kept trying to circle behind the malice who kept rotating to face them inspired whit raised his bow and shot his retrieved bolt at the malice it thwacked hard into the creatures left shoulder and vanished the malice screamed and heaved its awkward body around on its left breast its gray skin parted from that mouth the bolt spat into the malices upreaching hand the skin rippled closed again while the malice was winding its arm back to throw the bolt like a dart it would not miss dag stepped in front of whit who was gibbering did you see that come flyin out just like a watermelon seed shouldve gone through its heart even through his tight veiling dag could feel the malice reaching out to groundrip his tentbrother the power of it would pry open whits shield like a mussel shell given enough time which of course was also true of ground veiling the huge arm bunched whits shot had been futile as a blow but perfect as a distraction in the malices momentary and terrible shift of focus rase face gone white darted up behind it shut his eyes and thrust out the pale blade of his sharing knife the faint crack as the bone split and released its hoarded death into the malice was the sweetest sound dag could imagine the malices scream shot upward in pitch till it felt like hot needles thrust into dags eardrums whit clamped his hands over his own ears and bent mouth opening and closing on words dag could not make out rase neeta and remo all stumbled backward rase grazed by the malices deathly aura was curling in on himself and starting to vomit already slowly starting at the top of its ridged skull the malice began to fall apart pieces flaking off and spinning away in a stinking cloud destruction spiraled downward faster and faster yet slowed when it reached the outthrust torso the remains of the creaturegod man monster or some clot of all threeslumped in a pile in the middle of the road several hundred pounds of slimy rubble the sudden silence was a blessing beyond imagining dag eyed the great formless lump drew cranes primed knife from the leather sheath hung at his throat and advanced cautiously he was going to have to open his ground just a hair to check this and then he was going to regret it the smell was bad enough the lingering wrongness blasted through dag with the force of a bitter wind in a luthlian winter his belly knotted and his mouth watered uncontrollably but the new malice body forming inside the old one was dead too or never alive dag clamped his ground and his jaw shut again put the knife away and swallowed hard against his late lunch demanding instant escape whit was shaken but standing barr was sitting on the ground holding his bleeding head tavia with a bright red mark on her face that was going to be a dark blue bruise soon knelt beside him trying to pull his hands away to check the damage rase was now on all fours emptying his guts with remo bent beside him in concern and neeta watching warily whit neeta dag called were not done yet got to clean up all the mudmen within reach easy reach at least only a couple of the creatures had escaped across the road trying to find concealment in the riverbanks or in the scrub up toward the far ridge they were mindless nowor rather and more dreadfully returned to their animal minds trapped in their humanlike bodies they would die on their own but only after lingering agonies the ones still alive in the broken brambles were making the most vile noises animal screams mixed with almost humansounding weeping dag paused to swap out his bow for his hook again and drew his knife once more the downed mudmen were still dangerous in their thrashings so the three of them worked together two to hold them down and one to slice through those pitiable throats ending what should never have begun it was rightful mercy and dag hated every wretched minute of it but the youngsters didnt need to see that so he set a methodical and thorough example for the thousandth time they collected as many of everyones spent arrows as they could find dag made sure rase wasnt vomiting blood then set remo to haul him back to the horses away from the remains of the malice tavia supported barr who looked impressively goryscalp wounds bled like wellspringsbut had suffered no skull cracks dag assigned neeta to ride after the farmers and get them turned around once more tell them well meet by the wagons as the swift hoofbeats of her mount receded whit circled the smelly mound piled up in the middle of the road shaking his head in new amazement that thing must have weighed six eight hundred pounds did fawns malice look like that one he asked dag pretty much except the glassforge malice was more dangerous not being on the verge of a molt the glassforge malice had also acquired language this one seemed not to have which suggested hopefully that it had not yet taken any human victims how do those molts work you keep talking about them like they was a bad thing dag shrugged you understand how mudmen are made right the malice places a live animal in the soil and alters the creatures ground to impel its body to grow into a human form i heard fawn describe the ones she saw in raintree i wouldnt rightly claim to understand it but i guess i get the picture ground is the underlying truth of the world the malice turns it into a lie or at least into something else and the matter labors to match it whit looked much blanker dag swiftly gave up on maker theory its like the malice uses its own body as a mudpot to grow its new one in a newer better more advanced usually more humanlooking one depending on what people or animals the malice has found to consume groundrip that is a malice uses those grounds to teach its new body how to grow whits nose wrinkled youre saying the malice gives birth to itself theres a reason we call it molting and not birth when it reaches full size the malice abandons its old body which dies around the new one and the new one er fights its way out of the old skin the new body is usually near as big as the old so a malice on the verge of a molt is sessileimmobile it holes up for days or weeks and doesnt move till the process is complete theyre pretty helpless at that stage and easy well easierto slay what about when it gets more human like the one you saw in raintree that you said was so beautiful same process messier i guess they tend to molt less often as they advance whit stared at the pile of rubble and scratched his head huh you wouldnt want fawn to see that just now i reckon trust whit to blurt out what was better left unsaid dag didnt know whether to laugh or sigh no he agreed i sure wouldnt but whit was already in pursuit of another thought soback when you two met near glassforge fawn did what rase just did more or less yes she slew a malice with a primed sharing knife just like that whit was silent for a very long time my little sister he finally said his tone was not especially readable but dag thought it might be wonder or awe huh fawn was relieved to camp that night back at the shallow ford where theyd left the wagons despite the exhausting trek to regain it grouse wasnt the only farmer to grumble about having ridden twelve miles down the road only to ride twelve miles back just the loudest it was a long days work to end up right back where we started what did we gain practice said sumac without sympathy practice is never wasted once fawn had convinced herself of dags uninjured state she viewed the victorious but battered patrol with what concern she had left over whit assured her that barr yelped far more for arkady stitching up his head than he had for the mudman hitting him with the original rock remo moved stiffly and couldnt raise his right arm higher than his shoulder but made no complaint everyone including tavia seemed to think the bruise on tavias face was more showy than serious rase untouched by any blow was by far the sickest fawn gladly shared her dwindling stock of antinausea medicine with him but it was after sunset before he could keep so much as a sip of water down dag seemed unalarmed but made sure the boy stayed in his bedroll the lakewalkers all agreed rase deserved a proper bowdown a party patrollerstyle to celebrate his first malice kill but that it would have to be put off till he was in shape to enjoy it which dag said could be as much as a week the patrollers collected around the fire after supper to piece together rases spent knife and carefully wrap the shards in a makeshift cloth shroud until it could be returned to new elm camp for burial they didnt seem grave enough for fawn to call it a ritual nor cheery enough to call it a celebration but sumac led them in a song fawn recognized from the bowdown shed seen back in glassforgenot with a bone flute this time just with naked voices the words turned out to be not about malices or death or sacrifice but about a garden by a lakeside where two lovers met it ought to have sounded lyrical but somehow came out more like a hymn fawn could not have said why but she felt the tune must be very old berry listening as the verses found their culmination drew her hickorywood fiddle from its bag and despite her healing fingers took up the melody in winding variations each sweeter than the last the flickering firelight gleamed off tracks of tears on rases face as he listened from his bedroll and when she finished he murmured thank you very sincerely fawn wondered how close to his greatgrandfather the young patroller had been berry lightened the mood with a brisker reel inspiring plum to drag her little brother owlet to the fireside in a valiant attempt to dance the two held hands and swung arms with more enthusiasm than grace and owlet squealed his delight as plum twirled her skirts in this warm weather owlet ran about dressed in a castoff shirt as good as a gown on him and nothing else below the hem his dimpled knees pumped and his little bare feet tromped the dirt and even bo and dag smiled after berry shook out her hands and put the fiddle away bo offered a tale or two both outrageously unlikely which led to some reminiscing from the patrollers the likelihood of which was harder to judge a few hoarded bottles passed from hand to hand arkadys contribution won the most respect the one sip that fawn dared went down like liquid fire even grouse took a swallow of that one when the moon rose fawn lay in their bedroll and listened to the munching and muffled snorting of the grazing animals scattered up the creek side from the way hed picked at his dinner she thought dag shared some of rases queasiness but she wasnt sure how it compared with how hed felt after the glassforge malice as shed been in no condition then to notice so had rases ground veiling just been unpracticed or would he grow into a maker someday too dag walked his perimeter patrol very wide it was a long time before he joined her they found their familiar positions legs interlaced beneath the blankets facetoface in the silvered dark was it a hard fight today she asked stroking his furrowed forehead winding her fingers in the unruly curls of his hair in which no gray strands yet gleamed no as straightforward as any other sessile truth to tell did whits shield work right as far as i could tell well i dont know how long it would have stood up to a serious attempt at groundripping but it resisted mind slaving if only because it made whits ground so blurry the malice couldnt figure out what he was we didnt give it time to puzzle out the problem your patrollers were all right oh yes fawn said carefully im not sure they know you think that youve been sort of grim and glum tonight his brows lifted the youngsters did very well whit too he pulled his weight and they all saw that he did wont any of em look at farmers quite the same way again i daresay he was silent a moment its the malice bothers me why he drew breath let it out slowly i dont know it just niggles every malice is akin yet every one is a little different why was it out on the road like that maybe it was just changing its lair looking for a better place to molt possibly dag didnt sound convinced but this one seemed awfully aggressive for a premolt usually by the time they reach that stage they just lay up and let their mudmen bring them their prey maybe i dont know maybe it groundripped some rabid animals i dont think it would work like that he shook his head hugging her in close as she turned to fit the curve of his body but ill say a few good words to the youngsters tomorrow they earned it the next day dawned clear the company made a creaky but willing enough start shortly thereafter rase had recovered enough to sit his horse although he had to let indigo saddle it and two of his comrades help boost him aboard four miles up the road came a delay when everyone who hadnt been on the battlefield got dragged over it by everyone who had for a blowbyblow description of the fight fawn watched from atop magpie a trifle worried about the effect any lingering blight might have on her child she was waiting eagerly for the first flutter of quickening down there deep in her belly she had not confessed even to dag her unfounded conviction that if only she could bring this pregnancy past the point where her first had failed it would be a sign of hope like breaking a curse to encounter a malice just now bringing back such evil memories had shaken her more than shed let on but whit and the patrollers finished babbling about their every bow shot at last and they moved on late in the morning they came upon the spot where dag said the malice must have first turned onto the road and dag led a mixed party of patrollers and farmer boys up toward the eastern ridge to search for the lair sumac stayed with the wagons to watch over rase with neeta who had seen lairs in luthlia assigned as support bo also declined the treat and hod as usual stuck by him berry grinning leaned across her saddlebow to whisper to fawn i expected bo to have a worse head than this come this morning at midnight last night he was swearin to me hed seen bats the size of turkey vultures flyin over the moon were they anything like the hoop snakes he told me southern folks used as wagon wheels said fawn or the alligators hitched up in teams to draw racing boats in the swamps or the time it rained so hard that he saw catfish swimming up the road overhead and fellows caught them in their hats i expect so this fish wasnt biting though fawn snickered and kicked magpie along she wouldnt be surprised if bo had seen vultures those unburied mudmen corpses stank and would draw scavengers soon did vultures search for carrion by moonlight the fire scrub ran on for miles and fawn tried to imagine the size of the blaze that had leveled these woods how fast had the wind whipped the orange wall of death she was reminded that malices were far from the only great uncaring hazard in the world between being burned to death or blighted she could see little to choose yet the fire scars were recovering in years not decades or centuries and from the point of view of blackberry brambles and fireweed might almost be considered a blessing her ruminations grew darker when they stopped for lunch at a stream crossing by what was plainly a burnedout village destroyed by that same threeyearsback fire the lack of settlers in this valley seemed suddenly explained she walked among the traces of houses and sheds blackened char sticking out from the green weeds like bones through skin we could stop right here said grouse eyeing the bit of flat land along the feeder creek that had doubtless been what first attracted the burnedout folks im not stopping in this accursed country said vio sharply monsters and fires and bearmen and who knows what all she had to break off to run and rescue her toddler owlet from a determined attempt to fall headfirst into an old well as she was snatching him away from death and he was thrashing mightily in protest she glanced down and shrieked fawn hurried to her side as did sage and everyone else in earshot the sun overhead lit the well shaft revealing a mess of bones at the bottom all tangled together the flesh was gone but a few scraps of hair and clothing still showed they must have gone down into the water there to try to get away from the flames said sumac coming over to look and suffocated when the fire passed over or drowned opined bo if they climbed on each other fawn swallowed and walked quickly away several sizes of bones down there a family a couple of families maybe wasnt there anyone left even to bury these asked calla maybe the survivors decided to let this be their grave offered sage not wanting it for a well anymore after some debate it was decided to leave the wellgrave as it had been found fawn had lost her appetite for lunch and was glad to be gone from the haunted place the malice lair expedition dropped down to rejoin them a few miles farther on dag had told arkady he would be sorry if he came along and the maker looked it his face clammy with a raselike paleness sumac hurried to help him but he just shook his head the two parties traded firevillage and malicelair descriptions equally gruesome and for once bo offered no silly tales to top them late in the afternoon fawn found herself riding between dag and finch at the head of the company everyone was starting to keep an eye out for a likely spot to camp for the night dag said that they might reach the pass at the head of this long valley late tomorrow a debate was afoot whether it would be better to rest the animals for a day before or a day after the climb but fawn thought most folks were in favor of after no one much liked this country anymore finch was still full of his first sight of a malice lair never would have believed everything dead gray for two hundred paces around and those pocky holes where the mudmen came out just like you said fawn was it very bad fawn asked dag shook his head nothing you havent seen spark and less it still puzzles me he turned in his saddle frowning i sure wish wed seen some other traffic today either direction sumac was riding behind them along with a recovered but rather quiet arkady that reminds me dag she remarked we should log a report at laurel gap camp they should have cleaned out that malice before we found it writing a patrol report ah yes said dag thatll be a good thing for you to teach the youngsters how to do she stuck out her tongue at him he grinned unrepentantly but added we can leave it at the courier drop point in blackwater mills when we get there no need to go out of our way though id sure like to know where their patrol has got to said sumac dag grimaced aye his puzzled gloom returned inspired fawn sat up in her saddle what if that malice wasnt attacking us dag what if it was running away from something what does a malice have to run away from asked finch fawn brightened further patrollers maybe well run into those laurel gap patrollers up the road a piece will they be mad that we poached their malice asked finch who hadnt been there when the malice had been slain any more than fawn had but somehow whit as representative farmer cast a reflected glory on all the boys fawn didnt think it a bad thing after a time said dag you learn therere plenty to go around we dont hoard them sumac said though i trust the laurel gap patrol will be embarrassed in fact uncle dag i believe i will write that report just to make sure of it dags smile flickered but faded again i shouldnt think that malice wouldve run from a patrol in the first place it was so newhatched it wouldnt have known to and in the second malices regard us as meals on legs itd be like running away from your dinner we try to make the sharing knives a surprise to them which gave fawn a peculiar picture of her next meal leaping up off her plate grabbing her knife and attacking her she shook it from her head she didnt want to try to imagine what malices thought she was afraid she might succeed maybe she needed a nap she glanced up at dag and her belly went cold his face had gone absolutely expressionless as if hed just had an idea he really really didnt care for not likely he breathed what isnt likely beloved the fire blight was at last giving way to patches of neverburned trees a quarter mile up the road fawn could see a clear line where the woods closed back in had sudden rain saved it or a change of wind direction the suns rim touched the western ridgetop whose eastern slopes were already in shadow she squinted at movement near the road at the tree line doubly dusky id vote for the first good stream past the trees for camp tonight said finch peering too huh what is that turkey vultures have got themselves a party looks like half a dozen dark flapping shapes surrounded a carcass a goat said fawn a dog maybe a fawn said finch then snickered at her peeved expression dag stood abruptly in his stirrups staring hard thats not a goat its a mule cant be scoffed finch thatd make those bird wings ten twelve feet across those arent birds sumac lend me your eyes and your groundsense sumac kneed her horse forward peering along with dag her breath hissed in what the dag what are those ugly things mud men his voice sounded remarkably unsure mudbat things no feathers joints are wrong for birds bat wings malices can make batmen said finch blankly why didnt you say ive never seen the like said dag wolfmen and dire wolves yes so why not bats fawn could think of a dozen good reasons why not bats right up there with why not alligators no ick eew absent gods theyre huge said arkady whod ridden up to look his voice held a very unarkadylike quaver at the mule carcass one shape was driven back by its feasting friends it spread long leathery wings and vented a sharp snarl like a mill saw jamming more leftovers said fawn like the ones you said got away over the river she hoped fervently that these were leftovers because the alternative what in the wide green world would a malice have to run from nothing excepta worse malice are those hands at the tops of those wing joints said sumac with claws blight said dag fawn finch ride back and stop the wagons sumac round up the patrollers im going for a closer look not alone youre not said sumac sharply arkady you alert the patrollers arkady gulped nodded and wheeled his horse reluctantly fawn followed turning awkwardly in her saddle to watch over her shoulder as dag and sumac cantered up to the carcass the batcreatures scattered from it making more jammingsaw noises they were awkward crawling on the ground with their wings trailing like halffolded tent awnings two clawed their way up nearby trees others made for a pile of rocks scuttling up one after or over another to gain height another turned and screamed rearing up and flapping its wide leathery wings like a crowing rooster both dags and sumacs horses spooked pivoting and trying to bolt dag couldnt force copperhead close enough to slash with his knife but did persuade his mount to spin and lash out with both hind legs the shod hooves connected fawn could hear the bonecrack the batcreature screamed again and flapped over the ground trailing its broken wing copperhead bounced wildly the batcreatures whod made it to the rock pile took off one after the other in great noisy wing flaps barely clearing the ground before they started their climb into the air they could fly oh no roughly batshaped with flat oddly rectangular bodies like a flying squirrels heads large with backswept pointed ears fawn couldnt see the shapes of their mouths from here worse they could fly well gaining height the nightmare trio sped off over the woods sumac gestured mouth moving dag nodded both came galloping back to the wagons get everybody turned around dag gasped not again wailed grouse fawn hesitated dagits open country for miles behind us if those things can drop down out of the air on usand it sure looked like they couldwouldnt we be better off amongst the trees where theyd tangle their wings he stared at her openmouthed eyes dilated ah he wheezed point at least called sumac whose horrified horse still fought her close up under the trees till we can scout and take stock knives are going to be no good on those things we want spears and bows axes too suggested fawn the ones with the good long hafts everyone who was mounted rode up and clustered around to listen sage left their teams reins to calla and came running up to hear as well shrewdly he bore his longhandled sledgehammer though his hands shook as he clutched it the wagons lurched forward once more fawn stuck close to callas all the patrollers except rase and half the farmer boys rode forward to make another attempt at slaying the mudbats they closed rapidly on the fallen one when they parted the shape lay still like a collapsed tent the remaining two seemed to have snared themselves in their tree branches a rider might reach one with a spear but the horses wouldnt go near whit had already dismounted fawn could hear the ratcheting of his crossbow and see him exchanging gestures with sumac about the angle of his shot so fawn had a clear view when a black cloud of about fifty of the batthings burst over the eastern ridge and stooped upon them shed never been much for shrieking or making squeaky girly noises but she screamed in earnest now magpie reacted to the vast flapping wings much like the other mounts plunging under fawn and almost unseating her carrying her away from the wagons in an allout attempt to bolt if only the mare had run toward the trees fawn would have let her carry on fawn sawed the reins trying to get magpies head turned around in the hopes that her body would follow water streamed from fawns eyes and whipped away in the wind as she bounced in her saddle she gasped in terror of falling hard and maybe losing the baby till she realized that at this speed she was more like to break her neck the thought was oddly liberating she gripped with her legs felt herself slipping with every hard stride then abandoned her reins to grab her pommel every animal in the party was bolting or trying to the basswoods wagon was slowed because the two leader mules were tangled in their traces and sage and callas wagon was jammed behind it grouse had evidently fallen off but he leaped after his rig jabbing upwards at mudbats with his spear vio was braced on the box with one hand around the roof hoop and the other swinging an iron skillet the wagon was covered with swarming batcreatures much as theyd mobbed the dead mule they used their wing hands to hold on mostly but tore strips out of the canvas roof with their clawed feet reaching down as if feeling around inside vio banged her skillet down on the clutching claws like a hammer which made them jerk back and whanged other mudbats in the face or body as she could reach she drove off some but more came vios screams shattered when a batcreature beat its wings and began to rise clutching her toddler in its two feet owlets mouth went square with terror and pain as he was lifted into the air his shirttail flapping wildly around his churning knees from the corner of fawns eye she saw a patroller boy she wasnt sure which one unseated and pulled struggling from his horse three mighty wing beats and he fought free only to fall with a cry cut off too sharp and a sickening bonecrack noise arm leg neck yanked around by magpie fawn couldnt see where he fell a stench and a hot wind buffeted fawn in the back and suddenly a clawed foot anchored itself in her shoulder her cry of pain came out a stretched wail go away go away go away as she beat at the creature with her hands only to have it grab her around her other arm and flap its vast wings again and again its claws were like iron its thin muscles like cable without the grip on her pommel she began to rise from her saddle and frantically wrapped one foot into a stirrup strap galloping magpie jerked them along as if the mudbat was a kite and fawn the kite string if the creature let go and she fell she could be dragged by her ankle but if she let go she could be carried off like owlet copperhead half bolting half bucking appeared in the right of fawns vision dag was somehow still aboard gasping for air gold eyes demented there was no sign of his steel knife but he swiped frantically with his hook and connected at least once tearing a strip from a leathery wing beating against his face the mudbat yelped and drew its foot claws from fawns right shoulder which welled with blood at dags next swipe the mudbat caught his hook in its foot and held hard releasing fawns left arm too she grabbed at her saddle as she fell ripping several fingernails half off but yanked her ankle from her stirrup strap and came tumbling to the ground on her feet and not her head rolling in the damp earth and weeds she scrambled to her knees rearing around dizzily and trying to spot dag again magpie shied away copperhead made frantic by the flapping monster fixed overhead got his head down and gave a mighty twisting buck that would have launched his rider into the air even without the aid of a mudbat a second mudbat swooped near take leg screeched the first as dag wrenched kicked punched and struggled the second mudbat got a claw into one of his boots then brought its other foot down for an iron grip on dags ankle somehow the two sorted themselves out so their beating wings didnt knock into one another and rose higher they talk they have wits they work with each other oh no no fawn staggered along beneath the swooping shadow she thought she was crying but no sound seemed to be coming out of her bonedry throat higher overhead dag twisted heaved swore fawn remembered the falling patroller and screamed upward dag dont fight them till youre closer to the ground he stared down wildly at her seemed to realize how high hed been dragged and abruptly froze he heard he understood oh thanks be with his hand still free he clawed at his throat snapped the leather thong that held cranes knife spark take the knife she stared up openmouthed bewildered the sheathed knife fell turning in air into the weeds where it bounced unbroken in soft soil she looked up to see dag rising higher higher in the distance the howling toddler was being carried eastward behind him a madly flapping mudbat seemed also to have tavia although it was struggling for altitude with her greater weight fawn didnt think the evil things could weigh more than forty pounds wings and all but the biggest ones seemed to be able to lift upwards of a hundred fawn weighed less she squirmed in the dirt and sought a wellanchored sapling to grip as more mudbats swooped overhead but they didnt appear to be able to take prey right off the ground without fouling their wings once fallen and awkward they could be outrun even by her she thought she raised her head again the wagons and the riders had reached the shelter of the trees a litter of dead or injured mudbats left in their wake the slaughter was no consolation tavias horse was down making dreadful noises gutgouged and bleeding some mudbats were attracted to its helplessness like the swarm around the dead mule but most of the survivors took to the air and followed their comrades bearing the captives screeching garbled abuse and clear calls to come at the hungry lingerers along the woods edge to the east fawn thought she glimpsed sumac spurring her horse in and out of the trees in a futile effort to follow fawn crawled forward and gathered up the sharing knife gripping it with trembling bloodied fingers whit galloped back out from under the trees toward fawn slid from his saddle threw her up and climbed after she drew breath in stuttering gasps unable to speak but stuffed the knife in her shirt as they dashed for the woods once more beneath the screen of the branches at last she slid down then down to her knees shaking too hard to stand she wanted to faint to escape this horrific moment but shed never mastered that trick she was going to have to get up and deal with whatever came next he giv you his knife whyd he drop you that knife whit wheezed last thing neeta scratched bleeding and wild strode up i saw madness dags got as good a chance of using it as we dobetter absent gods its the only sharing knife we have left fawn stared fearfully up through the leaves at the luminous empty sky and thought no hes got one other people had dreams about flying dag had heard he might have nightmares about it in the future if he lived just now that wasnt looking down he shuddered for breath that would not come the world wheeled wildly beneath him like a map grown green and alive the mudbats flapping wings were as thunderous as a tent coming loose in a windstorm horses looked strange from this angle legless ovoids with questing heads copperhead and magpie were running off riderless and bucking had fawn fallen where there too still noshe lunged up scuttled dove under a little tree that seemed much too scant a cover alive so far so far on the next whirl he glimpsed sumac face raised whipping her horse in and out of the fringe of the woods she fell behind the mudbats lurched and swooped at a terrific pace unimpeded by any barrier no wrong the mudbats were laboring hard to clear the eastern ridge dag abandoned thought of the knife in his boot in favor of getting his hand around the other ankle of the mudbat that gripped his hook it would not be able to drop him wholly at its convenience the mudbat shook its back foot and made an angry screeching noise but in this position was almost as helpless to fight as dag the feeling that his skull was exploding in his panic eased slightly with this doubtlessfalse sense of control fawn had seen the problem at once while his head had still been swinging around if he fought free at this heightthe blurring fall the hot crunch of impacteven arkady wouldnt be able to put the pieces together again blight i only look like i know what im doing because so much of it is the same doings of the past forty years the truly new uncovered his weaknesses such as now when he wanted down with a desperate desire but not that fast he stiffened his neck and tried to look in some other direction most of the surviving mudbats had winged ahead but the burdened ones lagged the screaming toddleroh i hear you and agree little brother was not far in front of him if higher up at least owlets mudbat seemed to have its back claws locked around the childs thin arms not cruelly piercing them the way the other had caught fawns shoulder tavia was ahead and lower struggling she too had hit on the notion of wrapping her hands around her captors back ankles she twisted and kicked air dragging her mudbat closer to the ridge which seemed to rise below them the gray rocks looked bony and lethal the trees like pittrap stakes could dag force a similar descent without being dropped or falling once they wobbled across the high line the ground would fall away again best chance if he could somehow get rid of the mudbat holding up his right boot the other would not be able to support his weight he kicked without effect but to elicit some nasty hissing and a tighter grip that hoisted his right leg higher at a more awkward angle how close was the malice the mudbats strung out ahead seemed to be aiming to clear the next ridge as well a good four miles off at least that far dag dared to ease open his groundsense reaching upward into the mudbat bodies as he would examine a distressed patient their thinwalled chests heaved their big hearts pounded with their exertion their grounds were a horror but he ignored that he focused on the second mudbat closer up and deeper in deeper in the ridge was coming up fast there was no time forthere was no time he organized a projection reached in and groundripped a pinhole in the great artery exiting the mudbats heart three straining flaps three thumping heartbeats and the vessel split asunder the mudbats mouth opened on a pained roar its eyes rolled back and it fell away its clutching claws tearing loose from dags boot it tumbled into the trees dags remaining mudbat lurched in surprise redoubling its efforts owlets mudbat turned and swooped nearer calling in confusion come come its this or the poor tad is malice food dag had once been partly groundripped by a malice as painful deaths went there wasnt much to choose between that and plummeting onto rocks dag reached again at his fullest stretch this time he went for the big vein entering the heart a touch slower to take effect maybe he felt the pop withdrew at once owlets mudbat shrieked choked flapped more slowly began spiraling down crashed into whipping branches owlets screams stopped too suddenly dags mudbat was falling too it released its grip on his hook tried to shake him off but the release gave dag back a weapon he clawed upwards catching and ripping skin from the creatures short rear legs tearing tatters in the lower edges of the leathery wings blood spun out like a shower of raindrops bright red the branches of a beech tree came up around them with a whoosh and crackle the mudbats twisting wings caught jerked loose caught jerked together mudbat and prey descended in a neckwrenching stutter and a shower of leaf bits and twigs just when dag was figuring that his next greatest danger would be the mudbat falling atop him his sweaty grip was yanked loose from the bloody ankle and he plummeted he tried to take the impact on bending knees rolling but lost everything on the steep slope a looping root strong as a hawser caught his right ankle and wrenched it violently but it stopped him tumbling tail over teakettle down the mountainside then the mudbat landed on him snarling in a world beyond pain dag fought his way out from under the choking black envelope of those wings his hand closed on the first stout weapon he could find a broken branch he swung it high and began beating in the creatures thin skull with frantic strokes on the third swing he caught his first close look at its big brown eyes blinking up at him ow it said in a miserable voice hurts a human voice an animals eyes a childs bewilderment as to why these terrible things should be happening to it the mudbat shuddered choked and died dag chest heaving for air bent over and heaved in truth there wasnt much in his belly small favors oh absent absent gods he folded in a boneless heap he supposed from the wet and slime on his face that he was crying although some of it might be blood he didnt care he put his arms over his head and bawled his regained control of his breath and wits in a few minutes overwrought didnt begin to describe his state of mind and body which shuddered like grouse in the throes of his ague he lifted his right hand and found the wedding cord wrapping his left arm and gripped it through the torn fabric of his shirt alive sparks alive she needs you start with that upon that foundation he could stand or at least sit up his wrenched ankle was throbbing under his boot he eyed it with disfavor turning his groundsense upon himself although it sent another wave of nausea through him he was fairly sure no ankle was ever supposed to fold as far sideways as that one just had he unlaced his boot and with difficulty extracted the bent steel knife staring at it in wonder theres why my anklebones not busted clean through not exactly the way hed pictured that knife saving him but it would do he relaced the boot for support before the joint could swell further ripping the mudbats had left a greasy stain in his groundarkady would doubtless disapprovebut hadnt larded him with poisonous black blight like the time hed groundripped a malice the contamination would render him unfit for gifting ground reinforcements for weeks which was likely all right as he was more wishful just now to receive some at least he hadnt traded a swift death for a slow one yet in the distance somewhere down the hill a child began crying weak muffled dag went still opened his groundsense reached out alive the tad had survived his fall dag felt around himself found a long stout stick and stripped side branches from it with his bent knife with it he levered himself onto his feet and began to make his way down the hillside as swiftly as he might with due care because he didnt think another tumble would help much the shadowless light was graying concealing detail although the sky above the leaf canopy was still luminous shot with pink streaks of high cloud the crying grew louder as he skidded from tree to tree there the black shape of a fallen mudbat lay like a discarded cloak half wrapped around a hickory trunk the weeping was coming from underneath the folds dag leaned his stick on the bole reached down and heaved the carcass aside to reveal owlet curled up and shaking the little boy looked up at dag and burst into howls dags groundsense flicked out anxiously no broken arm leg head neck or spine both eyes still blinking lungs clearly in working order scratches and gouges in plenty though a torn ear and tumbled bruising dag lowered himself with a pained grunt the child flinched away a memory flashed in dags mind of the second time hed met spark in a rough rescue from a violent assault too dizzied to tell friend from foe when shed been flung at him shed tried her level best to scratch his eyes out i guess im not a very reassuring sight he said ruefully to owlet but i do mean well the howls stopped perhaps in surprise then started up again though not as loudly absent gods hissed tavias voice cant you shut that child up itll have every mudman for a mile down on us up on us whatever tavia descended the slope lurching from sapling to sapling and fell to her knees beside dag winded no broken bones there either clearly but bruises cuts branchwhipped wheals redbrown braid undone a hank of hair torn out and her scalp oozing blood copperbrown eyes wide and wild and pulsing dag suspected his were too welcome back down he murmured glad you made it in one piece absent gods she said nobody ever said the north was full of giant bats she glared at dag as if this were somehow his fault dag stifled the impulse to apologize surprise to me too what happened to your mudbat when it couldnt clear the ridge it scraped me off in a mess of dogwood scrub and got away her jaw set in frustration but she seemed to have made a softer landing than his fortunately and um how are you with tads i was the youngest in my family she returned at once eyeing the crying toddler with alarm i dont know anything about little children farmer or otherwise ah dag sighed and extended his hand here owlet the child recoiled farther eh tavia was right about the noise reluctantly dag opened himself and shaped a persuasion for the shocked boy its all right now i wont hurt you you want to come to dag and let him make it better he left the beguilement in too for good measure mamamama owlet blubbered sorry the only mamashaped person here doesnt want to play shes just a youngin too you know im afraid youre stuck with me come here mamama but owlet stopped inching away dag reached over and pulled the child into his lap owlet abruptly reversed his opinions hiccupped and buried his slimy face in dags shirt gripping like a baby bapossum dag didnt think it would do what was left of the garment a mite of harm how did you do that asked tavia whispered actually perhaps influenced by the sudden end of the clamor cheated said dag ah tavia glanced fearfully upward seeking black motion overhead dont open your ground dag warned no no but can they see us in the dark not through trees rocks would be better you and i can veil but the tad here cant hell be a beacon do those bat things have groundsense do you think might a grim thought their maker malice must have taken a human or humans or it wouldnt have been able to gift its creations with speech had it yet taken a lakewalker stealing deeper powers well have moonrise in a while while we can still see better find us a ledge or cranny to hole up in with water near the grownups could go without their dinners but dag was parched with his late panic and owlet likely was too she looked at his ankle how is that not good ill scout then aye tavia slipped off in best patroller fashion dag waited contemplating his new burden owlet now lay on his side head pillowed on dags knee in a false calm hysteria still lurked beneath like fish circling under a frozen lake tavia returned fairly soon thankfully and they set off through the dusk along the steep hillside ledges and crevices there were in plenty water was harder to come by at this height but tavia had found a mossy trickle that would doubtless become a stream farther down it more seeped than flowed but it did collect in a natural stone bowl before slipping away they took turns putting their heads down and sucking it up owlet was harder to persuade into this novel form of drinking but he got the idea at last then was inclined to play in the puddle and then objected to being dragged away and tucked in the far back of the crevice dag would have taken the outside position but tavia clearly wanted a spacer between her and the unhappy farmer child with an overhang at the back the cleft was blocked from both vision and groundsense from five out of six directions dag was less certain that it would be blocked from invading mudbatsthey folded rather well when they werent tangled in trees but the creatures clawed hands and feet though dangerous in themselves didnt seem built to carry weaponsnot that all of this malices scouts were necessarily of the same design blocked perception unfortunately worked both ways dag wished theyd landed on the other side of this ridge overlooking the trace if he were alone hed be up and over that ridgeline already bad ankle or no where did those horrible batthings come from asked tavia peering nervously out past the narrow rock walls of their temporary refuge in the slice of purple sky dag could see one lonely star they were mudmen a malice made them not the one we slew yesterday i could tell that dag squeezed his eyes shut and open a few times trying for coherence its been over thirty years since i exchanged in these parts and that only for a season but this whole region all the way north to the grace river is limestone country in its bones shot through with sinkholes and caves and caverns and some of those caverns harbor bats thousands of bats oh no not thousands her shoulders slumped in relief millions tavias mouth fell open in a tone between hope and dismay she said thats a bo story isnt it no the biggest bat caverns are amazingly dangerous besides the risk of rabies which some bats seem to carry when they gather in such numbers their droppings poison the air people whove stumbled into one of the big caves have choked and died on the fumes though skunks and raccoons do go in to catch baby bats in the dead darknobody quite knows how they do it tavias face screwed up in mounting horror now the local patrols do search the caves but only near the surface its dangerous to go deeper though they say theres galleries and passageways running for miles underground but no malices have ever emerged from the deep caves either because they were never seeded down there or because theres no life for them to get started growing on excepti have a notionthat if a malice finally chanced to come up near or right in one of those big bat caves it would have found a feast laid out for it from the getgo off to a very fast start which could explain how it was missed between one patrol and the next thats my best guess leastways tavia poked tentatively at her hurts she could do with a stitch here or therethey all could likelybut no one was doing more than oozing by now treatment would have to wait she glanced up what has that child got in its mouth dag looked around owlet was sitting up looking very scruffy and battered with an appalled expression on his face his jaw working and drool dribbling from his lips peh he remarked dag went fishing with his little finger inchworm he remarked holding up his green catch actually more of a twoinch worm ugh dag smiled it felt strange on his set face like dry leather cracking but welcome for all of that he dug down in his pocket and drew out a dark strip here tad chew on this what is that asked tavia peering in the dimness dried plunkin i always keep a few strips in my pockets when they start to look good despite the lint and sand stuck to em you know its time to eat em owlet regarded the plunkin with considerably more suspicion than he had the worm but shortly broke down and began gnawing his false calm was beginning to be replaced with real calm dag thought for all that dag had pulled the initial persuasion out of his own ear when the child crawled back into dags lap it was as soothing as holding a purring cat moods were contagious in more than one direction it seemed which was why a leader should never break down in front of his patrollers he was grateful tavia hadnt found him any sooner his back to the warm stone dag felt strung tight between nerves and exhaustion he decided to cultivate the nerves because if the exhaustion overtook him he might not get up again for a week and they had to move again soon he felt his marriage cord for reassurance still alive but surely the malice would mount its forces for another attack the trace must seem a moving picnic to it unless the laurel gap patrollers were alerted and gathering putting on pressure north of here theres a hope and not a fools hope either buthe contemplated the unsubtle difference between arrive eventually and arrive in time well have to work out some way to carry the tad he said to tavia he cant climb these rocks dark or moonlit im thinking we could rig a sort of sling with my shirt and your vest to tie over my shoulder what about your bad ankle well im thinking one of us needs both hands free in case of trouble and thats already not me he hesitated were not going to be hunting this malice but theres no doubt itll be hunting us if it catches ushe drew breathjust so you know i have my bonded knife around my neck she stared at his throat at her hands if the job has to be done itll be at the last moment because well because but that means you wont be able to hesitate can you do the needful i dont know she answered honestly he nodded youll find your way if you have to he made his voice confident unwavering bland such situations had come up before of course though more common in legend than fact for the first time he wondered if any of those prior illfated heroes had been as desperately unwilling to share as he was right now likely a year ago this would have been easy his barren future scant grief to give up things seemed to be coming at him out of their time fatherhood for one he wanted to watch over his latecome little girl as a live papa not as a dead legend not even as a living absence as his own father had been i want to see how her tale comes out the sudden thought of her at the mercy of strangers as owlet now was at his made his heart go hollow no need to burden tavia with these reflections no nor any fraught last words either the malice he said will give you all the gumption you need trust me on this she nodded unhappily it was upwards of an hour before sumac dragged back whit almost shot her fawn looked up from the far side of the little fire where she was attempting to help calla attempt to help arkady with barr as the ominous shape loomed out of the dark and the dual gleam could be made out as sumacs eyes whit lowered his quivering crossbow give some warning why dont you he gasped i bumped grounds with neeta sumac said voice flat neeta was off in the woods somewhere trying to guard their whole perimeter by herself sumacs hair was in disarray her face branchwhipped and strained she added tightly you can see that blighted fire for a hundred paces through the trees and smell it put it out not yet said arkady in a blurry voice from deep in his trance need the boiled water sumac looked around taking in the scene in some dismay fawn thought barr lay on a blanket right boot off and trouser leg cut away his lower leg held across a towel on arkadys lap arkadys hands hovered over the bloody mess the hideous pink bone ends that had been sticking out through his burst skin earlier had been pushed beneath it once more mating up under arkadys most powerful groundsetting the maker had seemed unshaken by the bone breakthe worst fawn had ever seen or imaginedbut had complained bitterly back when hed still been able to speak about all the dirt he had to work in barrs face was the color of suet and he looked as if he wished he could pass out again as he had a couple of times so far remo gripped his whiteknuckled hand and wiped his sweating forehead with a wet cloth the rest of the group was scattered back under the trees taking care of the animals and one another when the last of the mudbats had vanished over the eastern ridge the shaken company had pushed forward a quarter mile into deeper woods then turned off the road at a shallow stream and struggled up it as far as they could drag the wagons the boys had pushed the two wagons as deeply under the cover of some spreading oak trees as they could be squeezed fawn doubted it was enough sumac ran an aggravated hand through her escaping hair if you oh blight keep the fire with all these unveiled farmer grounds and this herd of animals nothing with groundsense could miss you dark trees or no blight have a party and dance ill pass said barr weakly from his blanket it might almost have been a joke the wheezy bark it won from sumac might almost have been a laugh the laugh leached away as she met fawns anxious eyes i couldnt catch themcouldnt get near them she said other side of the river up the ridge those rocks rise up in ten and twentyfoot blocks no way for miles either side to get a horse up fawn im sorry barr squeezed his eyes shut mutely fawn held out her left wrist wrapped in its wedding cord sumacs lips parted she strode around the fire and gripped it ye gods hes still alive yes remo and arkady said we keep checking his patrol always claimed dag was a blighted cat but this how can hewhere can they have a jerky wail interrupted her as vio ran out of the dark my baby did you find owlet judging from the spasm of her hand sumac barely kept herself from flinching away she dropped fawns wrist and turned to the desperate woman no i lost them over the ridge couldnt follow how can you have lost them youre a lakewalker youre supposed to be magic sumac stiffened i cant blighted fly fawn pushed herself up to stand between the pair hitching up the torn fabric of her shirt lefthanded because her right side wasnt working too good with arkady drawn deep into the urgency of the bone break fawn had to wait for her turn so berry had done her best to clean out the deep gouges fore and aft in her shoulder wrapping them in a strip of torn cloth it would hold for the moment fawn wasnt about to complain of the throbbing pain with barr down there gritting his teeth on much worse we think dags still alive fawn said if he is hell go after the child if he can if he hadnt been dropped on those rocks like barr and left lying up there in some broken agony how do you know vio demanded because because hes dag vios mouth thinned cant we send out searchers are you mad said remo ill go by myself if none of you big men and lakewalkers will grouse coming up behind her said dont be a fool vio the girl plum hoveredskinny holloweyed dark hair straggly her distraught mama earlier had screamed at her for not helping hang on to her baby brother her frantic papa had hit her for crying she was pretty quiet now creeping to cling once more to her mamas skirts because no matter how bad it got where else did a fiveyearold have to go vio gave her husband a hard look i dont see anybody else volunteering now do i fawn put in more quietly we all lost folks neeta her partner sumac her uncle me well and if barr gets to keep his leg itll be a miracle a disagreeing grunt from arkady all in a days work for him was this if this is a contest i dont think much of the prizes fawn finished ignoring that last what we need is to work together vio stared venomously at her you cant know what its like to lose a child on the list of pointless things to say to the woman yes i do seemed pretty high up so fawn said nothing and was shortly glad of it when vios hard voice broke owlets so little sumac started to rub then winced and dabbed at her scratched face theres not a lot of question in my mind dag would have wanted me to turn back and look after you all her glance at fawn added especially you in an effort to be practical because someone needed to fawn put in we found another dead mule along the road i dont know if you had time to notice but didnt neither of those mules have their harness taken off if theyd died natural those tea caravan boys wouldnt have left their loads on em nor the hides either likely that says to me they must have been attacked and forced away or run off but we havent spotted any human bodies yet sumacs brow furrowed sounds like trouble to the north all right besides no traffic coming down i specially dont like that we havent even met anyone running away our way except for that first malice fawn pointed out there was that sumac grimaced going forward seems a bad idea going back is no better wed be open targets in that burnedover country staying heres no good either we hit that mudbat pack hard no question theyll be back looking for more but i know the worst would be to scatter into the woods with no blighted plan the others had trickled up around the firelit debate looking more mulish than their mules we should round up our weapons said ash we should agreed sumac but were too many to hide and too few to make a stand im thinking said fawn that those muleteers could have been mindslaved she looked around at the array of faces some blank and explained that scares me way more than mudmen i talked to folks at glassforge and in raintree who went through it its like you still have your wits you keep all your knowhow but suddenly you want to do whatever the malice wants of you if it wants you to attack your friends or eat your own children it seems like a fine idea at the time and you remember after the most important thing whatever else we do is to keep everyone out of range of that malice sumac bit her knuckles seemed to gather herself and spoke in the most nononsense voice fawn had yet heard from her a patrol leaders voice for sure all right this is what were doing the wounded cant run or be carried theyll have to be hid in the rocks on the valley side no matter what lie up till rescue can get to them thatll be barr arkady and rase i can fight rase quavered to fawn he looked as if he could barely stand good said sumac heartlessly because if you get found youll have to my best guess is that the malice lair lies to our east so that leaves west happens theres a lakewalker camp almost due west of here at laurel gap so we set the animals loose pull together what food and weapons we can carryand ropes well want ropesand skedaddle west over the ridges on foot tonight her voice slowed it might be best to leave plum with arkady no vio wailed your decision said sumac you have one hour to think about what this retreatll put her through and whos going to carry her fifty sixty miles over mountains at a run she turned on her heel taking in the rest of the stunned company we want to make sure we have all the bows and arrows into the hands of folks who can use them tavias bow was broken when her horse fell on it fawn said neeta got back her quiver sumac nodded remo can take barrs bow neeta can have mine whit you have yours putting the distance weapons fawn noticed solely into the hands of people who could groundveil or were shielded and did not risk mind slaving we can fight those things said finch we drove them off once speak for yourself boy growled bo looked to me like they just left cause they got bored but we cant fight their master said sumac this wants the laurel gap patrol blight this wants every lakewalker camp in the hinterland i have dags primed knife said fawn quietly he dropped it to me last thing sumacs eyebrows rose well she said that gives you two good reasons to stick tight to me fawn swallowed dag might come back looking for us or maybe tavia then theyll be able to join up with arkadys group suggested sumac hide out till we can send help fawn thought sumac drew more consolation from this notion than she did arkady looked up squinting and said in an underwater groan needle dressings splints calla and fawn hurried back to his side fawn rooting in the medicine pack you all right said sumac in what was for sumac an amazingly diffident voice ill do just dont bring me another like this for the next three days eh he grimaced at her in case you didnt hear were going to tuck up your medicine tent back in the rocks your job will be to all stay alive till we send a patrol to dig you out of your burrow again he nodded not sorry fawn guessed that it would be sumacs duty to run away from this place as fast as she could drive her farmer flock sumac packed off the splinted barr on a saplingandblanket stretcher carried by remo and whit with arkady leading his packhorse bearing the medicinetent supplies and rase staggering along after vio didnt send plum with them again fawn noticed no one without either ground veiling or a shield would know just where theyd gone to earth and so could not betray them even under a malices persuasion the company scattered to gather its gear two hours after sunset the lopsided moon rose to bathe the easternfacing ridge in milk and ink under normal conditions dag would have found it as good as daylight not tonight staggering along with his only hand full of walking stick trying to peer over the squirming burden of owlet tied to his chest ankle screaming at every step it took dag twice as long to reach the crest as hed planned he could sense tavias growing impatience maybe i should take the tad she said as they made the top and dag stood gasping and bent he waved an acknowledging hand a minute he stared out over the valley seeking beyond the silver ribbon of river the fainter line of the trace nothing moved along the road no curls of luminous smoke rose from the woods to the north either he dared to open his groundsense reaching but it was well over two miles to the valley floor beyond his range even at his best fawns still alive his marriage cord told him but where the cool damp of this blackwhitegray world falsely serene felt clammy on his sweating face something unexpected pricked his senses not below but north along the ridge faint thready tavia open and check along the ridge to our right maybe half a mile thats right at the edge of mywait a patroller not one of ours no ground i recognize hurt i think she nodded they began to pick their way between scrubby bushes around jutting rocks through weeds plants bruised by their passage gave up a sharp green smell in the dark the trees rose around them as they descended making the shadows more treacherous though they did give tavia handholds dag found that anchoring his hook on a passing sapling proved more pain than it was worth his left arm was wrenched and sore his stump swollen and uncomfortable in the wooden cuff but he hardly dared remove his arm harness for fear he wouldnt be able to get it back on tavia forged ahead he caught up to find her crouched and peering over a twentyfoot drop a huddled manshape lay at its foot a dry hoarse voice rose from below someone up there help we see you tavia called were coming down i think my back is broken the voice returned dont try to move i cant blighted move they crept along the outcrop till tavia found a steep scramble down dag was forced to go a little farther and then work his way back a patroller yes dag saw as he limped near spare of build middle height a few threads of silver gleamed in his dark hair mostly undone from its braid and scrambled around his head he lay faceup legs limp hands clenched a marriage cord frayed and faded circled his left wrist his lips were dry cracked and bleeding his ripped shirt was stained with dark dried blood already dag recognized the pattern of mudbat clawings and he was right about his back at least two vertebrae fractured about halfway down water he whispered to tavia as she bent over him oh please the mans patting hand found a leather water bottle at his side empty and flaccid and thrust it toward tavia dag she said uncertainly yes hes dangerously parched careful getting it off she unwound the strap from his neck untangled it from his hair and sped away dag lowered himself with a grunt sleepy owlet whimpered protest dag offloaded the child and rolled him to the side where he curled up in the dry dirt stubby hands relaxing again in sleep how did youngins do that go from squirming whirligigs to limp little rag dolls in a blink whore you whispered the injured man patrollers not ours help from outland he squinted up at dag in brief hope took in his battered appearance his arm harness his stick and answered his own question with a deflated not names dag bluefield n dag swallowed the nocamp traveling north with a mixed party of farmers and lakewalkers we were attacked just before sunset by a flock of those flying things mudbats they tried to carry me tavia and the tad over there across the ridge but we fought free of em were trying to get back to our people but i dont see where theyve gone lucky i was dropped the mans eyes rolled anxiously as tavia reappeared out of the moon shadows ahplease you can help him raise his head said dag but dont lift his shoulders or jostle his back tavia nodded and spent the next few minutes getting the entire skin of water down the desperately thirsty man without choking him much ah he said as she let his head down again so good gods hurts how long have you been up here asked dag the mans bladder had given way in his paralysis long enough ago for his trousers to have pretty much all dried out again that actually wasnt a good sign but the water should fix it not sure i keep fading in and out and waking up not dead surprises me one day two its been dark and light and dark where you from laurel gap aye my patrolwed heard strange reports just arrived at the head of the valley and started to sweep when those mad things fell out of the sky on us north of us then how far maybe ten fifteen miles there was a strong west wind whenever that nightmare that carried me off rode the updraft along this side it kept trying to cross the ridge like the rest but couldnt stay up over there so it was forced along farther and farther south lower and lower it finally got so exhausted it just let me go a shaken breath for an instant i thought i was going to get lucky but i slammed off that rock face and landed wrong way too hard can you feel anything below your waist weird spurts of pain sometimes but mostly not did any of your patrol get away to warn your camp gods i hope so then laurel gap should be alerted by now if anyone had escaped and followed the blighted patrol procedure as dag so often hadnt he felt a sudden new warmth toward the rules it sounds like your mudbat was trying to carry you back to the malices lair same as us which suggested the malice was still in its lair hopeful thought its a ways east of here i reckon did it capture anyone else if this malice had succeeded in groundripping a lakewalker it was primed to grow immeasurably more dangerous but the mudbats plainly had trouble transporting prey as large as a fullsize patroller not sure that thing took me off early in the fight i didnt see much except gods i used to like high views dag grimaced in sympathy you havent run across any of the rest of my patrol yet no sorry youre the first if id had a primed knifethe mans voice dropped lowthat thing could have carried me to the malice with my goodwill if i hadnt left my own bonded knife in my fool saddlebags wherever they are id have shared by now itd have to hurt less than this with this back im a dead man sooner or later youll never get me down off this ridge alive maybe your luck just got better said tavia dag heres a medicine maker the mans eyes widened with one hand im just an apprentice my wife partners me when i need two hands but shesdag lifted his head to peer out through the trees but couldnt see muchback with the others he added whats your name patroller pakko pakko sunfish laurel gap right dag opened himself dropped down and in the break was every bit as ugly as his first impression had suggested two vertebrae cracked and pushed out of alignment the spinal cord was twisted with bleeding and swelling pressing upon the nerves and creating excruciating pain one wrong move with enough force and the nerves could be sheared through or torn outright pakkos foresight was shrewd likely the very best they could do was to get the man home to die there dag wasnt sure that was a kindness his own father had shared while taken sick on patrol and been buried where hed died sending nothing home to his family but a clean bone blade would his return have merely plunged his tent into strain and grief and helpless anger to the same end no mercy there no mercy anywhere at the last but pakko didnt have his knife and dag was almost glad of it though not for pakkos sake dag came up and out again from his exploration to find the patroller staring at him with wider eyes groundsense what you see sees you theres a better medicine maker with our party a groundsetter if we can get him up here i expect we can get you down dag did not promise save your life but what arkady might do with this mess he scarcely dared guess dag was not above plunging in and trying singlehanded if things were dire enoughhed once done crude groundsetting on a man with a spurting cut throat knowing much less than he knew nowbut with water and someone to care for his immediate needs pakko didnt look to be dying just yet dag was sure he could preserve the man long enough to give him the chance to share arkady might be able to get him back to his camp and walking well enough to live and work if not patrol for many more years forty or fifty years of a mans life were too much to hazard on dags own impatience dag glanced aside at the sleeping heap of owlet these are not the responsibilities i want right now but they were the ones hed been handed he sighed tavia i need you to refill the water bottle then help me slide pakko here further under this overhang without putting strain or pressure on his back ill stay here with him and the tad you try to find arkady and the others and bring us help about time dag thought he saw her breathe tavia had been wild to do just that earlier but had been stuck with dags limping pace that he might now be sending her alone into a death trap there are no good choices here but there were less stupid ones she nodded and scrambled up glumly dag resigned himself to getting no further tonight sumac was right about the rocks there was no way to haul a horse over this terrain and fawn wasnt too sure about a gaggle of frightened farmers either or frightened lakewalkers their air of patroller grimness might conceal their anxiety from the others but shed been around dag too long to be fooled by it getting them all in motion in the same directiondisorganized for retreat as sumac tartly put ittook an agonizing amount of time by lakewalker standards that fawn found herself sharing sumac was rendered speechless when she found sage at work fastening a chain around a tree and fixing it to his wagon axle to daunt possible theft but since half the others werent ready yet either she let it pass indigo wept to let loose the mule team and his riding horse if we make it back alive remo said ill help you find them again what if those mudbats eat them better them than us indigo didnt looked convinced they tramped five miles north through the woods to come up even with a saddle on the ridgeline that sumac figured they might get over plum stumbled along for the first mile till she started to cry was carried by her papa still weak from bog ague for the next two then was passed off to vio and finally as the family fell behind was handed on to big ash fawn figured the relay between ash sage finch and whit they could likely pack the poor slip of a child over this barrier the young men could spare the gift of energy now but later lets hope theres a later the moon rode high lighting their way such as it was their line of seventeen people began to snake up the steepening slope neeta and remo ahead scouted paths by eye and groundsense breaking the trail and dodging dead ends and dropoffs sumac tense and wary brought up the rear fawn trudged just ahead of her as fawn bent and climbed the sharing knife swung and bounced on the end of its cord and she tucked it inside her shirt below the walnut pendant that didnt stop the distraction the sweat between her breasts made the cord slippery and the sheath rubbed against her belly bringing to mind her other burden so welcometill now when all her fears seemed doubled her pregnancy had drained away a freedom to take risks that shed scarcely been conscious of before lakewalker customs of knife sacrifice were so careful about binding and assent her own state seemed a strange inversion binding her not to death but to life when shed lain with her husband shed made an irrevocable choice and she could not now go back on it she rubbed her marriage cord where is dag prisoner injured escaped was he struggling to get back to her just as she was going away from him the thought hurt her heart thumping hard and fast in her chest fawn spared a glance upward to find the company strung in a zigzag across an exposed patchwhether burned over in the recent fire or always barren she could not tell in this milky light across the weedy slope a shadow rippled like a wavelet on water then another fawn blinked rapidly wondering if she was passing out from the breathless climb then she realized what she was seeing and spun around looking up toward the high blue face of the moon across it another shadow fluttered and stars winked in and out theyre back she gasped mudbats a dozen of them of course they could fly at night sumac followed her gaze rasped blight raised her face and bellowed up the incline archers alert everyone close up under that outcrop grouse give that blighted boar spear to someone who can swing itgrouse had mainly been using it for a walking stick poling his shaking legs up the hilltrade with ash take back your youngster at the shouting and scrambling plum began to cry again people abandoned the path and started to climb for the twentyfivefoot high face of stone silver gray in the pale light that promised some protection hod and hawthorn shouldered under bo and boosted him upward sage grabbed calla who grabbed indigo and they chained over the rugged rises remo neeta and whit slid down toward sumac bows brandished out of the sky disturbingly quiet a vast shape descended and settled upon the outcrop overlooking them it had twice the wingspan of the other mudbats it stretched out its arms to the sides like black sails and folded them in again a whiff of its unmistakable scent a dry cellar smell rocked fawn back in realization thats not a mudbat oh gods oh gods the malice turned its dark chiseled elegant face upon them great eyes glimmered in the moonlight and pointed ears twitched against its faintly ridged skull soft batlike fur covered its body its legs anchored by clawed feet were longer and more manlike than those of the mudbats the weight of its gaze fell like a war hammer fawn had seen the glassforge malice facetoface an early molt ugly as mud the wolf war malice was said to have acquired a strange man wolf form before its end the raintree malice had been breathtakingly beautiful dag had told her a tall warrior shape of surpassing glamour this malice too had its own appalling beauty fawn stared upward entranced with terror sumac frozen beside her made a weird little noise that might have wanted to be swearing but was squeezed thin by awe she found her voice only to whimper it flies but her words broke both of them out of their shock fawn was already scrambling in her shirt as sumac hissed the knife give me the knife as fawn fumbled it into her hands sumacs legs bunched to launch her up the slope angling around the rock face three bows lifted aimed uselessly at the commanding figure staring down over them in cool curiosity remo was so shaken that he almost tried to shoot it anyway but at the last moment turned and found a circling mudbat instead his arrow tore through a wing the creature shrieked and fluttered sideways a few more mudbats darted near and banked away not so much seeking to grab prey off the hillside fawn thought as to drive it before them toward their master the spreadout companys dash in all directions changed to a drawingin fawn saw it coming before neeta and remo did ash upslope turned and raised the boar spear took aim but not at the malice or the mudbats remo duck fawn screamed the heavy steeltipped pole hissed downslope remo dodged barely in time the point grazed his shoulder instead of lodging in his throat the spear clattered to a stop against some rocks below at least ash had thrown away his weapon temporarily he looked confused blinking and shaking his head finch sage and indigo drew up beside him only calla tried to back off jerking like a balking horse but ended up falling to her knees above sumac burst onto the outcrop the malice merely spread its wings and fell forward sliding away as she swung wildly two buffeting flaps and it rose wheeling upward once more sumac pitched over the edge breaking her own plummet with skintearing grabs at bushes clinging to cracks in the rock face the bone knife spun from her hand rising futilely after the malice and arcing outward fawn gasped and tried to move beneath itif that bone breaks on the stoneswith a crackle of twigs the knife came down in a buckthorn bush fawn raced to retrieve it whit after a moments hesitation followed after her crossbow swinging in his grip as he ran sumac landed in a shower of leaves rolled downward past the farmer boys found her feet and kept on going braking from handhold to scrubby handhold sage looking puzzled knelt and picked up a rock and threw it after her finch and indigo after a moment followed in clumsy imitation hod and hawthorn turned back to join them hawthorn no screamed berry in dismay as he too scooped up a missile launching it with rather better aim it clipped remos ear neetas bow wavered around to point at the farmers no yelled sumac breathless still scrambling wildly downward we cant fight them cut and run remo had half fallen sumac pulled him up stared around spotted fawn scrabbling through the buckthorn after the knife tried to make for her a line of mudbats went for sumac one after another and she broke the other way ducking through the scant shelter of the scrub all the mudbats circled to concentrate upon the three lakewalkers who retreated southward berry over here yelled whit berrys white face turned saw him she gave up yanking at hawthorns arm just barely in time to evade ash and sage closing in on her and bounded down the hillside toward them whit caught her as she almost plunged past the walnut pendant bouncing on her collarbone the malice fawn scratched bloody clutched the knife to her heaving chest the malice has taken everybodys minds she stared at her brother and sisterinlaw gaping back in horror except ours in the moonwashed dark the mudbats whirled their master soared above them so close so out of reach sumacs right its time to run buthawthorn choked berry looking back as fawn turned north toward the nearest trees bo we cant help them now fawn gasped over her shoulder as whit grabbed berry and dragged her along theyd turn on us too best hope is to all stay alive till the local lakewalkers arrive and bring down the malice would the local patrol be expecting this did they even know about the nightsky terror that had burst upon the trace what if the rest of the company was made to be soldiers against them unlike sumac and their own lakewalkers the laurel gap patrollers wouldnt see the farmers as captured friends only as dangerous enemies tears tracked down fawns face at the vision but she bit her lip and dodged onward the ground came up like blows under her fleeing feet and whipping strands of her hair caught in her open mouth running beside her berry looked just as windwild they stumbled into the shelter of the trees and looked back the lakewakers had vanished on the south side of the clear space a couple of hundred paces away but fawn thought she could mark them by the mudbats dipping and swooping above the trees over there the malice appeared to be following them the rest of their company stood in a bewildered huddle temporarily undirected by their new master keep running said whit shouldering his crossbow to free both hands for their next burstor rather one hand to fight through the undergrowth the other to clutch berrys in a death grip that she returned fawn longed for a hand to grip as welljust ones all i needbut dag seemed as beyond her reach right now as the moon overhead she swallowed nodded the three of them toiled north along the mountainside dag peered into the night this rock ledge above their overhang offered a broad vantage down over the tops of the trees the angle gave him a dizzy shudder and he ventured no closer to the edge the moon was full enough to infuse the whole valley with a blue glow but it wasnt bright enough for him to see clearly at a distance even without the rising mist the widest cast of dags groundsense wouldnt make out what was happening eight or ten miles off nor did sound carry that far but beneath that saddle in the far ridge he thought evil specks whirled unless his eyes were full of floaters like that time copperhead had thrown him but by the ugly quaver in his belly he thought not the mudbats were abroad and had found new prey fawn and the company some other hapless trace travelers the faint hum of sparks live ground in his marriage cord was no reassurance because if it stopped it would already be too late he clenched his teeth and hand and snarled helplessly even if he were to ruthlessly abandon pakko and owlet to each otherand he was feeling pretty ruthless right nowit would take him four five six hours to limp from here to there whatever was happening would be long over or moved elsewhere and hed be wrecked wholly crippled instead of just half was tavia seeing any of this she might have crossed the river by now but if she was under the treesand she should be her view would be worse blocked than his his every heartstring twanged go what was left of his wits said stay im going to go mad before this night is done fawn sat panting on the dirt floor of their crevice a tiny patch of moonlight lay at her knees like a rivulet of spilled milk she and whit and berry edged back from it as if the moon were a malicious eye that might stare in and see them cowering you think this is enough whit wheezed staring around fawn could just see the gleam of his eyes in the shadows theyd run maybe two miles north angling downward mainly for speeds sake before fawn realized they would run out of rocks if they descended farther and started looking instead for a bolt hole groundsense doesnt go through thick stone she said but malice groundsense was in every way stronger than lakewalkers fawn tried for optimism because the alternative was a panic they could ill afford i expect sumac tucked arkady and barr and all up somewhere a lot like this and i dont think shed take chances with arkady whit breathed reluctant agreement with that relaxing slightly berry nodded her blond hair a glimmer in the gloom fawn traced the two cords around her throat her hand clenched on her birthday walnut in its hair net they worked do you realize dags ground shields worked at least long enough for them to run away from a malice distracted by other events long enough to live to tell the tale we got away the others didnt berrys voice was flatnot with censure fawn thought but just to keep steady whit scrubbed his face why didnt that malice just groundrip everyone right then it was chasing after the patrollers said berry i reckon its circled back by now her voice quavered at this last maybe not said fawn slowly that malice you fellows brought down the other day was a lot like my malice at glassforge a lumpy firstmolt this one seems more like the one dag saw in raintree advanced except mainly eating bats instead of people so its advanced oddly it was so crisp and fine and freshlooking if it just lately had a molt maybe its only now able to fly and get around it might not be looking to start another molt right off especially as that would weigh it down sos it couldnt fly anymore maybe it might want to like save its prey till its ready for more like a spider said berry fawn could hear her grimace fawn frowned trying to think it through if its mostly been eating bats it might not be too bright yet bats didnt keep larders as far as she knew would the malice think like a bat or like a person a mad person she brightened but it cant get too far away from its mind slaves remember what ford chicory said back in raintree how he and his fellows would ride in and raid the malices army catch folks and bring them back out of range and then theyd get their wits back i think this malice will want to gather all its captives in one place except then itll be stuckif it flies too far away from em theyll all come to their senses and escape think itll try to march everyone to its lair asked whit puzzling it out too maybe though this one doesnt seem tied to its lair anymore now what do we do asked berry if i had six good feet of water under my hull id take on anything but i barely know this dryfoot country should we try to get back to arkady whit shook his head wed not be that much safer and wed be all exposed trying to get there fawn thought of the pale flash of bone knife spinning through the air in sumacs last futile effort and let her hand curl around its sheath whit you got any of those crossbow bolts left just three give me one whit rustled around extracted a bolt from the short quiver and handed it across it glinted in the strip of moonlight fawn held it traced it tested its balance fingered the feather vanes drew the bone knife compared length diameter heft whit saw her drift at once um if that worked wouldnt lakewalkers already have invented sharing arrows sharing spears for that matter fawn shook her head actually dag says patrollers do fix their sharing knives to spear hafts sometimes in the field but not often in the close quarters of a woods or a cave a spears not much more use than a knife and they all are right terrified of anything that risks breakage like poor remo berry agreed so cut up when he broke one by accident that he ran away from home yep said fawn its not just a handy sharp point on the end of a stick its someones life death hopes and it has to be the right shape to carry around with you for years and something you could drive into your own heart even if you were caught out dying by yourself a primed knife can be made into a spear easy enough but i think a patroller would faint dead away if you suggested a sharing arrow think of a miss hitting a tree or a cave wall hard mm said whit your grandfathers ghost would haunt you forever i expect now thisfawn held up the knifewould just tumble and be useless if you tried to shoot it from your crossbow but if i put vanes on it and balance it i think it might fly straight enough for a short ways she touched whits bolt showing where she meant to scavenge the vanes how would you make it balance id need to carve away some of the bone whit made a choking noise wont that destroy it asked berry doubtfully fawn stared down at the length of carved bone turning it in the moon patch i watched dag bond and prime this knife the groundwork he did seemed mainly concentrated on what used to be the bones inner surface the end is just carved this shape to be handy for a grip if i pare it down see if it doesnt break its not broken huh said berry its made to bust open from inside by the groundwork when it comes in contact with a malice if it doesnt crack apart while im fooling with it that means the priming is still sound but fawn ruined her confidentsounding claim by adding i think and just who said whit warily do you picture doing this shooting it would have to be you a fraught silence from two directions youve had way more practice n me fawn forged on and besides my shoulders hurt hot and aching from the mudbats clawing she would deal with that later best to be as close as we can get in case you only get one shot but all the bone bolt has to do is fly more or less straight and hit anywhere and go a little ways into the malices fake skin i didnt shove dags old primed knife point moren an inch into the glassforge maliceshe suppressed a shudder of memoryand it worked just fine thats taking an awful risk with our only primed knife said whit yes but if we sit hiding out here with it its just as useless as if its busted better to try something fast before the malice flies somewhere out of reach before it starts snacking on our folks everything ive learned about malices says its better to get them sooner than later like putting out a fire into the continuing silence fawn added desperately and if it fails well it was only crane that said berry after a cool pause is a real good point whit sighed partly agreement and partly well they would shortly lose what little light they had as the moon advanced over the ridge fawn held the bolt in the patch of moonlight and picked apart the threads winding the vanes laying the feathers out carefully one two three she then drew her steel knife from her belt one of dags earliest gifts to her hed insisted she wear it at all times and kept it razorsharp for her she balanced and rebalanced the sharing knife in her hands turning it over and around set the steel to a knobby bit on the hilt pressed the bit flew off with a faint snap everyone held their breaths but the bone blade stayed intact fawn swallowed set her steel to lift a longer sliver and leaned into her next cut the scent of a campfire drifting in the chill dawn air warned fawn whit and berry to get off the trace and take to the woods once more sumac was right about smoke smell carrying fawn thought then wondered if dags niece was still alive earlier theyd discovered where the remains of the company herded by the malices mudcreatures had tromped back onto the road right enough but if the patrollers were still around theyd left no mark following the slight acrid whiff upwind they came to what was plainly a longestablished stopping place along a creek and found their quarry no not our quarry our bait prior travelers had stripped the woods of burnable deadfall near the big clearing but berry scouting ahead found a pile of old rotting logs too damp and punky and mossgrown to burn shaded by huge old mountainlaurel bushes and a spreading white pine by the time they crept beneath to take stock color was seeping back into fawns vision as the last stars were swallowed by the steely sky the day would turn hot and fine once the sun rose above the eastern ridge but right now all was a shadowless damp and an eerie quiet a whimper from plum quickly muffled by her mama came faintly to their ears and fawn was reminded that sounds carried both ways more than their captured company huddled around the fire maybe a dozen tea caravan muleteers and a few other unlucky trace travelers were also collected sitting or lying down in sodden exhaustion or snoring in the meadow opening out beyond mules munched and crunched big gray shapes moving through the wet grass they seemed to have their harnesses off so evidently the muleteers had retained enough of their wits to care for their animals fawn wasnt sure if that was good or bad see that malice anywheres whispered whit fawn peered over the mossy log balanced on a dead tree branch on the other side of the clearing what seemed a tall cloaked figure moved and she caught her breath but then she spotted another draped from a lower branch like dirty washing and realized they were only a pair of mudbats the one above shuffled in an irritated way then swung to hang head down the one beneath whined uncomfortably and clawed its way back upright neither seemed to like its new position any better a couple of big naked shapes sat crosslegged at the far edge of the circle of captives and fawn realized they were ordinary mudmen new made or seized from the other malice their lumpish forms made her think maybe they were spoils of the earlier clash the one thatit was hard not to think of it as our malicehad been fleeing berry followed her gaze gripped her arm breathed can they sense us i guess not fawn breathed back when none of the dozing creatures roused in suspicion dag had said their shields didnt make their grounds as invisible as that of a fully veiled patroller were these early creations lacking groundsense or did the smudged grounds simply not catch their interest maybe we look like rocks fawn tried to crouch as still and rocklike as possible to keep up the illusion when dyou think the malice will come back whispered whit into fawns ear she had to strain to make out the words at least she didnt have to warn him to keep his voice down she also made her reply as voiceless as she could not sure if its past the stage of groundripping everybody on sight and it seems this one is next thing a malice does is try to gather forces to make attacks cept theres nothing around here to attack itll have to march everyone forty miles up the road to even reach the next village she hesitated the glassforge malice started to dig a mine pretty early on but that might have been cause it ategroundrippeda miner if this ones been eating muleteers and traveling folks it may just want to traipse away up the trace huh whit settled in tighter to the earth they might have a long wait till their ambush that would be bad fawn could feel her nervous energy leaching away in exhaustion this was a wellwatered country so they hadnt gone thirsty in the night but no one had eaten since noon yesterday or slept a wave of nausea swept her but it wasnt as bad as the sick chill from being reminded of what she risked oh gods if the baby made her throw up could she do so in utter silence dont think about it it just makes it worse she swallowed and breathed through her mouth to distract herself she counted heads all their company seemed still to be here and together except disturbingly calla and indigo an ice lump formed under her breastbone as she realized that the four bodies in a huddled heap near the road werent sleeping but all were strangers had the muleteers redeemed their comrades for burial or were the mudmen just saving the corpses for breakfast she swallowed again harder if the mudmen were properly frugal they ought to consume the oldest meat first before starting on a more tender morsel like say plum only if the malice has groundripped a good farmwife i suppose and it might still get that chance whit shifted uncomfortably readjusted the lie of his crossbow touched the cord of the sharingknife sheath now hung around his neck if it flies around how do we lure it close enough to get a good shot i figure our shields will puzzle it if it sees us itll fly closer to look then we get it you get it fawn corrected herself maybe you two better draw back berry shook her head somebody might have to keep attackers off you till you get your shot her hand tightened around a long stout stick which fawn had no doubt the riverwoman knew how to use fawn felt less useful if whits first shot missed but fell without breaking she might be able to scurry and retrieve it depending on whether anyone malice or mudmen or mind slaves realized what was going on giving whit not one chance but two but probably not three she did not mention the dodgy scheme aloud the light grew from the woods a redcrest trilled incessantly cheercheer cheer and was answered by another a few figures around the smoldering fire stirred lay back down fawn spotted some but not all of the companys packs and bedrolls lying scattered about would the muleteers share their food would the malice realize it needed to feed its new troops if so would it bring people food or bags of bugs fawn blinked rapidly fighting a soft slide into the hallucinations of dream this was nightmare enough with her eyes wide open maybe the batmalice only came out at night they would have to withdraw and hide till then there was no way they could stay awake and undetected till nightfall in this whits breath went out in a guarded huff fawn looked up through the laurel leaves a batshape circled in an unbatlike graceful glide she could not guess its size against the blank blue sky but its boneshaking aura rolled before it like sea waves she wanted to run now but of course it was too late it wasnt courage nor any fancied usefulness that kept her crouching papa always said mama should have named me cat because my curiosity would kill me someday maybe today yet beneath her fear curiosity refused to surrender will my stupidfarmergirl idea work she wet her lips and waited all right whit muttered he fumbled the modified knife out of its sheathfawn took it back from him so he wouldnt drop it while he was cranking his bowstood up and stepped forward breaking cover too soon maybe but oh gods that he could stand up at all fawn scrambled after and pressed the bone bolt into his sweatdamp hand the malice circled overhead looking down curiously too high moving too fast it flapped it vast wings and went higher whit wait fawn gasped as he raised the crossbow wavering after its target instead of the malice descending the company rose to its feet turned faces their way started to move in a stumbling bunch finch called anxiously no you dont have to kill them just pull those walnut necklaces off them and theyll be fine oh gods berry took a grip on her stick and stepped forward grimly fawn desperate jumped out and waved her arms frantically skyward down here you stupid batthing you malicebat stupid thing this is what you want come and get it she danced back and forth oh come and get it stupid malice whit gulped as the malice with another lazy wing flap dropped suddenly closer eyeing them still beyond reach of any knife or spear more wing beats sent gusts of cellar smell tumbling toward them as it hovered legs drawn up fawn wondered how long their shields would stand up to the malices full concentration then realized she was about to find out because they had surely won all its attention now its legs extendedit was coming in for a landing the morning grew darker like a cloud drawing across the sun but the sky was cloudless and the sun wasnt up over the ridge yet the shaking crossbow steadied fawn knew well at what cost yes whit a snap of release a deep thrum from the string a white flash as the bone bolt flew upward a thwackcrack as it entered the malices abdomen spread broad as a target as its wings stretched to scoop the air the malices surprised shriek pierced fawns ears dimming abruptly as darkness descended on her eyes am i being groundripped but dag said it would hurt through the boiling black clouds fawn saw the malices wings blow off in both directions and tumble earthward as its body disintegrated rank matter showered down the blackness shrank inward hard and tight was this death oh baby oh dag im sorry dag came awake on a sudden indrawn breath and stared around heart thudding for no reason that he could discern all was quiet the woods fogshrouded but the world had lightened since hed dozed off under this ledge in a black chill the sky shaded upward from gray to pale blue an hour after dawn perhaps it would be at least another two hours before the sun cleared the ridge and began to warm them but already the mist was shredding away as the air began to stir his two charges still slept or at least owlet slept and pakko lay in a painhazed doze that dag could find no reason to disrupt fearfully dag tested his marriage cord coiled on his upper arm shes still alive at least that the tiny hum seemed disturbingly muted as it had ever since dag had anchored fawns walnut shield into her ground was it more muted now why was fawn traveling farther from him ordinary distances had never affected their cords before dag tried to encourage himself sumac will know to look after her but the dire part of his mind that wouldnt shut up had to add if sumac is still alive would his scout tavia find any survivors at all in the valley let alone arkady he rolled his shoulders propped uncomfortably against the rock wall and scowled at his right leg stretched out before him hed finally loosened his boot for fear that cutting off circulation would lead to cutting off his purpling foot and as hed expected the ankle was now too swollen to tie it again soon he would need to get up and go refill their water bottle he tried to muster a proper medicine makers concern for his charges instead of frustrated rage for being fixed here he and tavia had made pakko as clean and comfortable as possible before shed left last night dags last reserve was one strip of dried plunkin in his pocket pakkos body was the most depleted but his pain muffled his hunger and keeping owlet silent might prove the more urgent task with his thoughts chasing their tails like crazed cats all hope of dozing off again faded as silently as possible dag levered himself to his feet with his stick gathered up the water bottle and began hobbling down the hillside this was going to take a while when dag at length returned owlet was awake cranky and fearful pakko was eyeing the farmer child with a glazed sort of alarm even in his dreadful pain the patroller was holding a tolerable ground veiling which won both dags gratitude and respect owlet of course blazed like a beacon oh good youre back said pakko a tension in his tone reminded dag of just how long pakko had lain up here alone lost and hopeless dag settled himself by the mans side leg out ayup water itll just make me piss myself again pakko grimaced looked away hiding helpless shame im a medicine maker ill deal with it dag revised this slightly you help guide the bag ill hold your head up he slipped his hand behind pakkos head pakko raised an arm though it made him gasp together they managed to get another good drink down the injured man absent gods what a pair were not half a patroller between us owlet circled around pakko and crept into dags lap dag gave him a drink too with rather more spillage but the threat of howls passed off with only a few sniffles in the daylight pakko squinted at dag in new curiosity dag hoped not too tinged with dismay except for the hand id have taken you for a patroller i was once is that why you went for maker instead how was it you were traveling with farmers he looked over at the scabbed and grubby owlet as if the child were the most unlikely part of all this its a long story a couple of long stories im not going anywhere pakkos air of indifference was a bit too carefully held some taletelling would keep his rescuer safely planted under his eye right dag sighed yeah me neither but before he could choose a beginning a ragged motion through the trees snagged his eye he sat up squinting then grabbed his stick and clambered abruptly to his feet owlet dumped whimpered in protest scuse me he ducked out from under the overhang and dared to flick open his groundsense mudbat he snapped closed again limped a few dozen paces along the hillside to where a rock slide had plowed open a wider view of the sky and of the treetops falling away several hundred paces below a laboring mudbat crashed into the branches fought loose and struggled for altitude again it was flying very badly injured burdened with a load or a captive it was too far off dag thought for him to pull yesterdays risky trick with a precisely placed groundrip yet if it was taking a prisoner back to its malice hed have to try something but as the creature pumped frantically upward dag saw that its back claws were empty it lurched nearer had it seen him was it attacking one bent boot knife and a cut sapling werent going to be enough to bring it down dag took a breath opened himself again reached stood stunned there was nothing in the mudbats ground but bat natural bat voiceless wordless stripped of reason terrified and confused to find itself in this allwrong tooheavy dying body frantic to reach the cool refuge of its dimly remembered cave far to the east out of the horrible hurtful light in the hot speed of its flight with no support from its malice master its disintegration was proceeding rapidly there was no mistaking the ground of a mudman that had lost its wits dag had seen the little tragedy played out countless times most recently two days ago someone has dealt with the malice a good half of the thousand pounds of worry weighing dags heart lifted his mouth opened and his lips drew back in an uncontrollable grin the mudbat crashed again rose again and finally tumbled out of range over the ridgeline dag tottered back to their shelter if he could have he would have danced the distance hey hey hey pakko what is it pakko clutched the only weapon he had the water bottle no good news your patrol must have found the malices lair its mudmen are skinned of their wits and scattering if we just hold out help has to come my people might get up here by the end of the day yours could even be out looking for you already they were what you said only about fifteen miles north of here when you parted ways pakko made a sound of profound relief his head fell back limply despite everything his lips too stretched in a grin with a sense of joy dag flung his own ground open wide releasing that cramped deaf blind no one here and changing it for a flag of welcome here we are come get us pakkos grin went wider even owlet looked up and cooed bemused by the sudden cheer of the mysterious scary grownups dag escorted owlet back to the streamlet for an overdue morning cleaning then settled himself again and offered the child a celebratory half plunkin strip which was grabbed with alacrity pakko accepted the other half the child climbed back into his lap refuge to gnaw and drool happily so let me see dag thought he might be babbling but he didnt care pakko was surely the most captive of audiences and owlet seemed to find the rumble of dags voice soothing you asked for my life story i sure do wonder how you stumbled onto me ill say that pakko allowed well im from oleana originally but i took a walk around the lake later dag passed some time tricking a few luckless squirrels and a mourning dove into becoming lunch a process that both fascinated and fed the fretful owlet peeled cut up and cooked on a toasting stick the game produced hardly a mouthful but owlets was a little mouth dag was more worried for pakko who seemed barely able to swallow it was midafternoon when tavia arrived with arkady wonderfully sooner than dag had dared hope unexpectedly they also brought calla indigo and pack loads of supplies dag ducked out from under the ledge where owlet was napping and hobbled forth to greet them arkady still catching his breath from the climb grabbed dag by the shoulders as though he didnt know whether to hug him or shake him i never thought id see you alive again ye gods what horrible things have you been doing to your ground this time did a little surgical groundripping on some mudbats thats how we all ended up here and not as meat in the malices lair arkady were saved someones done for the malice yes we saw tavia nodded vigorously there are dying mudbats scattered all over the valley we passed two on the way here wheres fawn and the others dag added conscientiously arkady and tavia looked at each other in a way dag didnt much like arkady said after you three were carried away we made it to the trees and the attack broke off a mudbat tried to take barr too but it dropped him and shattered his leg i put it back together as best i could but there was no moving him far so sumac had me barr and rase hide up in a cave of sorts sumac decided shed take everyone else west over the ridge try to reach laurel gap best patrol procedure get the children and women out of range of the malice spread the warning or efficiently both at once good for her was fawn safe on her way to the lakewalker camp then evidently not for arkady added after that calla had better tell the tale the halfblood girl took a deep breath we were partway up the hill last night trying to cross that saddle when the mudbats came back the malice came with them it was flying dags belly chilled but he reminded himself that however appalling this malices form it was dead now it looked sort of like a mudbat only bigger and and more beautiful i suppose once youd seen it you wouldnt ever mistake it for anything else not for a second dag nodded understanding it took our minds it was the strangest sensation like i was calm on top but screaming underneath her tremors were long gone in this bright afternoon but dag sensed a bonedeep exhaustion left in their wake a familiar state after dealing with the terror of a malice it didnt keep hold of her mind the way it did ours though said indigo he too was pale with more than the nights exertions calla scowled in memory it was like all these wild ideas kept fading in and out of my thoughts arkady thinks i was trying to veil myself anyway indigo went on the mudbats chased sumac and remo and neeta off and fawn and whit and berry got away too he seemed about to say more but swallowed instead together dag asked in hope was fawn safe with sumac indigo shook his head they ran opposite ways we think those walnut shields of yours must have worked the malice marched the rest of us north up the trace in the night calla continued but i kept falling back dragging as much as i dared i kept trying to make her keep up said indigo it seemed like my own idea at the time it was just something we had to do but we got farther and farther behind the others and then it was like my mind cleared then we turned tail and ran i hoped we could find arkady and that the lakewalkers would protect us said calla ive never been so scared we were searching along the ridge about where i thought sumac had put him when neeta found us instead she was all by herself she said the patrollers had veiled themselves and shook off the mudbats and hid up in a cranny sumac was frantic by then but finally decided someone still had to warn laurel gap camp so she took remo and lit out westward and left neeta to hunt for fawn and try to get her back to arkady but neeta said she couldnt said indigo find fawn and whit and berry that is she said it was a good sign because if her groundsense couldnt find them neither could the malices she hoped theyd have the sense to stay hid dag ran his hand through his hair and tried not to scream then what i came out of the cave to fetch water and found neeta and these two blundering around said tavia id reached arkady a couple of hours before tavia was our first word of your fate arkady told dag it was a relief to know the local patrol was on the hunt but absent gods what a mess tavia went on we were trying to decide what was best to do for you since we didnt have near enough hands to carry an injured man down this ridge or any better place to hide him if we did and then we saw the first dying mudbat and then well the whole situation was changed it was plain it was going to be easier to get the medicine maker to the injured than the other way around said arkady or so i thought before i climbed this benighted mountain i left barr with rase which i dont quite like but theyve no need to hide themselves now they should be all right tavia said eagerly neeta recovered her horse so she decided shed ride north and try to find the others wherever theyd gone after calla and indigo got away and maybe make contact with the local patrollers get us more help all as good and sensible as it could be under the difficult circumstances but where was fawn plainly no one here knew dag led the party around to their nearcave under the ledge arkady knelt down by pakko opening his ground to the mans injury in that keen daunting way of his interesting he murmured dag familiar by now with that particular tone of voice sincerely hoped his sprained ankle would qualify as boring he made introductions which he hoped the glazedeyed pakko understood and went on i didnt think it was good for the break to sit untreated this long with his muscles in spasms around it like that but while id have been willing to go in after the bone alignment i wasnt too sure of those disrupted nerve cords right on all counts said arkady he sat back on his heels and frowned at dag you should be a patient right now not an assistant but need drives all his skin is unbroken bar some abrasion and id like to keep it that way that means we do it all by groundsetting techniques i want you to do the heavy work go in and carefully realign the two vertebrae and place ground reinforcements across the fracture lines are you ready now dags relief having arrived now he wanted to go search for his wife blight it and child yet fawn wasnt out there alone he reminded himself shed had her kin with her his thought snaked on when last seen dag eyed the helpless hurting pakko and controlled his frenzy of impatience fawns phrase soonest begun soonest done drifted through his head just a moment carefully he sat on pakkos other side laid his bad leg out undid his arm harness and set it aside while dag was pulling body mind and ground together arkady called tavia calla indigo set up camp here we wont be moving this patient tonight it wants six fit fellows and were going to need to fashion a rigid board carrier to tie him to first pakko swallowed and said if im not going to walk again sir he did not say aloud but dag understood if im just going to be lying in a bedroll pissing myselfid rather you found my knife arkady gave him an enigmatic look youll have time to make that choice later ready dag arkady could scout the lay of his land and choose his tactics as swiftly as dag and for the same reason forty years of experience despite his weariness dag found himself relaxing into that trusted leadership he stretched his fingers real and ghostly sight and sound dropped away as he sank into the shared hinterland of flowing ground it was not healing so much as making ready to heal pain moved with hot red violence muscles cried the sculpted bones themselves were cool solid reassuring yet like strange lace down and in alive with blood both flowing and blocked bruised and clotted arkady handled the much more delicate nerves like ropes and whips and threads of fire down and in down and in hold up dag murmured following with a groundtouch arkady gasped and broke out of his beginning ground lock dag couldnt have fallen into a lock right now if all their lives had depended on it his heart was too outwardly drawn wild to regain the world and all it held it made him a good anchor he supposed what arkady was doing was complicated a fiendishly difficult task accomplished with as much grace as any dance and a strange sort of pleasure to observe just in its own right apart from any consequences thanks muttered arkady good job you can pull out now dag inhaled blinked sat up as their mountainside refuge rushed back into his senses how much time had gone by the sun seemed notably lower he passed out a while back reported calla wiping pakkos clammy face with a damp cloth im not surprised said dag and rolled away pale and shaking that was good he thought with elation gods he liked this work magery at full stretch allowable magery he crawled to prop his shoulders up against the cool rock wall of the overhang and let other people do everything else for a few minutes tavia brought him water and a dried strip of ruddy new moon plunkin surely this discharged his last obligation to fate as he was pakkos good luck perhaps someone else would be fawns passing the debt around now it was dags turn to pursue his own ends and no one had better get in his way just as soon as i can stand up will pakko walk again asked tavia diffidently dag shook his head too early to say itll be a week before the swelling goes down enough to tell the permanent damage but hell live to see his wife again when arkady at length rolled back and propped his own shoulders looking much like a wet rag dag said i need to go look for fawn tomorrow said arkady i promise well get you down off this mountain first turn i can get myself down arkady made a rude noise how fall i grant you it would be quick dag touched his left arm somethings not right arkadys gaze flicked quick and keen he frowned but did not argue that particular point it disturbed dag that he did not i suppose i cant stop you short of tying you up that wouldnt stop me either absent gods dag if youve half the sense of a plunkin youll wait for help i am the help dag frowned and falling downhill or not it would be dark by the time you could get to the wagons arkady added i suppose thats the one known meeting place at this point otherwise youll have this whole valley to search mm said dag trying to think it through everyone here was just as exhausted and short of sleep as he was calla was also missing a spouse dag would have quashed any halfcrippled patroller of his who suggested a jaunt so plunkinbrained still he touched his marriage cord again rubbing it through the rips in his shirt but it gave him no further enlightenment changed yes but what did that mean perhaps his and fawns questionable cord weaving was simply running down naturally no this is wrong dag found an unexpected ally in owlet who had awakened during the groundsetting session flustered by the influx of strangers the child began crying again for his mama dag ruthlessly let him tavia quickly handed him off to calla who had no better luck calming him arkady returning from washing up in the streamlet winced at the noise best to get this child back to his family dag observed over the ruckus before he cries himself sick or takes a tumble down the hill theres no need to keep him up here in the cold another night who are you volunteering said tavia you couldnt carry him i could said indigo unexpectedly go with dag and help look for the basswoods a glance exchanged with calla added and sage and finch and ash huh tavia rubbed a hand over her weary face i guess calla and me between us would be enough help out up here tonight i mean with arkady and all calla added bouncing the child to no other effect than to give the wails a waver his parents have to be crazy with worry and grief right now cruel to leave them that way any longer than needed where would you look said arkady weakening under the onslaught theres been a tail of smoke coming up from the woods near the trace all day bout eight ten miles north looks like said dag ive been checking it seems like a campfire and on the route calla and indigo said our folks took if not our people its some people who might have seen them and you plan to walk two miles down this hill cross a river walk another mile to the road and more miles down it with a sprained ankle before dark inquired arkady lugging this little screamer youre not heroic dag youre mad getting there for the tenth time today dag hobbled to the dropoff and cast his groundsense out to its farthest thinnest reach for the first time today he received a response far below a long plaintive whinny echoed up the ravineslashed slopes dag grinned who said anything about walking seems my rides turned up if indigo can get me down this hill as far as i can summon copperhead up im back in the saddle to dags surprise his saddle was still on copperheads back though his saddlebags were gone scraped off somewhere in the woods hed have to spend a day hunting for them not for the first time in his career not to mention his war knife lost in the clash later copperhead hadnt managed to pull off his bridle and his bit was slimy and crusted with browsing his mane and tail were full of burs but in all the horse was in vastly better shape than his owner bemused dag handed back the blanket hed begged from indigo with which hed planned to pad the geldings murderously serrated backbone you didnt unsaddle the horses before turning them loose the others sure indigo indignant stepped prudently out of range of cow kicks as dag led his mount to the nearest fallen log this one ran off after he dumped you in the fight we never caught him embarrassed i hope eh old fellow dag scrubbed the chestnut ears copperhead snorted green slobber and rubbed to be relieved of his bridle in vain he laid his ears back in protest as dag tightened his girth but dag made sure the horse sensed this was no time for tricks it was an awkward heave to get himself up but dag blew out his breath in relief as his haunches settled into their accustomed place once more and he allowed his throbbing right foot to dangle he hurt all over and his vision seemed to pulse in time with the pain in his ankle arkady though also exhausted and still disapproving had spared him a small ground reinforcement to his sprain before hed left muttering i suppose sumacs halfway to laurel gap by now to which dag had replied ill keep an eye out dag lowered his hook toward which owlet reached out grimy hands swinging from it had been a game theyd invented earlier in the day which had worked for a while to turn wails to giggles upsydaisy little brother indigo boosted him upward and dag tucked him in the blanket and disposed him as securely as possible before him in the saddle left arm wrapping his little chest owlet made a noise halfway between fascination and dismay at this elevated view of the world dag glanced out across the river valley and said to indigo copperhead will outpace you i didnt figure youd be waiting indigo helped dag slip his stick under his saddle flap do you want to follow or go back up to arkadys camp with calla indigo shook his head ill check the wagons first they really are the sensible meeting point if no ones there yet i may follow you up the trace or i may just flop down and wait but norths your best bet right enough dag nodded and turned copperhead westward with the pressure of his knees it was slow work picking through the woods spitting out spiderwebs but they found a river crossing that didnt come up higher than the horses belly just as the rim of the sun touched the western ridge dag reckoned the luminous mountain twilight would last till he reached the source of that smoke curl up the road after that well it would depend on what he found there was a very real possibility that he might be attempting to deliver owlet to parents groundripped and dead in a ditch he tried for optimism it was equally likely that the batmalice had been mustering farmer troops to meet an attack from the patrollers operating to the north in which case it would have been conserving its captives not feeding on them his optimism faltered with the thought i hope our folks didnt run into the patrollers before the malice went down although that might well have been how the malice had met its end because clearly the creature had not been tied to its initial lair dag had been on the other side of that scenario a couple of times fighting mindslaved farmers he didnt have to imagine the horrors he could just call up the memories he jerked up his mazed brain as if it were a balky horse no were not having that here when they reached the road dag turned copperhead north and touched him into his long rocking lope of the horses many defects that gait was not one owlet squealed with astonishment and glee as his curls ruffled in the wind at least one of us three is happy actually copperhead didnt altogether seem to mind stretching his legs and dag let him stretch them a little farther as a result dag came within groundsense range of the smoke camp while the sky was still bright yes he thought as he touched the first familiar farmer ground still half a mile out he let blowing copperhead drop to a walk and began hurriedly counting heads bo hawthorn hod good sageoh calla everythings going to be all right for you now finch and ash the basswoods very distressed but absentgodsbethanked plum was still with them hed been especially worried for plum a highgrounddensity morsel of little use as a soldier a great many strangers or near strangershe was almost sure he recognized some of the teacaravan muleteers theyd been playing leapfrog with for weeks he sorted through again were those dim smudges whit and berry behind their shields surely there was a third yes dimmer still dag pressed copperhead into a grudging trot as orange firelight flickered through the graying shadow of the woods he turned into a broad clearing with a broader meadow opening out along a creek to find a couple of dozen folks in a makeshift campmuleteers yes and the larger part of his own company finch lugging in an armload of deadfall saw him first dropped the branches around his feet and yelled in astonishment its dag hes alive and hes got owlet with him a female shriek of what came from the clearings far side dag had just time to spare a powerful thought of behave or youre wolf meat to copperhead before a dozen pale excited people swarmed up around him copperhead lowered his head and snorted but stood dutifully still without being asked everyone parted to let vio run up to dags saddle grouse and plum hurried behind her the ragged woman stared up openmouthed with all the joy lighting her face that dag could have wished her arms reaching as if for stars he persuaded owlet to hang on to his hook arm lifted him from his saddlebow and lowered him into his mothers grasp dag dag dag chortled owlet plunkin plunkin blighdit vio was laughing shining tears tracking down her face my word but hes filthy no worsen dag grouse exclaimed hugging wife and child both as he took in the return of his son all unexpected from what had surely seemed certain death his face bore a naked wonder unlike any expression dag had ever surprised there dag grinned and what do you think of lakewalkers now grouse dags gaze swept the upturned faces but didnt find berry whit or fawn wheres fawn he asked silence spread out from the crowd clustered around his knees as though his words had been a stone thrown into water vio looked up her face drained of joy leaving just tears she clutched owlet harder oh dag im so sorry what the poor little thing was so brave and bright and then so stiff and cold if wed guessed you were still alive wed have waited for you what are you talking about bo shouldering forward swallowed and swung his arm to point across the clearing that batmalicething kilt her just as whit got it with his bow them muleteers was buryin their own dead so we laid her in alongside em not an hour ago i reckon buried dags heart began to hammer he gripped his marriage cord and stared in foolish bewilderment at the mound of freshturned earth beneath a cluster of slender ash trees but shes not dead dag found himself atop the low mound clawing at the dirt with his hook with no memory of how hed got there he didnt have his stick weve got to get her out of there she cant breathe dag man finch pulled at his shoulder ash clamped a big hand on the other lifting him more effectively he wavered unwillingly to his knees still clawing dirt then clawing air its no good dag said sage give it up please a womans voice vios in the background calling in distress oh help griefs gone and turned his wits i did not dag gasped furiously shrugging off the hands survive a fight with mudmen and a night on a blighted mountaintop climb two miles back down the mountain and ride ten with a busted ankle all to find my wife to stop six feet short does he want her bones said an unfamiliar voiceone of the muleteers they say them lakewalkers eat their deadits like a funeral feast to thembut im not having with that here she was his wife though maybe we should let him well he aint eating my brother nor stealing his bones neither dag fought free more hands clutched him bo called out theres no use to this carryin on daglet her rest in peace we done her all the respects i promise you shes not dead i dont know whats going on but shes not dead she cant be dead not spark he whirled shedding men farmers dag stop this is madness blight it help me he cried anguished onehanded shoveling was not one of his better skills but somebody must have had tools to dig the grave so there must still be tools around to dig it up he didnt expect the strangers to understand but surely the southern boys a muleteer shoved too close dag almost swiped at him with his lethal hook just managed to slug the man instead six more helpful muleteers jumped dag and wrestled him to the grass gods he couldnt groundrip them like mudbats yes i could the unwelcome thought slowed him a little he wept in his frustration water blurring his dizzied view of shadows firelight mens frightened faces look fetch another lakewalker anyone with a speck of groundsense theyll testify im right a knee pressed on his chest making him think of the dirt that must be pressing down on sparks had they stamped down the grave mound absent gods did you cover her face therell be dirt in her mouthin her eyes they hadnt sewn her eyelids shut had they hed heard that was a farmer funeral practice some places bos voice wouldbesoothing but for the quaver dag there werent no mistaking she was cold and stiff we couldnt feel a pulse there werent no breath mistin on a knife blade it was a hot day of course there wouldnt be breath on a warm blade wheres whit wheres berry get me whit hell understand hes too sick to stand up dag and berry aint no better hawthorns voice called anxiously from beyond the circle of looming faces wrong wrong what was wrong with a mighty lunge dag wallowed to his feet knocking aside muleteers oh gods thank gods a man was running up with a shovel dags heart lifted in joyous relief yes yes help me he reached out his hand for the wildly swinging tool saw too late its intended purpose as the broad blade swept around his head and clouted him hard faces firelight spinning branches above all dissolved in hot bright sparks he came to himself wincing sick to his stomach pain pulsed like forgehammer blows in his head ankle lungs heart he breathed shallowly then more deeply made to touch his head only to find his hand caught he wrenched around or tried to to discover he was sitting with his back to a slender tree his hand and hook tied behind it he hadnt been stunned for longhis tears were not quite dried it felt as if snails had been crawling across his face and he jerked his arm again desperate to wipe away the sensation turning his wrist dag felt rope he could groundrip through rope if he had toit wouldnt kill him to rip anything he could eat spark had figured that out spark no not that gnawing down a mouthful of hemp would be good for him he panted trying to collect his scattered wits because they seemed to be his last resource struggling for calm he extended his groundsense the dim sensation in his marriage cord was unchanged that at least the shadowy blur under the mound at the meadows edge had not disappeared whatever had happened wasnt growing worse yet he looked up to find finch ash sage and bo all crouched around him in a half circle staring apprehensively hod hovered behind bo hed been crying too judging from the snail tracks down his spotty face dag swallowed moistened dry lips croaked im better now you can untie me bos eyes narrowed ill be the judge of that dag subterfuge he should have gone to subterfuge right off instead of alarming the whole camp with a display of deranged lakewalker screamingmore screaming gods his throat was rawwould not be helpful stands to reason stands to reason and he choked down a shattered laugh at sparks favorite turn of phrase because inexplicable cackling would not be helpful either the sight of sages strained face reminded him sage i saw calla and indigo they escaped last night all right and made it back to arkady indigos gone back to the wagons to catch anyone who shows up there and callas up on the east ridge with arkady and a hurt patroller that tavia and i found tavia she got away from her mudbat too whole were all whole well i got a little bent sage almost melted before dags eyes as a man had a right to whod just learned he would not be burying his new bride not to mention his tentbrother and all and all save for spark but this levelvoiced report seemed to reassure his audience in more ways than one please all i want all i want is to see her face again one last time is that too much to ask dag would have crawled on his knees to beg without hesitation but until he convinced them to untie him he couldnt move it wasnt enough just to break free and run off now that hed recovered his senses he could think of three ways to escape quick as a cat but he had to have helpwilling careful help right now he gulped again to hide his madlooking desperation fawn and me weve done a lot for you folks i know its late and youre all tired but but please i just want to look at her one last time and if it really was the last time well he still had his bonded knife slung around his neck didnt he formerly when he was in desperate straits that thought had calmed and heartened him in a bleak sort of way not tonight i want fawn i want our baby i want i want i want life years and decades and heaping plattersful more of life it was not too much to ask for pitys sake he whispered he tried to compose himself enough to muster a persuasion or more than one unfit for groundwork of any kind though he was in this distraction but then he saw the hesitation in sages face and waited one heartbeat two three maybe itll settle him down sage said dag quelled a howl of agreement yes yes made his voice humble mollified its all i want please bos brow wrinkled finchs mouth twisted in doubt ash whose size had made him the victim of every cry of need some help liftin here since theyd left alligator hat sighed and said sadly all right ill dig there was only the one shovel belonging to the muleteer whod belted dag with it and who gave it up dubiously but even with the three southern boys to take it in turns it would be agonizing minutes before they uncovered the hopes they had so prematurely buried more frantic urging to be careful would do nothing but reconvince them that dag was mad since he was terrified that they might yet stop short and he couldnt watch without screaming he took himself across the clearing to see whit and berry limping so stiffly that even bo hurried to put a helping hand under his elbow dag did not protest his bluefield tentkin were laid out together on a thin blanket just at the edge of the circle of firelight hawthorn crouched by his big sister and brotherinlaw looking forlorn he shuffled back as dag approached berry muzzy and weak levered herself up onto one elbow dag knelt awkwardly by her side from this distance now that hed settled a bit he could at last see what was going on the pair had not as he had first thought been partially ripped by the malice a crippling unpleasantness of which dag had firsthand experience or not exactly but their shields had closed down so tightly under the impact of the malices attempt to do so that their grounds were actually partially withdrawn from their bodies drained from their extremities into quivering defensive balls dag huffed in astonishment and fascination and reached to grasp berrys walnut pendant and pull it over her head she whimpered in protest no its all right its done its work not only done but nearly drained the thinning groundwork was close to failure in a few more hours it would likely have fallen apart freeing her ground from its shell leaving her exhausted but alive as he coaxed its cord from her hair the deep connection pulled reluctantly apart in sheets like maple syrup just turning to sugar and her ground flooded back out into its normal form congruent with her skin berry took a ragged breath raising her hands to clutch her head oh she struggled to sit up what was that oh dag what a night weve had whit she turned urgently to her unconscious young husband just a moment dag half crawled around them he stole a moment to study the effect of the other walnut shield it too had held against the malices attempt at groundripping but was clamped even more tightly and was very close to failure whit wasnt going to be his friskiest after it released but his abused ground would recover in a few days i trust dag drew whits braided cord over his head in turn and felt the link shear apart whit groaned and mumbled i feel awful bo what did i drink his gluey eyes peeled open to stare without comprehension up at dag blinked came abruptly to awareness dag youre here the malice fawnshe carved up your knife put feathers on it we got the malice whit berry told him did we yes i remember its wings blew off wildest thing dag your shields they must have worked whit felt all down his body as if surprised to find it still attached to his head yes though it seems they still need some refinin you just rest patroller boy youve done your job whit settled back pleased hey i did didnt i heh waitll barr and remo hear about this and a great many others besides two dozen people had witnessed fawns farmer patrol shoot down the terrifying malice dag suspected that this was one tale he wouldnt have to labor to get across to folks it would fly on wings whits and berrys voices tumbled over each other to tell him the story of the past rough night of all theyd done from the time theyd been driven away from the mindcaptured company till their dawn ambush of the batmalice dag barely listened his groundsense straining toward the grave if fawns shield failed before she was unearthed releasing her ground back into a body buried alive that certainly would have happened dag thought sometime before tomorrow morning absent gods and hed almost let arkady talk him into spending the night on the mountain dont scream dont scream at the mound the boys had stopped digging with the shovel and were leaning in reaching down with their arms working something stiff and small up out of the soil dag found his stick and pushed to his feet again turning hastily away from whits urging that he go look for the fallen wings and berrys woozy belated query of hey wheres fawn dag fell to his knees beside the opened pit in time to receive his wife in his arms ashs face looming in sympathetic sorrow she was every bit as stiff and cool as a real corpse he had to allow the farmer boys that much her powerful shield had drawn her ground in deeply centered on head spine chest and especially belly thered been no shroud to wrap her inshed been buried in her shirt and shoes and riding trousersbut absent gods be thanked someone had donated an old handkerchief to spread across her face it lay dimpled and moist across her mouth and nostrils which at least were not packed and blocked with dirt he pulled the cloth away her face was set her lips much too pale but not the drained lavender yellow of a corpses her closed eyes were undamaged the lids traced with the pale violet lines of her veins beneath the delicate skin her black lashes lying in a curving fan above her cheekbones his hand shaking so much he could hardly get a grip dag found the walnut and drew it over her head its cord caught in her dark curling hair thick with dirt clumps and he had to stop a moment lest he tear away strands of her hair too in his terror gently gently the bond sheeted apart the way whits and berrys had and he flung the walnut from him with enough force to make it bounce halfway across the clearing her rigidity changed under his hand to a shuddering stretch he bent his head and kissed her forehead cheekbones all over her face but not her mouth for she needed that to take a sudden breath then another and another long gulps of air color flooded back into her face and his world the lashes fluttered faintly there had been voices in the darkness distant as though heard from the other side of time the poor little thing oh the pity of it its almost a blessing that hes gone first yeah he wouldnt of took this well shed wondered in muzzy indignation before the voices faded out of hearing where were her congratulations pressure then stealing her breath and pain from the pressure and panic from the loss air seemed absorbed through her skin not her slow gaping mouth seeping into her lungs and hot busy belly where had dag gone off to now she needed him she was sure of it something was very wrong time leaked away in the black hours years at last mumbling sounds returned to her clogged ears breaking up the worrying toomuchsilence that had made her fear shed been struck deaf she felt suddenly heavy and dizzy and only then realized how nothing shed felt before almost almost there air her eyelids fought apart onto the most welcome of sights dag his eyes were turned their tea color in the graying shadows and flickering firelight but a few gold flecks still glinted from their crowfoot corners shimmering lines traced around his cheekbones like inlaid silver wire beaten into a copper vessel his cheeks were stubbly face bruised and haggard and his dirty ironblack hair stuck up every which way for once he actually looked his age still looks good to me her hand struggled upward to touch the silvery wetness as she at last caught her breath despite his wild eyes his grin nearly split his face her fingers traced the rough beard his stretched lips bumped over his slightly crooked teeth with the dear familiar chip out of a front one his kisses found her knuckles imprinting each one her hand slid across his jaw around his neck found a grip on his collar and oh my what had he done to his good cotton shirt shed made for him more rips than cloth she swore kisses renewed on her forehead cheekbones chin mouth at last this is better she was still stiff and hurting under her collarbone and in the track of the gouges across her shoulder blade from the mudbats claws but beneath her shirt callas plasters seemed to be holding tugging on her tender skin when she moved she had still been able to carve they had wait what dag there was this huge batmaliceit flewbut we got it she paused worked her throat to clear the croak whit got it would you ever believe and your shields they mustve worked all those poor mice didnt die in vain her free hand searched her neck for her hairandwalnut necklace best birthday present ever yes yes and yes spark a fierce hug with this last which she didnt quite like as much as usual because the weight of it brought back her stifling nightmarehad she been asleep knocked unconscious i knew you couldnt be deadyou looked too mad to die when those awful flying mudbats were carryin you off upside down and backwards at her wriggle his grip finally loosened enough for her to sit up hey is this evening it was morningdid i sleep all day i dont feel so good was i out cold why am i all over dirt my hair her fingers feeling among the dirt clumps encountered a long sticky cool object that she withdrew from her curls with difficulty an earthworm big ol nightcrawler she flung it from her with a heartfelt eew did whit put worms in my hair while i was asleep ill get him her fingers searched her scalp in renewed alarm bos voice broken and maundering as if hed been drinking againsorry im so sorry amazed murmurs joined with bos mumble and fawn looked up from the circle of dags arms to find their tender reunion had an audience crowding up around them bo and hawthorn and hod ash and finch and sage unfamiliar trace travelersno wait she thought she recognized some of the tea caravan muleteers nice fellows if a bit rough around the edges whit shouldered through the mob crying buried her buried her whatd you want to go and do a stupid thing like that for he knelt and pulled her away from dag long enough to give her a hard and quite unprecedented brotherly hug dag tolerated this briefly with a weird benign smile then drew her back whit said fawn in suspicion did you stick that fishin worm in my hair youd reckon a fellow your age wouldve outgrown such things a muleteers voice rose in a quaver he raised her that lakewalker sorcerer raised her up from the grave dont think about it muttered dag into her now wormfree hair dont think about it as if to protect her from nightmare visions hers or his another muleteer one of the young oneswhat was his name spruce that was itwent to one knee on their other side and held out a hand quivering in entreaty mister mister lakewalker bluefield sir would you raise my brother too hes youngern me it was his first trip and i surely do dread taking the word of this back to our mama oh please dag stared back in bewilderment his face as blank as if someone had hit him over the head with a shovel only fawn felt his flinch as some realization slotted in oh no you dont understand absent gods no one is that good a medicine maker fawn was never dead in the first place you blighted fools buried her alive his arms trembled tightened i cant help your brother im sorry fawn began to piece it together she supposed she ought to be horrified but really her outrage echoed whits you buried me and didnt even wait for dag bo we thought for sure he was a goner too bo said in shaky apology you could tell by my marriage cord he wasnt we told you that before mebbe one o those other lakewalkers couldve but we didnt have none of them nobody thought to ask that girl who rode by neeta she was in such a hurry bout that hurt patroller stuck up on the hill dag gave bo a sharp glance but he was distracted by the muleteer pulling on the remains of his sleeve please sir he werent but twenty years old and dead without a mark on him just like her the muleteer nodded eagerly at fawn dismay pity and horror chased one another across dags face and my friend bootjack said another muleteer joining the first down on one knee fawn and dag were suddenly surrounded by a mob of supplicating men one tried to reach out to touch her but his hand fell back daunted by dags renewed clutch and glare you dont understand dag repeated and under his breath oh gods ill have to talk beleaguered dag began a halting explanation of ground malices the walnut shields and his hopes for supplying the defense to more farmers than just his bluefield tentkin someone gathered up the discarded necklaces and placed them in a pile at his knee at fawns urging they were passed around the crowd so that the men might grasp with their hands what they did not quite take in through their ears some looked very interested though the close friends and kin of the dead muleteers plainly wanted a different answer and kept trying to get it through amending their questions bo and whit and the alligator hat boys all testified to the parts theyd seen which seemed to help between that and dags obvious exhaustion the press around them eased from dangerous desperation to mere disappointment one or two stared at fawn in a lingering alarm that seemed disproportionate to her small rumpled self her small rumpled filthy triumphant self she and whit and berry deserved the bowdown of all bowdowns fawn thought so when the argument about walnut shields and raising the dead ran down at last she clambered up eager to show dag the remains of their malice the cool spring night spun crookedly around her head as she straightened she groped for dags arm which he wrapped around her again dropping his stick to do so only then did she discover what dag had done to his ankle his bare right foot was twice its normal size colored a streaked deep purple that would have looked fine on a petunia but was very wrong for human skin she led him in a mutual stagger over to show off the decaying traces of the wingsdag made sure to warn everyone not to touch the poisonous blight of the malices remains and no souvenir taking either he plainly didnt even want to camp so close to it but the deepening dark and everyones utter exhaustion looked to keep them all planted in this clearing till morning everyone in sumacs party had carried light bedrolls and food with them for the failed flight to laurel gap and most folks had hung on to them despite their forced malice march while dag looked after his horse with the help of sage being careful not to let fawn out of his sight she nibbled a piece of hardtack till her stomach settled then was able to get down a couple of strips of dried plunkin the meal made her cold shakiness pass off she was reminded of the very first time she had met dag with his firm belief in grub as a cure for shock and smiled a little her bedroll had contained a wedge of soap and despite the hour she wanted a bath above all things they borrowed a lantern from one of the muleteers and made their way across the road and around a crook in the creek to a pool of sorts it was too chilly for lingering they stripped down and splashed quick although fawn soaped up and rinsed her hair twice holding her breath and shaking her head underwater to be sure she fussed over dags ankle not to mention his impressive new collection of gouges and bruises and he fussed over her shoulder they could do no more with their filthy clothes than whack them against a tree trunk and shake them out before skinning damply back into them it would be better when they got back to the wagons and their gear meanwhile this helped it wasnt till they were lying down together between two thin blankets on the grass that her mind began to turn over the events of the past day imagining other grimmer outcomes then she cried muffled in dags shoulder mostly he just held her but then hed hardly let her out of his arms since since shed been dug up out of her grave which seemed horror enough till she dwelled on not being dug up to have come all this way and survived so much only to be killed on the last leg not by bandits or mudmen or malices but just by an ignorant misunderstanding shh he murmured into her hair when her shudders renewed she swallowed to control her snifflingwas she crying too muchand managed is the baby all right after all that can you tell under her hands she could feel the familiar stillness of his concentration as he went deep with his groundsense yes seems to be he said coming back up and blinking at her eyes a mere gleam in the firelight and shadows far as i can tell leastways shes no bigger than your little finger yet you know but ill have arkady check when we meet up again for luck fawn melted with relief butshe you sure now yep he said and if his voice was tinged with a faint smug glee well that was all right by her as she shivered again he said blandly well name her mari his gentle teasing was a deliberate distraction from her grave thoughts and she was grateful for it hey shouldnt you ask me about that she cogitated what about nattie dirlas a nice name for a smart strong girl or sumac too confusing if sumacs going to be around with arkady maybe for later later he murmured ah i like later no baby animals thats for sure i do sometimes wonder what my parents were thinking theyd certainly never pictured her as a grownup womanthen or later can you imagine a grandmother still named fawn with great delight she snickered and poked him fondly just dont you ever start saying yes deer she could feel his smile in her curls and finally grew warm enough to stop shivering she wondered when a thin bedroll on plain grass had started to seem such unutterable luxury as long as dag is in it with me and were safe the safety not the coverlet was the true source of her comfort she realized and the comfort of all the folks with them too so nearly lost to one another sleeping close in blanketed lumps around the fire tonight for more than warmth she cuddled in harder and for all her hurts and wobbling thoughts slept dag woke in gray light to the sort of drowned lethargy that generally followed great struggles yeah ive been here before he wasnt so weary that he didnt reach out to reassure himself that fawn was still in their bedroll warm and asleep under his hand as she should be his hazy mind shuddered over all the mighthavebeens that hed forbidden her to dwell on last night and it struck him anew how very little interest he had in saving a world that didnt have her in it well and berry and whit and the rest of tent bluefield and their friends and they needed their neighbors he supposed and the tangle widened ever outward and he was back to where hed started maybe a fellow didnt have to love the whole worldgrouses voice raised in complaint about something across the clearing grated on his earmaybe just one short heartening person would do dag stared up through new beech leaves at the pale blue sky it would be a clear warm day once the valley mist burned off fawn stirred and sat up looking dauntingly perky all things considered after supporting his hobble to the woods to take care of the morning necessities she parked him back on the blanket with his purple foot prominently displayed which served admirably to fend off any other demands upon him was it malingering when you really couldnt hardly stand up he was in any case content to lie low behind this excuse and watch the others deal with the day a couple of stray muleteers had arrived in the night and a few more came with the dawn with yet more recovered mules in tow one beast unfortunately had another body draped over it in addition to the muleteers the camp included a trio of trappers who had been captured by the malice while taking their furs south to mutton hash and another family of five grown siblings and their mama whod been snatched while heading north for homesteading they all assembled to pay what brief respects could be devised the gaping maw in the earth that fawn had escaped was filled after all which made her sober all over again dag was glad for the delay when neeta rode into the clearing guiding a half patrol from laurel gap detailed to bring pakko down off the ridge her shock at finding fawn afoot was swiftly cloaked by her closing ground she looked almost more taken aback to find dag i thought youd still be up on the mountain with arkady i brought extra fellows to help carry you i came down on my own copperhead did the rest ill deal with you later he couldnt do it now so soon after yesterday he was too exhausted and didnt trust himself at the very least he wanted sumac with him for all sorts of good reasons including a check on his wits but the uproar that ensued when the dozen lakewakers trailing neeta discovered just who had taken down the fearsome flying malice that had scattered three of their patrols across the upper valley and how was sufficient diversion dag hardly had to open his mouth twentyfive farmer eyewitnesses plus fawn berry and whit were couriers enough to carry the tale everyone was led around to marvel at the tattered wings handle the walnut necklaces see and touch the pieces of the spent sharing bolt collected by berry and preserved in a clothand be marched through all the steps of the dawn ambush whit brandishing his crossbow and acting it out dag limping after with his stick had to allow that farmers and lakewalkers were sure talking to one another now and better still listening a field medicine maker traveling with the patrol cornered dag back on his blanket intent on the walnut necklaces while dag wasnt quite up to a live demonstration the young maker did seem to follow his descriptions and promised to carry them back to her camp medicine and knife makers she was excited about unbeguilement too dag attempted to show her and at the same time relieve one of his worries by having her put a general reinforcement against infection into fawns shoulder but the maker was so open to the farmer heroine of the hour that she didnt leave a beguilement for dag to clear he considered grimly having neeta work an example but no you can pass the word amongst your makers he told the young woman anyone who wants to learn how to unbeguile or make these shields can find me and maker waterbirch at berry bluefields place just outside clearcreek up on the grace river well take all comers we havent quite worked all the kinks out of the groundwork yet mind could be a few more folks chewing on the problem is just what it needs in all it was noon before the laurel gap patrollers cantered off again with many backward glances and an hour after that till dags own party assembled itself for the long walk back to their wagons dag rode copperhead with owlet chirping on his lap fawn clinging behind though after a time she climbed down and put plum up instead relieving ash from playing pack pony it was still light out when their straggling company arrived to find indigo in calm possession of their abandoned goods firewood collected and tea water on the boil with a couple of the mules and his riding horse rounded up already whit led two of the boys and one of the mules off to collect rase and barr out of their hideyhole arriving back they laid out barr on the blanket next to dag where dag had to admit barrs busted leg far outshone his bent ankle the groundwork arkady had done on the break made dag whistle theyd not finished dinner when the laurel gap patrol came in leading their mounts six men handcarrying pakko on a rigid litter arkady supervising calla ran crying and laughing for sage and her brother and they exchanged heartfelt hugs tavia strolled after looking tired with darkness descending the patrollers made camp for the night beside the farmers and there followed much swapping and repeating of tales all round arkady made an admirably authoritative lecturer dag thinking about the fad for washpan hats and cookpot helmets along the upper grace not to mention his unwanted new reputation for raising the dead had no illusions about how their story would twist as it spread but at least it would start straight arkady wanted to keep pakko under his eye a little longer so the next day was welcomed as one of rest by the laurel gap patrollers who were exhausted from their own strains their breathless tales of the fight at the north end of the valley with their rising realization that a routine patrol had become an emergency then a looming disaster felt all too recognizable to dag calla and fawn helped arkady with caring for pakko whose fellow patrollers in turn helped the farmers find their scattered animals so that all the surviving beasts were retrieved by nightfall in fine fettle from their bout of freedom the wait proved a benefit for the next morning while arkady the patrol leader and the patrol medicine maker were still debating rival merits of a hand versus a horse litter for transporting a spinal fracture sumac and remo arrived they rode strange horses and two new patrollers accompanied them sumac and arkady more or less flung themselves at each other which raised a few eyebrows from those whod only seen arkady in his austere mood dag grinned one of the young patrollers turned out to be pakkos son the day after the malice scattered us me n remo hadnt made but fifteen miles crosscountry sumac explained all frantic and footsore wed just found the patrol trail over the next ridge west when we ran into reinforcements on their way from laurel gap so getting the word out was already a done deal which if id have known well anyway we joined up with them and circled back into this valley when we caught up with the patrols north of here news was spreading that the malice was brought down which we could tell from the dying mudbats we found pakkos son had been in the first relief patrol and was pretty distraught at the tales of his papa being carried off like you were dag then the word came which i guess neeta brought that his papa had been found hurt so we volunteered to guide him here in exchange for a ride which speeded things up considerably she and arkady exchanged rather loopy smirks well earned in dags opinion the horse remo rode was pakkos recovered along with all his gear his bonded sharing knife was indeed still in his saddlebags but the son confided later to dag he wasnt going to let his papa have it till his mama said so dag and the medicine makerand pakko had enjoyed or endured a number of practical lectures yesterday from arkady on the subject of nerve damage which even dag took as guarded hope for the mans walking again he rather thought pakko might well be a greatgrandpapa before that meeting with his bone blade took place all the tales had to be told again to the new people so it was after lunch before the laurel gap patrol headed back to the trace once more at a walking pace with men taking it in turns to carry pakkos litter smoothly the wagon camp fell much quieter and folks bent their thoughts to their own road dag counted up the days of delay and was surprised how few there werehe felt as if theyd been trapped in this burnedover valley for months tavia was left horseless since barr would be traveling the next stretch in the back of a wagon he offered her the use of his mount which actually belonged to arkadyif shed come north with him after a sidewise glance at dag neeta renewed her urging to remo to come south with her the boy seemed confused by her sudden warmth which brought dag to a task hed been dreading his shiver of rage was still anchored by doubt lets have the truth out then and if it was as ugly as cleaning up mudmen maybe it was as needful too dag selected a spot just out of sight and earshot of the camp near the chattering streambed he sat on a rock and dug in the ground with his stick while sumac leaned on a gray beech bole arms crossed her mere presence he trusted would be enough to block any embarrassments like his last private talk with neeta his other invitees settled crosslegged around him remo tavia neeta finch and ash also summoned shuffled and stared uncertainly whats this all about dag asked remo patrol business you said dag held up his hand to spare the last pair from settling hed have picked sage for this testimony as the most levelheaded of the alligator hat boys but in the aftermath of the malice kill the young smith had been distracted by worry for his wife and tentbrother i wont keep you long the day whit shot the malice that afternoon what all was going on in camp when neeta rode by as exactly as you can remember oh finch ran a hand through his hair it was such an uproar at first berryd got out just about enough words to explain what had happened or at least enough for us to explain it to the rest we were all worried for her and whit bod looked over poor fawn and said she was a goner hod and hawthorn were crying it was plain we wouldnt be staying there long and most of us figured you for a goner too so when we told the muleteers your tale they dug space for her as well as a sort of gift ash confirmed neeta came cantering up the road in a hurry but she saw us and reined in before or after the burial oh before we had those four poor muleteers and fawn laid out on blankets and were sort of looking at one another wondering what to say neeta said shed been sent to find the local lakewalkers and get help for some hurt patroller that shed seen tavia whod hauled arkady up the ridge to rescue you bothyou were hurt too but she didnt know just how bad it didnt sound real good said ash we got that somebody had a broke back but we werent sure which we told her whit had shot the malice but i dont know as she really believed us she rode around and looked at the wings anyway never got down off her horse then she was gone at a gallop before vio even got to ask about owlet neeta started to speak but at dags upflung hand fell silent her eyes pinched did she see what was coming dag was afraid so dag said did she know you were about to bury fawn oh sure said finch that is we didnt talk about it but it was all laid out there the corpses and the grave half dug and all i wouldnt think you could miss it ash gave a slow blink and started to open his mouth dag cut in thanks boys thatll be all the two wandered upstream toward the wagons looking curiously over their shoulders dag scowled across at neeta she raised her chin she looked dead groundripped i figured how was i to know those shields of yours would do such a crazy thing and anyway i had my ground veiled on account of the malice blight dag said slowly its your word alone as to whether you were open or closed i cant prove youre lying you cant prove youre telling the truth can you neeta red spots flared in neetas fair cheeks indignant or scared well i like that she could open now said remo doubtfully dag and neeta traded a long long stare his heartbeats felt hot and too far apart odd hed thought his world would be tinged with red by this point but it was just blue and distant no said dag at last i think not unveiled i could kill her with a thought you know just like i did crane itd be almost as easy as murder by silence a ripple of dismay ran through remo and tavia a flinch from sumac but no one spoke or dared speak neetas gaze fell slid away it was all the answer dag needed or wanted really and you thought this was your duty old patroller why wearily he ran his hand over his face rubbing at the numbness go home neeta patrol there you owe new moon for your raising and luthlia for your training youll be a long time paying that debt back at the end of your lifetime share if you will just dont come north the north does not need you remo stared at her in bleak doubt its not fair she began then clamped her jaw shut right best advice for someone at the bottom of a deep deep hole stop digging apt turn of phrase that well hed never thought the girl was stupid what about me said tavia she had gone very pale staring at her partner sumac stirred on her tree bole id recommend you to fairbolt crow at hickory lake if you want to take a turn exchanging north my word with fairbolt is pretty good coin ill be speaking for rase as well you can beti expect hell be all recovered by the time i get him up there his recent malice experiences are going to make him very much in demand i can tell you yours too tavia looked at the ground looked narrowly at neeta who stirred uncomfortably but said nothing tavia finally replied i think ill report in at home first be sure the story is told straight make my goodbyes properly but ill take you up on your good word after that if the offer holds it holds tell rase ill be along come fall then sumac nodded rase thought dag so much for poor barrs hopes well barr was resilient remo looked downcast again blight that boy cant win for losing both were so very young and you remo which way you ridin tomorrow asked sumac remo let out a long breath he did not look at neeta anymore north he said no one spoke on the short walk back to camp in the morning when theyd finally wrestled the wagons back down the creek bed and onto the trace two silent riders turned south arkady had lent tavia a horse also lading her with a long list of his possessions to bring back with her when she returned dag didnt know what all sumac had confided to arkady last night but he was formidably chilly to neeta in parting tavia turned once in her saddle to wave farewell a gesture earnestly returned by rase neeta her back rigid did not look around to fawns joy blackwater mills harbored a hotel almost as fine as the one in glassforge if smaller better still it had a spanking new bathhouse she gladly pried open their purse for a roomas after one look at the bathhouse did arkady doubling up with sumac for frugality no doubt as for fawn she looked forward to a few days of eating food someone else had fixed and no squinting in the cook smoke the swelling in dags foot had gone down in the four days of travel since theyd left the burnedover valley but its colorcolorswere even uglier they both could use some time in a real bed she reckoned all to themselves the town held sadness too for this was a place of parting it lay on a barely navigable tributary of the grace river but more importantly it was where the tripoint trace crossed the old straight road that cut up toward pearl riffle with its lakewalker ferry and camp sage calla and indigo would point their wagon east up the trace the rest of them would take the northern way from which in turn sprouted the back road that led to clearcreek the basswoods stopped abruptly short when vio dug in her heels and declared shed had enough and wouldnt go one more step well in this busy place grouse would have no trouble finding day labor likely more successful for him now he was cured of his recurrent bog ague and really fawn expected the couple would do better with town life than with the demands of homesteading selling their rickety wagon and a pair of their mules would give them enough to start out on she grinned though to overhear the phrase our lakewalkers fall from grouses lips when he was explaining their adventures to the hotel horseboys she would miss plum who had somehow ended up under her wing and she rather thought dag would miss owlet he seemed vastly amused by his grubby little brother of the mudbat adventure and owlet seemed to return the compliment though she suspected dag used his groundsense to cheatunless it was his arm rig that so enthralled the child who had developed a passion for buckles well ill just give dag a toddler or two of his own and hell do fine could she really object when the cheating would be on her side but the most important thing that happened in their stopover in blackwater mills almost as good as a bowdown in fawns view was when a patrol that had come from a neighboring camp to reinforce the laurel gap folksthough theyd arrived after the fight was overrode miles out of their way home to catch up with dag and arkady to have the tale firsthand they seemed a little taken aback to get it mostly from fawn and whit and berry complete with a display of the sharingbolt shards and crossbow but their captain as shorthanded as every other patrol leader was highly interested in the notion of farmer help that couldnt be mindslaved by a malice even if the farmers did no more than hold the horses dag tried to make it very clear that his walnut shields werent quite perfected yet but the captain left with a gleam in his eye nonetheless after making sure of the directions to where dag and arkady planned to roost later that night fawn rolled over on clean sheets atop a yielding feather mattress and snuggled up to dag the bedside lamp cast a gentle glow over their quiet room slow spring rain sounded through the real glass windows open just enough for a cool breeze to stir the cloth curtains just being inside when the rain was outside seemed pleasure enough for any sensible woman but she had plenty more blessings to count her fingers reached up to flick over his quizzical eyebrows one two comb through his unruly hair three this tally might take a while will it be enough she murmured those patrollers tonight seems to me they listened to us better than any lakewalkers yet or is this just another stone in the sea dags lips softened in a smile the worlds a pretty big sea for all our travels weve only seen a slice of it enough no not yet but its a start and this time our rocks will make ripples he leaned into her hand to kiss it in passing best part is i dont have to go around like a stump speaker trying to talk folks into being nicer to each other one by one which really would be like throwing pebbles into the sea he stretched over and picked up her spent walnut necklace from where it lay by the lamp turning it thoughtfully in his hand these will bring folks to us for their own reasons and i dont even have to know what all the reasons are send enough farmers out with enough lakewalker patrols and they will learn all about lakewalkers and bring their true tales home well said fawn only if the lakewalkers can resist trying out patroller humor on them his lips twitched id think any fellow raised on a diet of bo stories would be able to sort it out maybe not on the first day fawn giggled those river boys should do well on patrol then that learning wont be all one way i expect indeed im counting on that he held up the necklace squinting at it i do wonder about what whit and bo said back on your birthday when i first showed this off that it wouldnt be a day after i set something like this loose in the world before someone figured out how to misuse it im afraid thats true fawn sighed but if theres enough folks those river bandits we ran into were awful sure but most of the rivermen were good enough fellows the river has a reputation but that doesnt stop folks from going on it anyhow and getting plenty of good from it too if theres enough grease some grit wont stop the whole wheel from turning i hope thats so spark he set the necklace back and found a better use for his hand stroking over her shoulder which made the skin of her arm stand up in happy goose bumps i guess well find out she eased back onto her pillow and his warm palm traced over her belly in a flatteringly interested fashion she raised her head and squinted over her torso frowning impatiently her waist was still disappointingly slim down there six months from now shed likely be wondering why shed been in such a hurry to expand but still is nattiemari all right in there seems to be happy so far despite all her adventures with her mama he tried to keep his voice light but just a tinge of remembered desperation leaked through she drew a breath then stopped to consider just how to phrase this sos he wouldnt take it wrong its been a pretty amazing wedding trip most fellows only claim they want to give their sweethearts the world you really did this won a trail of light kisses from her temple to her chin which was very agreeable but she couldnt let herself be distracted yet she caught his head between her hands before he could work down farther and rob her of words so dont take this as any sort of complaint but can we try staying home for a while he laughed id say you took your turn traveling with a patroller its my turn to stay put with a farmer he sobered a little though not too much good itll be a fine fresh new thing for me staying home ive never done that before ill try to see you dont faint from the excitement of it all being kissed through a grin was good too his lips drifted down her throat and struck south and they gave up talking for a warmer exchange after a few more days of rest in blackwater mills arkady pronounced barr able to ride again suitably splinted and at a careful plod on a mildeyed mare borrowed from whit dag remembering his own much less severe broken arm last year figured barr was still in a quelling amount of pain confirmed by the boys wan smile and lack of complaint about the restrictions well a quelled barr was not altogether a bad thing even at their gentle amble the straight road north brought them all too soon to their next parting barr remo and rase were to ride on to pearl riffle there rase would play guest observe a northern ferry camp in operation and not least add his testimony to the tale of their malice kills back on the trace until sumac caught up with him again finch and ash too planned to cross the grace at the pearl riffle ferry they carried a stack of fat letters to west blue that would guarantee them room and board for quite a while with lots of sound advice for homesteaders thrown in most likely sumacs own plan was to ride with arkady to clearcreek ostensibly to see him safely settledbut given the glitter in her ground dag would have bet cash money the couple had more intimate reasons for sticking to each other like burs for the next few days sumac herself was vague on whether she meant to leave arkady at berrys and come back to fetch him in a few weeks after presenting rase and her resignation at hickory lake camp or take him with her straightaway to exhibit to her parents rather like a hunter returning home with a spectacular bag of gamedag kept trying not to grinor have a stringbinding on the spot with her uncle dag doing the blessing and tying just to make sure before exposing her husband to his new tentkin dag was happy to stay entirely out of that decision remo turned in his saddle and stared up the shadedappled road toward his home his brow clouded with doubt your kin and camp will be glad to see you dag told him not entirely recklessly word of how you two helped put down the bandits at crooked elbow had to have reached the riffle months ago and if a patrol circular about the trace malices hasnt got ahead of you already itll be along soon grab your forgiveness while the excitement is still high and youll do fine fawn atop magpie raised an eyebrow at him speaking from experience dag he touched one finger to his temple in wry acknowledgment just dont try to pull the returningson trick too often is all it does wear out with repetition barr eased his horse forward and observed with this leg of mine we can each take credit for getting the other home i guarantee to hobble and yelp a lot youll look good home camps not going to look the same i promise you said dag both of you neither does the view in my shaving mirror barr muttered and maybe it wasnt just the leg making him sober he turned his head and said seriously to dag ive learned a lot since that night in the rain when i first caught up with the fetch so mad and cold i could hardly stutter thank you dags head cocked back in surprise and he had to admit sneaking gratification yeah dag has a way that way said whit i daresay hes been teaching me new things ever since that first night my sister dragged him into the kitchen at west blue did i ever say good work sis it was luck mostly said fawn that and grabbing onto my luck with both hands and not letting go again or even one hand dag nudged copperhead around next to magpie sumac by now well acquainted with remos darker moods and listening with some amusement put in itll be fine remo and if its notfairbolts always looking for healthy young patrollers hell need at least two to replace me i figure ill put in a word there if you should need it remo brightened slightly at this prospect of an honorable bolt hole if his return went ill which dag thought profoundly unlikely in any case when barr shook his reins and started off remo followed finch and ash called their goodbyes and fell in behind pack animals trailing dag watched them out of earshot before he said to sumac you really intend to inflict that pair on fairbolt fairbolt has nothing to do with it i promised the crow girls when i exchanged last fall that i would bring them back some cute men as it seems rase is bespoke already i have to make my word good somehow dag considered fairbolt and massapes array of blackhaired granddaughters lovely one by one formidable in a mob theres enough of them ones bound to like a gloomy boy and another a flitterwit sumac went on cheerfully feed them to the crows i say what a fate murmured dag brows rising at this riveting vision just sos the girls dont get them switched the wrong way around said fawn again i trust massape said sumac berry was by this time wildly anxious for clearcreek so they picked up the pace i hope the place is still standing she said kicking her horse along between copperhead and magpie papa leaveslefttwo of his cousins to look after itaunts i call them cause theyre older than me ones a widow and ones never married the widow has a son who comes around a couple of times in the week to help with the heavy work fawn pictured a clearcreek version of ash tanner and nodded encouragement i wrote two letterswhit helped meone after crooked elbow and one after we was married in graymouth and sent them upriver with keeler friends bad news and good i hope they got there she added after a reflective moment in the right order if clearcreeks as much of a river town as you say the word about crooked elbow will have got there one way or another ages ago fawn pointed out theyll have had months to get over the bad news if the good news only arrives when you do well thatll likely be all right berry nodded and slowed goodnaturedly when fawn complained that if they did any more trotting either she or nattiemari was going to start hiccupping nevertheless clearcreek came into view over the lip of a steep wooded climb the next afternoon with two hours to spare till sunset the valley spread out in goldgreen splendor before fawns eager eyes with long blue shadows growing from the western hills off to the left the broad grace river gleamed beyond the feedercreeks mouth a tidy village homesteads scattered up the vale with evening cook fires sending up gilded threads of smoke and a stream fawn saw as they descended the long slope and clopped across it on a timber span that earned its name fawn stood in her stirrups and gazed out under the flat of her hand as berry eagerly pointed out landmarks of her childhood even sumac and arkady riding behind engrossed mainly in each other closed up to listen they rode along a splitrail fence enclosing a narrow pasture with a craggy treeclad hill rising behind look theres the pond fawn said in delight and a placidlooking cow a few goats and some chickens they rounded a stand of chestnut trees into a short lane also lined with split rails and the house spilled into view it was an unpainted warren looking as if a hive of flatboat carpenters had worked on it for years instead of having its stories neatly stacked like the house in west blue it was as if a load of crates had been tossed down the hill connected by chance one to another half a dozen chimneys stuck up here and there it must have held a much larger family a few generations ago and looked as if it hoped to again what a splendid place to grow up in for all its rambling oddity it had quite a proper front porch long and railed and roofed and if it looked a little like a boat deck well that was all right hawthorn whooped and galloped ahead hod stuck close to bo looking shy and hopeful fawn could only think that berrys letters must have got here in the right order because two stout women ran out onto the porch both looking excited but not surprised and waved vigorously hawthorn jumped from his horse and bounded up the steps and one of the women dried her hands on her apron hugged him and made universal signs to head and hip and heart my how youve grown the other shaded her eyes berry grinned fit to split her face and pointed emphatically at whit this ones the husband the aunt in the apron clasped her hands over her head and shook them in a gesture of shared if not downright lewd female triumph that actually made whit blush as they rode close enough at last for voices to carry she cupped her hands to her mouth and called welcome home fawn glanced at dag who was looking very bemused and a little bit waryjust like a lakewalker dropped down among strange farmers welcome home to a place weve never seen before but if a place was home because it held your past wasnt it equally so if it held your future she stretched out her hand to him he shifted his reins to his hook and grasped it in a swift squeeze in the sunset light his gold eyes glinted like fire epilogue footsteps clumped on the stoop at the knock on the kitchen door fawn grabbed a cloth pulled her pot on its iron hook away from the hearth fire and hurried to answer she hoped it wasnt another emergency but the door swung open onto a damp and chilly afternoon and barr he wore patroller togs smelled of horse and the outdoors and walked without a stick mist beaded in his dunblond hair gleaming in the watery light hey fawn well arent you a sight for sore eyes come in come in he shouldered through into the pungent warmth staring around fawn spared a looksee out at the sodden brown landscape warmer air had moved up the valley of the grace last night breathing wisps of lowlying fog across the sad streaks of dirty snow the gray tailings wouldnt be lasting much longer if not quite spring this was definitely the tag end of winter no other riders were waiting in the yard nor approaching on the part of the road she could see from here she shut the door and turned to her unexpected guest barr rubbed chapped red hands and moved gratefully toward the fire reminding her of the very first time shed ever met him he was much less wet and cold and distraught this time happily he sniffed the air what are you cooking medicine oh whew i thought it was dinner and was worried fawn laughed and pointed to the volume propped open on the kitchen table remember that blank book hawthorn n hod gave me back on my nineteenth birthday in graymouth i used it to write down all the recipes for the remedies they were making up in the medicine tent at new moon cutoff and drew pictures of the plants and made notes about the herb makers groundwork too it came with me in my saddlebags when we went north you bet arkady was so surprised when i pulled it out he hadnt realized how much i had in there barr eased out of his deerskin jacket and hung it over the back of a chair to dry yeah i ran into sumac when i went to put my horse away in your barn she looked downright cheerful and um bulky floating around like those boats we saw down on the sea he made hand gestures to indicate a bellying sail its the feather quilt i padded her coat with when arkady got to fretting about how much time she spends out with the horses in the cold shes less alarming out of it it wont be long till their baby comes though she smiled it would make you laugh how much arkady fusses for her if you didnt know his history instead its sort of sad and hopeful all at once i must say i suspect its no bad thing for a man to wait till hes older to have his children he seems to appreciate things more barr smiled briefly bleakly fawn shook off the odd fancy and went on fortunately sumac doesnt much put up with his coddling a lot like her mother omba id say shes pretty much taken over all our horses and manages the barn the way omba used to run mare island or still runs it i guess did you see my graces filly dancer when you were out there isnt she a sweetheart yep sumac made sure to show her off first thing fawn swung her pot back closer to the coals are you out with a patrol the valley of the clear creek lay at the easternmost edge of pearl riffle camps patrol territory she wondered if she should offer the barn loft for bedrolls except that sumac would surely have beaten her to it or are you courierin no im on my own a private visit came to see dag and you leg troubling you no itsoh starting to drag a chair noisily toward the hearth he spotted the big basket tucked in the rooms corner and lifted instead setting the legs down two by two with exaggerated care in a whisper he said is that nattiemari then asleepwill my talking wake her up likely not as long as you dont yell or drop things she just fed so shes for dreamland for a bit yet it wont matter if she does wake up she sleeps better through the night if i dont let her nap all day fawn yawned and so do i theres so much to do though its tempting to let her sleep too much she stepped up as barr peered down into the basket in vague masculine alarm she did lower her voice shes still roundfaced like a bluefield though im hoping for dags cheekbones in time her heads grown a lot this past month and her hair thankfully she bent and touched a finger to the black fuzz you can hold her later on um thanks barr backed carefully away from the basket and found his chair fawn took up her wooden spoon and stirred her graygreen goop which was thickening nicely papa brought mama all the way from west blue slogging through the mudthey got in just two days before nattiemari was born stayed for three weeks then mama had to go back for clovers first mama says she doesnt approve of men in birthing rooms but arkady won her right over i think she was relieved reallydespite all the children shes had midwifery isnt her best thing dag was pretty excited but he kept his head real good i thought better than i did some stretches it was the most pain id ever done but i got a real fine baby out of the deal so i figure it for a fair trade barr stirred uncomfortably and fawn kindly decided to spare him all the terribly fascinating details other peoples babies as she recalled were much less interesting than ones own a little silence fell dag and arkady should be back soon she offered they were called out for some fellow whod hurt himself down at the landing and meant to stop on the way back and look in on a neighbor woman with lung fever i dont ride out much just now on account of nattiemari but i am dags other hand when folks stop in here i do try to go along when i can or dag will get all wound up in the interesting parts and forget to ask for money i swear arkadys rubbing off on him and the other way aroundarkadys getting quite used to having dirty ground these days arkady hadnt actually said on me it looks good but fawn thought it was implied so your medicinemakingforfarmers scheme is going well fawn wasnt sure if barr was trying to draw her out or avoid talking himself in either case she rattled obligingly on it was slow to start having berry as a wedge to get us in did the trick i cant imagine how it would have gone if wed just plunked down in a place like this as strangers but dag and arkady did a few things for her kin and friends and bo and hawthorn and even hod talked us up all over town the first night someone we barely knew knocked on the door for help was a big step youd best believe her brows drew down in consideration but the most important thing i thinkthis is going to sound strange to you i knowthe most important thing that happened this winter was losing some patients because makers must you knowover enough time it has to happen not the fellow whod been dead for two days when they brought him to the door on a plank no one blamed dag for that one though he did have words never saw him look so harassed her lips twisted at the memory which would be funny in a black way except for the distress of the dead fellows friends but people wed got to know a bit the old man with the broken hip the child with the strange raging fever the woman whod miscarried and bled dry almost before dag had arrived though hed raced copperhead to flying foam dag tries his hardest my word he about turns himself inside out with the trying but sometimes it just isnt enough the sensible folks have seen that clear though and straightened out the couple of less sensible ones its a tricky dance but we all seem to be learning the steps us and the folks around here both huh barr tilted his head i always knew you had to learn to be a medicine maker but i never thought you had to learn how to be a patient lakewalkers in camps teach those tricks and that trust to each other as offhandedly as how to swim and as young we have the ways of farmer midwives and bonesetters to follow up but no one knew exactly what to expect of us at first not even us so weve all had to learn together barr stretched scratched his chin looked around did berry and whit get their fall flatboat built and launched after all i didnt spot them anywhere when i rode in oh they left months backtook bo and hod and hawthorn for crew though bo claims thisll be his last trip its not quite time to be looking out for them but soon they werent sure if theyd be coming home by the river or the trace i hope its the river and i hope whit brings me an iron cookstove which i wouldnt expect him to carry in a packsaddle although with whit you never know whatever he brings i imagine itll turn a profit i dont know how he does it nobody in our family would have guessed that talent of his back home neither one of us had much chance to shine there i reckon the town of clearcreek was only about twice the size of the village of west blue fawn wasnt sure how it managed to seem worlds larger barr cleared his throat you ah ever hear anything more from calla and indigo and sage he added in afterthought oh yes calla sent letters twice ill let you read them later we get mail up and down the river fairly regular how are they getting on well sage got work in a foundry and hes learning lots of new things just as hed hoped calla says he still wants his own place in due time indigo found a job driving a delivery wagon and his boss thinks the world of his way with the horses though indigo doesnt much care for town lifetoo crowded he says it makes him feel funny and tense we wrote back that hed be welcome in clearcreek but he hasnt taken us up yet but heres the best thingcalla got so interested in medicine making in her time with arkady she went and apprenticed herself to this midwife in tripoint her bit o groundsense gave her such an edge she finally fessed up to her half blood and instead of throwing her out on her ear the woman took her to someone who knew one of the local lakewalkers and now calla goes and trains one week in the month with the medicine makers at the tripoint campsame place fairbolt was born if you can believe it oh said barr brightening thats good his brow wrinkled unexpected was to me too till i got to thinking about it seems calla was tested to be let in to her papas camp back south but she wouldnt join up because they wouldnt take indigo too huh i didnt know that barr looked very pensive which was not an expression fawn was used to seeing on him before she could ask what was troubling him another set of clumps sounded from the stoop fawn looked up eagerly ah heres dag as the door swung open barr cast her a crooked smile you developing groundsense these days no but id know those boot steps anywhere like my childs cry or my own hand in the dark dag ducked through straightened up and grinned broadly hey barr what brings you here things must have gone well with his patients he wasnt drooping with fatigue or low with gloom or spattered with blood before barr could answer nattiemari stirred in her basket and meeped be right with you sparkle dag called to her and hastily slipped off his jacket and went to wash his hand in the basin in the sink the meeping grew more anxious if not yet a fullthroated cry dag tossed the towel over the sink rim and went to gaze down into the basket a moment his expression curious and tender barr brow furrowing watched him pick up his child and position her on his left shoulder hand spread securely over her little back and take a comfortable seat in the rocker on the other side of the hearth is she wet asked fawn hungry no she just wants to join the party she likes the rumble of dags voice fawn informed barr and reassured went back to her stirring i do wonder that lakewalker children ever learn to talk with the grownups able to figure out everything they want by groundsense dag shook his head not everything i assure you the little ones have to train us up just like farmer babies train their parents dont you sparkle youre teaching your old papa all kinds of tricks arent you nattiemari settled in her new perch with an air of ownership little fingers flexing eyelids half shutting her eyes had been rather muddy at birth but lately had cleared to a deep brown with exciting redgold flecks dag added to barr how are things at pearl riffle hows maker verel doing with my ground shields better since whit came by last fall puffed off his walnut pendant and his malice kill in every tavern in the landing and the bend and had verel quadruple the price which last also settled the camp council and increased the number of farmers wanting to try one which i dont understand but whit said would work whit has that knack said fawn complacently she tapped her wooden spoon on the pot edge readjusted the pots distance to the coals and settled on the hearth edge by dags knees to listen verels taken on two new apprentices to help out barr continued so the shield work doesnt put him too far behind good said dag and captain amma was she willing to try our experiment yet yeah finally she sent four farmer boys out with my patrol with me detailed to ride herd on em since she said i knew farmers better than any other patroller she had two of em quit after their first stint when they found out how boring and uncomfortable it is especially in the winter and no sign of a malice anywhere of course and all the dirty work piled on though i kept explaining that all new patrollers get the dirty work but the others stuck it out and two more came on were to go again next week dag said you know arkady trained hoharie in shield making when he was up to visit hickory lake camp with sumac same as i trained verel barr nodded well half a dozen raintree boyssurvivors of their malice outbreak heard the rumors and turned up at the gate to volunteer fairbolt claimed it was a patrol matter and made sure the camp council was too divided to overrule him he had the boys partner with rase and remo to teach them how to go on which answered fairly well the boredom and grind didnt daunt them with kinfolk to avenge i had a letter from remo just last weektheyve survived their first test with a real malice it was just a little sessile but hoharies shields held and none of the dire predictions of the naysayers came true so far so good will you ever go back there to hickory lake dag shook his head not soon i dont have time so far arkady and i have had eleven different makers from nine different camps turn up here to learn our tricks shields and unbeguiling and more new folks come every week seems like we got so we keep a bunk room ready for visitors fawn added well put you up in there tonight barr nodded gratefully thats in addition to all those long descriptions arkady wrote up for hoharie and verel to send out all over the hinterland with their medicinetent circulars and for fairbolt and amma with their patrol circulars even if copperhead achieves his lifelong ambition of bashing me into a tree tomorrow the ideas are out there does remo sound happy there up at hickory as happy as remo ever gets that is barr added seems to be dag smiled slowly tioca crow got mentioned three times in the letter she was a goodlooking girl in a strappy sort of way as i recall barr shook his head i hope he has better luck in love this time if its really tioca i expect shell see to that he didnt have to go you know amma was all ready to put him back in the pearl riffle patrol i suppose it was better that he did things in order and transferred properly though hes always happier when he thinks hes following the rules dags eyebrow twitch made provisional agreement rules arent actually made to be broken theyre generally invented because someone made a mistake or a mess and folks didnt ever want to have to clean up after another one like it barr cleared his throat yeah about that now hes getting to it thought fawn she didnt think barr wouldve ridden a day and a half in this raw weather just to party with nattie mari something was preying on his mind for sure you know i could be a bit of a blight when i was a younger patroller fawn supposed it would not be polite to agree too wholeheartedly she hunkered on the hearth dont let me interrupt dag limited himself to an encouraging hm i thought most of the rules were stupid and i suppose i was still new to my powers wanting to test them out like boys running races or lifting logs or something anyway i did this thing his eyes shifted fawns way fawns not going to like this fawn rubbed her lips not that she exactly wanted to make it easy for him but if youre talking about the time you persuaded some farmer girl to go out to the woodpile with you and then tried to talk remo into seducing her sister i already heard barrs lips made a silent oh uh when remo told us back before you first came on the fetch when we were all trying to work out unbeguilement remo said barr sat up looking betrayed he was still plenty mad at you about the accident with his sharing knife recall you two only fell into that ambush in the first place because that flatboat girl led you there by the noseor whatever she led you byand he followed you oh um yeah barr shot another look at fawn was that why you wouldnt hardly give me the time of day when i first came aboard well lets just say it didnt help your cause barr gave up betrayal in favor of glum well it was true that farmer girl wasnt unwilling mind even before er and then remo pitched such a fit i never dared it again and so much has happened since id almost forgotten about it till this last patrol took us back through that same little village about thirty miles northwest of the riffle dag leaned back looking very bland fawn was chilly but silent shed get no tale if she rushed to judgment it was a joke almost at the time i thought i doubt it was such a big laugh for her said fawn yeah i found that out fawn sat up she didnt go and hang herself did she barrs eyes flew wide hang herself do farmer girls really do that sometimes or drown themselves no it wasnt that um bad kind of the opposite i asked the blacksmith after i saw her shed got married and had a child one of those sevenmonths children with the ninemonths hair said dag we get them around these parts time to time i think they get them everywhere conceded fawn i might have had one myself once but for some strange mortal chances we ran into each other outside the village smithy cold day but bright the sort you sometimes get just before the first thaws my patrold stopped to get a couple of cast shoes fixed she was carting away some tools that had been repaired she recognized me right off but she pretended not to know me like i was invisible or she wished i was she had her little girl toddling after her about owlets size blondheaded curls everywhere in this knit cap with a long pink tassel she kept tossing her head to make it fly around and giggling dag she was mine fawn scowled how can you be sure just from her age and hair color no from her ground fawn cast dag up a doubtful look he returned a nod barr would know yes then what did you do fawn asked in worry rode after her of course i caught up with her cart the first bend out of sight of the village first she said she didnt know me and then she told me to leave off because she hated me and go away or shed scream and i said the little girl was mine and she said no she wasnt and i said yes she was and then the girl started to cry from the yelling and her mama finally stopped the cart to talk he added after a moment shed named her lily barr took a breath and went on as if afraid that if he halted he wouldnt be able to get started again she said she had a good life now and a good husband and i didnt have no call to ride after her and wreck her world again murmured fawn and i said did this fellow think my girl was his and she said yes and she offered me all the money in her purse to go away quiet did you take it asked fawn sweetly barr glared outraged now fawn chided dag fawn sighed it was much too late for a traditional farmer horsewhipping to do barr the least good after all or anyone else she supposed he was learning his lessons in other ways possibly no less painful so she said if i wanted the other favor from her she wasnt going to give it to me because she was pregnant now and this one was her husbands and i said no i didnt and yes i could see it was a farmer boy and healthy too she seemed glad to learn that and calmed down a little but she said that i should ride away and stay away because id done her enough harm for one lifetime barr blinked she didnt actually look like she was suffering that much how would you know said fawn tartly you werent there to see the bad parts just because you survive a hurt doesnt mean you didnt bleed plenty at the time so what did you do dags deep voice cut in before fawn could expand on this theme barrs face scrunched up i didnt know what to do so i turned around and rode off like she wanted but dagthat little girlshe couldve shouldve might have been my my tentheiress in some other world too late for that i think said dag i know but all the way home i kept thinking about her and about calla and indigo i dont know that i would have understood the problem before i met calla and her brother what if lily grows up with groundsense whats she going to do come eleven twelve years old when all those strange things start happening in her headyou know how it feels when your groundsense first comes in all in spurtswith no one to tell her how to go on what if her mamas husband comes to suspect and and doesnt treat her right he hesitated what if i come to some sudden end out patrolling and no one knows she exists dag said you did not i take it see fit to inform your parents they have a halffarmer granddaughter they having the next closest interest by right barr shuddered absent gods no barr was still fawn was reminded very young by lakewalker standards he might change his views on that later dag grimaced well we dont know them you do i wont argue with your judgment on that barr ducked his head gratefully but i thought someone had better know about lily in case and if there was anybody who could tell me what to do next it would be you two so i rode here dag shifted in his chair and nattiemari on his shoulder she whuffled faintly smacked her lips and fell back to dozing what do you want to do well first off no harm then youll do best to leave that poor woman alone to live her life said fawn it seems shes found a way to survive she wasnt sure whether to say you or without you so said neither you darent take that away from her unless you stand ready to replace it and i dont think you can and nor does it sounds like she much wants you to no i guess not dag sucked on his lower lip tapping his hook gently on the rocking chair arm but you shouldnt i think leave little lily alone without any watching over at all things change parents can diehers or yours come to thinkfortunes reverse families upstakes and move at the very least you owe the child a discreetand if you dont know how to be discreet its time you learnedcheck every now and then so you can spot if she ever needs any help barr said slowly i could do that i guess his strain was easing now that he had his confession out and if it was replaced by a nearly remolike glumness well it would do him no permanent harm barrs gaze lifted to nattiemari flopped happily on her papas shoulder and fawn finally recognized his odd look as a kind of envy he added apologetically my father is a pretty good one mostly for all that we used to butt heads till mama threatened to drown us both in the riffle he spent a lot of time with me and my sisters teaching us things its strange to think that i wont ever well the silence that followed was broken only when nattiemari stirred and squawked dag looked down at fawn and smiled twohanded chore coming up huh funny how your dexterity comes and goes medicine maker she scrambled up stirred her pot once more swung it to safety then bent and retrieved her daughter yep leaking dag was entirely unmoved by the damp spot left on his shirt though he did stretch his arms and roll his shoulders she might offer to teach barr how to do this cleanup chore sometime if he hadnt yet learned on one of his younger sisters not just now thoughlater on when his heartache had eased a bit earlier in their acquaintance shed often wished for someone to hit barr over the head with a plank and adjust his selfcentered view of the world it seemed little lily finally had but the results werent as much fun to watch as shed imagined when fawn came back dag gave up the old rocking chair by the fire for her to sit with nattiemari taking her place on the hearth to continue his earnest discussion with barr new groundshield designs and teaching unbeguilement and how many camps had sent inquiries and how many makers had promised to pass the word arkady blew in then with sumac stomping his feet and complaining as usual about the deadly northern cold which was actually quite mild today and the talk turned to medicine making clearcreekstyle and the new apprentices begging for places and horses in foal and plans for the spring and if hope for their wide green world grew as slowly as a baby grew into a mama well no one had ever said raising either was a task for the faint of heart or the impatient fawn rocked and fed the future
