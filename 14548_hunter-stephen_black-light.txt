stephen hunter black light for my son jake and its old and old its sad and old and weary i go back to you my cold father my cold mad father james joyce finnegans wake today you can drive south from fort smith down to blue eye in polk county in about an hour by way of the harry etheridge memorial parkway its a bright band of american road one of the finest in america even if it didnt quite have the anticipated effect of turning polk county into the branson of west arkansas and even if some local cynics call it a porkway and not a parkway fastfood restaurants and super gas stations cluster at its exit ramps pennants flapping in the breeze the high signs of national motel chainsdays inn holiday inn ramada inncan be seen from the roadway even if the motels are never more than half full and the anticipated polk county land boom never quite took off the land especially as you near blue eye county seat of polk becomes spectacular for the ouachita mountain range the only eastwest range in america a heaving sea of pinecrusted earth and rock the parkway was finished in under the sponsorship of boss harrys son hollis etheridge then a member of the united states senate and later a presidential aspirant it was the sons idea to honor his father an authentic great man who had been born dirtpoor in polk county and had found his fortune first in the intense ward politics of fort smith and then in the true corridors of power in washington where he was a fifteenterm congressman and the chairman of the house defense appropriations committee it was only fitting that polk county and fort smith should honor a man whod brought so much gloryand so much patronagetheir way in no parkway existed nor could one even be imagined you got from blue eye to the big city the way harry had when hed moved up there just after the great warthat is along snaky slow route as pisspoor an excuse for a road as could be imagined two lanes of shabby blacktop cranking through the mountains and the farmland widening every ten miles but just slightly for onehorse towns like huntington mansfield and needmore or boles or even the poorest and most pathetic y city it was just the hardscrabble landscape of one of americas most wretched states hills too mean to be farmed valleys where desperate men eked out some kind of subsistencelevel survival and now and then some cultivated land but more usually the bleak shacks of sharecroppers one hot morning in july of that year a saturday at the polk and scott county line on us about twelve miles north of blue eye a state police black and white ford pulled over to the side of the road and a tall officer got out removed his stetson and ran his sleeve over the sweat on his forehead he wore three yellow sergeants stripes on his shoulder and under a gray brush cut had the flateyed incapableofsurprise face of a noncommissioned officer in any army or police force in the past four thousand years a whole phalanx of wrinkles moved across his leathery face which had been baked in the sun for so many years it resembled a scrap of ancient hide his eyes were slitted and shrewd eyes that missed nothing and also expressed nothing he had a voice so deep and raspy it sounded like someone cutting through a threehundredyearold hardwood pine with a threehundredyearold saw his name was earl swagger and he was fortyfive years old earl looked about the road was cut into the slope here so that there was a high bank on one side and on the other the land fell away not much to see other than a goddamned billboard for texaco gasoline just a southslope closegrown forest hard to walk through a cutting maze of shortleaf pine black oak and black hickory with a tangled undergrowth of saw brier and arkansas yucca dust seemed to hang in the air there was no breeze no sense at all of mountain crispness you looked back toward blue eye and your vision was cut off by the hump of fourche mountain up ahead which just appeared to be a huge wall of green on the road an armadillo had been smeared to meat and blood and shattered shell by a loggers rig in the still heat cicadas hummed sounding like a drunken quartet of jews harps it hadnt rained in weeks forest fire weather it reminded earl of other hot dusty places hed been tarawa saipan and iwo jima he checked his bulova he was early but then hed been early most of his life it was am the others were still fifteen minutes off earl put his stetson back on a colt trooper rested under a flap on a holster at his right hand he hitched it up for the heavy weight of the big pistol was always drawing his belt downward and it was a continual battle to keep the gun where it was supposed to be thirty gleaming highvelocity softpoint cartridges rode in the belt loops gleaming because unlike other officers he removed them each night from the loops and wiped them off to prevent them from corroding in the moisture the leather attracted his fifteen years in the marine corps had taught earl many lessons but the most important of them was always take care of your equipment it was a melancholy day which just yesterday had promised so much happiness july jimmy pye was getting out of prison after ninety days up in the sebastian county jailhouse at fort smith jimmys cousin bub would meet jimmy at the jail gate and the two would take the polk county bus earl would pick them up at pm and take jimmy over to mike logans sawmill in nunley where mike had promised jimmy a job that was important jimmy had to get off on a good start if he was to make a go of it and by god earl had promised jimmys wife edie that he would see to it that jimmy got himself straightened out this time earl had reluctantly first arrested jimmy in when jimmy was sixteen on a routine breaking and entering hed busted him again in twice in each time jimmyd charmed his way out of it for that was one of jimmys gifts he wasnt just handsome and the best high school athlete ever seen in polk county but he had a sweet charm he made people care for him hed grown up wild his father after all had been killed on iwo jima and earl had sworn to the dying man that hed look after jimmy and pledges made on a battlefield have a huge weight back in the real world earls wife june had once even said i swear earl you care more for that wild whitetrash boy than you do for your own son it wasnt true earl knew but he also knew that people might see things that way when you looked at jimmy you just knew he could be everything that his poor father had dreamed of he was smart enough for college and if steered right could go on to a wonderful life hed married the prettiest girl in all of polk county when he was twentyone years old just four months ago but it was as if he had some twisted wire in him just when he got a thing that no one else could getedie white for instancehed throw it away so it was set to be a day of celebration on the premise that ninety long days in the jailhouse would straighten out anybody a new life for jimmy and edie all of earls obligations to jimmys dad taken care of and the future before them all then earl watched as another vehicle drew into sight a black squad car rolling up from blue eye it pulled over and a blue eye deputy named lem tolliver a big man got out and earl remembered why he was there howdy earl called the deputy we late or you early im early besides the damn dogs aint here yet i hope that goddamned old man dont forget he wont called the man then turned and opened the rear door of the car okay boys out you go wes here in prison denims two sunburned old boys climbed out of the back of the truck earl knew them lum and jed posey spent more time in the blue eye lockup than out of it they were always in petty trouble with the law for every damned little thing you could imagine usually whiskey running which was the federal boys problem but also petty larceny car theft shoplifting anything thatd put a bite of food down their gullets but earl had thought of them as essentially harmless you sure you wanta go to all this trouble for a nigger gal said jed posey what difference do it make let the niggers take care of it shut up jed said earl smack him upside the head lem if he gives you any more shit hes here to work not to talk you just goin soft on the niggers said jed everbody knows it the niggers everwhar is gittin uppity they say they got them northern commie niggers comin on down here to stir up our niggers its a jew thing them hebes got a master plan to take over you watch and give our gals to the big niggers you watch you just shut up there jed said earl i done warned you now i dont but usually give a man a single warning its you ise going soft on earl was known for his courage and toughness in a fair fight or even an unfair one he would have broken jed posey in a hundred places then used what was left to wipe off his shoes jed seeing earls flare of anger knew it was time to back down nobody stood against earl swagger just shootin my mouth off earl dont you pay me no mind lem used his penknife to cut a wedge off a plug of browns mule he stuck it in his mouth on the left side where it bulged like a sack of gold pieces and offered the plug to earl no thanks said earl its one goddamned bad habit i aint yet picked up you dont know what youre missing there earl smiled the swollen lem expelling a squirt of the sweet brown juice to explode in the dust at the side of the road at that moment the third and last vehicle swung into view way down the blacktop pulling a tail of blue smoke and grinding through ancient gears a twentyyearold nash chugged wheezily up the slope seemed to lose its energy once or twice but at last pulled off the road by the first two vehicles most of the top had been blowtorched off forming the semblance of a pickup out jumped a spry old fellow of indeterminant age sheathed in a wad of beard under an old engineers cap and filthy overalls you could smell pop dwyer a mile downwind it was said and on this day there was no wind so pops odor hit earl like a blunt instrument but it wasnt just the odor of unwashed man it was also the odor of dogs keep that old man away from me said jed posey he smell like a damn sty you dont smell so pretty yourself after what you been in last night said lem tolliver over his plug howdy pop howdy all said pop his nutty grin flashing through his beard brought my best boys mr earl just like you said fine said earl watching as pop went to the back of the truck messed with the kennel cages there and leashed up three liquid squirming dogs two were blue tick hounds smooth and slick and muscley under their bright sheen darkgummed and eager the third was some kind of beagle its muzzle swathed in folds of flesh mr mollies the best said pop if it can be found old mollie boy will find these other pups are just along to learn the damn ropes mr mollies getting old the two blues yapped and showed white teeth and pink tongues and a swirl of saliva dense and foamy they took an immediate dislike to the posey boys sensing jeds contempt for pop jed posey drew back you keep that damn bitch away from me aint no bitch that uns got a pecker size of a corncob on him you dumb billy said pop and i aint wearing no chains neither im a free man on a police contract the dogs barked in the dull hot air swirls of energy against the dolor of the heat and the dryness of the timber they actually unsettled earl just a bit though he tended to discount his superstitions but on tarawa during the mopup nd marine dog teams worked over the blownout bunkers and pillboxes hunting for the few living japs among all the dead ones to save them no sir if the dogs howled and came scurrying out of a bunker it meant a jap inside still breathed or moaned in went two or three pineapples followed by the call fire in the hole after the blasts a marine with a flamethrower squirted ten seconds worth of flaming gas into the small space roasting it out it was twelve years ago and earl would remember it forever the yapping of the dogs the flat anticlimactic blasts of the grenades the stench of gas and flesh the buzzing of the flies you got something mr mollie can work on said pop squinting up his eyes it dont work without something to start on earl nodded now he really felt an ache he reached into the backseat of his cruiser and withdrew the pink wool sweater see if they can pick up a scent off this he said and watched as the dainty pink garment was seized in pops huge grimy hand and dipped to the dogs who nuzzled and rampaged with it one of the blues got a good hold on it and shook the other two hounds away but both shivered and closed and got nose and fangs into it seeming somehow to absorb or suck it in then just as quickly as it had started it was done the dogs had beat the scent somehow into their sharp but narrow dog brains and the object itself lacked interest it fell moist and ripped to the earth you didnt want it back did you mr earl asked pop no no thats all right said earl lets get going you sure its the right spot im sure said earl he looked over his shoulder there sixteen feet high it said texaco with knockfree power and sky chief secret ingredient petro x over a vivid painting of five dancing service station attendants currently big on some show on the goddamned television set that earl had never heard of and didnt care about but somehow knew of anyway in the odd way a policemans mind works hed noticed an entry in the polk county sheriff departments incident log which he made a point of checking once or twice a week even though it wasnt in his jurisdiction proper it simply said white lady called in to say late last night she was driving up toward county line when she noticed in her headlights a negro boy acting strangely right there at the texaco sign she thought she ought to report it since shed heard many things about dangerous and uppity negro behavior farther south it stuck somehow lodged there meaningless in itself but then last night he got home late and was surprised to see his son bob lee standing alone in the moonlight in front of his farmhouse wearing his everpresent davy crockett coonskin cap bob lee was a quiet almost studious boy but not one to panic or frighten easily whats going on son he asked theys some people here to see you daddy the nineyearold answered they wunt go in the house though mommy ast em to something in the boys voice told him immediately an oddity was occurring and indeed it was a negro man and woman stood stiffly on the porch evidently too frightened to take junes offer of hospitality earl walked up to them hep you folks it was extremely unusual for black people to pay a house call on white people particularly strangers particularly after dark so earl knew in a second something was wrong though it seemed ridiculous as he approached he let his right hand brush against the holster flap over the colt trooper freeing it in case he had to go to pistol work fast but in the next second he realized hed overreacted mr earl im the reverend percy hairston down at aurora baptist i do hate to bother you at home sir but this poor ladys so upset and the town police didnt pay her no mind at all thats all right percy sister wont you sit down and git your load off he called through the screen door june can you git these people some lemonade he turned back to the negro couple you just tell me what it is and i cant make no promises but i will look into it but a part of him blanched negro problems were not a specialty of his he had no idea how negroes lived or thought they seemed to happily occupy a parallel world he also knew that they had a tendency to get into thorny problems of the sort only the lowest kind of white people ever managed it seemed they were always stabbing each other or someones brother was running away to the big city with someones wife leaving ten scrawny kids at home and an outofwork daddy or something none of it ever made any sense at least to a white man and if you let it suck you in you might never get out policemans wisdom let the niggers go their own ways as long as they dont get in our way mr earl said the woman who looked to be about forty with a big hat on in her sunday best to come to see the man mr earl its my girl shirelle she went out last tuesday night it was and she done never come back oh mr earl im so scared somethins done happened to shirelle how old is shirelle earl asked shes fifteen said the mother prettiest little thing in the whole town she my sweet baby daughter earl nodded it sounded like some typical kind of niggertown thing the girl had been picked up by a handsome buck in a fancy suit of clothes hauled off to what they called their cribs out on the west side of town where the music and the dancing never stopped and the alcohol and god knew what else were passed around for free despite the fact that polk was a dry county then the buck had the girl and left her by the side of the road maybe the girl woke up ashamed and left town or maybe she went to live with the buck you never knew it played out different each time but it was always the same well honey earl said maybe she met a feller and went to a party you know these young kids these days mr earl said the reverend ise knowed sister parker and her people nigh on two decades i know shirelle since i baptized her she be a good child she be the lords child hallelujah and amen please jesus said shirelles mama my baby daughter be a good baby daughter yes maam said earl beginning to lose patience now that they were going all holy on him you know them white polices they got in town them boys dont give no two nothings about what happens to a negro girl even a highclass negro girl like shirelle said the minister bitterly earl was surprised that percy dared express himself so clearly but he knew it to be true the sheriffs department wouldnt do squat to help a negro problem or solve a negro crime and then earl made the connection the strange negro boy out by the road where he shouldnt have been late at night when he shouldnt have been the girl whod disappeared the same night who knew yall have some lemonade now said june coming out with a pitcher and two glasses on a tray all right said earl as i said i will look into it i know some bucks who might tell me a thing or two andwell thats the best i can do for yall but ill give her a fair shot oh mr earl you so kind oh thank you thank you thank you jesus you done answered my prayers said the lady as the reverend hairston tried to calm her down earl walked the two back to the ministers old car a prewar de soto that had seen a lot of miles when he got the lady settled he followed the old man around and drew him aside percy i may need something of shirelles if it comes to it he said playing his last card you know a piece of clothing something she kept close to her body can you manage that when you drive mrs parker home ill make some phone calls tonight about some things get some boys i know and ill stop by the church early tomorrow say round nine yas sir what you need them things for but then the old man stopped and looked at him i aint necessarily saying anything said earl but yes we may have to go to the dogs you go home now and pray them dogs dont find nothing in the morning earl was a methodical man and before he let anything happen he carefully inscribed each mans name in big blocky print on the inside cover of his notepad jed posey he wrote lem tolliver lum posey pop dwyer and under that search team earl all right all right he said hearing the impatience in lems voice okay lets get her agoin the old man worked the dogs beautifully it was as if he spoke to them in a secret language a low soft vocabulary of mutterings whispers clicks and crackles and most expressively a kind of smooching sound the low fat beagle seemed to understand that he was the special one like a movie star he didnt do much work and nosed the earth with an affected casualness unimpressed by everything the younger bigger dogs were wilder and more exuberant they seethed with impatience and immaturity pop took them up and down the road for half a mile in each direction and got no response from any of them except once one of the blues broke hunt discipline and went straining toward a coon that shimmied in panic across the asphalt pop gave it a mean swat and it fell into line behind the offhanded master sniffer at the same time earl deputy tolliver and the posey brothers eyeballed the vegetation looking forwell who knew for what signs of a disturbance tracks articles of clothing shoes socks ribbons anything but they saw nothing except lum posey found a coke bottle which he carefully cleaned and put into his overall pocket for the penny itd bring the sun climbed and burned more fiercely jed posey was muttering about nigger gals and how pointless all this was loud enough to be heard not loud enough quite to provoke earl earl felt the sweat collecting in the cotton of his shirt and watched as the other men sweated through their own shirts it was godawful heat well earl said lem when theyd finished trekking in each direction what you want to do now want to go into the forest and up the damn hill your call goddamn said earl he checked his watch it was close to noon jimmy pye was out now hed be at the fort smith bus station with bub earl knew the schedule by heart the blue eye bus didnt leave till ah maybe give it another damn hour or so say i tried anyhow mr earl what is it pop my dogs is gittin hot they cant work in this weather much longer pop youll get your damn seventyfive cents an hour from the state but you aint done till i say youre done shit earl wanted to leave too he had things to check on maybe he could talk to a nigger he knew who owned a pool hall in west blue eye thatd be one more thing he could check but he still had four and a half hours till jimmys bus arrived lets take it about a hundred yards back through them damn trees and do a goddamn sweep he called you boys keep your eyes open jed posey hawked a gob of something yellow and thick into the dust as his comment on the decision but wouldnt meet earls glare the old man yanked hard on the leashes of the three animals and the little squad set off toward the trees as they penetrated the land seemed to fight them the slope increased to wear against their legs no clear path yielded through the dense pines and the saw brier slashed at their legs the sunlight fell in slanting sheaves through the darkness but it wasnt a cool darkness and was instead hot and close sweat burned earls eyes goddamn screamed jed posey stumbling for the tenth time in the saw brier as the frustration built this aint no goddamned picnic earl this aint white mans work git some niggers if you want to fight your way through this shit even earl had to agree it was pointless you could hardly see ten feet ahead the dust rose and swirled all right said earl admitting defeat lets get out of here mr earl it was pop were leaving pop aint nothing back here mr earl mollies got something earl looked the two stupider young dogs had collapsed their heads forward on the loam their pink wet tongues spread out under halfopened jaws their bodies heaved with effort and disappointment but mollie sat quietly his head cocked his eyes quizzical very calm then he began to keen the sound seemed to come from some other orifice than his throat it was pure animal a single howl throaty with texture and meaning then he bobbed up pivoted his tail wagging smartly and pointed with his nose hes got her mr earl said pop shes here goddamn shouted jimmy pye shoot and goddamn boy turn that damned dial git me some noise jimmys hair was blond and longish slick with brylcreem which glinted in the sun like a sheet of beaten gold above his beautiful fineboned face bubs thick fingers worked the dial but the trace of musical energy that jimmy claimed to have heard as bub slid through the possibilities seemed to vanish jjjimmy i caint ffffind spit it out boy just go on goddammit and spit it out but bub couldnt the word hung up somewhere between his brain and his tongue trapped in a molasses of frustration and pain goddamn when would he learn to talk like a man bub was twenty a thickish sluggish young man who had worked as an assistant carpenter at wiltons construction in blue eye until hed been let go because hed never quite got the hang of it he had grown up totally in awe of his older cousin who was the best running back polk county had ever produced and had hit his senior year at polk high and could have gone either to the minor leagues or the university of arkansas if he hadnt gone to jail instead but today bub was more than in awe he was possibly in love for jimmys golden power seemed to fill the air radiating the magic of possibility go on boy yelped jimmy his face alight with glee find me some music none of that nigger shit no hillbilly shit neither no sir want to hear me some rock and roll want to hear me rock around the clock by mr bill haley and his goddamn comets bub hunted earnestly sliding the radio dial left and right seeking a powerful memphis or st louis station but for some reason the gods werent cooperating and exactly the kind of shit jimmy didnt want kept coming up loud and clear kwin out of little rock or that nigger beam kgod from texarkana but jimmy wasnt angry he was enjoying bubs struggle and gave him a little pat on the shoulder jimmy was driving where the hell had he got a car well goddamn bub was so overwhelmed with love when he arrived at the jailhouse in west fort smith he just hadnt bothered to ask and jimmy hadnt explained the car was a goddamned beauty too a sleek white fairlane with fordomatic gearshift a convertible no less looking brand spanking new as if itd just been driven off a showroom floor jimmy drove it like a god he whipped out rogers avenue zooming in and out of traffic blowing by the slower vehicles honking merrily waving with a movie stars sexy confidence whenever teenage girls were glimpsed the girls always waved back and this was one thing that left bub a little confused jimmy was married he was married to edie white who was jeff whites widows daughter and a legendary beauty why would jimmy want to go and wave at strange girls it was all set up it was perfect mr earl had gotten jimmy a job at the sawmill in nunley and jimmy and edie was going to live in a cottage outside nunley on the late rance longacres cattle ranch miss connie longacre ranees widow had said they could have it for free if jimmy pitched in at driving time meanwhile jimmy would learn a trade at the sawmill he might even become a manager everybody wanted it to work out lookie them gals said jimmy as the car sped by a pontiac station wagon four pretty blond girls who looked like cheerleaders smiled as jimmy shouted hey there pretty missies yall want to git some ice cream the girls laughed for jimmy was so handsome and outrageous they knew he meant no harm though it was bub who noticed that he had crossed the centerline and that a truck was bearing down on them jjjj or how about a drivein movie we could go to the skyvue and see jail bait jimmy hollered the truck was the truck honked the girls screamed jimmy laughed jjjj with just the flick of his wrist jimmy jiggered the wheel and stepped on the gas and with his athletes coordination shot into the tiny space left between the station wagon on the right and the rushing honking squealing truck just ahead the car dipped and swooped ahead whooooooie sang jimmy im a goddamned free man he took the next left fishtailing in a spray of gravel and headed back downtown you find me some music bub pye you old dog you bub caught something familiar with at least the kind of banging rhythms he had figured his cousin needed thats a nigger said jimmy nnnnno finally bub got out thats a white boy he sounds like a nigger jimmy listened it was a white boy white boy with rhythm white boy with nigger in him full of piss and cum hot and dangerous whats that white boys name he wanted to know bub couldnt remember it it was something new some name he could never remember caint member goddamn said bub well you aint no damn good then said jimmy with a big old smile in the way of saying in code it dont matter a damn jimmy looked at his watch he seemed to know where he was going bub had only been up to fort smith a few times before he had no idea pretty soon jimmy pulled over just about noon he said they were on a busy street midland boulevard across from a big grocery store iga food line it said on the sign it was the biggest grocery store bub had ever seen goddamn said jimmy lookie that bub lookie all them people in and out a place like that all of them with their goddamned money just spent on food hell boy must be fifty sixty thousand dollars in that place bub wondered what the hell jimmy could be talking about something he didnt quite like about it jjjjj but goddamn jimmys luck was good one two three oclock four oclock rock five six seven oclock eight oclock rock nine ten eleven oclock twelve oclock rock we gonna rock around the clock tonight we gonna rock rock rock til the broad daylight the unleashed dogs found her earl heard them baying wildly their voices agibber with excitement them dogs wont wont touch a goddamned thing said pop over here over here shouted jed posey goddamn and a half over here earl breathing hard struggled uphill through the trees and saw brier and broke into some kind of clearing where the shade vanished the full killing force of the heat struck him earl saw jed standing his chest heaving next to a shale wash where the earth was stony and broken the sun harsh on the other side of the wash the three dogs sat obediently barking to drive the devil away but the devil had already been here and done his work shirelle lay on her side her pink gingham dress crunched up around her hips her panties gone her blouse ripped off she was beyond shame her eyes were wide and lightless her skin was gray almost colorless sheathed in dust her body was fat with bloat so that she seemed some balloon version of herself and the left side of her face was swollen into a massive yellowish bulge crusted with a fissure of gore where someone had smashed her with a rock a yard away the rock lay stained with black you can see her cooze said jed gwan look everbody you can see her cooze you could of course and earl looked and saw what appeared to be a black gruel of blood on the childs privates and what looked like contusions and abrasions the buzz of flies the stink of rot earl had seen death in all its forms over three major island invasions hed done more than his share of dealing it too but the girl looked so broken and thrown away so blasphemed by the gases that filled her then abandoned on the side of a rough hill it broke a heart he thought would break no more after the long walk through the tide at tarawa and the flamethrower work on saipan and the upclose tommygun killings so very very many of them on iwo no jap or dead american boy ever looked so uselessly pointlessly wasted lem tolliver spat his plug out explosively them niggers he said what they do to their own kind we never should have brought em over they belong back in the african jungle lem said earl you get these boys out of here and go on down to my car i want you to hey earl said jed posey jeds brother laughed hey earl you mind if i jump on for a free one i mean i might as well before you close her up she aint going to mind none and she sure aint no virgin no more earl hit jed with his balled fist just under the ear toward the jaw a short vicious completely satisfying jab he hit him so hard the man was driven backwards as he chomped on his own tongue opening a terrible wound and blood began to gurgle out of jeds mouth and darken on his overalls a storm of dust floated up as jed thrashed a bit and then lay still one hand raised in surrender earl stepped toward him as if to work on him some more jed scurried back on his hands and knees his face gone to the fear a man feels when he knows hes way overmatched dont hit him no more earl begged lum posey git this piece of shit out of here earl said to lem i want him out of here you go to my car you call on the goddamned radio to the greenwood barracks tell em its a real bad tenthirtynine i want the criminal investigations team here as fast as they can git it and the criminal id team just in case our boy done left prints or something you put in a call to sam vincent i want him out here representing the prosecutors office hell be the one heps me put this fucker in the chair you call your sheriff you tell him i want his people out here to close the site and search for evidence you call the coroners office cause we gonna need some real careful body work done you got that lem i got it earl pop you rest and feed them dogs now and git em into the shade we might need them see if they can get up a scent on whoever done that you understand pop yes sir now go on git the men turned back down the hill lum posey helping his bleeding brother earl was alone with the body okay baby girl he thought time for you to talk to me sos i can find who done this to you and i swear to you im gonna nail his ass and watch it fry in the chair earl was not sherlock holmes he wasnt any kind of bigcity homicide cop he hadnt even worked a murder before that is as opposed to a killing where the killers identity was obvious from witnesses or known grudges this was different a body abandoned for close to a week it was a true mystery it went way beyond anything earl had ever tried before but earl swagger was a serious professional law enforcement officer committed to perhaps even obsessed by the twin masters of duty and justice his mind was so rigid that he could only see one possible outcome of the event before him the execution of the murderer and until that happened he would feel a serious hole had been blown into the wall of the universe it was up to him to plug it he set about it methodically oblivious first to the odor of death which attended second to the flies that hung and buzzed and finally to the obscenity of the crime itself first thing drawing the scene let the photogs do what they would later he wanted to record for his own uses the overall look of the body its relationship to the setting he used the triangulation method useful in outdoor settings where no baseline such as a road could be located he chose as his three points the closest tree about twentyfive feet beyond the childs head the edge of the vegetationless shale on which she lay and off to the right a stone humping out of the surface of the earth crudely he did a stickfigure version of her broken body placing it between the landmarks then he began an immediate site search for footprints or other signs of disturbance in the earth as well as other bits of personal evidence of the man or men whod brought or dropped her here but the land was so hard and dry it would register no such impression instead a breeze kicked up unfurling shirelles dress throwing vapors of dust then just as quickly it subsided earl went to the body itself later the criminal investigations team the professionals could make a more intense examination in search of microscopic information fibers body fluids possible fingerprints bloodstains that sort of thing but he wanted to learn what he could from the poor child speak to me honey he said feeling such an aching tenderness come over him he could hardly abide it something in him yearned to take her up and cradle her against the pain but there was no pain there was no her anymore only her swollen remains her soul was with god he shook his head clear and spoke again to her in his mind come on now you tell earl who did this to you he looked into her blank and depthless eyes at her utter broken repose at her bloodstains and bruises and cruel abrasions and something hot and hopelessly unprofessional stole over him he saw a vision of his own child that serious somber hardworking little boy who seemed almost never to laugh saw bob lee snatched and brutalized like this left to swell so much it spread his features over his face and for a second earl stopped being a police officer and became any avenging father and through a red fog had an image of blowing a shotgun shell into the heart of whoever had done the thing in the name of all fathers everywhere but then he had himself back and was cool again asking dry professional questions things easily measured easily known she was quite dusty was it from lying here these many days possibly but more likely he now believed shed been murdered somewhere else and dumped here if indeed that rock was the murder weapon thered be a lot more blood he bent and looked at the bloodstain congealed under her skull the pattern of dispersal was regular and there was no sign of spatter only a pool that suggested that the blood had thickened and leaked out slowly surely if the girl were thrashing as she was being killed the blood would be more widely scattered so he thought that whoever had done this had simply bashed her dead skull with a rock in order to make it look as if hed killed her here but why what difference would it make he bent close to her throat yes it was bruised under the gray swollen skin had she been strangled not beaten to death he recorded the fact in his notebook then he saw on a sliver of shoulder revealed by her twisted blouse a red smear not wet but dry he touched it dust red dust hmmm he turned to her hand and gently opened it he bent and looked at her nails under each of the four fingers was a halfmoon of what might have been blood but looked more like the same red dust hed found on her shoulder the forensics people would have to make that determination red dust red clay possibly it hung in his mind reminiscent of something then he had it about ten minutes outside blue eye out route near a wide spot in the road called ink was an abandoned quarry noted for its red clay deposits it wasnt so marked on any maps but by the consensus of oral folklore folks called it little georgia in homage to the red clay state he wrote little georgia on his notepad among his other recordings he went to the other hand which was twisted under her still clenched in a deathly fist but he thought he saw something in it a scrap of paper or something he should leave it he knew but the temptation to know more was overwhelming gently with his pencil as a kind of probe he pried open her tiny hand trying not to disturb a thing a treasure fell out in shirelles left hand was a ball of material crumpled and desperate something shed grabbed from her killer as he killed her with his pencil earl opened it up it appeared to be the pocket of a cotton shirt and it was monogrammed three letters big as day rgf could it be that easy earl wondered my god could that be all there was to it finding mr rgf with a shirt with a pocket missing lawdie lawdie lawdie someone was chanting earl looked up lem tollivers considerable bulk was moving through the trees under the propulsion of great agitation earl earl earl what is it lem said earl rising i called em earl and they gonna git here when they can why whats earl jimmy pye and his cousin bubba shot up a fort smith grocery store oh earl they done killed four people even a cop earl they got the whole state out looking for that boy jimmy reached back over the seat and pulled out a paper grocery bag whose heavy contents as he lifted it into his lap stretched it out but it didnt break though when he set it down in his lap bub heard the dull clunk of some kind of heavy metalonmetal contact here you go jimmy said removing a large longbarreled revolver from the bag and handing it to bub that theres a smith special thats a big ole mulekick of a gun bub looked at the thing it felt impossibly heavy in his hands oily dense weirdly charged with energy a gun a pistol hed never had a pistol where he came from everybody had guns but not pistols hed seen policemen with them that was it he looked over at jimmy and felt his jaw drop and the look of gaping stupidity come across his face when he didnt have no idea of what to say jimmy meanwhile had pulled out some kind of automatic gun with gnarled stag grips and had commenced clacking and snapping it fitting something into its handle fiddling with a little lever thirtyeight super he said contentedly your colt goddamn asskick gun too a lot of gun for a little package a pros gun but then he noticed the look of utter befuddlement on his young cousins face now whats up and bothering you bub whats eating you bub could think of nothing whatever to say then he blurted iiiim scared oh come on now bub

easiest take there is bubs throat got dry and then he had trouble breathing he wanted to cry he so loved jimmy but he didnt think he had it in him for this kind of thing he just wanted his old job back he just wanted to pound nails for mr wilton every day just like the other rain or cold snow or frost just pound them nails that was enough for him look bubba said jimmy leaning over drawing bub in conspiratorially i dont know about you but i aint going back to some goddamn job in a sawmill to make a mr goddamned earl goddamned swagger a happy man i aint working there sooner or later you lose

ardent that bub closed his eyes and saw it for just a second his image of movie stars involved swimming pools fancy clothes little mustaches sleek cars all under the california sun it seemed utterly beyond dreaming until just now i swear to you nobody going to git hurt you just back me up in that office you show em the gun i show em the gun nobody going to fight us for some goddamned money belongs to a grocery company then we out of there we swing on by and pick up edie and off we go nobody going to git hurt come on now bub i need you time to go jimmy got out of the car and wedged the automatic into the waist of his chinos he set his sunglasses squarely on his handsome face then reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of luckys with a flick of his wrist he snapped a butt out picked it out of the pack with his lips and then lit it off a zippo that had magically appeared in his hand he turned and winked at poor bub who just watched thinking without a stammer anywhere in his mind it already is a movie jimmy in the lead jimmy walking confidently a bebop in his step a smile on his face bub is behind bub is scared and confused he too has stuck the gun into his trousers but its heavy and awkward and the barrel is so long it sticks him in the thigh so hes walking peglegged like some cripple scampering clumsily to stay up shouldnt we have masks suppose we get recognized my mama is going to be sooooo mad why am i doing this why is this happening jimmy jimmy help me jimmy just swaggers ahead his bright face lit with pleasure as he blows in he stops gives a courtly gesture to a woman struggling to load her car bends swiftly and lifts her last bag up so that she can secure it why thank you she says yes maam he sings so charming she never notices the gun stuck in his pants this eats up a second or so and bub catches up and as a twosome they enter the store is strangely dark and vast bub thinks of a church at six counters six women are plunketyplunketyplunking over cash registers feeding items one at a time to baggers as they click up the tote on the machine its the biggest grocery store bub has ever seen he has an impression of giant spaces aisle leading to aisle stacks of goods and foods its an america hes never seen something about the order of such a place the hugeness and careful planning with which its laid out scares him he feels as if hes about to defile a shrine a small voice begins to whimper his knees are pounding he yearns for the courage to scream no no jimmy no but up ahead jimmy is so completely sure of himself that bubs got no chance and no nerve to confront him besides its happening already so fast jimmy has reached a kind of office beyond the last register a high walled structure with a door in the center of all that space with a counter around it and a pleasant redhaired woman standing there talking to a negro lady virginia it says on her blouse assistant manager she looks at jimmy responds as everyone does to his charm and looks and a broad smile begins to beam until she recognizes that what he lifts to her face is a gun and her face melts into fear jimmy shoves the colored lady to the ground and puts the gun right into virginias face and is screaming git into that office and git that safe open gulping poison air like a fish dying on a pier virginia rings a buzzer and the door up to the office opens and a young man leans out bub isnt sure what happens next theres a crack that he cant identify from anywhere that seems to make no sense that is uncalledfor and the young man is on his knees and then on the floor hes wet something wet is coming out of him and going all over the place bub hears screaming shouts yelps he gets his own gun out slowly and in a second theyre up in the office but jimmy is pushing him back screaming you cover from outside so bub stands guard and doesnt see or know whats going on in the little office but that theres a terrible commotion crack it sounds again and bub flinches in fear he doesnt like the sound a bit he knows its a gunshot and he hopes jimmy is shooting into the air or the ground to scare them but from the utter terror of the screaming hes begun to catch on to the idea that jimmy is actually shooting people why would he do that why would jimmy shoot anyone if you ever saw jimmy run with a football escape tacklers move sideways break into the open and pump away in long graceful strides to the roar of a crowd youd never ever think such a boy could shoot people bub begins to cry he doesnt like this at all it scares him sick he is supposed to be on a bus with jimmy on his way back to blue eye jimmy is going to live with edie and work in a sawmill in nunley for mike logan mr earl had said mr earl said it would happen why hadnt it happened why wasnt he on the bus someone comes at bub some big negro man and has bub down against the counter holding his arms in he hits bub a hard blow in the mouth and the world bangs out of focus why why did he hit bub bub launches forward with his shoulder and the man slips down bub points the gun at him why he says jimmy is next to him do it he commands do it i cant he thought dont make me but the negro man arises from the floor and comes at him and the gun goes off he hasnt wanted it to he doesnt mean to it isnt his idea it isnt his fault its the niggers fault hoooieee thats the boy screams jimmy engorged with delight come on lets git out jimmy pulling a big bag with him leads him out he stops once turns and screams run yall and fires his gun five fast times over the heads of the people cowering behind the registers they fall backwards over themselves to get away screaming suddenly its bright theyre outside on a deserted midland boulevard though bub has the impression of people hiding behind parked cars and in shop doorways he sort of likes this all of a sudden its exciting he feels important come on bub lets amscray the fuck outta here jimmy is pulling him across the street when a black and white police car its siren wailing appears far down the street and drives straight at them so fast it seems to go from small to big in but a second bub is so scared theyre going to be hit but very calmly jimmy takes careful aim and starts shooting crackcrackcrackcrackcrackcrack he fires fast and bub watches as his bullets hit and splatter the windshield of the police car which veers suddenly to the left and slams into a parked car the noise is terrific broken glass flies everywhere bullseye shouts jimmy with a hoot come on bub we gotta git outta here its going to get hot they roared along the street then cut down an alley spun left through colored town and watched as the negroes fled sirens rose behind them i kilt a man said bub you didnt kill nobody said jimmy swear to god you gave that old boy the thrill of his life hell be telling his grandchildren about it for years to come you sure of course im sure goddammit i didnt put no real bullets in the guns those folks just lay down because they thought they was shot its a big joke in an hour theyll be laughing up a goddamned storm now im hungry hows about some hamburgers bub just swallowed he wasnt sure he believed jimmy he remembered stuff pouring out of the boy that fell out of the office he hadnt seen nothing on the black man hed shot but it was so jangled it was all mixed in his mind he did know the police car had crashed and that its windshield had broken here we are said jimmy you got any money im flat busted he pulled into a giant chrome and glass structure that had a buck rogers look to it where a fleet of cars was already parked at oblique angles to the central building bub read the sign his lips forming each syllable tasteefreez heard this place has the finest damned burgers in the world lets see what they got uh jimmy yyyy spit it out boy yyou think this is a very good idea i mean wont the polices be looking for this car well now they aint never going to think wed stop for no burgers now would they and indeed a couple of blackandwhites their sirens zinging their flashers flashing rushed on by see what im doing is something new jimmy explained its called cool im being a real cool cat a cat said bub he didnt get it yeah a cool cat is your slick customer he dont sweat nor git excited hes always got a laugh on his face and he a rebel he rebels against things cause he knows things is fucked against him but he always stays cool nothing gets him hot bub contemplated this novel idea suddenly a carhop appeared whats the ruckus honey gal jimmy asked her some old boys robbed the iga she said they done killed some people and a nigger too oh you just wait said jimmy giving bub a big wink bet that changes real soon and you find out nobodys been shot for real i dont know said the girl whats your best burger here we got all kinds they sell a lot of the bacon supreme you got your bacon and your cheese and your lettuce and tomato they got to hold it together with toothpicks they put a little flag on it its really cute sound good to you bub bub nodded he was hungry yeah said jimmy two of them bacon supremes two orders of the fries and you got a good milk shake i mean now made out of real ice cream and milk mixed up superthick on one of them beater things yes sir best shakes in the town you bring us two chocolate strawberry said bub one choc one straw said the girl jimmy sat back he lit another lucky inhaled deeply then looked at his watch he seemed like a man without a worry in his mind you just relax now he crooned its all going to be all right its going to be cool we are the coolest cats around the girl brought the hamburgers and it was the best hamburger bub had ever had in blue eye a place named checks checkout offered hamburgers but they was greasy wads of overcooked beef on a tough little bun nothing like this heaven the meat was so damn tender the cheese tangy but that bacon really made the thing sing whod ever think of putting a piece of bacon on a burger damn bub said aint that a damn burger thats a king burger said jimmy the king of all burgers okay now you just come with me he got out of the car taking the bag that said iga with him ever so casually and just began to amble along easy as can be by now they got our car idd he said we wouldnt get two damn blocks with it so well git another car right where i got the last one see this is working out just fine they turned off the main road and walked a block or two into a nice little area with small houses neatly kept the summer heat was lighter because of the heavy green trees that closed everything off it felt enchanted water sprinklers heaved back and forth like giant fans on a few of the lawns and a couple of young men mowed their grass the mowers sounding clackety and mechanical they passed an old lady howdy maam said jimmy nice day nice day to you young man she answered with a smile soon enough jimmy came to an oldsmobile parked unattended in a driveway he turned back and smiled at bub see you get all nervous you cant do nothing people sense youre up to bad you be cool you just smile and look like you got the whole world in your back pocket they back off and give you all the room you want you just watch how damn easy this gonna be with that he sauntered up the driveway opened the door and in a second had the car started he backed up come on bub you gonna wait for mr earl swagger himself to invite you bub got in off they drove in another nice car tooling down suburban streets as mild as could be jimmy looked at his watch again as if he had a schedule to keep turn on the radio find us some good tunes he said this felt weirdly familiar to bub and he bent over and worked the dials and knobs as a crackle of sounds came out but none of that harddriving hillbilly crazy stuff that jimmy preferred he got some country patsy cline he got that perry como singing about the moon hitting your eye like a big pizza pie he got miss day doing que sera sera and he got authorities in fort smith have set up a twostate dragnet to locate two armed and dangerous men who robbed a downtown grocery store killing four men including a police officer bub just heard the killing news dumbly the police say that newly released car thief jimmy m pye of blue eye and his cousin buford bub pye also of blue eye were responsible for the outbreak of violence on peaceful midland boulevard they theorize that the two killers will attempt to return home to the polk county wilderness says state police colonel timothy c evers and here a richer deeper voice came across the radio if i know my bad men theyll head to land they know well theyll run into our blockades and well take care of em the way they should be taken care of that ole boy sounds ticked said jimmy he sounds like we got him out of bed or something jesus jjjjimmy yeah cuz he did so say we done killed them boys well maybe they was real bullets in my gun but there werent none in yours you in the free you was just long for the ride bub your cuz jimmy wouldnt get you in no shit that i swear wouldnt be cool at all now wes just gonna head out to blue eye pick up edie and off we go figure we may lay up with an uncle i got over in anadarko oklahoma hell but bub was crying bub whats eating you boy jimmy i want my mama i dont want to go to no jail i didnt want to kill nobody oh jimmy why is this happening it aint fair i never did nothing wrong not nothing i just want there there bub dont you worry bout nothing i swear to you you got it all up ahead california a job as a stars number one boy you can bring your mama out there and buy her a nice little house its all set up i swear to you all set up bub began to sniffle his heart ached he threw the gun on the floor he just wanted to make it all go away well lookie here said jimmy bub looked up and saw a gaudy sign against the bright blue sky but since it was midday the sign wasnt turned on it said nancys flamingo lounge and bub noticed that all up and down the street were other places called clubs all of them with unlit signs and the sleepy look of nighttime spots jimmy pulled off the road and down a little driveway so that he was out back in a parking lot area dominated by a large blank garage there was utter silence hey said jimmy guess what we there we made it we gonna be fine bub watched as the large garage doors of the structure peeled back and jimmy eased the car forward darkness and silence swallowed them cut only by some jangled music far off as from a cheap small radio rock rock rock around the clock tonight rock rock rock til the broad daylight cool said jimmy when he got there he thought everything would clear up but insteadand of coursethings simply got more confused he took a room in a cheap motel near the mexican quarter of town and spent the morning fretting in his room about his next step heres what he came up with no next step ultimately he decided to go for a walk on the dumb hope that hed just get lucky that things would just work out as they usually did but of course the one fact he knew precisely and totally was that things didnt always work out thats why he was here because sometimes things dont work out violence and craziness break out people die lives are destroyed it was so much hotter and brighter it was after all the desert but hed had a different image of it somehow what he saw was a spine of purple mountains or hills actually blocking the horizon in one direction and in all the others just low rills of hills crusted with spiny scaly vegetation the odd cactus pronging up off the desert floor like some kind of twisted tree of death the color green was largely absent from a world now dominated by browns ochers and pewters the town was total jerkwater it lay along a single main street fastfood joints at one end trailer parks and quasi suburban places back a little bit farther under imported palms and the rest scabby little shops many boarded up convenience stores a grocery a dry cleaner cowboy and indian souvenir places for the odd lost tourist any small town anywhere too far off the interstate this state happened to be arizona and the town happened to be called ajo so russ walked up and down the street and saw nothing and didnt get lucky he found a barcafé and eventually had lunch listening to cowboys talk in low hushed voices about nothing much nobody noticed him finally he paid the bartender the five dollars for the sandwich and thought he caught a semihuman smile of acknowledgment say he said i wonder if you can help me oh i bet it is i know what you want son is it that obvious its pretty goddamned obvious you get a lot of guys like me some like you and other kinds too had a german tv crew in town for close to a month sold em maybe a thousand dollars worth of barbecue the soundman franz he really got to liking my wifes barbecue but they didnt get anywhere nope not them not nobody had a real slick fellow from new york he acted like he owned the world and we was his employees he was out here for six weeks hed done a lot of big business hed set up a deal with that fellow they executed in utah and with oj himself but he didnt get nowhere and a french magazine writer some babe wish shed come to write about me id have told her all my secrets even the secret to my wifes barbecue does anybody ever see him does he come out oh hes about tall quiet fellow keeps to himself mostly married a damn fine woman they got a little girl now but he lives a life he does things sees things mixes can you tell me where he lives cant do that son he wouldnt want me to i respect him you have to respect him i think he just wants the world to leave him alone i do respect him said russ thats why im here youre probably going to fail everybody else has why should you be different why should i be different russ thought yes key question well russ said i bet its something nobody ever threw at him before its not even about him then just be patient son hell know youre here probably knows already people tell him things you know yeah i know well thanks ill probably end up buying my thousand dollars worth of barbecue too im in for the long haul russ went outouch that blinding sunand fumbled for his sunglasses as he got them on a pickup truck pulled down the road and russ thought he saw him a lean man suntanned and leathery with calm squinty eyes but no it was just a fat cowboy he ambled up and down the street trying for eye contact with the locals but all he got was the grim stare of smalltown america that proclaimed no trespassing eventually he went back to the motel and got out his file again the exhibits were tattered and dry a few a little greasy from being handled too much if reading could have drawn the blackness out of the ink then theyd be faded as well but it hadnt and they werent modern industrial printing vibrant colorful indestructible the most famous item was the newsweek cover from that month in when hed been the most wanted man in america bob lee swagger it said hero turned assassin time which he didnt have had run the same shot bob lee swagger vietnams tragic legacy it was an old picture of swagger taken in vietnam it told everything and nothing a southern face somehow a man in his twenties who could have been in his forties with a jaw so grim and skin so tight he looked a little like a deaths head which in a way he was he wore tiger camouflage and a marine boonie cap the eyes were narrow and hooded allowing no contact with the world on any terms save their owners they lurked behind sharply etched cheekbones it was almost a nineteenthcentury face he looked like a cavalry trooper with mosby or one of quantrills raiders or someone whod lugged a colt down to the ok corraland come back again five minutes later the job done on the magazine cover in the crook of his arm there rested a sleek rifle with about a yard of scope atop it and it had been well established that with that tool he was one of the worlds foremost hunters of men russ passed on the cover shot and looked at other photos which had come out of the photo morgue of his recent employer the daily oklahoman of oklahoma city these were shots taken at the mysterious hearing that ended bob lee swaggers two months of celebrityhood and marked his return to total selfwilled obscurity he was like t e lawrence hiding as shaw the aircraftsman a man who had an almost physical need for anonymity he had just vanished amazing in an america that quite routinely awarded celebrity with huge amounts of cash but no no book deals no movies no tv specials no answers to the provocative questions some analysts had raised suggesting that he knew things no one else knew thered been a ripoff novel from someone way on the outside and a number of patchjob articles in the survivalist and gunnut press all misleading all vague and speculative all russ knew wrong but one of them had contained one nugget of information that swagger had evidently come to roost in ajo arizona with his new wife the handsome woman who had attended the explosive hearing therefore thought russ i am in ajo arizona in a cheap motel running out of money and time and luck finally on the fifth day as russ chomped through his last morsel of barbecue while not facing the reality that his funds were getting dangerously low the bartender came over say there the man whispered did you know that a certain party sometimes comes to town today russ swallowed yes sir its friday he comes in to lay in supplies at the southern states now i may have this mixed up with someone else but id say i just saw a certain pickup heading down in that direction and if i was you thats where id relocate myself great blurted russ you didnt hear nothing from me not a thing russ fumbled with his sunglasses and sprinted out southern states southern states yes russ remembered two blocks down where the ranchers gathered in the mornings before work and then returned to after work where you could buy anything from sacks of grain to halfmilliondollar international harvester threshers russ was so excited he got a little mixed up but then got himself under control and decided rather than driving to just hoof it he turned and sprinted his feet flying ducking along the covered sidewalk around the odd party of tourists past some lolling teenagers feeling like a complete jerk no feeling somehow flushed and excited once in his career on the oklahoman hed had to sub for the vacationing movie critic and go on what was called a junket where hed flown down to new orleans and sat at a table in a hotel banquet room when kevin costner and clint eastwood were paraded around the room a half an hour per table it was of course a completely ridiculous situation but when he first saw the two men entering the big hotel room he felt as he felt now giddy goofy unprepared callow as a pup completely unworthy and they were only movie stars and turned out to be at least as far as he could tell in the time he shared with them at the big tables fairly decent guys but pretend heroes now this guy was a real hero in war and in peace hed done extraordinary things as russ ran and as his excitement mounted his concentration scattered his mind seemed full of glistening soap bubbles a plan he thought you need a plan but before he could hatch a plan his shoes took him around a corner and into the parking lot that lay in front of the southern states store it was a gravel lot and dust hung in the air russ stopped and drank in what looked like a scene from some documentary on americas working habits this would be the rural division as imagined by someone with the mordant glee of hieronymus bosch and the eye for detail of norman rockwell everywhere it seemed that farmers or ranchers or cowboys milled in the yard swapping yarns near their pickups or backslapping and grabassing in little clots in the background were cattle pens and there was some lowing from the imprisoned animals it looked like saturday night at the railhead where was john wayne well dammit john wayne was everywhere these men all had craggy brown faces and seemed woven together out of rawhide and pemmican all were encased in dusty denim and leather from head to toe in a dozen different shades all wore boots beat to hell and gone but the headgear was various straw hats stetsons both domed and flat brims curly or straight baseball caps engineer caps even a fishing cap or two out of such chaos russ could make no sense at all and felt as out of it as an african american at the local klan meeting but they seemed to be so enjoying themselves that they paid him no mind at all and he wandered among them looking for a set of features he could match with the features hed memorized off the magazine cover and the more recent photos hed guess a man like bob would leave a wake of wannabes would be at the center of a circle of acolytes so he looked for a king among all these princes he could make out none and now one or two at a time the boys would peel out and begin to leave whats going on he asked one oldtimer friday noontime they haul in to reload on supplies lots of spreadout places here moren youd imagine the boys all git together for a bit of joshing time on friday noons i see he said he wandered on through the thinning crowd utterly failing to connect any of these tawny ageless men who seemed from a different race altogether with his image of bob lee swagger he reached at last the supply house where some laborer was throwing sacks of feed into the back of a weathered green pickup russ froze and then unfroze and just stared the man was tall and sweaty and had wrapped a red bandanna around his throat to soak up the sweat he wore the faded jeans and faded denim shirt of a cowboy but was also wearing a battered faded red baseball cap that said razorbacks the man felt him staring and looked him hard in the eyes and yes yes it was him older than russ expected and browner almost the color of navajo pottery without an extra ounce of flesh anywhere on his face his skin was a nest of fissures and crags taut yet ruination itself the pewter eyes were so intense they burned like lasers he looked not at all romantic or heroic he looked like a hot tired sweaty man with a lot of work still to do he looked grumpy as hell and maybe mean too he looked like he could whip russs ass what are you staring at sonny he demanded russ was overcome with shame but also excitement and he ran to him and blurted mr swagger mr bob lee swagger i came a long way to see you well you wasted your goddamned time said swagger you go write your goddamned book on your own i aint explaining myself to a pup like you or the best writer on earth i hate writers i really hate writers now go on get out of my way with that he climbed behind the wheel of his truck and headed off bob worked the horse the horse had an eye condition an ulcerated pupil which had infected possibly from fly contamination the infection had spread mysteriously and monstrously until the eye looked like an eight ball sheathed in mildew and terrible acne had formed on the face all the way up to the ear and halfway down to the nostrils he was a beautiful gray gelding named billy and the girl who owned him had done a good job building him up and bringing him along until the eye thing its the worst disease anyone in our family has ever gotten said the girls mother he could die from it now now bob had told her but mainly told the grave little girl who hadnt said a word the vets done all he can you got to trust the medicine and we wont miss a night and you got to trust us well take the best care of billy that can be taken bob lee swagger having survived nearly fifty years of a life that included various adventures in the marine corps three tours in the southeast asian war games second place finish and a private life that was amazingly complex had ended up the one way hed never thought hed end up happy now who in hell would have thought such a thing for one thing the dry arizona weather had a miraculously curative power over his reconstructed left hip where a grain fullmetaljacketed bullet launched at over feet per second had torn out a hideous amount of bone and cartilage it had taken the government a long year in a vet hospital to get the thing rewired and even then after all that time it had been a juryrigged job and for a good twenty years hed awakened each morning with the reminder that if you hunt men for a living they by god hunt you back the pain possibly had led to the drinking but possibly not hed stayed drunk and mean for nearly a decade to bury pains that maybe had nothing to do with his hip and could not otherwise be rewired memories of young men thrown away for so much nothing except possibly a name on a black wall that took time to work out and make peace with and now the blessed lack of hurt down there where he was rebuilt was extra gravy every goddamned day but that was only part of it the other part of it was the wife a woman julie fenn rn shed once been a picture carried between the helmet and the helmet liner by his spotter one of the great young men who came home from the land of bad things in a rubber bag in a wooden box some short circuit in the universe had decreed that bob meet julie many years later when hed seen her hed known this is the one there is no other and by the same token shed known that of him and now they were married had a little girl named nicki who wrote her name ykn backwards and scrambled the age tossed in too on all her drawings of horses it was so good so many of the things hed thought hed never have because he had been exiled from the rest of the human community because hed done his countrys bidding with a rifle and gone out and officially killed enemy soldiers one at a time over a long distance he knew of course that hed killed now all that was somehow forgotten and then the last thing the goddamned frosting on the goddamned cake the horses this was the best work there was there was something about a horse that he loved they told no lies and if you handled them well they responded he never met one that was ambitious or jealous or hypocritical they were honestly stupid creatures strong and dumb as oxen but with that magic component that he so loved in animals even when hed hunted them which he did no more some magic would come over them and in a flash theyd go from grazing herbivores to sheer dancing beauty on the hoof to watch them runespecially say under the tutelage of some small girl like the one that owned billy or the one that was his own and would grow in time to be a horsewoman herselfto watch them run all that muscle playing under the skin all that dust ripping up beneath their powerful hooves by god that was a kind of happiness that could be found in no bottle and in no rifle and hed looked for happiness in both places he worked billy it was called lunging the horse is on a tether and if you work it around in circles cantering twenty feet out on a lunge line driving it with a lunge whip or as now if youve bonded with the horse with voice alone come on now billy bob crooned and billys muscles splayed and flexed as the horse rotated around bob though to bob it was straight ahead of him because he was rotating with it the dust rose and clung to the grays sweaty shoulders hed need a good rubdown afterwards but that was all right because they were coming to get billy that afternoon twenty minutes when billy had begun to recover bob had started lunging him to get the softness and soreness out of his limbs get those muscles hard and sleek and defined again get him back to what hed once been in the beginning the animal had balked still unsure because the ulceration had eaten into his vision and he only saw percent in the bad eye and could only go seven or eight minutes before beginning to act out now he did twenty minutes three times a day no problem and was looking as if he could show again soon okay boy bob called and began to draw in the lunge line that ran to a halter called a caveson slowly he brought the horse in and at last halted him he snapped off the line removed the caveson and threw a halter over him now hed walk the animal for another twenty minutes to cool him down you never put a hot horse away then hed wash him off mrs hastings and suzy would pick him up at three and it would work out just fine billy would be gone back to his life you had to do something and this was it for bob his marine pension still came in his wife julie still worked three days at the navajo reservation clinic and sometimes more if necessary and there was just enough for everybody to have everything they needed daddy nicki was four blond and a tough little thing its good to raise them on a ranch twenty miles from town he thought teach them to get up early and go feed the animals with you form their character early to hard work and responsibility as his had been formed and theyll turn out fine he had been raised with a father lost to grotesque tragedy nothing like that would happen to his child yes ykn billys sweaty yes he is baby girl we got him lathered up fine just a good workout now we got to get him cooled down are they coming to take billy today yes baby girl they are hes all better now see some scars some vision loss but other than that hes okay we got him through it ill miss billy ill miss him too but he has to go back to his life that girl suzy shes missed him too the last four weeks now its her turn to be happy ykn wore jeans and keds and a little polo shirt she was as are all children who pass the better part of their times in barns among horses dirty and happy she bobbed along beside her father as he took billy in slow cooling circles around the corral until finally the animals breathing had returned to normal you gonna wash him down daddy help me honey yes daddy you are such a big girl ykn said bob and his daughters face knitted up and laughed ykn took the horse by the halter line and drew it into the barn where she strained to link it to a rope the big animal yielded entirely to her bossy directions she didnt give it a chance and she didnt back down come on you big old dopey thing she shouted shoving against its shoulder to move it backwards she brought another line over and clipped it to the halter effectively tying the horse in the middle of a stall can i give him a carrot daddy let me finish honey bob turned on the hose and fixed a pail of soapy water then moved to the horse and began to rhythmically sponge it neck to shoulders shoulders to withers down each muscular leg daddy said the girl yes honey daddy there was a man bob said nothing at first a little steam gathered behind his eyes a little fire a skinny man thick hair dark looked intense whats intense daddy ah like hes galloping only hes just standing still not a smile nowhere on him face all tight like a fist yes daddy yes thats it where was he he was parked just down the road from where the bus let me off this morning rosalita looked at him and he looked away in a pickup truck white yes daddy do you know him is he nice he smiled at me i think hes nice hes just a fool boy with the idea i can make him rich and famous hell get tired hell go away i thought he got the message but i guess hes more stubborn than i give him credit for would they ever leave him alone you get your goddamned picture on a magazine cover and the whole world thinks you got enough secrets in you to write a bestseller over the years no end of assholes had come at him how did they find him well it was like his address was out on some nutcase internet and all the losers and loonies came sniffing along some werent even american the goddamned germans were the worst they offered him money anything for ah interview but he was all done with that hed had the worst kind of fame and it was enough for him he was done with that did he bother you honey no daddy he just smiled if you see him again you tell me now and ill speak to him and then hell go away otherwise well just wait until he tires himself out many of them just disappeared after a while their ideas were so absurd and ill formed some of them didnt even want to write about him and make money they just wanted to see him and draw something from his presence from the thing that his life had been so stupid his life wasnt a monument or a symbol or a pattern it was his life it seemed for a time the boy vanished then he was back again one night sitting patiently in the truck across the road julie was back theyd eaten and were sitting on the porch drinking iced tea and watching as the sun set behind the low mountains in perfect serenity he is stubborn damn fool boy at least he keeps his distance he has some manners in their time people had pulled into the yard jumped out and begun offering contracts setting up camera lights gladhanding carrying on sure they were onto something big theyd found el dorado at last bob had several times called the sheriffs office the last time for the germans who were extremely obnoxious but he wont go home its beginning to feel a little sick poor ykn i dont want her to think this is how you have to grow up oh she can handle it it helps her to know her father is an extraordinary man it gives her a little something i think swagger looked at his wife she was a tanned and handsome woman whose blond hair had begun to show streaks of gray she hadnt worn anything except jeans and boots and tshirts since theyd returned to ajo she worked like a dog too bob thought she worked harder than he did and that was saying a lot how old would you say he is she asked about twentytwo or so if he wants adventures he should join the corps he could use a few weeks on parris island he shouldnt hang out here scaring the child and making me even crankier than i am i dont know why he seems different he reminds you a little of donny thats why bob said naming her first husband yes i suppose he does he has donnys shyness and unsureness donny was a good boy bob said the best donny had died in his arms gurgling blood in little spouts from a lung shot eyes locked on nothingness squirming in the terror of it his left hand gripping terribly into bobs biceps hang on donny oh jesus medic medic goddammit medic just hang on itll be fine i swear itll be fine but it wasnt fine and there were no medics bob was hung up outside the berm his own hip pulped by the same motherfucker and donny had come for him and caught the next round square in the boiler he remembered the desperate pressure in donnys fingers as the boy clung to him as if bob were life itself then the fingers went limp and the gurgling stopped bob hated when that sort of thing came back on him sometimes you could control it sometimes you couldnt blackness settled on him in older days it would have been drinking time im sorry she said i shouldnt have mentioned it its all right hell i guess i can go tell him facetoface to get out of here and quit wasting his life he got up gave her a tight little smile and walked down the road into the place the boy was across the road in an old ford f just sitting he saw bob coming and bob saw him smile he got out of the truck now what in hell do you want bob said say your piece the boy stood before him yes early twenties lanky with a thick mop of hair and the soft look of college all over him he wore jeans and a fancy little shortsleeved shirt with some kind of emblem on the chest im sorry he said this was stupid but i didnt know how else to talk to you so i thought if i just showed you i was serious about all this just let you know i was here didnt force it or act like a jerk they say youre a very decent guy anyway i thought youd eventually let me talk to you this aint no interview i dont give interviews whats done is done and its mine not for nobody else i swear to you i have no interest in and i aint doing no imsuchahero books no nam stuff thats over and done and best forgotten too let the dead lie in peace its not about vietnam i didnt come about vietnam but i did come about the dead they faced each other for a long moment twilight the sun eased behind the mountains leaving an empty world of gray light and silence the dead let them alone please what good does it do what good can it do why would this boy come before him claiming to represent the dead he knew so many of the dead too so goddammit spit it out a book you do want to write a book i do want to write a book yes and yes its about a great american hero and yes hes from blue eye arkansas and yes hes the kind of man they dont make anymore no books said bob well let me go on just a bit the boy said the great american hero is namedwas namedearl swagger he won the medal of honor on iwo jima february d plus two he went home to america where he became a state trooper in arkansas on july he shot it out with two armed robbers named jimmy and bub pye he killed them both bob looked hard at the boy and they killed him too your father i want to do a book about your father earl assigned lem to stay with the body until the state detectives and the county coroner arrived he got back to the cruiser and noticed jed and lum posey leaning on pop dwyers hood the three of them hooting like old drunks but when they felt his hard glare they dried up fast jeds face had swollen badly it looked as if hed swallowed a grapefruit yellow and rotten but jed was hard mountain trash you could bang on him for hours without really breaking anything you boys stay here till the detectives come pop them dogs cool cool as they can get in this weather mr earl said pop good you stay on station now you hear i do said pop earl got into his cruiser turned over the engine and flicked on the radio the air was full of traffic as the state mobilized for the manhunt led by the state police all officers of them who would inherit responsibility for this job he listened for a bit in disbelief as if in disbelieving he could make it go away but it would not go away ah dispatch this is car two niner ah we are now in blockade at and i got two units arching down between and you got that dispatch roger two nine we got the state piper cub working your area trying to cover them back roads hes on another frequency but if we get anything well git to you got it dispatch im holding here got three units more coming in wally the colonel says you might want to send one of your units over toward lavca we got good military help out of chaffee and i think theyre goin pitch in some airborne stuff dispatch i got a unit headed to lavca good work and over two niner earl recognized two niner as bill cole a lieutenant in the logan county barrack dispatch was talking for major don benteen secondincommand colonel evers must have been calling the shots from somewhere in little rock and was presumably on his way over to take area command jimmy you goddamned little fool he thought with sudden passionate bitterness where did we go wrong on you what got into you boy howd you turn out this way there were no answers as there never had been for jimmy pye earl shook his head hed been as guilty as anybody of telling jimmy pye that it was okay hed always been there for the kid easing the fall even as he recognized the remoteness in jimmy and denied it even as he began to see how different jimmy was from poor old lannie pye he thought of bub pye jimmys cousin a poor dim boy who no one ever thought would amount to much so dreary in comparison to jimmy earl couldnt even bring bubs face up out of memory even though hed seen him just yesterday there was something forgettable about bub what would happen to him bub had been a carpenters apprentice but he just couldnt get the hang of things and theyd let him go hed never found another job he was a decent boy but without much in the way of prospects but he was no criminal that goddamned jimmy had made him a criminal darkness crept into earls mind this poor dead colored child jimmy pye all in one goddamn day it was the worst day hed had since iwo jima reluctantly he picked up the microphone and pushed the send button dispatch this is car one four i am teneight earl where you been it was the major taking over for dispatch been at that crime scene major you copy and send units negative one four earl you got to let that nigger gal cool till we catch up with jimmy pye i seen the record hes a polk county boy and you were his last ao i know the family said earl okay good you want me on roadblock or sweeps major negative one four you go cover the family maybe hell make some contact with them dont he have a wife thats what the records say married her a week before he done his jail time said earl you check on her then earl you cover her and any other kin he might have there in polk you need help you wire up with the sheriffs boys got you major but when am i going to see that forensics team i want them out here on the crime scene fast as possible maybe by the late afternoon earl them boys got lots of work still to do at the fort smith iga its a bloodbath he shot two boys in the office a nigger outside and he popped a city officer in a car hes bad news earl earl nodded bitterly checking his bulova earl drove through blue eyes colored town on the west side under the bulk of rich mountain it was small and scabby why couldnt these lost people pick up their garbage mow their lawns tend their gardens everywhere he looked he saw signs of decay and lassitude and disconnection from decent living the children barefoot and in rags lolled on the porches of the shanties staring at him with big eyes and slack faces they wore ragamuffin clothes and their eyes were huge unknowable pools as they stared at him though when he rounded a corner and caught them unawares he was able to see them playing games like jump rope and hideandseek with their natural exuberance but when they saw the big black and white car and the white man in the stetson with the harsh eyes they immediately cooled way down and met him with those empty faces in time he passed the most impressive building in colored town fullers funeral parlor an old mansion from the days when white people lived in this end of town nestled under elm trees and a little farther down the second most impressive building a church white clapboard and then finally down a treeshaded street where the small negro middle class lived the parker house was the third on the right also clapboard with a porch and a trellis hung with bright wisteria tiny but neat and well tended mrs parker led the choir in the church her husband ray was a clerk for the gas company the only colored man employed there earl was both glad and sick to see no other police vehicles that meant he could talk alone to the parkers without the presence of a lot of bulky white men with badges and guns which would quiet them down and scare them or at the least drive them into the guarded conditions negroes affected in the presence of a lot of white people but it also meant he would have to give them the news himself maybe he should have called that minister he parked aware of eyes upon him the girls mother stood on the porch her skin seemed not brown at all but ashen her features were drawn up as if shed been stricken and she breathed heavily he took off his hat as he approached mrs parker diddid you find my girl mrs parker youd best sit down now you sit down maybe youd let me call the minister to come over mr earl what is it please just tell me oh lord just tell me maam im sorry your daughter has passed someone found a reason to kill her we found her off the road twelve miles out of town maam oh lord said the woman oh lord lord lord oh why do he test me like that he knows i love him lord i love you lord amen i loves you she began to sob and rocked back and forth in the chair it was said commonly and earl half believed because hed never tested it that negroes didnt feel grief or pain like white folks that there was something undeveloped about their systems but not here there was nothing negro in it at all mrs parker let the power of the news have its terrible way with her he recalled seeing men give in to grief like this in the pacific just letting it roar out and over them he thought of his own son and how hed feel if he lost that little boy he wanted to touch the woman comfort her somehow but it never worked when people with different skin touched im so sorry maam oh lord she said he ducked into the house which was dark and neat he found the phone and picked it up operator betty this is earl swagger earl what you doin in niggertown thats mrs parkers line they got some trouble you connect me to reverend hairston betty put him through and he told the minister who said hed call mrs parkers sister and her aunt and be over in minutes to take charge earl went back out onto the porch where the woman still sat how did my daughter die mr earl it wasnt very pretty looks to me like someone choked or beat her i dont think she suffered long was sheyou know did he im afraid he did maam you know these animals get heated up they just cant control themselves oh lord said mrs parker he done took ever last thing from us every last thing your baby is in heaven where it dont hurt no more earl said tomorrow therell be some policemen to talk to you theyll want to know what time she left who she was with who her friends were she looked at him mr earl they dont care about no negro girl they wont ask a thing it dont matter to them earl said nothing as far as the blue eye sheriffs department went she was probably right well maam since this happened outside of town the state police detectives will have to work it and ill make sure the work gets done well catch whoever done it you understand i swear to you as i live and breathe we will solve it oh lord the woman said again knitting a tissue up against her ruined face mrs parker i know its hard now but i want you to answer me two maybe three things to get this all started you concentrate on answering me and helping your baby girl she said nothing do the initials rgf mean anything to you no sir okay now exactly when did she leave and where was she going it was tuesday night four nights ago she went to church meeting thats all she dont never come back you sure she made it the reverend say she was there what kind of meeting was this the woman looked at him and earl who had an instinct for such things thought he picked up a little something here just a meeting you know mr earl a church meeting for the lord he wrote down meeting what kind who there then she left okay yes sir and come on walking home earl looked down the street it was but two blocks to the church lord shed been picked up on this very street mr earl where is my baby now she aint still there is she yes maam im afraid she is we have to wait for the detectives to come out from fort smith seems we had another crime today a robbery some folks killed a bad boy from right around here did the shooting they say lord lord said the woman he was just about to ask her about friends when the reverend hairston pulled up in his old car oh sister lucille he keened oh jesus help us jesus help us the reverend swept toward her and so did four or five largebosomed distraught negro women and earl stepped to one side as the mourning began in earnest as the full weight of the melancholy fell across him earl drove out west of town on route toward nunley where the land was hilly pasturage green and lovely this way took him past boss harry etheridges summer home mountaintop and the two stone posts that supported the gray wroughtiron gate were testimony to boss harrys importance in the world and how he had risen in washington in his many terms in the house earl could see the road switchbacking its way up the hill to boss harrys compound which in fact was on the other side of the hill but all was quiet boss harry had returned to washington or possibly to his mansion in fort smith and there was no sign of habitation on the other side of the fence earl caught up with the news on the radio network just callins from roadblocks but nothing to report no sightings of jimmy and bub dispatch he finally called in this is one four am tenseventysix out to the pye place in east polk tenfour car one four ah dispatch any word yet on when that forensics team going to arrive at my tenthirtynine on route ah i think they done finished up there in fort smith now and will tenseventyseven around six they a little tired a busy day aint that the truth you call me dispatch if yall nab jimmy cause i want to get back to my tenthirtynine okay earl good luck tenfour and out dispatch nunley was just a few stores and mike logans sawmill off the road but beyond it was the longacre place he turned left passed the big house and took a dirt road back through the pastures where the biggest beef cattle herd in west arkansas grazed fattening up for the slaughter just four months ahead the cottage which mrs longacre had built for her son and daughterinlaw who had died in a car accident in new orleans and for that reason had never moved into was a gingerbread romantic fantasy a mothers dream of a wonderful site for her beloved son and his wife to live while he was prepared to take over the family properties but it was not to be now before it was a sheriffs car and the ladys cadillac a deputy named buddy till leaned on the fender howdy earl buddy youre a little out of your territory aint you sheriff thought itd be a good idee to keep a lookout case jimmy made it all this way back if he comes by god ill be ready he jacked a thumb toward his backseat and earl looked through the glass to recognize his old pal from the war a thompson submachine gun this one wasnt the military variant however it sported a circular fiftyround drum and a vertical foregrip underneath the finned compensated barrel just like al capones you scare me sometimes buddy said earl if jimmy makes it through fifty roadblocks and seventy miles i know hell come in easy why dont you put that thing in the trunk before you hurt somebody with it hell earl ever since you won that goddamn medal you think everybody else is common and you can boss em around earl never mentioned the medal and it irritated him when it was brought up to him but he controlled the flare of anger he felt and spoke forcefully in his raspy powerful voice i done enough work with them guns in the war to know they aint so easy to run smooth they jump all over the damn place i dont want to see you hurting anybody and you dont want that now put it in the trunk and move a spell on down the road if sheriff jacks asks why you tell him i told you so petulantly buddy did what he was ordered earl climbed the porch and knocked once connie herself answered earl thank god hello miss connie he said connie longacre originally came from baltimore shed met rance longacre in the east married him and come down and made polk county and its biggest cattle spread her home she and rance lived the life of maharajas out here on the most beautiful spread in all polk county until boss harry bought the mountain some years back but connie longacre never quite escaped death which dogged her like a little black mutt rance died at fortyeight and just last year her only child stephen had died at twentyfour along with his pregnant wife so much death but the woman in her fifties was still beautiful in a proud eastern way that no one in polk county could ever quite define you made that awful troglodyte go away earl wasnt sure what troglodyte meant but he got the gist of it yes maam hes set up down the road now hows edie oh her voice trailed off upset yeah well earl what on earth happened miss connie i caint say jimmy heoh jimmy you caint figure jimmy out what got to him i was never a great jimmy believer earl im old enough to look behind a pretty face he never had no father yes i know earl but everyone always used that to excuse jimmy lots of boys had no father and turned out fine i should have done more for him i could have done more but i had my own son will they catch him yes theyll catch him and make him pay hell have to pay no other way its appropriate i do feel sorry for his poor cousin bub loves jimmy too much jimmys easy to love but dangerous it aint been a very good day in arkansas he said we found a poor colored girl this morning north of town somebody messed her up real good oh my lord who was it shirelle parker i know shirelle i know her mother oh earl thats terrible it seemed to strike miss connie very hard those poor people she finally said woe is always unto them they aint got no picnic thats for sure some black boy i assume i hope i dont know though miss connie theres some monkey business going on and its got me buffaloed earl he turned honey you shouldnt be up said mrs longacre earl looked at edie white pye keeping his face blank as possible he was not an emotional man but he had feelings all right he just put them away and pounded a couple of nails into them to keep them there edie had been jimmy pyes best girl since when jimmy had led blue eye high to a secondplace finish in the state football classic she was possibly the most beautiful young woman anyone had ever seen in polk county her father died in the war a few weeks after the normandy invasion smoked by a german tiger in some french hedgerow her mother raised her alone though not much raising had to be done with edie from the start she was all right her nickname was snow white for thats who she reminded many people of jimmy was her prince charming and charming he could be when he wasnt being wild earl drank her in for a moment and put his feelings even deeper and pounded three or four more nails into them oh mr earl she said im so sorry dont be sorry edie he said jimmy made his own decisions this is his damn fix hes got to face the music this time i only hope no one else has to get shot he imagined jimmy running into someone like buddy till and his machine gun thered be hair and blood all over everything and god help anybody who got in between he shivered that damned boy said connie longacre he always was too handsome for his own good he spent too much time looking in the mirror i never trust a man who loves what he sees in the mirror more than what he sees outside it edie you needed a solid man a real man its too bad earl here is already married and has a boy rance used to say earl swaggers the best man polk county ever gave birth to and that was before the war now you stop that miss connie said earl she loved to say provocative things and watch peoples jaws gape well if i was a young woman earls the one id have gone after edie i have to talk to you i have to ask you some official questions they want me to stay here in case jimmy heads this way that silly boys on his way to hollywood if you ask me said connie we wont see him in these parts ever again well ill leave you two alone for a bit have things to tend to go gentle with her earl yes maam said earl he and edie went and sat by the window next to her he always felt cumbersome and awkward he could feel his boots and his leather gun belt creaking the colt trooper felt impossibly heavy he got out his notebook turned past the ten pages of notes hed taken on shirelle parker edie has jimmy been in contact no mr earl the last time i spoke to him was three weeks ago he seemed fine he was looking forward to getting out he was full of excitement i got a very nice letter a week ago he was full of excitement about the sawmill said hed end up owning it before he didnt say nothing about making new friends in jail or anything no sir sometimes a young guy like jimmy he can fall in with some hard cases and they can turn his mind he didnt mention anybody a new friend or nothing no sir you should tell me now it aint a question of betraying hes killed some people theres a price to be paid he has to pay it like a man thats the best that can be offered at this point a safe surrender a fair trial thats what i want earl i never ever wanted anybody to get hurt oh earl is it true he killed four men they say at least four witnesses identified him and bub edie looked off into the sunlight across the fields poor bub she finally said he couldnt hurt a mouse jimmy jimmy jimmy thought earl bitterly you fool why the hell did you have to go and do this thing for you havent heard from him today i havent the truth is mr earl i dont want to ever hear from him again i cant have this its too horrible i have to leave and start over he saw that she was crying she turned mr earl i have to tell you i married jimmy because i was bad i let him you dont have to tell me a thing all thats your business i was pregnant i didnt have a choice i didnt think my baby had to have his father a single track ran down from her left eye no one knows but miss connie it would kill my poor mother no one will ever know said earl no i lost the baby i miscarried a month ago the babys gone i lost my baby and now im married to a killer oh earl you dont have to worry about that earl said we can fix all that the phone rang should i answer its probably for me she went and picked it up and no it wasnt for earl its jimmy she said the boy sat on the porch with bob and julie can you get him something to drink please bob said he says he wants to write a book about my father do you want some lemonade a diet coke we dont have any alcohol in this house im a drunk said bob cant have it around a diet coke said the boy bob stared at him what was he some kind of emissary from the dead who could speak of his father to him bob found himself strangely agitated not fearful exactly but ill at ease uncertain not that the boy looked difficult or dangerous quite the opposite the boy wore wirerim glasses and looked a little queasy it was a look bob had seen on boys hed had to lead into battle why me why anyone why julie came back with the coke and a glass with ice he felt that the can was cold and took a swig bypassing the glass go ahead said bob my name said the boy is russell pewtie that is russell pewtie jr im twentytwo years old and i spent two years at princeton university before dropping out its possible the name pewtie rings a bell not yet said bob my father is russell bud pewtie sr until three years ago he was a sergeant in the oklahoma highway patrol big guy oldboy type everybody liked him a lot decent man he was famous for a bit it was in all the magazines they say theyre going to make a tv movie about him one of those line of duty things i must have missed it well it may have fallen through said the boy i dont talk to my father anymore so i wouldnt know what happened was in june of a guy named lamar pye led two other men on a breakout from mcalester state penitentiary in oklahoma lamar was a powerful criminal personality tough violent very smart extremely aggressive he cut a swath through southwestern oklahoma theyre still talking about robbery murder kidnapping the works now for some reason he and my dadwell they were fated somehow mixed together lamar ambushed my dad wounded him though only superficially but killed his partner my dad took it personally twice he tracked lamar down he had a total of three shootouts with pye he killed his cousin he killed a woman whod thrown in with pye and finally he killed pye shot his face off then shot him in the head sounds like a brave man said bob well said russ as if judgment were still pending he was seriously wounded shot in the lung broke his collarbone nerve damage crippled his right arm but he recovered and then one day he says to my mother i love you i always will goodbye leaves flat cold on a wednesday morning moves across town to a little house near the airport he was in love with and was carrying on with the woman who was his partners wife closer to my age than to his excuse me russ said julie where is this going what does this have to do with my husband i got to thinking how much we lost to lamar pye and we were lucky we got out alive lamar pye killed two men during the break out he killed ted pepper my dads partner he terrorized a farmer and his wife and the woman died soon after he kidnapped and terrorized a young woman he killed seven people in a robbery before my dad finally ended it we were lucky theres eleven people in the ground because of lamar pye that was three months work but lamar took my family he broke it up whatever happened he enabled my father to leave my mother it nearly killed my mother i should tell you to be quite honest that i now truly hate my father how he could do that to her after all those years he gave her and so if all the pewties survived lamar lamar still killed the family he couldnt have done a better job with a shotgun he paused took a swig on the coke now it was dark i got curious where does a lamar pye come from what so fills him with anger and hatred and fury what turns him that way so i thought theres a book theres a great book the story not only of how my dad got lamar pye but what created lamar pye russ we still dont julie said honey let the boy finish said bob i know where hes going i thought you would russ said so i contacted the mcalester prison authoritiesim a journalist used to be assistant lifestyles editor of the daily oklahoman in oklahoma cityand i got to look at his records and the stuff he left behind i found his reform school records his criminal rap sheet the prison records and i foundthis he reached into his wallet and unfolded a document and handed it over to bob what is it honey julie asked bob recognized it immediately and shuddered it was from the arkansas gazette of july hero trooper slays two before dying ran the headline a state trooper sergeant shot and killed two suspected murderers on route north of fort smith yesterday evening before dying himself of gunshot wounds inflicted by the two men dead were sergeant earl lee swagger of polk county a marine medal of honor winner in the pacific and jim m pye of fort smith and his cousin buford bub pye also of polk county bobs eyes ran down the account of the longago gunfight he handed it to his wife see he said as she read it this lamar pye that shot all them people in oklahoma he was the soni guess thats it right thats it said russ he was the son of the man who killed my daddy so you see started russ incidentally said bob dryly the papers then werent no better than the ones we got today the gazettes a big little rock paper it dont know shit about west arkansas they got a fact wrong they said north of fort smith it was south of fort smith thats why i dont trust em well said russ a little nonplussed uh yes mistakes do get made uh but you see if i wrote a book about lamar pye and what he took from people and where he came from well it has to start on the night of july it all starts that night lamars life and what became of it is it some genetic thing like father like son well maybe it is jim pye was a criminal and a killer his son was a criminal and a killer on the other side theres earl swagger war hero and man of honor and theres his son war hero and man of honor my father was a man of honor said bob i was just a marine but it all begins on that night all of it your life lamars life what you did what lamar did what happened to all those people in oklahoma people who never heard of jim pye jimmy pye said bob they called him jimmy yes well anyhow people who just walked into the fury jimmy passed on to his son and died for it it could be a great book too bad a great writer didnt see it but im the guy that saw it and so im going to write it im going to call it american men its a study of the life of jimmy pye and earl swagger and its the story of jimmys son lamar and poor old bud pewtie the cop who ran into him and chased him down the parallels are so unbelievable two bad boys just out of prison father and son two state police sergeants two violent robberies gunfights close up and scary and dangerous itsits a great book bob just looked at him it wont have a thing to do with and what happened to you and the time and newsweek covers and all that russ said its not about vietnam its about a legacy of violence handed down through two generations and the two lawmen who stopped it who stood up and said by god no more it stops here tonight your dad who gave up his whole life and my dad who got his head all messed up because of it bob doubted that at any moment during their long and violent nights either sergeant had said by god no more it stops here tonight thats how the movies would have it more likely each man had thought oh jesus dont let me get killed tonight but the movies never got that part right bob said julie it would be so nice to give your father his due he could have some measure of the respect and honor he deserved even now forty years later what do you want from me bob said ah well i suppose fundamentally your blessing and in small ways your help i was hoping to interview you on the subject of your father i was hoping youd share your memories of him not just of that night and the aftermath and what you remember or know of it but generally what sort of a man he was that sort of thing then i guess there might be some documents youd still have photo albums maybe some more articles letters i dont know anything to build it up to recall it to help me recreate it umh grunted bob noncommittally and finally some kind of help you know in getting others to talk i know how reluctant people can be to open up to a stranger particularly a younger man from a different part of the country though lawton oklahoma where im from isnt all that far from blue eye and fort smith but a phone call a letter of introduction see it has to be all oral recollection one of the first things i learned was that in the polk county courthouse annex burned down and thats where all the files and exhibits from the hearings were stored the afteraction reports the medical records all that i have secondary sources from the newspapers but i want to talk to people i even wrote the arkansas congressmen and both senators and some other people in hopes of opening doors i just got generic replies but with bob lee swagger helping me he stopped he was done thats it thats all i have im finished uh why dont you you know think about it give it some thought im no salesman i hate selling things i want you to be comfortable too well said bob look i could lie to you and say yep you let me think about it and we could play this game out but heres my answer straight out no bob julie no you let me talk i cant have it thats all over i buried my daddy and went on and made my way i cant be talking it up into some tape recorder those memoriesyou dont give them away for someone elses book it seemsindecent the boy took it well yeah he said well youre consistent at least just let me say id try to do honor to your father to me hes a hero he never left his family but going back is painful whats the point except to make some kid you never heard of a published writer okay uh ill probably still go ahead somehow im sort of committed i actually quit my job and im determined to take it the whole way so well im sorry i appreciate your time and your honesty i wish you luck russ you seem all right your dad seems like a hell of a man im sorry he did what he did sure uh i guess ill be going now he stood and tentatively put out a hand which bob shook and then turned and stepped out of the porch and began to walk up the road to his truck bob said julie are you sure bob turned and his wife saw something on his face shed never seen before it was she realized fear i cant go back there he said i cant face all that it nearly killed me then it killed my mother its better off forgotten oh god jimmy she said the voice came from far away but as earl drew near he could hear it increasing in clarity and the familiar rhythms of the young man hed watched grow up became evident honey oh god i am so sorry jimmy was saying i have made such a mess of things oh lord it just got out of hand earl hovered over edie feeling huge and helpless and enraged at what jimmy was doing to her jimmy please dont hurt anybody else i swear to you i wont earl tried to fight his way through his anger what should i do whats the smart move he was always so certain he always acted decisively and correctly in every situation from a hunting camp to a battle to any of a hundred police dilemmas but now he felt sluggish stupid lost he tried to get his mind working this was almost a jail breakout and in almost all jail breakouts standard operating procedure was to wiretap the homes of those the escapee would most likely turn to then raid them when contact was established but would the department have had time to set up a wiretap the robbery was around noon it was now four that was a few hours he didnt think so more to the point though betty hill the operator was known to listen in as she threw wires into jacks at the polk county switchboard she might be listening and if so who would she call the sheriff she might even call earl himself find out where he is he mouthed to edie jimmy oh my god where are you im at some general store up near mulberry on the public phone its around back aint nobody can see us we done dumped two cars and picked up another one oh jimmy theyll get you you know that honey listen its all over for me i got to face up to it im finished im over youre a free gal i love you but you cant stick to me from now on aint nothing in it for you honey i crossed the line and cant get back over oh jimmy jim but listen here the problem is bub christ that boy didnt do nothing but what i told him hes out in the car crying for his mama i cannot have it said that i got bub killed or sent away jimmy i honey i want you to get mr earl mr earl will know what to do honey hes here oh thank god put him on earl took the phone jimmy earl dont waste your breath telling me how i done messed up lord lord i know what the hell happened earl i wanted a stake i wanted to go to la and be a movie star i didnt want no job in no sawmill living in a cottage off some rich ladys charity earl could only shake his head in dismay now i got a mess said jimmy and i got to fix it up i got to save bub can you git me a deal best just come in and face up to it heres the deal earl i go murder in the first and if the state wants it can fry me and itll probably want in exchange for my plea bub gets maybe accessory to armed robbery manslaughter two at the worst he gets out in a year or so no hard joint neither one of them work farms where nobody going to bother him i cant get you that deal without talking to the sebastian county prosecutor best thing for you to do is to surrender peacefully to the first law enforcement officer you see and then tell them you did all the killing ill call sam vincent down here and no screamed jimmy goddammit mr earl these boys is loaded for bear they got machine guns and shotguns and deer rifles and dogs i killed a cop they got a taste for blood i walk in there hands up and by god i end up on a slab with dimes on my eyes next to some tinhorn deputy smiling for the camera and thinking about how famous hes gonna be poor bub too jimmy was right of course earl knew it too many hotheads with guns too many chances for a slipup a mistake he thought of the fool buddy till with the big tommy gun and the fiftyround drum just itching to cut loose and make himself a state hero the man that got jimmy pye jimmy would die certainly poor bub probably as well as whatever citizens happened to be standing around shit jimmy whatd you do this for mr earl ill surrender to you you can put us both in cuffs please please please just give me a minute or two with edie afterwards one last time with her and promise me youll call sam and help out with bub thats a lot i know but please earl please mr earl i know you got it in you help me clean up my mess how the hell you going to get up here i can make it up there okay we wont move till after dark and i know the back roads like the other side of my hand jimmy no one else can die do you understand do you swear it i swear to you earl i swear to you i got it all figgered out how we can work it ill meet you at ten swear to you earl thought darkly he didnt like it at all jimmy crossed the line you couldnt cut him that slack it went against so many principles be rigid he told himself live by your rules you have rules now live by them but lannie pye jimmys dad begged earl to look out for his boy help his boy that cut to the quick he gave his word on iwo and it wasnt a thing he could walk away from goddamn his own soul theres a cornfield just below waldron maybe ten twelve miles said jimmy its right off which side of boles the fort smith side just beyond boles on the right as youre coming up beyond the mountains earl had lived the past ten years on route i know it theres a cornfield road ill pull in maybe a hundred or so yards no ill pull in first jimmy i want to see you approach and throw the beam on you you git out of the car with your hands up you and bub both you show me your guns then throw em on the ground okay mr earl that sounds square ten ten if you get jumped or chased before you throw your hands up you hear nobody else can die tell edie i love her ill have her waiting in town well take you boys into blue eye ill be with you every step of the way jimmy hung up it sounds like hes trying to do right by what he done wrong he said he looked at edie whod gone over back by the window in the distance they could see buddy till arms folded leaning against his fender chewing a long stalk of grass earl picked up the phone and pushed the button a couple of times operator betty its earl calling from the longacre cottage why earl you do git around what you hearing the coloreds is all excited about that poor little gal theyre blazing away on the line them people really talk a lot theres talk too about jimmy pye and what he done the coloreds dont care about him though they only care about their own just like people everywhere is there any talk about edie and miss connie folks wonder about how theyll take it when jimmy gets his reward pity lots of pity pity and palaver and a little about you earl me earl you are a mighty man but theres an element that dont care for you they think youre too big for your britches ever since president truman hung that ribbon on your neck theres talk that if youd taken a hard hand with jimmy when he was young hed not have turned out as he did theres talkearl do you want to hear this i suppose theres talk itll serve you right and bring you down a peg or two you tried to invent some fairytale life for jimmy and that poor girl who maybe didnt love him as much as you told everybody she did you and miss connie you got together and wrote a fairy tale and never really knew what was going on and what was that asked earl the pyes are trash and always will be its as wrong to mix trash and quality as it is to mix black and white its not meant to be and theres consequences earl sometimes as smart as you are you can be a very thick old boy all right betty thanks he hung up there was no news there nothing he hadnt felt or suspected before what was important was that betty couldnt have gotten through that performance if shed just heard earl talking to jimmy shed been too busy eavesdropping on the others he felt safe at least if the sheriff and his machine gunners showed up when jimmy came in it could be a disaster he went over to edie who simply sat and stared out the window you all right she smiled and put a hand on his wrist yes mr earl i am fine some are saying miss connie and i tried to set up a life for you and jimmy out of something of our own i never thought of that if its the case i apologize i tried to help sometimes helping just makes it worse mr earl you did what you thought was best i swore to lannie pye id help his boy thats what it was i went too far jimmy is no child anymore mr earl hes twentyone he made up his own mind but he does have a gift for selling i bought because i wanted to buy except for the poor folks in the store maybe this is best for all of us down here in polk county now we all have a chance to start over thats the smart way to look at it okay youre okay then ill be moving out i have other places to cover before tonight ill earl yes he was aware shed never called him that it made him slightly uncomfortable earl if i was you id call in your buddies if jimmy gives you even a twitch id have them shoot that boy down like a dog and bub too earl i dont trust him in honesttogod truth i dont trust him a bit edie i have to give the boy a chance and on top of that i dont trust my own people they might shoot no matter what i can bring this thing off you watch earl miss connie would tell you your word to a killer doesnt matter you look out for mr earl first this is the best way he said i know it in my heart we can set this thing as right as it can be set and then we can go find whoever killed that poor little negro girl a weird light shown in edies eyes hed never seen it there before she was gazing at him with such admiration earl miss connie says no man ever carried more of the world around on his shoulders than you do youre going to carry this whole thing around until you set it right where do they grow men like you i never met a one they grow us on trees in the thousands dont you put no account on it youre still young youll meet plenty now you have some great things ahead of you she looked at him as hed never seen her look at him before late in a very long afternoon her face was calm grave lovely in the serene light she was so young hed never let himself look at her before she was someone elses daughter who grew to be someone elses wife the most beautiful girl in the county and so what he was married to a good woman had a son enough responsibilities to choke a cat a goddamned duty that would never ever stop earl she said put it away he told himself put it far far away sometimes the thirst for whiskey was so palpable it ached this was such a night he lay in the bed hearing the warm desert breeze run through the night and the low even breathing of his wife in a room down the hall his daughter slept he dreamed of whiskey in whiskey was the end of pain whiskey blurred the images of boys shot in the guts crying for mama and mama wasnt there only sergeant swagger screaming medic at the top of his lungs while pouring m fire off into the paddy breaks whiskey banished the stench of the villes after the phantoms had laid down napalm the odd blend of burned meat and scorched straw and fried water buffalo shit in whiskey disappeared the emptiness of emotion when the recoil spent itself against ones shoulder and the rifle settled back and the crosshairs reimplanted themselves on a man so far away who was now horribly altered his posture destroyed by death arriving in packages of grains launched at feet per second sometimes they staggered sometimes they instant ragdolled always they went still forever gone too in the whiskey was this one he woke late to a lot of commotion downstairs the sounds almost of a party or meeting he blinked sleep out of his eyes confused a little scared daddy he called daddy outside another car pulled up and then another he was wearing underpants and a davy crockett tshirt which he had got by sending fifty cents and six caps from masons root beer off to chicago it took weeks for it to arrive and he wore it every day and every night he was nine he heard his mother crying downstairs and listened to a mans footsteps on the stairs he heard creaking leather the sag of the floorboards the squeal of the stairway banister all familiar from a thousand times his father came home late as he always did letting the duty day stretch out sometimes for eighteen and twenty hours but there was a heaviness to the tread which he knew was not his fathers he sat up as the man entered and it was some other state policeman the crickets were chirping desperately in the dark just beyond the open windows and outside it was a clear night glittery with starlight youre bob lee is that right said the man in his daddys uniform the flatbrimmed roundtopped hat not quite a cowboys hat and the big gun in the holster not quite a cowboys gun he stood in the doorway just a silhouette the light behind him blazing yes sir he had said bob lee may i come in have to talk mantoman to you bob nodded he knew something was wrong another police car pulled up out front of the house im major benteen youre going to have to be a man now son the man in his daddys uniform told him what you mean son son your daddy was killed in the line of duty this evening hes in heaven now where all the good soldiers and policemen and men who do their duty have to go eventually whats duty bob said i cant explain it i dont even know its what special men like your dad lived by and for said the major its the best thing a man can have its why your daddys a hero its but the man stopped and bob saw that he was crying too now bob shook his head that big officer bawling away in the dark over his fathers death trying so hard to be manly but so destroyed by the bitter futility of it he had no chance that was a whiskey memory you wanted to soak that motherfucker in amber fluid that roasted your tongue as it went down your gullet and sent its radiant message of hope and love to the far precincts of your body and numbed out your mind with the buzz of alcoholic bliss thats what whiskey was for to kill those lost black memories that when they came out from hiding would try and kill you like this one was now trying to kill him bob sat up in the bed he was glad there was no whiskey in the house for if there were he knew hed grasp it and drown himself in it going down so far thered never be an up he could hardly breathe he rose a tall thin strong man graying but still with a gift for silent movement and a face famous for the little that it showed he had slept alone for so long now he wasnt alone in the bed anymore and he looked at her dozing softly under the sheets such a beautiful woman whod have thought it he slipped down the hall and pushed open the dark door into the next room hearing the childs breath he snapped on the light ykn was curled up her little nose fluttering ever so gently she stirred disturbed by the light she looked as if she were made of candy a moist perfect little thing her wide lids enveloping her wide eyes her curled lashes as perfect as the tracing of a doily her tiny little nose cusping her tiny perfect seal of lips she rubbed a hand against an eye shivered in some sort of animal delight pushed some hair off her face and pulled the blanket tighter dreaming no doubt of horses he wondered if he would ever be the mystery to her that his father was to him he hoped not bob turned off the light bent to her and kissed her smooth cheek gently feeling a radiance much stronger than whiskeys and much truer thats worth getting through it all he thought suddenly he felt a bit braver resigned almost steady at least and aware at last of what must be done he walked down the hall pulled a lanyard so that a section of the ceiling pivoted downward with a groan and a section of wooden ladder slid out he climbed into the attic pulled the light switch it was any attic jumbled trunks racks of old clothes sheaves of pictures most of it julies but a small portion of it was his loaded into the trailer for that drive out from blue eye years ago after hed buried his guns he climbed and looked toward his small claim of the space he saw an old seabag full of marine utilities boots the like his dress blues hanging off a rack a leather shooting jacket with its many buckles and straps a few old pieces of luggage and at last what he was looking for it was an old shoe box with a red ribbon tied prettily outside it the label on the box said buster brown size c dark brown oxfords the container for his sunday shoes sometime in the fifties though it was sheathed in dust he could make out handwriting his mothers ornate script daddys things it said he tugged on the old ribbon which easily enough gave up the ghost and popped dust stirred like vapors of lost memory he carefully lifted the lid off and there kneeling in the yellow light in a pair of sweats he began his exploration this is what remained of earl lee swagger usmc arkansas state police killed in the line of duty july first bob saw old brown photographs on stiff slightly wilted papers he picked them up to enter an alien universe that seemed built around a little farm boy with a chubby face that showed but a trace of the bone structure that would eventually yield the face he would recognize as his fathers in this brown world there was a farmhouse a trellis a scrawny old goat in a straw hat a threepiece suit even in summers full blaze a bow tie and starched collar a face chipped out of granite who must have been a father that is bobs grandfather he also wore a circled star on his chest that was a sheriffs badge and a wide belt festooned with cartridges and a holster that swallowed up all but the colt peacemakers curved grip next to him was the grandmother a dour woman in a shapeless dress and a face that looked as if it never had worn a smile he turned it over and in faded ink read the date blue eye ark there were others various arrangements of the same three people sometimes together sometimes alone or in twos none of them had ever gotten fat off the land bob saw a final shot showed earl in his twenties in a marine olivedrab service uniform with that tight tunic collar a glistening sam browne belt diagonally transecting a manly chest and a sergeants three stripes on the shoulder looking proud and ramrodstraight hed joined in at twenty and had made his rank fast turning the picture over bob saw in his grandmothers flowery penmanship the inscription earl home on leave earls hair was slicked back over white sidewalls and he looked dapper as possible next he found the medals there was a nest of them police marksmanship badges his father was a natural extraordinary shot pacific battle star and campaign ribbons the purple heart with four clusters a presidential unit citation for the nd marines another one for the rd marines a distinguished service cross a silver star and of course the big one the medal of honor a chunk of metal in the configuration of a star that hung on a necklace of now faded but once skyblue ribbon he hefted the ornament it had weight and density gravity almost dignity perhaps its gold plating was grimy from years of neglect and he realized that hed never seen the thing itself before his father never had it out or displayed it and his mother must have dumped it in this box sometime after the funeral and sealed the box and herself off from the pain he held it in his hand for a few seconds waiting to feel something it was only a chunk of dirty metal a trinket hed won medals himself and knew the odd distance a man feels from them looking at them and thinking so what they explain so little they have no connection with the reality of what they signify the citation was there too on official department of the navy paper a fancylooking thick piece of paper dated december that had the look of formal ostentation that he despised it could have hung in a dentists office he read it wondering if hed ever read it before or only heard it told by other men his father never spoke a word about the war on february on charliedog ridge two miles inland from beach red platoon sergeant swaggers unit from e co second battalion ninth regiment third marine division came under intense fire from several enemy machinegun positions all his flamethrower operators dead or wounded platoon sergeant swagger led a squad off on a flanking maneuver but only he reached the ridgeline in sufficient condition to continue the attack the others having been killed or wounded wounded himself three times platoon sergeant swagger climbed into the first nest from the rear killing the enemy soldiers with his submachine gun he continued to work his way along the line silencing two other positions in the same fashion by rolling over the parapet and spraying the enemy with gunfire in the third nest his gun jammed and he killed two enemy soldiers with the butt of the weapon advancing on the last position a concrete bunker he realized he was out of ammunition he returned to the previous machinegun nest and removed the enemy weapon and several grenades he blew open the steel door of the emplacement and leaped inside with the light machine gun killing thirteen more enemy soldiers in the sevenminute engagement platoon sergeant swagger killed over forty enemy soldiers while sustaining five wounds himself his actions saved the lives of thirty men in his platoon for conspicuous gallantry in action against the enemy above and beyond the call of duty he is awarded the medal of honor somewhere bob had seen a picture though it appeared not to be here he remembered a yellowed scrap of newsprint almost delicate to the finger in its crumbly dryness and on it the image of his much younger father flatbellied and stoic of face in dress blues as the president of the united states behind bifocals and a folksy missouri face laid the ribbon over his head again it was nothing the ceremony was for other people not for his father who kept his feelings to himself about what hed done and why hed done it at last bob set the medal down he knew enough of war to know that the description of his fathers action was antiseptic to say the least in the nest with the japs working them over with a tommy gun he must have watched them disintegrate under the heavy impact of the s the air was sulfurous and full of lead and smoke mortars exploded everywhere sucking the oxygen from the surface of the planet exhaustion stress dirt and filth grime the gritty volcanic soil of iwo the hundreds of scrapes cuts and abrasions from lowcrawling the utter terror maybe some bloodlust some pleasure in watching the enemys head torn off or limbs blown away fear that the gun would jam all that and much more was left unnoticed by the citation hell of a fight you made daddy he thought next his eye caught on something unusually regular and a pull yielded a thick wad which turned out to be an old tablet of arkansas traffic violation citations an amazement there were at least twenty unused citations with their triplicate carboned forms left flat on the pad but curled back over the spine of it were five or six carbons on tickets already handed out bob saw in a second that they were the tickets his father must have issued that last week and was unable to file with the court before his death he shuffled through them seeing his fathers own handwriting recording a series of meaningless misdemeanors against the arkansas standard traffic code in the second and third weeks of july driving with left taillight disabled was checked on one citation and the drivers name and address and license number and below that under the rubric issuing officer the scrawled semisignature e l swagger a couple of speeding violations on routes and a dwi the small beer of a rural highway patrolmans life he felt his father so powerfully he almost doubled over and then next a notebook evidently earls pen had broken or some such for it was spattered with brownish fluid on the cover and a discoloration had worked under the cardboard and bled through the pages bob peeled them one at a time trying to make sense of it he saw a list of meaningless names inside the cover like jed posey lum posey and pop dwyer he saw a stick figure crudely inscribed and lines radiating off toward landmarks that indicated distances and a variety of other unrelated facts or observations was she moved it said at one place little georgia it said at another cause of death it wondered blunt force or strangulation meeting at church find out what he could make no a sudden sense of profound unease hit bob he turned back to the cover of the notebook and felt the thing burn in his fingertips it occurred to him that the brownish stain that had seeped through to discolor the pages must be blood it was his fathers blood his father had been holding this or had it in his pocket when jimmy pye fired the fatal bullet and the wound had emptied on this document it had the sense of something religious to it something from an ancient saints reliquary like a blessed chard of bone or a fragment of hair or cloth its power overwhelmed him and he put it down feeling somehow as if hed blasphemed it was almost too much he suddenly had a need to put the lid on the box stuff the box back into the slot where it had rested beribboned and sheathed in dust and flee back to the good life hed finally built for himself he had horses to care for a daughter to raise a wife to support in the box was only pain and black memories no go on he told himself go on do it see every last thing next came some news clippings of the event itself the various rags account of the events of july he slipped through them uninterested in details only one caught his attention hero trooper buried it said july the fort smith southwest times record front page also brown and crackly with age he saw himself as a small dour boy standing next to his poor mother surrounded by a sea of uniforms and suits under a spreading elm tree a minister seemed to commandeer the most artention the casket was aligned next to the hole in the ground under the tree where it would go at least daddy had some shade a marine honor guard stood on the right ramrod boys with no hair and severely raked white dress hats bills low over their eyes their gloves white the highnecked dress coats severe as any puritans frock bob glanced at what the picture showed of himself and saw only pudge and softness as if he were out of focus which he was he could barely even remember the event itself though the photo brought something back his mother would not stop crying though by this time he himself had been fully cried out it was hot the speeches seemed to go on forever someone called miss connie was like the dowager empress of the event the mother courage who took over and got everything organized and done he remembered her smell and beauty and how strong shed seemed but she was not in the picture bob put the clipping down passed through what little was left letters of condolence official and otherwise testifying to his fathers greatness from among others the commandant of the united states marine corps two men in the platoon who could write that day only because his actions had saved their lives one on iwo one tarawa testimonials in inflated language from the commanding officer of the arkansas state police and the governor of arkansas and a final crude letter from someone called lucille parker telling his mother what a wonderful white man earl swagger had been the only white man whod listened to her pain over her daughter shirelle and pledged to help what on earth could that mean so many mysteries so many unconnected elements unfinished bits of business the stuff of his fathers life not much to show for fortyfive years on a planet where youd done so much good work and only a shoe box was left to testify to your existence that was it would the boy find such material interesting possibly bob made his mind up that in the morning hed call the boy and arrange to let him borrow the stuff possibly some good would come out of it after all there was a last scrap of paper bob picked it up curious it took some effort to get it figured out it was the last page of what may have been an autopsy or a hearing report in fact lodged under the staple at the left top was the mulch of other pages that had been torn away bob understood that it had been the necessary clinical appallingly unemotional and excessively professional description of the wounds his father had suffered a copy had been sent to his mother and when she discovered its meaningsbob guessed it would have read something like translateral passageway from under left nipple at degree angle to sternum led to severe and catastrophic destruction of left ventricle or some suchshed just been unable to face it and had ripped it up and destroyed it why had this page survived he couldnt guess it couldnt be explained maybe shed gone back and pulled it out of the garbage can and remorsefully tucked it away in the box her own sad decline had just been initiated she would not live much longer herself bent under grief and regret and finally alcoholism so this alone remained bob glanced at it and saw that it was a partial list of exhibits pertaining to the ballistics evidence of the hearing or autopsy or whatever because he knew a great deal of such matters he read onward and saw what state police detectives had recovered at the scene colt super government model serial number with staghorn grips four cartridges left in the magazine in the pistol that was jimmys gun slick flashy colt automatic shooting highvelocity bullets vestpenetrating shockinducing meant only to kill very professional choice fourteen cartridge cases bearing headstamp colt superww the spent casings that jimmy had ejected in the fight meaning hed fired fourteen times hed reloaded once and was halfway through the reloaded mag when his father took him out he was a shooter that boy bob wondered which of the fourteen rounds had been the fatal one whether his father took it early or late he shook his head a fleeting wish came to him that he could reach back through time and deflect that bullet or maybe improve earls aim just a bit on an earlier round who knew how differently it might have turned out but no jimmy fired the last round he killed earl even as earl was killing him smith wesson model special sn with six unfired ww special rounds in the cylinder bubs gun bob guessed unfired hadnt got a shot off colt trooper magnum sn with three loaded cartridges and three empty in the cylinder his fathers gun bob had seen his father clean that big piece of machinery once a week and after every firing session most of his memories of his father in fact were connected with firearms and his father teaching him how to shoot how to hunt how to clean care for and respect the firearm they were the lessons hed never forgotten six cartridge casings bearing headstamp remington his father had reloaded himself a speed reload under heavy fire from a guy with a semiauto and plenty of ammo good work he thought the best kind there is only one label remained on the sheet it bore the depressing title bullets recovered and he knew it meant recovered from bodies the coroners last connection to the physical mechanism of death did he have the courage to read on with a sigh he discovered he did there were three exhibits that is bodies and under each of them was listed the items recovered nothing in it surprised him except that he learned that bub had a bullet in him from jimmys gun probably delivered in the excitement of the action a friendlyfire accident of the kind that was distressingly common in battle at last he read of the bullets taken from his father there were three two misshapen calibration impossible to determine bullets copper clad weighing grains and grains then one misshapen calibration impossible to determine bullet metal clad weight grains bob looked at it not quite sure what he was reading then he read it again and a third time it did not go away grains i thought id find you here julie said he turned startled yeah here i am going back through it bob you ought to help that boy it would help you more than anything youve been angry ever since you should face it im going to do more than face it he said in the gloom of twlight earl drove swiftly down route until he passed beyond board camp and came to his own mailbox turned in and followed the dirt road to his own house he picked up the microphone and called in the news was not good at all the state detectives had not been able to get to the shirelle parker site yet and wouldnt make it until the morning only a oneman shift from the polk county sheriffs department could be assigned to secure the crime area overnight though a coroners assistant had come out to make a preliminary investigation how long was he there earl asked over the radio ten minutes ten minutes earl exploded to the sheriffs dispatcher how the hell could he learn anything in ten minutes come on earl you know we goin to go to niggertown tomorrow when all this about jimmy is settled and sooner or later someone goin to talk to us thats how it works down there them people cant keep no secrets earl thought suppose it was a white person who killed shirelle okay tell them ill be out there first thing in the morning and to keep the site as clean as possible i hate to think of that little girl lying out there all alone another night it dont matter to her none earl earl signed off all sorts of things weighed on his mind he tried to will them away you got to stay sharp he told himself you got lots to do but he wanted more than anything to sleep to end the day and hope that tomorrow would be a better one he reached the house which had once been his fathers low but surprisingly gracious a white place with a porch and green shingles in a grove of elms out back there was a rope swing and a creek the barn held four good riding horses and the fields were earls for two hundred acres all around his son came running off the front porch daddy daddy daddy daddy well howdy there davy crockett hows daddys best boy he said his heart swelling at the sight of the kid running toward him the everpresent coonskin cap clutching his head its tail bobbing on his back damnedest thing earl ever did see but all the kids wore them bob lee was nine and had never given anybody a lick of trouble he was all the son a dad could wish for all boy but a hard worker too and he had something of his fathers natural ways with a firearm for a nineyearold he could fire a lever gun with amazing accuracy and last year had bagged a deer though hed shot it too far back and earl had to track it all the way into the mountains of scott county to finish it earl picked his son up and gave him a swirl up to the sky as if he were a bag of feed swinging him till his little feet swept upward whoooooooooo screamed the boy best hope i hang on to you bob lee i let you go youll end up on the moon the boy laughed as earl set him down mamas up the road a piece he announced mrs fenson felt poorly and mama said shed take over some dinner umh said earl recognizing his wifes behavior in the gesture im just gonna git me a sandwich and an iced tea and be on my way the disappointment was ripe on the boys face you going out daddy you go out every night tomorrow i swear to you ill stay in got me one little thing to do when thats over im going to take a rest come on boy lets see what shes got in the kitchen in they went and in no time earl had slapped some ham on his wifes good bread and opened two root beers he took it all out on the porch and bob went with him they ate in silence earl looked at his watch it was now and he had close to an hours drive up to near waldron and the cornfield he finished the sandwich took a last gulp on the root beer draining it walk me to the cruiser bob lee yes sir said the boy adoring the private time with his father they got to the car earl opened the door ready to climb in and pull away the sun was setting it was the gray hour of perfect stillness and clarity in the world here in eastern polk county the ouachitas changed subtly in character and became lower rounded hills crested with pine and teeming with game like islands rising out of a flat sea earl didnt do much farming but it was nice to have some land to hunt and to shoot on hed made a good life for his family he thought an immense melancholy and regret suddenly flooded him there was a kind of hole in his mind where hed exiled his most recent memories and focused instead on the perfection of the here and now he reached down and grasped his son and gave him a crushing hug you be a good boy now bob lee he said you tell your mama how much i love her i just have this one last little thing to do you understand then maybe well take some time off its been a rough summer time to go fishing you understand yes sir got a surprise for you in a month or so the chicago bears goin come down to little rock and play the new york giants saw an ad in the paper they call it the football classic of the south war memorial stadium september you send off for tickets theyre pretty expensive threeeighty apiece but what the heck figure you me and mommyd go down to little rock have us a nice dinner and see that game howd you like that at night yes sir they rig these big old lights and its bright as day thatd be great the boy said but he had picked up the strangeness in his father daddy you okay i am fine said earl i am he paused perplexed he felt he had to explain something to his son im going to arrest a bad boy he said a boy who made a big mistake but theres two kinds of bad bob lee this boys bad was he just decided to be bad he said i will be bad and he did bad things and now hes got to pay see thats one kind of bad the boy looked at him but you aint ever going to be like that most nobodys ever like that that other kind of bad see thats the kind that a good boy like you or any good boy could fall prey to thats the kind of bad that says i will be good but somehow not meaning to not facing it not thinking about it lying to yourself you just sort of find yourself where its easy to be bad and you dont have the guts or the time or whatever maybe you dont even realize where you are and you just do it and its done then you know what the boys vacant eyes signified that he was lost well anyway someday youll understand all this what you got to do next you got to clean up your mess you got to make it right if its busted you got to fix it you got to face the consequences do you see the boy just looked up at him well so you dont you will i know and youll be a fine man and not make the mistakes your poor stupid old daddy made now i have to go you tell your mama that i love her and ill see yall tonight do you hear yes daddy earl got in the car took one of his swift practiced uturns the maneuver of a man who drove beautifully and with great confidence and pulled away as he drove he saw his son in the rearview mirror standing there in the fading light one arm lifted to say goodbye he put a hand out the window and gave a little waggle of acknowledgment hit the main road and sped off that was the last thing i remember bob said the wave julie asked yep he just put his big old arm out the window and gave a little you know a little wave then the car turned and off he went next time i saw him he was in a casket with a pinkfrosted face and a smile like a department store dummy and all these grownups were saying sad things he paused remembering the wave not the man in the casket it seemed to sum his father up a little masculine salute from an arm thickened with muscle hand big and loose and square three yellow chevrons gleaming in the failing light hat set square on his head in silhouette as he went off to do somethingno one could ever tell bob what it wascalled duty would you let me be please he said are you all right honey im fine i need to be alone a bit is all ill be downstairs if you need me she said and departed softly when she left bob cried hard for the first time in his life since july russ had his lamar pye dream again that night as they usually did it started out benignly he was sitting in a popeyes eating greasy chicken and red beans and lamar walked in big as a house friendly as life itself the fact that he had never seen lamar but only pictures of him freed russs subconscious to invent interesting details for lamar for example tonight lamar was wearing a clown suit and had a bright red pingpong ball for a nose his teeth were bold and shiny he radiated the power and the glory as he saw russ sitting there lamar came over and said are you a spicy kind of guy or a regular kind of guy that was the key question for russ and it was another test and he knew hed fail it bravely he said im a spicy kind of guy lamars mean but shrewd eyes locked on his squinting with intellectual effort he looked russ up and down and then he said the hell you say boy no its true russ argued through a tide of liars phlegm rising in his throat really im spicy been spicy all my life a rhinolike flare of rage blossomed behind lamars clown makeup and the urge to strike viciously displayed itself in the narrowing of his pupils to pinpoints but he controlled himself i say youre regular and i say to hell with it only he said it reglar two syllables russ cowered in lamars force lamar was huge and strong and knowing and decisive unclouded by doubt untainted by regret he was definitely a spicy kind of guy all right he finally allowed well see what kind of guy you are with a magic wave of his hand the clowngod lamar made the popeyes disappear instead the two were deposited on the front lawn of russs family home in lawton oklahoma it was a small rancher on a nice piece of land a wellworn house where russ and his brother had been treated to stable loving childhoods by their parents from the smoke curling out the chimney though it was full summer in the dream russ understood that the family was home lamar willed it and in the next second he had some kind of tacky xray vision as if he were looking into a house onstage through the old invisible fourth wall his brother jeff was in his room lacing up a baseball glove with the intensity that another boy might spend jacking off not jeff jeff just poured his whole heart and soul into the effort trying to get the glove just right limber supple soft but not too soft it was the central issue of his life in the kitchen russ and jeffs mama jen a handsome though somewhat hefty woman in her early fifties slaved over a hot stove mom was always cooking he had a sense of his mother as cook to the world thats how he would think of her always having traded all chances at happiness and freedom and selfexpression to spend her time instead in the kitchen whaling away at this dish or that concocting elaborate dinners never displaying an iota of disappointment or despair rage or resentment she just gave it up for her family downstairs his daddy was doing something to a gun his dad was always doing things to guns he was in his troopers uniform and totally lost in his own world as he usually was just working away there was a young woman with him nude watching him and asking him to hurry up please goddammit she was getting tired of waiting and he kept saying just let me get this bolt oiled up and well be outta here finally russ saw upstairs again and saw himself a grave boy as usual doing nothing but reading by the time he was fifteen he had read everything there was to read twice he read like a maniac soaking it up trying to draw lessons from it he had a freak gift for the written word which when regurgitated crudely became in turn a crude gift for his own writing he had a small fluency a big imagination and enough doubt to sink a ship why did he work so hard in this area to escape oklahoma was there some sense that he was too good for oklahoma for this little life of homey platitudes and smallbeer deceits and easy pleasures he russ he was too good for it he deserved such wonderful things in his life he deserved the east he deserved bright lights fame adoration no littletown blues for him no sir see that aint healthy lamar said you just asittin up there you oughta be out doing things my brothers the jock russ said i had a mind i didnt want to waste it well heres the deal lamar said he drew a chain saw out of nowhere and dramatically pulled the ignition cord and it leaped to churning life filling the air with that high ripping scream the deal is im going in there and im going to kill all them people you go stand by that tree ill deal with your sorry young ass when i get out please dont do it russ said oh and whos to stop me my dad will stop you your dad all that old bastard cares about is fucking that girl and his guns he dont care about you or your mom none no hell stop you youll see hes a hero he aint no hero sonny just you watch and so lamar walked to the house and commenced an atrocity it actually duplicated several such episodes that russ had seen on the silver screen and thus it unfolded according to the rules of the movies lamar kicked down the door the young woman screamed russs dad reached for his gun but this time lamar was too fast for him the saw dove through them each and they fell behind each on a far wall blossomed a blood spatter like a red rose opening to the sun aesthetically perfect showing the devotions of a supremely gifted art director see lamar called back he werent no trouble at all lamar climbed the stairs jen looked at him and said dont hurt my boys please lady im hurting everybody lamar instructed her laconically in the second before he swiped at her with the saw driving her backwards into the refrigerator which had been rigged to collapse as she crashed into the jars and cartons and cans she died in bloody splendor amid a smorgasbord of brilliantly conceived food effects with mustard and ketchup and coke flung every which way by the grinding chain of the saw jeff a hero heard the noise picked up a bat and came running but a bat and heroism are no match for a chain saw no sir lamar got jeff on the stairs and the camera which loves the destruction of the young and tender best of all zeroed in on the poor boys face flecked with his own blood as the life in his eyes shut down into blankness that left russ reading something obtuse and meaningless as the killer stalked him russ had no defense when lamar kicked his way into the room he begged he sniveled he quivered he raised two trembly hands lamar turned away from begging russ weeping for mercy by his bed to the russ who watched from outside should i do his young ass please dont kill him lamar please can you stop me no i cant then you aint worth a turd on a hot day he stepped forward with the chain saw and russ awoke it was really not one of the truly bad ones an essay more in dreamstate illogic and pernicious movie influence than in sheer vomiting violence hed had those too though not so bad lately one night hed awakened screaming and someone thought to call the princeton cops who took him in for drug testing another time hed evidently rolled off the bed in stark fear and badly bruised himself once he cut himself thrashing in the night and awoke in his own blood this one not too terrible survivable at least were they getting easier he didnt know you just couldnt tell when it was going to explode over you and to his knowledge nobody in his family not even his father suffered the same but perhaps he alone had worked out the logic lamar pye was coming to kill them that is the family to punish bud pewtie for his crimes he would kill buds family it was only a twist of fate that the drama played out elsewhere and that only lamar and his minions died but the weight of it settled on russ for some reason the idea that not randomly not accidentally not out of whimsy or malice or the sheer force of the universes irrationality lamar pye had targeted the pewtie clan for extinction it sat upon russ like a fat black cat in the night so do not send to know for whom lamar comes he comes for thee russ blinked he was still in the motel room daylight showed wanly through the cheap curtains he felt hung over but he hadnt been drinking rather it was the caffeine hed had in the diet coke at bob lee swaggers that had kept him awake full of ideas and theories and arguments that he hadnt made until well after four finally he had been permitted to sleep he checked his watch it was close to eleven nothing to do he tried to figure out his next move but there was no next move he thought hed go back to his apartment in oklahoma city and maybe work something out but that idea filled him with boredom his big book was going the way of all flesh that is toward lassitude and indolence and ultimately nothingness russ showered dressed checked his wallet he had less than fifty dollars left it was about a tenhour drive back to oklahoma city through new mexico and across texas and half of oklahoma it filled him with despair and selfloathing he threw his dirty clothes in the suitcase and went out to dump it in his car then he settled up with the motelhis credit card didnt bounce not quite yetand gassed up driving through ajo he pulled into the little cantina where hed had so many lunches he went in took his familiar seat at the bar and without even having to order it the usual plate of excellent barbecue was served with a draft beer russ ate enjoying it that woman sure could cook well he said to the bartender i didnt quite spend a thousand on the barbecue but its pretty damn close you did okay son the bartender said now i take it youre moving on yep gave it my best shot got to the man put it before him and maybe for just a second i saw something in his eyes but no he said no you worked as hard as any of em but hes a tough nut to crack that one that he is well anyway i really enjoyed your barbecue no kidding it was the best ill miss it i but then he noticed how quiet it had become in the bar and that the barkeep was standing almost gapemouthed and goofy he looked left and right and there was only silence and men staring quietly then he looked in the mirror across the bar and at last saw the man standing behind him tall and sunburned with a shock of tawny hair and gray narrowed eyes swagger sat down next to him howdy he said er howdy said russ barbecues pretty good here so they say its great said russ well one of these days ill have to get some you still interested in writing that book yes i am nothing in it about vietnam nothing about that still the deal yes sir you all packed yes i am well then bob said you and mere going to arkansas the corporate headquarters for both redline trucking and bama construction are located in a suite of offices in a flashy modern building on rogers avenue in east fort smith arkansas as befits firms which annually bill over million in fact it was bama construction that on a federal contract built the harry etheridge parkway which runs between fort smith and blue eye seventy miles south in polk county the offices which occupy the top two floors of the superior bank building right across from central mall are everything one might imagine of dominant prosperous regional corporations complete to potted palms soothing walltowall carpeting leather furniture and exposed brick in the public and presentation areas all of it designed and coordinated by one of the finest and most expensive corporate interior design firms in little rock no fort smith firm quite being up to the owners tastes in these offices lawyers and secretaries and engineers labor intensively on bama constructions farreaching plans such as the van buren mall or the planters road residential development meanwhile trucking executives supervise the hundreds of routes and accounts that redline controls as fort smith is ideally located for eastwest commerce given its central location on the huge us route between little rock and tulsa it all hums along perfectly the only oddity is the huge corner office jammed with antiques with two vivid picture windows that yield powerful views of the city from here one can see the old downtown the bridge over the mighty arkansas river and even a little of oklahoma its a beautiful office some say the most beautiful in fort smith it displays on one wall civic awards and family mementos pictures of visiting dignitaries and political figures examples of philanthropy and civic involvement all signifying a solid career and a solider place in the community yet the office is almost always empty rather randall t red bama prefers to spend his time in the back room of nancys flamingo lounge on midland boulevard in north fort smith on an uneasy tribal border where the black district spills into a poor white one where the citys surprisingly large thai population has begun to contest its more lengthily settled vietnamese one where a workingman can get an honest but tough game of pool and a shot and a beer all for under five dollars and a stranger can get a steely look that tells him to get lost fast perhaps such quarters are an unnecessary indulgence to keep his empire runningor at least that part of the empire which the newspapers so regularly chroniclered must make dozens of calls a day to his middle managers for of course he makes all decisions himself it helps that he has a supremely organized mind and a special gift for numbers its said he can add as many as eight threedigit numbers accurately in less than ten seconds which qualifies him not quite as a prodigy but certainly as a man with a flair for integers red arrives at ten parking his gray mercedes s on the street where it will not be molested stolen ticketed or even touched he always drives himself enjoying the time alone on his spin down from his familys complex on cliff drive above fort smith clearing his mind for the days tasks but hes preceded by two extremely professional men in a black chevy caprice who are authorized by the state of arkansas to carry the sigsauer p caliber semiautomatics they wear in shoulder holsters under their jackets they are tough calm and decisive excellent shots each wears kevlar second chance body armor capable of defeating all handgun and most shotgun ammunition they are never far from red red doesnt say hello to nancy because there is no nancy and nobody can remember or cares much if there ever was he makes his way to the back room where he hangs up his expensive suit coat sits at a navysurplus desk and begins to drink black coffee out of styrofoam cups from the bar while a continual stream of supplicants acolytes gofers errand boys emissaries and the summoned go before him for judgment or assignment it is here that he receives reports on his nineteen pawnshops his seven porno stores in the greater fort smith area on his heroin dealerships and his crack franchises mostly located in the black section of town his six brothels and his seven rural gambling cribs located across the river in oklahoma and the jewel of his night empire the choctaw gentlemans club in holden oklahoma five miles west on route where rubes pay five dollars admission and sit there drinking overpriced beer and slipping onedollar bills between the plasticengorged breasts of the strippers who must give fortyfive cents on the dollar to the boss man his enforcers and district captains report in with good news or bad usually good occasionally red must order severe consequences for an infraction not a pleasant task but a necessary one and one from which he has never and will never shrink it is here that he conducts meetings when necessary with armand gilenti the crime boss of little rock and hot springs or with jack deegan who runs kansas city these days and sometimes with carmen st angelo of the new orleans organization and sometimes tex westwood of dallas it is said that red sticks to the old room in the back of the old bar and billiard parlor because that is where his father ray bama did his business and built on a smaller scale the brilliant organization which red inherited upon his fathers death car bomb culprit uncaught and so vigorously expanded upon perhaps perhaps not red in other ways does not seem a man given to sentiment being noted far and wide for shrewdness sagacity persistence and toughness though he indulges his three children from his first marriage and his two from his second grotesquely yet his father is something of a holy relic to him that brilliant tough man who fought his way up from the mud of polk county to the heights of fort smith in a single generation building an empire but more important creating a vision which would sustain the empire red has called him to each of his wives the redneck joe kennedy well you aint no jfk his first wife shot back except when it comes to screwing around never said i was said red just said i wouldnt let my daddy down at fiftyone hes short and powerfully built with a faint spray of freckles stubby fingers deep blue eyes that are said to be able to see through anybodys lies and a bald spot that he vainly tries to minimize by wearing his reddishblond hair crewcut he favors gray suits with pinstripes blue buttondown shirts red ties brooks brothers usually and black italian loafers he wears a gold rolex and never carries less than on him in small bills but other than the watch wears no jewelry he doesnt carry a gun never has he loved his first wife and loves her still even though he divorced her when she got a little too old she was the third runnerup in the miss arkansas contest of he loves his new wife who is thirtyseven and blond and was the authentic runnerup in the miss arkansas contest of and that was back in the days when beauty contestants had real tits and beauty contests were about beauty not about saving the whales and feeling the pain of the homeless and all the other feeble liberal dogoodisms that were ruining america ask red about this one hell tell you all about it its a real sore spot he loves his children he loves his wives he gives his wives and his children and himself anything he wants on this day a sullen man sits before him in the uniform of the polk county sheriffs department as reds eyes hungrily eat up data from the gambling chits before him finally red looks over what he sees is what he was what he escaped from what his father heroically rose against and conquered but red knows it well some would call it white trash dead eyes a narrow ferrety face a lanky still body too much hair the whole radiating both danger and craftiness and best of all stupidity red knew that men with gifts for the larger issues were seldom any good in getting the nittygritty work done so duane he finally said i got reports here both good and bad on you duane peck said nothing but made a small clicking sound tonguing his dentures so that they crackled and snapped it was a nervous habit disgusting but no one had ever had the nerve to straight up tell him about it you do like to gamble dont you duane and lady luck hasnt been holding your hand of late dont suppose she has duane said i see you got paper out in most of the cribs in eastern oklahoma you owe ben kelly twentyone thousand keno duane that your weakness no sir said duane more to any card game duane you got a card imagination duanes narrow eyes squinted as he contemplated this notion failed to get a grip on it and then emptied of emotion as he dispensed with any more thought on the issue i mean said red do the numbers or the faces stick in your mind are the suits very vivid do you sense the deck charging up or closing down a feeling that whats left is in your odds or against them not counting cards thats only for the pros but just good card instincts a feeling most good card players have a gift for that sort of thing they also may have a good head for numbers duane whats plus plus ah duanes eyes narrowed his lips began to move never mind duane now on the plus side i see you did some associates of mine a favor now and then yes sir said duane peck you did some collecting and some enforcing yes sir sometimes duane moonlighted on his debt problem by collecting for ben kelly who ran a gambling crib in the back room of the pindel motel over in talihina oklahoma hmmm thats good you hurt anybody bad i busted some jaws and heads nothing nobody couldnt walk away from a week down the line i had to break one boys leg with a ax handle he got way out of line you kill anybody duanes eyes went blank no sir he said i dont mean since you joined the sheriffs duane and i dont mean headbops on crib debtors no i mean ever no sir said duane now duane one thing you must learn never lie to me ever so i ask you a second time you kill anybody duane mumbled something arco service station red said pensacola june you were just a redneck kid with a drug habit a few quick hitters to raise the cash but that night you popped a boy right duane duane finally looked up i forgot that one he finally said well randy wilkes didnt forget he works in new orleans for some people now you do a job like that you better come to an understanding with your partner you dont it seems sloppy you are sloppy arent you duane six ninetytwo said duane its no duane but close its damn said duane i can do it on paper this isnt an arithmetic test duane youre clean now youre straight nothing with real buzz said duane i do like my bourbon on a saturday night i like it then too duane all right now i got a job for you you interested yes sir said duane who had been wondering why one so lowly as he had been summoned before so powerful a figure a private job just for me thats why youre talking to me duane not ben kelly or anybody in between you and me yes sir duane your twentyone thousand could disappear you play it right sir said duane stirring from his phlegmaticism i will play it right you can count on that duane ill be honest wish i had a better man but you got one thing i need and it makes you valuable to me yes sir not your big dick duane not that finetuned brain of yours no sir your badge duane gulped a little i need an inside boy to keep eye on a little situation that may be developing down in polk i send a stranger down in that little place people will notice i got to have an insider a man with the states authority who can go places and ask questions without attracting attention you game duane yes sir mr bama you just say what it is it could get dicey said red i might have you get your fingers dirty for me i have to have your ultimate loyalty if im to give you mine yes sir said duane you understand im a fair man if you end up doing joint time itll be good joint time you dont have to be any big niggers fuck boy youll be protected fair enough duane could do prison he knew for a shot at a place with the man just about anything was possible yes sir all right duane you listen up many years ago there was a tragedy in polk county a heroic police sergeant shot it out with two very bad boys killed them both they killed him too mean anything to you no sir not a history buff eh duane duanes face remained stolid history buff as a concept was unrecognizable anyhow i now have it on good authority a young oklahoma journalist has decided to write a book about this event you know duane true crime that sort of thing duane nodded dully ahthis is something that must be looked at should i whack him duane wanted to know interesting question key question and duane with his primitives craftiness got to the heart of it the boy could be dealt with harshly killed destroyed and things left as they lay but that very act by the law of unintended consequences could bring catastrophe itself an investigation the asking of questions that had so long gone unasked no duane but lets not rule it out lets leave it at this you are to keep me informed on whats going on who he sees what he asks them what he finds out this may involve documents which documents you may have to do very little except arrange for certain documents to disappear it may involve more dramatic countermeasures and if so manpower wont be a problem but for reasons you neednt know and duane i suspect you wouldnt understand its important that this boy learn very little and that his book go unwritten do you understand yes sir red looked at poor duane he felt like a general sending a boy scout against the german army he had much better people he had access to excia operatives exgreen berets longtime underworld troubleshooters extremely competent aggressive experienced professionals but all were outsiders and they wouldnt know a damned thing about a dense little universe like blue eyes and theyd stand out hugely duane the most brutal and sociopathic of vernon tells deputies was also the most corrupt he would attract no attention and much respect so duane it had to be duane carefully controlled and directed duane in the game of his life and duane capable if handled correctly of anything duane ive got here a list of people this boy may consult and offices hes likely to see youll monitor them also here is an phone number you can call it free from any phone in america but i will get you a secure cellular with that number preset so all you have to do is hit one button i want a detailed report every day then you will get further instructions from me do you understand yes sir said duane but i heard they can git taps on them cellulars easy the feds do it all the time good point red was impressed no this ones secure at each end cant be intercepted without a preset descrambler what they can do is subpoena the records so they can find out who was talking to who but i dont think the cellular company would cooperate with them at least for years and years why asked duane because i own it said red now duane be delicate no bullyboy stuff you have some charm im told you can be a backslapper a laugher a regular guy those are the colors i want you showing in this first phase yes sir now you must go im behind schedule said red bama looking at his rolex and i want to get to my sons soccer game in the latter half of the nineteenth century it was not uncommon for armed men to ride into fort smith arkansas the bawdy bustling city nestled on the confluence of the arkansas and poteau rivers founded in it boasted a population of thirty thousand by perched as it was at the head of the long valley between ozark and the ouachita mountains and perched again on the border between arkansas and what in those days was called indian territory and is now known as oklahoma in those days the city was nicknamed hell on the border fort smith was the gateway to the savage and untamed west in those days civilization tried mightily to enforce its will upon the lawless and the enforcers were federal deputies to the hanging judge isaiah j parker between and the judge sent his men into indian territory to carry out the law they were of a type lean sliteyed exquisitely practical without much in the way of larger views all could shoot all would shoot for two decades fort smith was the gunfight capital of the world sending its men out to bring back the desperados and outlaws who roamed indian territory of the marshals were slain in the line of duty of the men they brought back alive were hanged by the judge no one knows how many outlaws perished in the territory at the hands of the deputies in those days such facts werent worth recording now of course all that has changed there are no gunslingers no bawdy houses no rigid judges instead arkansass second largest city is a bit shopworn its downtown once the most sophisticated urban thoroughfare west of the mississippi and east of denver fallen on hard and empty times with the action having moved out to the suburbs where the central mall and the walmarts are its skyline is dominated by two large grain elevators city fathers have tried gamely to reclaim or reevoke the glories of the past and the old fort parkers courthouse a brothel called miss lauras and many fine homes in the stately belle grove district of victorian houses have been restored but they do little to disguise the fact that history has moved elsewhere now its paradewidened garrison street a reminder of the days when it was an army post sited to keep the cherokee and the osage from tribal war has the look of a beautiful mouth that has lost too many teeth to gingivitis the most prominent downtown landmark is in fact the holiday inn on rogers avenue a mock hyatt with a ninestory atrium and a disco that blows loud bad rock into the night it is partially owned by the bama group so the men who come to fort smith from indian territory these days are unlikely to be federal marshals or gunfighters but still some come on missions and some are sliteyed hard and practical one was bob lee swagger accompanied by his new young partner russ pewtie driving east on us in bobs green pickup truck they reached the city near twilight the lights were coming on as they approached it through the rolling land of sequoyah county oklahoma though they couldnt see the arkansas river off to their right broad and flat but invisible behind a train of trees see russ was saying the folder of old articles from on his lap it just shows how crappy the newspapers were back then were much better now he insisted though bob only grunted noncommittally these stories he argued they just dont tell you enough no reporter ever went to the sites they just took the police handout and reprinted it jesus i can think of a hundred questions im going to have to figure out how to answer how do jimmy and bub get all the way from fort smith down to blue eye through the largest manhunt in arkansas history how do they just run into your father is it coincidence yet theres no speculation here on these issues at all also the bigger question why why did jimmy pye on his first morning out after ninety days in jail go off on this thing and why did poor bub who had no criminal record why did he go along with him and this bit here stopping at a drivein and eating a burger and flirting with the waitress what was that all about it sounds like someone who wants the world to think hes cool also why say you do talk a mite dont you said bob well it aint like i havent thought about this you know all right said russ one of my least lovely characteristics i am a talker i cant shut up i dont feel things i yap about them and youre the original wyatt earp and youre stuck with me son i aint no wyatt earp im just a beatup old marine trying to stay on the goddamn wagon russ said nothing in the fading light swaggers face looked as if it were carved out of flint his eyes hardly showed a thing he hadnt said a word in hours and yet he drove with the perfect adroit grace of a race driver he just swung the truck in and out of traffic smooth and light as could be hardly moving himself he was the stillest man russ had ever seen no man seemed to care less what the world thought of him ive worked out a plan said russ i want to approach this coherently and methodically i know where well begin and the plan said bob is that we go grocery shopping it was full night when they got there but the store was still open if once it had been the flagship of a national chain that identity was long since faded though if you looked in the neon you could make out the silhouettes of the letters when they removed the iga from the big sign it just said smittys handpainted on plywood nailed halfway up the big struts of the old sign but it was still at midland boulevard brown light sustaining a cloud of insects beamed down from the pylons installed as a crime deterrent the store looked ratty even threadbare and through the broad windows russ could see a few shoppers rushing among junky sparse shelves it occurred to him that the neighborhood had changed in forty years everybody he saw in the store everybody going in and out was black or asian or hispanic so bob said youre a writer you figure things out you tell me why here huh said russ begin with a beginning that day it starts here at this grocery store at about eleven in the morning now you tell me why me yep you ah maybe they just fell into it they were russ theyd stolen a car and somehow come up with two guns and ammunition they were fixing to rob something now if they went to all that trouble you think theyd just walk into it first place they saw the jail is downtown blue eyes the other way south out of town whyd they come north to this place ahh russ had no answer it shocked him though clearly bob had mastered the material at a much deeper level than hed expected surprising from a man who seemed as far from formal intellectuality as he could imagine look at it as a military problem what is it about this place that recommends it for an operation russ looked around nervously it was on a long straight stretch of road a main drag into and out of town from the north but now looking grim three or four miles removed from downtown proper there wasnt much to be seen long straight road leading off in both ways trees a commercial strip full of bars and car dealerships and decaying retail outlets now and then cars moved up and down the block just by them but there wasnt much i dont see a thing he admitted or consider this way bob said there were two other big grocery stores in fort smith in peerson brothers on south thirtyfirst street and hillcrest food market on courtland in hillcrest do you want to drive there and see whats different about them er said russ then he asked do you see something i didnt go to no college or anything said bob what would i know but you see something i see a little thing what is it bob looked up and down the road now im no armed robber but if i was an armed robber what id be most afraid of is that while im in robbing and before anybody even got an alarm out a cop might come along russ nodded it seemed logical now whats different about this block ahhhh he trailed off in acknowledgment of his stupidity its long if you look at the map youll see that it goes for an unusual length look no side streets and there aint a stoplight in either direction for more than a bit russ looked indeed far down in each direction a stoplight glowed one red one green now if you looked each way and you knew no cop was in sight youd have about a clear minute or so to git in and out and youd be guaranteed no cop could sneak up on you in fact a cop did come but the boys were out and old goddamn jimmy pye had plenty of time to set up a nice clear shot that cop didnt have a chance wow said russ surprised then he added jimmy was smart he wasnt just improvising hed worked it out it figures his son was very smart lamar was very very clever when he set up his jobs and he always knew exactly what to do thats something he got from his old man yeah he was a regular genius said bob but how could he have scouted it out if he was in jail for three months uhhh russ let some air out of his lungs but no words formed in his brain now lets consider something else the guns all the newspapers say bub brought the guns they was planning a job bub got the guns together had plenty of ammo they went right into action right but jimmys was a colt super not a common gun a kind of special gun very few of em made id love to find out where that gun come from the super never really caught on it was invented by colt and winchester in to be a law enforcement round to get through car doors and bulletproof vests but the mag come along a few years later and did everything it did better so the super just sort of languished it wasnt your street gun the kind a punk kid like bub would come up with its not a hunting gun it was never accurate enough to be a target round its not a nineteenthcentury cartridge a or a say that could have been lying around a farm for sixty years no it didnt have its day until the eighties when the ipsc boys begun loading it hot to make major but in let me tell you it wasnt something youd just find youd have to ask for it a professionals gun real good velocity nine shots in the mag smooth shooting if you were a cop or an armed robber its just the ticket howd jimmy know that he a gun buff he into guns he a hunter an nra member a subscriber to guns magazine howd he end up with just the right gun for that kind of work ah russ flubbed and howd bub get it stole it i guess said russ guess is right but no one ever reported it stolen not sos id know whats that tell us ah said russ not quite knowing what it told him it tells us maybe someones putting this thing together who knows a little bit about what hes doing russ said like i say jimmy was smart like his boy lamar not that smart was all that bob said where is this going whats this guy up to russ wondered the next morning they took the new harry etheridge parkway down toward bobs hometown it was a strange experience the road was not yet built when he left blue eye seemingly forever three years ago now it seemed so permanent he could not imagine that it hadnt been there forever four wide lanes of white cement gleaming in the sun the road however was practically deserted who went from blue eye to fort smith and back again as a recreation area blue eye had yet to be developed it was strange almost dislocating hed walked these hills and mountains daily for the seven years hed lived alone on a mountain in a trailer with the dog mike just forgetting the world existed he knew them a dozen different ways all their trails and switchbacks their enfilades and shortcuts the subtle secrets of terrain that no map could yield yet penetrated from this angle they gave up visions before unseeable as the highway almost seemed to rearrange the mountains themselves in new and unusual ways it troubled him announcing the mistake of going back thinking that things have stayed the same for they always change and must be relearned again a part of him hated the damn road what the hell was the point anyhow they say boss harry etheridge never forgot he came from polk county and he wanted to pay back his home folks give them some shot into the twentieth century they say that his son hollis when he was in the senate before he began his presidential quest wanted a monument to his father they say that all the politicians and businessmen wanted a free feed at the expense of the us government which is why so many people called it the porkway and not the parkway but it was meant as a monument to a fathers love of his home and a sons love for his father this etheridge russ asked is this the same guy thats running for president the guy thats finishing third in all the primaries same family bob said the father was the big congressman the son was a twoterm senator handsomest man that ever lived he thinks he can be the president hell need more than pretty looks said russ umm grunted bob who had no opinions on politics or particularly on hollis etheridge who was only an arkansas fellow by political convenience hed been raised in washington been to harvard and harvard law school and only came back during symbolic trips with his father when he was a youngster in arkansas he was a tribute to name recognition his two terms in the senate were marked by obedience to the rules blandness partyline votes rumors of a flamboyant adultery habit and if you saw his wife youd know why and a great willingness to siphon funds back to the statewide political machine that had put him in office whatever the road he built got bob and russ to their destination in less than an hour where by the old twisty route it was a closetothreehour trip thats a hell of a road said russ we dont have anything in oklahoma like that too bad it doesnt go anywhere the end of the highway yielded a futuristic ramp that swirled in streamlined hurry to earthbut it was the earth of beatup old blue eye depositing them quickly enough in the regulation strip of fastfood joints mcdonalds and burger king but also some more obscure regional varieties bob noted there was a new place called sonic a classic fifties drivein that boasted pennants snapping in the breeze clearly a hot dog joint but it didnt look like it was doing too well otherwise the walmart had moved across the street and become a walmart super saver whatever the hell that was and it looked like some kind of flat spaceship landed in the middle of a parking lot a few blocks on they came to the same scabby onestory town hall and across the square the razed remains of the old courthouse which had burned in and had simply been flattened and cemented over until someone figured out what to do with the property some confederate hero stood covered in pigeon shit and graffiti in the center of the square saluting the empty space where the courthouse had been bob couldnt remember the rebs name if he ever knew off the main drag the same grubby collection of stores general merchandising mens and womens clothing stores the life sucked out of them by mr sams walmart a beauty parlor a sporting goods store a languishing tax accountants office and to the left the professional office building where two doctors two dentists and a chiropractor had an office as did one old lawyer well start here bob said good to see this old dog again hope he can still hunt is this the great sam russ asked yes it is they say hes the smartest man in the county for close to thirty years sam vincent was the county prosecutor in those days they called him electrifying sam because he sent twentythree men to the chair he knew my daddy i think he was assistant states attorney for polk in well see what he has to say you let me do the talking he must be in his eighties hes eightysix now i think are you sure hes even here he could be in a rest home or something oh no sam hasnt missed a day since he came back from the war in hell die here happier than most they parked and got out bob bent and reached behind the pickups seat and removed a cardboard box then he led russ up a dark stairway between wallys mens store and miladys beauty salon at its top they found an antiseptic green hallway that reminded russ of some kind of privateeye movie from the forties it should have been in black and white the lettering on the opaque glass in one of the doorways read sam vinc ntatto ney a l w bob knocked and entered there was an anteroom but no secretary dust lay everywhere on a table between two shabby chairs for waiting clients lay two time magazines from the month of june cher was on one of the covers who the hell is that a voice boomed out of the murk of the inner office sam its bob lee swagger who the hell are you they stepped into the darkness and dank fumes and only gradually did the shape of the speaker emerge when russ got his eyes focused he saw a man who looked as if he were built out of feed bags piled on a fence post everything about him signaled the collapse of the ancient the lines in his baggy face ran downward pulled inexorably by gravity and his old gray suit had lost all shape and shine his teeth were yellowed and his eyes lost behind cokebottle lenses he was crusty and unkempt his rancid old fingers blackened from long years of loading and unloading both pipes and guns a yellowed deers head hung above him and next to it some kind of star on a ribbon and a couple of diplomas so dusty russ couldnt read the school names he squinted narrowly who the hell are you mister what business you got here sam its bob bob lee swagger earls boy earl no earl aint here been dead for forty years some whitetrash peckerwoods killed him worst damn day this countys ever seen no earl aint here jesus whispered russ hes lost it sonny said sam i aint lost a thing i cant find soon enough to whip your scrawny ass go on get out of here get out of here bob just looked at him sam i get out of here who the hell do you think you are bob lee swagger sam i am bob lee swagger the old man narrowed his eyes again and scrutinized bob up and down by god he finally said bob lee swagger bob goddamn son its great to see you he came around the desk and gave bob a mighty hug his face lit and animated with genuine delight so there you are big as life you on vacation son you bring that wife of yours and that little baby gal it was a little awkward the sudden return to clarity of the old man but bob pretended he hadnt noticed while russ just looked at his feet she aint so little anymore sam bob said nickis big as they come no i left em home this is sort of a business trip who the hell is this demanded sam looking over at russ you pick up a longlost son he aint my son bob said hes someone elses my names russ pewtie said russ putting out a hand which the old buzzard seized like carrion and crushed christ he had a grip for a geezer bob said heres the business part this young man is a journalist oh lord said sam the last time anybody wrote about you i sued em for you and we made thirtyfive thousand he says he isnt going to write about me if you dont have that on paper you better get it there fast so that when his book is published we can take him to the woodshed its not about mr swagger said russ its about his father its about july oh christ said sam that was the longest goddamn day i ever lived through and i include june in that reckoning it was a terrible day said russ leaving out the personal connection he tried to explain his book but bob had heard it and sam appeared not to care much so anyway he concluded aware he had not impressed anyone and getting a headache from the plummy odor of the tobacco thats why were here well goddamn said sam exhaling a burst of smoke that billowed and furled in the room probably a day doesnt go by i dont wonder why all that had to happen lots of good people all messed up your own mothers decline begun that day i believe i believe it did also said bob and poor edie white edie white pye i always fergit she married that piece of trash her decline begun then too nine months later she gives birth and in a year she is dead whatever happened to jimmy pyes son i wonder he continued in his fathers footsteps russ said they were two of a kind that i dont doubt so what is it you want from me well sir russ said i hope i can recreate what happened that day in a sort of dramatic narrative but as you know there was a fire in when the old courthouse burned thats where all the records were kept i dont have a thing i dont believe maybe a scrap or two well did the papers have it right russ asked fiddling with a small tape recorder sam eyed the little machine warily bob this is under your sayso youre letting this boy ask questions because you want the answers too he says it could be an important book well ive read enough books not to give a hunk of spit and a quart of whittlers shavings for any of em but go ahead young fellow you ask em and if i dont fall asleep ill answer em thank you russ said i wanted to know did the newspapers have it right their accounts wasnt much to get wrong said sam in my business you get to a lot of crime scenes oh ive seen death in bathrooms and kitchens and basements and in swimming pools and outhouses even and sometimes theres a mystery to it but most often not mysteries are for books in life you look at the bodies and the cartridge cases and the blood trails or you look at the knife and the spatter pattern and the fingerprints and they wont lie theyll tell you all you need to know or at least the whodunit part in this case it was pretty openandshut whydunit why it happened that no one ever can truly know is there some account somewhere of the movements of the day i mean how and when jim and bub got down here how earl ran into them in that cornfield no sir as i say the event explained itself no other information was really important was there any kind of legal resolution in the case of unlawful homicides in which there are no survivors the state of arkansas deeds all power to the coroners office to hold an inquest i represented the state and all agreed with the finding the death of earl swagger was murder in the first degree the deaths of jimmy pye and bub pye were justifiable homicide by a sworn law enforcement officer in the course of his legal duties so it went into the books is that document worth chasing down for your purposes probably not though i bet i have a copy of it at home it contained a diagram of the bodies locations a list of the recovered exhibits testimony of the first officers on the scene thats all but ill find it for you that would be very helpful as i break this down id like to try and acquire material in four other areas russ said consulting his notes and trying to sound important witnesses maybe talk to the first people on scene then relatives of all concerned that is jimmy and bub next is secondary accounts news media coverage but maybe there were other accounts in truecrime magazines of course we ought to walk the site too dont you think mr swagger hah said sam walk the site i believe the famous harry etheridge memorial porkway buried it under a ton or so of concrete in memory to the greatest man polk county ever produced son youre looking for a past that aint hardly there no more theres no pyes left in polk county i heard that jimmys father lannie had a brother in oklahoma anadarko said russ he was murdered in by parties unknown miss connie longacre knew edie the best but she left town after edie died and the child went to some pye kin she tried to get that baby herself but they said she was too old nineteen fiftysix i think was there an autopsy bob asked there was said sam state law in the case of unlawful deaths paperwork all gone however in that courthouse fire bob nodded chewing that one over a long and terrible day said sam it has always seemed to me a tragedy of the republic that it can no longer produce men the caliber of earl swagger ive said this to you many a time bob lee he was a quietly great man he did his duty said bob more than some fortunately polk county has never had such a day since four dead it marked the community for many years that followed in some places the pain even yet hasnt excuse me said russ you mean three dead or are you counting the victims in fort smith then it would be seven dead just a little young man where did you go to college ah princeton sir did you graduate er no i uh left after two years but i may return well no matter anyhows princeton well if you want to climb up and blow the dust off that picture framehe gestured to the wallyoud see old sam vincent the country rube lawyer from hicksville arkansas he went to princeton university too and if you blow the dust off the other frame youd see he went to yale law school and though hes old hes not as dim as you seem to think at least on good days and if he says four he goddamnyoursoul means four russ was stilled im sorry he finally said i meant no disrespect but who was the fourth one earls last case a poor girl named shirelle parker a nigra child fifteen years old she was raped and beaten to death out in the ouachitas and it was earl who found her that very morning and made the initial reports i felt it was his legacy and i pursued it with a special attention to duty fortunately it was openandshut too in that one there was some justice i think i remember said bob some negro boy wasnt he he was indeed electrocuted i watched him die up at the state penitentiary at tucker in reggie gerard fuller it was a terrible tragedy you going to put that in your book bob asked i dont know it is very strange isnt it earl spent the morning out there possibly he was still thinking of that case when he ran into jimmy and bub and thats how they got a jump on him it was openandshut like a door the poor girl had ripped his monogrammed shirt pocket as he had his evil fun with her we checked among the colored folk for the proper initials and when we found one that matched we raided im happy to say that even in those benighted days i arranged for the proper warrants to be issued here in polk county we run it by the goddamned rules we found the shirt stuffed under his bed the pocket missing it was smeared with her blood by type she was ab positive he was a positive the boy made a mistake he got carried away he couldnt stop himself she died he died both families devastated i dont hold with the theory nigras cant feel pain as white people do the parkers and the fullers felt plenty of pain as much as ive ever seen russ shook his head which now profoundly ached he wanted to get away this was like something out of faulkner or penn warren blasphemed southern ground soaked in blood a generation old white trash and black white innocence and black all commingled in a very small area on the same day sam weve tired you i may have some things i want you to do youll take my money i suppose bob was saying of course i will said sam heres a box he said handing over the cardboard container you have an office safe i guess im so old i may have forgotten the combination well can you keep this stuff here its my fathers effects for some reason i thought it might come in handy i dont want to be carrying it about sam took the package and they all rose tomorrow bob said i think we may go see where it happened sam could you come you were there oh i suppose in the meantime youll look for that document and any others i will this afternoon i think well go to the library see what the old papers said fair enough said russ sam shook bobs hand and ignored russ leaving the younger man to face the fact that nobody gave a damn he thought he could live with it the two went out down the dark stairs and stepped out into bright daylight he seemed a little daffy there at the beginning said russ i hope hes up to this thing what did he call them nigras colored folk god what klan klavern did he come from that old man is as tough as they come not only did he keep my bacon out of the fire a few years back he was the first prosecutor in arkansas to try a white man for killing a black man back in when it wasnt the easiest thing in the world he may say nigra where you say african american to show everybody how wonderful you are but he risked his goddamned life they shot up his house scared his kids and voted him out of office but he stuck to it because he knew it was right so dont you go disrespecting him hes solid as brass okay said russ if you say so then they saw a big deputy sheriff looking into bobs cab window whats this all about russ said oh just a smalltown cop who noticed an outofstate plate he walked over to the cop howdy there he said the cop turned flashing pale eyes on bob then those same eyes hungered over to russ and ate him up he was a lanky tan man with a thick mat of hair that was maybe a bit too fussed over hipless and lean and longfaced with a glock at a sporty angle on his belt he looked mean as a horse whip this your truck son asked the cop it is uh deputy peck bob replied reading the name off the name tag is there some kind of problem well sir just checking up is all we got a pretty nice little town here and i like to keep my eyes open i grew up in this town said bob my daddys buried in this town bob lee swagger said peck goddamn yes thats right i remember yes all thats finished now you want to run my tag and name you go ahead i come up clean youll see that was all a big mistake you back on vacation mr swagger oh you might say got a young friend here with me its just a sort of a sentimental trip looking at my old haunts and the places i went with my father well sir you got any trouble or need any help you come see me duane pecks the name ill remember that deputy peck peck drew back let them pass but russ had an odd feeling of being sized up read up one side and down the other he didnt like it did that guy seem a little strange he asked ive been around cops all my life and that guy couldnt keep his eyes off us you think so said bob seemed like a pretty nice feller to me it was opening night a road company cats fresh from little rock and due in tulsa in a week had booked three days in fort smith five performances only good seating was available on subsequent nights but not tonight it was sro and the civic center seethed with the towns most raffish and selfassured menthe rich boys cluband their families the manufacturing poultry and corn elite of western arkansas and eastern oklahoma red bama sat with his slim beautiful second wife miss arkansas runnerup his two new children and nick the youngest of his children from his first marriage he waved chatted took homage calls and genuflections from others as the excitement built and curtain time approached then he saw his first wife still beautiful but not so young and not so slim anymore sitting with his only daughter on the other aisle honey he said to beth theres susie im going by to say hi go on baby said beth smiling showing her perfect teeth before she was the miss arkansas runnerup she had been the miss sebastian county you boys and girls you dont give your mama no hard time now he warned in his humorous trashy tyrantfather voice he rose said hello to jerry flood regional vicepresident of hoffmanprieur associates passed between nick conway of harrisray furniture bill donnelly who ran the shelter insurance companies and finally made it over to susie hi doll he said leaning to give her a kiss she wore a diamond necklace that had cost him in jeez dont let beth see that shell want the same damn thing how are you baby he added to his snooty oldest child amy who attended smith and taught tennis at the club during the summer hi babe susie said that gal of yours just gets prettier every time i see her she is a peach i agree but she aint half so much fun in the sack as you were daddy dont be so gross said amy making a face of disapproval amy when you going to come down

blazer plant wed get that job too honey thats the best news and everything else its going its fine sweetie oh its just he felt something like a sting at his hip jumped a tiny bit then recognized it as his beepers vibrator but it wasnt the office beeper it was the new one it was the blue eye number red just got a message no big deal he said taking the little cellular out of his pocket ill call in a sec amy honey havent you had that rolex three whole weeks its gotten boring hasnt it why dont you let daddy buy you a new one daddy you suck red laughed goodnaturedly tormenting his children was one of his deepest delights amy knitted her fierce bright little face up into something like a fist and if it had been possible she would have smacked him with it a wave of deep and uncompromising love poured over and through him the way a man feels about his favorite daughter who goes her own way takes nothing and makes good on everything the watch was presented to her not by red at all but by maryvale prep for graduating with the highest accum in its history the lights began to dim okay got to get back to family number two red said cheerily to susie youll bring nick home tonight he can stay with us if you want no thats fine hes got practice early i know you wont get him there well take him for ice cream after and bring him by great honey see you he said as the overture came up hot and pounding but red didnt return directly he walked back to the rear of the house paying no attention as the curtain opened to tumultuous applause revealing what looked like a back alley populated by sleek sinuous feline shapes that one after another began to shimmer to life red dialed his number and listened its duane peck here the voice came telling him what he already knew and impressing him with nothing anyhows uh this kid is in town and i got him nailed and ill stay with him first stop old sam vincent is that a problem should i take care of that let me know also uh someone was singing and we all say oh well i never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mr mistoffelees ah he aint alone tall guy lanky looks you up and down real fine i thought it might be yeah it was the son the guy in vietnam called him bob the nailer hes along with the kid dont know why but hes here too bob lee swagger earls boy no emotion showed on reds face he just cleared the call and standing there in the back of the house dialed another one billy red here hey red whats on your listen here got me a situation you put me together a team very tough guys experienced qualified on full automatic professionals i dont want to use my boys got that red what shut up billy and listen i want no less than ten i want good weapons good team discipline i want em all to have felony records preferably as

working on it right now good work billy red said then returned to his seat for the rest of cats it took three hours not at all helped by the fact that sams old eyes werent as good as they once were and that he had to stop twice to go to the bathroom then he got irritable and hungry and they bought him some pancakes at the waldron exit dennys but there were no more episodes of strangeness where sam forgot who they were or who he was then once sam said here here i think its here it cant be here russ the navigator exclaimed we just passed and the papers say it was south of were heading north toward fort smith we must have gone too far goddammit boy dont you tell me where the hell we are i traveled all this on horseback in the thirties i hunted it for fifty years and ive been over it a thousand times tell him bob its the new road said bob i think its throwing us off for old with its curves and switchbacks slalomed between the massive cement buttresses that supported the straight bright line that was the boss harry etheridge memorial parkway sometimes the huge new road would be to the left of them sometimes to the right of them and sometimes above their heads there would be times too when it disappeared altogether behind a hill or a screen of uncut forest but it was always there somehow mocking them a symbol of how futile their quest seemed to recover a past that had been destroyed by the coming of the future but at last the two points of their peculiar compass jibed to form some sort of imaginary azimuth to where they wanted to go sams memory and bobs to the corrected version of the arkansas gazette of july they had just passed an odd little place set by the side of the road called bettys formal wear in a ramshackle trailer a few miles out of a town called boles it was sam who shouted here goddammit here bob pulled off the side of the road a little ways ahead an exxon station raised its corporate symbol a hundred feet in the air so it could be seen from the parkway the inescapable parkway off to the right the roadway was thirty feet up a mighty marvel of engineering and even where they were they could hear the throb as the occasional car or truck whizzed along it arent we looking for corn russ asked i thought it was a cornfield aint been no corn or cotton in these parts for two decades said sam all the lands in pasturage for cattle or hay fields no cultivation no more they were parked next to a gte relay station a concrete box behind a cyclone fence back there said bob yeah someone had planted a screen of pines in the sixties and they now towered about thirty feet tall as if to block the ground from public scrutiny bob could see the flat grassy field through the pines however shot with rogue sprigs of green as small bushes fought against the matted grass for survival yeah said sam corn it was all corn then couldnt hardly see nothing i was the fifth or sixth car out here but it was getting busier by the moment bob closed his eyes for just a second and he imagined the site after dark lit by the revolving police bubbles punctuated by the crackle of radios the urgent but futile shouts of the medics it reminded him somehow of vietnam first tour he was a young buck sergeant rd marine division the aftermath of some forgotten nighttime firefight all the people running and screaming the flares wobbling and flickering in the night the way the flashing lights would have ten years earlier in you okay bob hes fine snapped sam his father died here what do you think hes going to do jump for joy russ seemed stricken i only meant forget it junior it dont mean a thing sam opened a flask took a tot believe a man named obrian owned it but he tenanted it out to some whitetrash families over there where that goddamned highway is that was the crest of the ridge woodscovered then took a deer there in and one of the white hags without teeth came out and gave me hell shooting so close to her cabin where her damn kids were playing she was right said bob yes goddammit i believe she was buck fever i had to shoot silliest damned thing i ever didthat is until today where were they the cars were back through there sam said lifting a blackened claw and pointing i believe you can see traces of the little road that ran between the cornfields about a hundred yards in your daddys cruiser was parked slantwise of the road jimmys twenty yards farther down the bodies were where they were in the diagrams said russ yes they were believe i answered that one yesterday no decent lawyer ever asks the same question twice he remembers the question he asked and the answer i couldnt remember all right said bob i want to go back there look at the land believe ill rusticate here sam said you boys go on ahead sing out if you get lost or need me to haul you out of the mud and watch out for snakes mac jimson killed a big rattler in the road the night your daddy was killed scared the hell out of us shot it in the head had to just crossing the road never saw no snake act like that before a rattler said bob big goddamn timber rattler strangest goddamned thing all the cops around the rattler skedaddles across the road mac had to shoot it i hate snakes said russ hell boy said sam its just a lizard without legs bob and russ left the old man cut through the trees and headed across the overgrown weedy ground it was field now no corn anywhere junk land that crouched in the shadow of the highway bob made it to the trace of road not road so much but simply an opening where the vegetation hadnt grown so high because it had gotten a late start the trace went back toward the big highway then began to curve around bob got about a hundred yards back here asked russ bob took a deep breath i do believe ask the old man sam here screamed russ bob watched the old man who studied them then nodded up and down here said russ bob had never been here before so odd he stayed in blue eye eight more years and hed never come out here and stood at the spot then he went away to the marines and then came back and went up in the mountains and never once either before or after had he been to this spot never laid any flowers or felt the power of the blasphemed earth why too much pain possibly too close to going under with a poor drunken mother who just could not hang on and the terrible terrible sense of it all having been taken from them the bitterness it could kill you you had to let the bitterness go or it would kill you he knew hed been by though as he remembered sam had driven him up us to fort smith to join the united states marine corps on june the day after he graduated from high school here said russ consulting the diagram from the newspaper heres where jimmy ended up parking nowhe walked past bob hunched in concentration nose buried in the clipping before himhere is where your fathers car was and your dad was found in the drivers side sitting sideways fallen slightly to his right and hung up on the steering wheel his feet on the ground the radio mike in his hand bled out said bob what that was the mechanism right thats what killed him blood loss not shock to his nervous system or a bullet in a major bloodbearing organ ah thats what it says here i dont russ how does a bullet kill do you know russ didnt a bullet just uh killed it uh a bullet can kill you three ways it can destroy your central nervous system thats the brain shot into the deep cerebellum two inches back from the eyes and between the ears instant rag doll clinical death in less than a tenth of a second or it can destroy your circulatory and arterial system depressurize you the heart shot or something in the aorta thats fifteen twenty seconds till clinical death your good central body shot or finally it can hit a major bloodbearing organ and you essentially bleed to death internally a big stretch cavity lots of tissue destruction lots of blood but not instant death say three four sometimes ten to twenty minutes without help which of those i dont know said russ it doesnt really say it just said he bled to death the latter i guess it would be nice to know the mechanism it would tell us a lot you write that down in your book under things to find out where would we go to find that bob ignored him just standing there looking about he tried to read the land or what little of it was left this was a hunters gift a snipers gift to look at the folds and drops and rises in a piece of earth and derive meanings from them understand in some instinctual way how they worked the first thing why here standing there exactly where his father had stood he realized that in high corn this spot was invisible from the road moreover it took just enough delicate driving to steer back here without losing control and careening back into the corn thered been nothing in the papers about a highspeed chase there couldnt have been a chase his daddys car would have been behind theirs not in front of it unless bub and jimmy were chasing him he looked about trying to imagine it in high corn you run back to sam he said to russ you ask him about the moon was there a moon we can check but i dont think so not from my memory anyhow ask him about the temperature the wind that sort of thing humidity was it heavy the boy looked at him vacantly then puzzlement stole across the delicate features what is i will tell you later just do it okay okay said russ turning away on the errand a wind rose the sun was bright now and then a car rushed along the parkway whose buttresses were about a hundred yards farther back bob turned in each direction trying to feel the land to the south there was an incline his father would have come that way to the north at least now the bright roofs of the highway service buildings the motel and the gas station and the restaurants but in those days nothing but wild forests the town proper of waldron still lay eleven miles ahead to the west more incline as the other side of the road fell away toward the prairies of oklahoma he turned back to face the east to face the parkway but it hadnt been a parkway then it had been a ridge obliterated in the building of the road how high how far the road was a hundred yards off but possibly the road builders hadnt placed the road at the center of the ridge maybe it was at its highest even farther out he says no moon said russ breathing heavily from the jog he says stars but no moon no humidity about seventyfive degrees maybe eighty a little breeze nothing much bob nodded all right now ask him two more questions the first is where were all the tenant farmers shacks were they right here did this road run back to them or were they farther along where did this road go then and second ask him which direction my fathers car was parked he said it was aslant the road and the body was behind the steering wheel i want to know on which side of the road that was which direction it faced russ took a deep breath then turned and ran back to the old man again alone bob turned to face the highway that towered above him he walked back through the weeds and came at last to stand next to one of the mighty concrete pylons upon which the road rested it was cool here in the shade though the road rumbled someone had painted polk county class of and beer cans and broken bottles lay about on the gravel beyond the parkway bob could see the land fall away into forest and farm over a long slope of perhaps two miles until a little white farm road snaked through the trees he looked back and saw that the action had played out halfway down just the subtlest slope he saw russ standing big as day where he had left him he walked on back okay russ said breathing hard trying to keep it straight the road evidently was an old logging trail and it ran back and up and over the ridge this area used to be logged back in the twenties the croppers lived another mile or so down us away from waldron toward boles thats where sam shot his deer and the lady yelled at him it wasnt here no sir okay and my daddy he was on the left side of the road facing east facing the ridge right sitting sideways in his seat with his feet on the ground not as if he were about to drive away is that right another look of befuddlement came across russs face how did you know that it wasnt in any of the newspaper accounts sam says the car was parked on the left side of the road and the door was open and your daddy bob nodded whats going on oh just seeing the place gets me to thinking i got a question or two what questions howd they get here through the biggest manhunt in arkansas that was my question remember i asked that question when we were driving in the day before but when you asked it it was a stupid question it was stupid because we had no idea of the layout of the roads that led to the site and the kind of terrain it was it could have been there were fifty obscure country roads far too many for the cops to cover all leading here but there werent theres only route a major highway well covered and this little logging track that dont go nowhere so now its a smart question russ didnt get the distinction but he didnt say anything then bob said how come here you tell me ah russ had no answer this is where he ran into them he chased them they turned off the road he got by them and blocked them uh you think that little road is wide enough for him to get by them its night remember and if he slides off the road into the soft soil of the cornfield hes fucked no he was waiting for them he was already here and its off the road out of public view so they wouldnt get surprised by someone coming along howd he get jumped by them hell he was a salty old boy hed made two thousand arrests hed fought in three major island invasions he was nobodys fool yet they open up and hit him bad first few shots how ah russ trailed off maybe he was the mastermind of the job maybe he had come to get his payoff and split the take russ looked at him in horror your father was a hero he said thats what it said in the papers isnt it he was just a goddamn man dont think of him as a hero because then you dont think straight about it no he wasnt in on it he didnt trust em but he knew they was coming reason he swung around to park in the direction he did was so he could use his searchlight which was mounted outside the driversside window he had to cover em hell they were surrendering to him thats what it was howd he know where to go where theyd reach him why would he believe them what was it really about russ had no answers come on said bob theres only one man who can tell us sam no said bob leading the way daddy himself he wants to talk its just time we listened they walked back and found sam sitting on the open tailgate of the truck his pipe lit up and blazing away it smelled like a forest fire you boys didnt get lost thats a surprise sam said bob let me ask you something suppose i wanted to exhume my fathers body what sort of paperwork is involved sams shrewd old features narrowed under his slouch hat and grew pointed now what the hell you want to do that for boy i just want to know what happened the diagrams may lie and the newspapers may lie and all the official documents may be gone but the body is going to tell the truth bob it was forty years ago i know theres not much left thats why we need a good man now whats it going to take well i file a motion of exhumation with the county clerk and the coroners office and you have to find a good forensic pathologist get a doctor not an undertaker like they got in too many counties down here someone from little rock theres someone in the medical school up at fayetteville whos well thought of i could call him then i suppose you have to make an arrangement with a mortuary to clear out a place for him to work bob you want to go to all that trouble it was openandshut its the only way my daddy can talk to me i think i ought to listen to what he has to say i have to find out what happened that night sam slept on the way back and when they pulled up to the old house where hed lived and raised his kids and married his daughters and his sons and buried his wife they waited for the stillness in the car to wake him but it didnt sam bob finally said softly it was twilight with the sun lost behind rich mountain which towered over blue eye from the west sam made some wet gurgling sound in his sinuses stirred a bit but then seemed to settle back sam said bob a little louder and sams eyes shot open he looked at each of them whawherewhat is sam sam said bob grabbing the old mans shoulder sam you been sleeping but sams eyes lit in panic and his body froze in tension who are you he begged fearfully what do you want dont hurt me sam sam said bob calmly its bob bob lee swagger earls boy you just done forgot where you was the old man was shaking desperately youre okay mr vincent said russ really its fine youve forgotten but sams eyes flashed between them wide with horror its okay said bob its okay earl eased into the cornfield road the dirt felt soft and he progressed slowly around him illuminated in the shafts of his headlights the stalks of corn towered eight feet tall and quivering ever so gently in the breeze off the shoulder of the road in the field the earth looked loose and he was afraid if he got off into it he could get stuck wouldnt that be a goddamn mess the road curved a little to the left until eventually it paralleled what from the darker texture of the night had to be the rise of fergusons ridge hed taken a deer on the ridge though several miles away that same day some sharecropper woman had given sam a tonguelashing for shooting so close to her children served him right though to hear him tell it samd never made a mistake in his life when he was about a hundred yards in that is so far in he couldnt see the us for the thickness of the corn he halted the car and tried to think he wanted to be able to put the light on jimmy and bub that meant he had to turn the car he got out looked around kicked at the shoulder and the dirt off the shoulder to tell if it would support the weight of the ford it appeared that it would he climbed back in and painstakingly ground the wheel toward the left cranking the car in a tight turn until the front wheels were just about off then he spun the wheel in the opposite direction backing slowly this put him on the left side of the road pointed outward he turned off the engine then leaned out the window and tried his spotlight it threw a harsh circle of white light down the road that collected in a vivid oval a hundred feet out with one hand he pivoted it tracked it up and down like an antiaircraft searchlight then turned it off he looked at the radium dial of his bulova ninefifty ten minutes to go why am i so nervous he wondered hed been nervous in the war or at least on the night before an amphibious operation reason to get nervous amphibious operations were tricky and dangerous at tarawa the traks had run aground on coral a thousand yards out it was a long walk in through the surf laden with equipment with the japs shooting the whole way you get through that you could get through anything but just some little goddamn nervous thing was flicking at him he felt cursed hed made a big mistake today he hadnt meant to but hed sure as hell wanted to and so he did it and now what so hed clean it up tomorrow hed clean up the mess hed made hed be a man these things could be handled and to hell with everything else he knew hed do it he just didnt know what it was to do it was all running together on him the whole goddamned messedup day shirelle parker jed posey pop dwyer jimmy pye lem tolliver bub pye miss connie longacre sam vincent buddy till edie white pye edie edie edie his son bob lee shirelle dead missing her underpants her eyes eternally open the barking dog mollie hes got it shes here forget about it he told himself concentrate on the job he got out of the car when he could feel his limbs begin to tingle with lack of circulation he stood breathing in the country air it was so incredibly quiet but no it wasnt just as a man in war learns the darkness isnt really darkness but a texture of different shades that can be learned and read so quiet wasnt really quiet he heard the snapping of the cornstalks as they rustled in the hiss of the breeze he heard crickets off on some spring by the ridge and bullfrogs too low and mournful he thought he heard a man cough far away no couldnt be nobody out here some goddamn frog thing or something or maybe some freak of nature carrying a real cough miles and miles it happened all the time up above stars not like the pacific but still towers and piles of stars almost a smoke of stars constellations that he had showed his son trying to remember the stories that went with them and feeling he wasnt doing a very good job there were no city lights out here to bleach them out the closest town was boles a good five miles back and in boles they closed up for the night around nine whats that one daddy someone asked no no one asked it was his sons voice but it was only in his mind he remembered the question from a hunting trip last fall thats the north star bob lee always find your way home with that one secret to night navigation whats night gation damn kid had so many questions concentrate on the job he told himself he checked his watch it was ten oclock nothing the monkey took one look at jim and threw the peanuts back at him burma shave bub drove he couldnt hardly see nothing just corn on both sides of the road and now and then a rhyming set of burma shave signs or on a barn a mail pouch or a copenhagen or even a jesus saves he felt lost it was so dark he was very scared and also very tired he was hungry hadnt eaten since the burger jimmy looked out of the car peering intently there it is he said right up there on the left you see it yes sir said bub he saw a gap in the corn and what looked to be a road leading back far off was a ridge you aint forgot what youre going to say he asked it was very important that jimmy tell him again it stopped him from getting so scared no sir i give you my word said jimmy this one was my deal the whole way it was all my fault old bub had nothing to do with it well git you back to your mama in no time you might even get to go home tonight do you think do you think i miss my mama an image of his mama came before bub she was an immense woman usually harried sometimes quite mean but he loved her just the same he remembered a time when he and some other boys had set fire to a cat after dousing it with kerosene and it had run just a little bit screaming horribly before it collapsed into a smoking heap and he had felt so bad and his mama had pulled him into her arms and rocked and rocked him and in her abiding warmth and under the ministrations of her calm heart he had fallen asleep that was his favorite memory you just do what mr earl tells you said jimmy its going to be all right bub turned onto the dirt road he paused feeling the car slip a little into the soil go on said jimmy just a bit farther im afraid old earl missed it goddammit they edged ahead until they were swallowed by corn the corn seemed to lean in from each side like it was attacking them and bub had a brief spasm of fear jimmy he asked plaintively feeling his voice rise just a bit there there said jimmy the headlights prowled ahead on the dirt road and in time they came to the state police cruiser resting on the side of the road here we are said jimmy earl watched as the car came slowly into view swung around the curve then pulled off to the side of the road fifty or so feet away whoever was driving switched off the engine a little gray dust still floated in the air the car cooling ticked and creaked a bit but neither of the two men inside moved for maybe thirty long seconds it was quiet then earl switched on his spotlight throwing a circle of illumination in the front seat of the automobile he recognized jimmy pye raising a hand to block out the harsh glare jimmy was blazing in the beam his natural colors turned flamewhite his thick locks of hair golden thats bright earl he called jimmy earl thought goddamn you jimmy whyd you go and do this goddamned thing all right now jimmy earl called out you move real easy yes sir said jimmy can bub call his mama hes awful upset about his mama well take care of that in a little bit now i want you to come out first jimmy i want to see the gun held by the barrel in your left hand and i want to watch it tossed until it lands in the dirt then i want you bub i want to see hands i want to see the gun held in the left one by the barrel i want to see it in the dirt you got that this is going to happen nice and easy yes sir mr earl called bub okay lets do it hey earl you sound like joe friday this aint dragnet hell earl its only jimmy pye and his little cousin said jimmy he unlatched his door then showing his hands kneed the door open and stepped out his hands were high and empty im going to get the gun now earl he called and reached down with his left hand and removed a pistol from his belt he threw it forward where it landed in the dust kicking up a little puff okay bub you slide over and out you come the same way bub scooted forward along the seat and pulled himself out where jimmys posture had been nonchalant even arrogant bub was tight with tension absurdly his arms flew straight up like a grade school boy aping an angels flight earl could see his knees shaking the gun bub did you forget the gun bub ohunh came a little choke of despair and terror from the big boy its still in the car you want me to get it turn around sos i can see youre unarmed said earl obligingly the big youngster pivoted and earl saw his belt was empty okay bub you turn back around and set them hands against the roof of the car next to jimmy yyes sir came the plaintive cry as bub turned and leaned now yall stay like that real steady im coming across i dont want any sudden moves hurry up earl the damn skeeters is eating me alive called jimmy the spotlight locked on the two boys earl reached down and unsnapped the flap over his colt trooper then he reached back and removed the pair of handcuffs from his belt case and another that hed stuck into the belt he started to walk across damn said jimmy slapping suddenly at his neck where hed just been stung goddamn bugs it happened so slowly yet so fast at the same time earls eyes followed as jimmys hand seemed to go back to the car but at the same time in a maneuver that made no sense at all jimmy was curling pivoting turning and he felt himself say jim when he saw the gun and he couldnt figure it out because the gun was on the ground hed seen it hit and he saw the flash before he heard any noise and he felt the whack before he heard the noise too and then he heard the noise and saw the flash again and whack from so close so very close and the next thing he knew he was on his knees and somebody was running at him and he heard the noise again and it was bub bub ran at him and seemed to stop as a red spider crawled across his tshirt front and his face was drawn and terribly tense with fear but still he came crazily at earl like some kind of monster his arms outstretched his mouth working his eyes wide like big white eggs coming on as if to crush the life from earl earl fired he couldnt even remember drawing bub went to his knees flash earl turned as jimmy fired again then again both misses as he slipped back into the corn earl imagined a sly grin on jimmys face and more than anything to wipe that terrible grin away he squeezed the trigger four more times four booming blasts the gun bucked in his hand the four shots as fast as any that ever came out of his tommy gun until the gun clicked dry what the hell is happening earl thought not in words so much as in bright flashes spangles fragments of light and hot metal that danced through his mind then he saw he was still in the light still on the ground and around him the cars towered and beyond the cars the corn towered he slithered backwards out of the light waiting to be shot but no shot came he heard steps the rush of corn being shoved roughly aside the sigh of the breeze no other sound he got behind the cover of his cruiser bub lay on his back covered in blood mama bub screamed oh mama hep me please oh jesus lord i dont want to die there was no sign of jimmy reload he told himself putting out the gun before him and reaching over with his off hand to unlatch the cylinder and reach for ammunition but he had no off hand or at least it didnt work he looked and saw he was covered with blood an angry black pucker oozed black fluid just below his elbow the blood coursing down to his fingers where it dripped off he couldnt move the fingers the arm was dead broken his left side was covered in blood too his uniform and trousers soaked in it am i going to die he wondered well if i am goddammit i better reload just the same with his good thumb he managed to pull back the cylinder latch and shake the cylinder out turning the gun upward he shook and shook until one at a time all six shells fell out he wedged the gun between his knees and again one by one picked shells out of his cartridge loops and threaded them into the cylinder big soft points with a snap of the wrist he flicked the cylinder shut the pain started it howled in his arm his side was numb and wet he wanted to sleep or scream he didnt want to go after jimmy in the corn gun loaded in his hand he slipped the colt into the holster and crawled into the car and picked the mike up he was way out in the country with no relay stations close by but the radio was a powerful lowband am could he get through he should be able to any cars any cars trooper down tenthirtythree repeat tenthirtythree any cars please respond dead air answered him shit a sparkle caught his eye he looked up to a blur of fractured glass in the windshield where one of jimmys shots had flown and then beyond that his aerial snapped in two by a bullet goddamn lucky little prick that would cut the range way down no backup he slid back out of the car took a look around bub was still though earl could see he still breathed nothing could be done now earl certainly wasnt going out there in the light he figured jimmy was somewhere close by maybe circling just getting closer for one thing was dead clear jimmy was trying to kill him thats what this goddamn thing was all about jimmy was so hopped up he could hardly hold still he knew hed got him he got him good earl was probably dead hed seen him fall seen the blood all over him and when earl normally a dead shot with any kind of gun had fired at him hed missed by plenty jimmy crouched in the corn still as a sleeping cat though he was breathing hard from his low angle he couldnt see much through the stalks which even now wavered and clicked in the low breeze somewhere far ahead was a blaze of light that told the location of the two cars he was going to wait to catch his breath and then begin the slow crawl back he knew he had to make sure then he was out he was gone he was done a whole new world lay before him he had done it rocking round the clock till the broad daylight but abruptly the light vanished he contemplated the meaning in this had the light gone out on its own had earl turned it out had people come and turned it out no it couldnt be people thered be cars dogs airplanes maybe them helicopters the whole goddamn shooting match it was goddamned earl earl hunting him earl turning out the light so there wouldnt be any backlight to throw up a silhouette he knew he should just be quiet another few minutes earl had seen him go so if earl was coming after him hed know which side of the road and hed come low and fast and hed make noise hell make noise he thought he didnt doubt that earl would try such a thing the man was a bulldog of guts but he was old he was wounded he probably lost a lot of blood just stay still jimmy told himself so of course he yelled earl earl you coming for me goddamn earl im sorry i thought you was fixing to kill me and be a big hero there was no response then he heard a yell goddammit jimmy you are a fool and you done shot me good i am a dying man you come on and surrender now because aint no way youre getting out help is on the way nobodys gettin way the hell out here in time for this jimmy yelled laughing for he knew it was true just as he knew earl wasnt that bad hurt but was lying to set him up earl could be a tricky devil but that didnt really scare jimmy in fact nothing scared jimmy his mind was ablaze with ideas of glory and fame with adolescent notions of toughness and reputation and he wanted to assert himself over the man who had loomed above him half his life like a dark cloud he loved earl he also hated him he wanted to save him he wanted to kill him most of all he wanted to impress him he had just reloaded his clip from the pocketful of bullets and slammed it back into the super his trick had worked he threw a wrench and earl thought it was a gun ha earl fooled you he started to crawl toward earl he knew the man would be there soon and hed get the jump and the first shot and hed say hey earl aint i the newest thing aint i cool and kill him now the pain the pain so bad it went up and down his arm looking for new places to hurt the hand was numb he was still bleeding hed seen somebody literally shredded by a shell blast on one of the islandscouldnt remember which one nowliterally turned into a confetti of flesh and blood and thats what his worthless arm looked like now next fatigue so utterly tired why was he so tired he wanted to sleep was he bleeding to death possibly there just came an urge to lie down and sleep it off and finally melancholy why oh why was this happening what had gone wrong who made such a thing happen goddamn jimmy pye or what sadness too for bub whom he now realized was not trying to kill him but was running to him in panic for protection bub stopped the bullet that might have killed earl and for his trouble earl shot him in the chest with a magnum soft point blowing a hole in his heart bub was dead sure enough for no man can lie the way bub had unless he was dead he felt the trooper in his hand his finger taut against the trigger he yearned to fire but at what he simply moved ahead not crawling because crawling was too slow and hard with the broken arm but walking sideways crabwalking down the side of the road deeper and deeper into the corn toward the direction of jimmys last yell it would come down to one shot he felt jimmy might get him but he knew if he didnt do something fast hed just bleed out and that would be that jimmy would be even more famous than he was now he had no hat hed taken off his badge he was just a wounded man with a gun hunting an unwounded man with one he was old he was slow he was very scared he thought he might never see his son or his wife again above him the stars were distant unblinking completely neutral all around him the corn shivered and clicked and far off the insects and the frogs wailed away why was he doing this for what for some goddamned civilians whod never know his name and would call him too big for his britches behind his back hed never wondered such a blasphemy before not on any of the islands or in any of the scrapes or near scrapes as a law officer why does it matter no not really he went to his knee the big pistol heavy in his hand he felt now that jimmy was close then he knew it jimmy wouldnt be ahead of him jimmy would be behind him jimmy would let him pass then come from behind thats how jimmys mind would work because jimmy was an athlete who had been schooled in the arts of feint and attack jimmy he called jimmy come on now boy this dont have to happen no answer earl stood by the side of the road and made as if to look forward peering into the corn jimmy watched him come earl wasnt in the corn so much as half in the corn clinging to the edge of the road he moved not fast but not slow either with grim determination even in the dark jimmy could see earls face tight and clenched it was a fathers face the face of a man who knew what to do next or maybe the face of a man who told you what was wrong with what you were doing jimmy raised the gun earl would pass within a few yards of him but then he paused there were a thousand stalks of corn between him and earl who knew if the bullets would deflect or what and who knew if he could shoot that accurately in the dark he could fire all his shots and miss no better to let earl pass him by then snake over and come out on the road behind him get close that was it get real close and just shoot and shoot and shoot show him whos best earl listened nothing he edged forward farther jimmy come on i dont want to have to hurt you nothing then he heard the click of a pistol safety snicking off i got you beat earl earl straightened and turned the gun at his side jimmy was twenty feet behind him the colt automatic out and pointed straight at him i win earl jimmy for gods sake put it down its all over it is all over jimmy it aint worth it earl put the gun down and ill let you live i caint do that jimmy you know that this is the end of the line another second or two and i cant cut you no more slack earl i dont hate you but it aint my fault he pulled the trigger the gun flashed and bucked and smoke swirled about earl stood straight as a goddamn rail you missed jimmy its too far you aint a good enough shot son youre overmatched put it dow jimmy fired sure hed hit but astonished at how fast the older man was as he dropped to one knee the gun rising in a blur he wasnt just fast he was some other kind of fast his arm a whip a smear a flash and the two shots were almost one so swiftly did they come the next thing he saw was earl over him in a fog earl he said yes jimmy earl i caint see nothing it hurts something with his head it was like in a vise or among broken boxes or pieces of glass or something fog everywhere never seen nothing like it its all right jimmy its all going to be all right jimmy breathed the last time and went still there was no death rattle final gurgle or twitch as there sometimes was it was as if his soul simply departed leaving only a cask behind earl could see that one shot had torn through his left eye and exited the side of his beautiful head destroying it the second had hit him just above the heart he lay as calm as a young king soaking in his own blood utterly motionless one eye beautiful and blue with its perfect curl of blond lash the other eye shattered pulp leaking black jagged streaks into the earth earl looked away and found the strength to rise he stood on groggy legs dizzy and unsure with an act of will he took a step and then another and walked back to the car feeling as old as the mountains god he felt so awful no man should have to kill a boy hed known for twenty years why hadnt jimmy told him what was going on what was going on what got into jimmy i will by god find out his arm was still bleeding it only hurt like the goddamned devil himself was beating away on it his left side was completely numb and he was sopped with his own blood he realized he would die if help didnt get there soon enough it all came down to the radio with the broken aerial he bent over retrieved the mike and pushed the send button any cars any cars goddammit trooper down tenthirtythree please respond please respond silence he looked up into the sky stars piles of them against the dark he felt so goddamned alone he tried again any cars any cars this is car one four is anybody out there trooper down tenthirtythree tenthirtythree jesus christ i am losing blood so on a road in a cornfield bleeding out after so many chances in the islands bleeding out in a cornfield any police cars any tow trucks any band jumpers please help trooper down tenthirtythree please acknowledge nothing it ends its over its finished i didnt make it he closed his eyes his sons face floated before him and he felt himself reaching out but it vanished ah trooper one four this is a commercial aviation flight delta one niner zero up here at twentyseven five and vectored southbound into new orleans im hopping the frequencies and i happened to pick up your signal son where the hell are you delta delta i am eleven miles south of waldron arkansas just off route in a cornfield one hundred yards off the highway i have been hit twice and i am losing blood you hang on son i am going to shift frequencies and put the squawk onto the little rock emergency frequency and the boys on the ground will asap it to your local authorities and you will get assistance and if they cant make it i will set this buggy down on the goddamn highway and pick you up myself trooper thank you delta one niner zero aint you a good samaritan and aint you a tub o guts trooper good luck son he signed off earl set the radio mike down and sat in the dark the world seemed suddenly full of possibility then he heard the sound of death it chilled him it was the dry raspy spastic crackle that signified the presence of a rattlesnake great he thought thats all i need judge myers was going to beat him this was very frustrating for red because judge myers never beat him nobody ever beat him goddammit red was the best sporting clays shooter in west arkansas and maybe the whole state hed placed high in several national tournaments including the big pig in maryland the nscas in san antonio the seminole cup challenge in orlando he had a gift for the game a natural grace with the shotgun and a kind of geometryinstinctive mindhis arithmetic gift again perhapsthat let him solve complex problems of deflection with an almost eerie confidence but even the good shooters have the odd off day when the birds come from the trap not as they should but by freakish chance too close too far or caught and toyed with in a burst of random wind lifted oddly or squashed oddly faster slower when for whatever reason the eye isnt seeing with quite the clarity it normally does or the brain isnt reading and solving with quite the same power the hands are slow the gun never gets mounted right so many little things that begin to erode at whatever it is that makes you hit so it was today with red the judge who had never broken was standing at now on the last station red was standing at if he ran five the best he could do would be to top out at so the judge could beat him with a five or even a pussy four and the man was so confident and feeling so full of himself the five looked possible the four positive this isnt my day said red no it wasnt he hated the last station not the two oblique outgoers that came low off the trap easy for a shooter at his level but his worst damned shot a far teal straight up and way out first a single then a goddamned simo he should have it changed after all he owned the course the judge stepped into the cage before them the beauty of the states wildness displayed itself for the course was a good one with shots hard enough to keep it interesting the trap was to the left the first two outgoers sailed low and dropped as they fell into a valley amid dogwoods crossed a pond and disappeared in the vegetation the teal were the bitches they looked like dots popped straight up from a remote on the other side of the pond bare against the sky only momentarily so dark and far you couldnt even see their orangeness you wanted to catch them as they paused in equipoise at the cusp of their rise if instead you tried to take them going down youd run out of shot before you could pull the trigger im feeling strong today red said judge myers of the fort smith myerses who was also chairman of the sebastian county party and a close personal friend and campaign fundraiser of and for senator hollis etheridge and if holliss campaign ever got into gear the judge would be headed for a big job in washington all of which pleased red no end well judge if you want ill just write you the check now we dont even have to shoot it out the better man won today oh red you sly damned dog you you really are ray bamas son but that kind of psych job wont work on me the judge laughed reds gamesmanship was a legend in fort smiths raciest poker golfing and wingshooting circles which essentially were the same circles and only one circle the rich boys club red and the judge went way back when in a justice department attorney working for the organized crime strike force had petitioned for a wiretap someone red knew had tipped him with the information and it was judge myers whod granted red a temporary enjoining order that case would come up to decision sometime soon too possibly by the second or the third decade of the next century so the judge owed red who contributed money by the gallon to the party and red owed the judge thats why red loved to shoot against the judge it was even the judge slipped two activ s into the chambers of his perazzi snapped the lovely guns sleek barrels into the receiver with the solid thunk of a bank vault closing and took up a nice loose ready position the gun tucked under the right shoulder the weight forward on the balls of the feet trapper ready came a call from the bush pull the judge called and obediently the unseen trapper launched the disks two orange saucers which in a blur flashed into the valley sinking skimming diminishing all at once the judges gun spoke twice fast and two orange puffs marked the hits as he swung through he opened the barrels let the empties pop out and slid two more activs into the overandunder chambers pull he shouted and quickly enough from beyond the pond a bird the size of an aspirin screamed into the sky paused ever so slightly and the judge stayed with it followed through and killed it except he didnt goddamn he said now im spooked youre not spooked said red not you damn said the judge he reloaded for the really hard simo two birds launched at once inscribing arcs away from each other you couldnt get them both with one shell you had to take one early as it rose then swing to the second one before it fell too far and you lost it in the vegetation tricky as hell because you had to trust your instincts as far as finding the line and if you came down through it and were off center there was nothing to be done he steeled himself took a swallow tried a hundred ready positions then found one to his liking pull he shouted and missed both goddamn the man screamed son of a bitch he muttered as he stepped away well well said red lookie here red you aint never run this station and i dont believe youre going to now jack myers you are probably right but we shall see what we shall see he stepped into the cage the test was concentration thinking too hard about the teal that lay ahead could cost him the easier outgoers that he had to deal with first visualize he ordered himself and in his mind he watched a movie of himself mounting the gun smoothly coming up on line with the two birds with no excess motion not even much gun movement killing them fast and getting out of there he slid two shells into the gleaming chambers of his krieghoff k worth of poetry and grace assembled lovingly by the best gun makers in germany he locked the gun shut and just felt himself leaning ever so slowly forward letting the shot assemble in his mind letting his emotions calm his heart still and his concentration begin to gather pull you dont want to look as the birds come off the trap because they move too fast youll be late as red smoothly pulled the gun up and into his shoulder with an economical practiced placement until it naturally found itself pointing exactly where also by long practice he was already looking he watched the birds come into the window of his sharpest vision there was no time for thought or consideration for things happened faster than words could be arranged to record them the birds were there falling diminishing but etched in his focus the barrel was a blur beneath them the gun seemed automatically to fire twice as he swept along and the orange smears where the birds ceramic was dissolved by the force of eight hundred pellets of bird shot driving through their center marked his hits he popped the shells out reached into his shell bag and took out a no winchester heavy trap load and slipped it into his lower barrel where the tighter of his two chokes was screwed the improved cylinder he set himself again oh he hated these far teal it was so easy for the bird to find a hole in the shot pattern and so distant it was also possible for the bird to take a bunch of hits and yet not break or chip it happened all the time pull he shouted the bird rose the gun rose and as these two things happened yet another did the vibrator on his pager went off momentarily disconcerting him he lost a tenth of a second and when he got up to where the bird was supposed to be paused as gravity overcame its upward velocity he was late it was already falling but red didnt panic he punched the gun downward hard caught up with the falling orange disk and fired as he passed it goddamn he missed no you hit it red said the judge i saw a chip not much of one but by god a chip great shooting damn you do you mind if i make an emergency call sure go ahead its your concentration red leaned the krieghoff against the cage stepped outside and pulled his folder off his belt he punched the key that accessed duane pecks hot line for the recorded report ah sir heres the latest yesterday i followed em out route toward waldron and then lost em i went back and forth for a coupla hours and finally i picked em up at some field out near uh waldron they never saw me they were there until dark that was the kid you know and that bob lee guy and they got old sam vincent with em uh the man paused seemed to lose track then got himself settled down so anyway today today early sam trots over to the temporary courthouse and files some papers he files whats called a motion of exhumation to get county permission so that they can dig up earl swagger and perform some kind of autopsy on the body uh whats your thought they dont got no idea im interested except for that fucking kid looked at me smart when i first bumped into em i could deal with it now before it gets too much it was like the sun breaking out on a cloudy day it was like finding a million dollars it was free sex with a beautiful woman and no consequences he pushed the button to reach the recorder dont do a thing i think we got em flummoxed we may git out of this one without a real problem things are looking very very good they were this one was covered you look as though youve had extremely good news said the judge as red returned to the cage you know sometimes how a deal looks like its going to fall apart on you with all kinds of difficulties but then something you did years ago because you were smart and thought about it clicks in and it turns out just the way you figured well i cant say ive had that exact pleasure well it feels great red said he picked up the gun popped the breech and dropped two more s in pull he said feeling wonderful the birds shot upward and he killed them both he remembered it as somehow more beautiful in his memory he saw a rolling green meadow mostly in shade from the stately black oak that stood nearby the tombstones had a grandeur to them it was like a parade of the honored dead a miniarlington where an honor guard would keep eternal watch but if that polk county veterans cemetery ever existed or if it was only an imaginary place like an oz for the dead it was certainly not the bitter reality blasted by sun parched and treeless and very shabby and as flat and banal as a pancake the cemetery stretched to the empty horizon it wasnt even really a veterans cemetery it just had a veterans section in it but beyond the crooked fence the civilians lay just as dead as the vets you never came here russ asked oh a few times when i was small that was before my mother got what we called sick meaning drunk she was better off not coming i just remember her crying like a baby her sister had to drive us home then i came the night before i left for the marine corps drove myself i came once more on liberty but by that time my mother was dead and there wasnt much else to come back to i never came when i got back from the war i just stayed on that goddamned mountain is it the same i remember more trees hell though i was just a kid a bush looked like a tree is this it mr swagger cried one of the gravediggers hired for the occasion well lets see bob walked over to the simple stone it looked no different from the hundreds in here the war dead of west arkansas dating back to the civil war he bent and squinted in the sun and read off the corrupted limestone earl swagger usmc arkansas state police and then husband father marine police officer uncommon valor yes sir mr coggins thats him now if that damned doctor would just get here we may as well get started said the old man why dont you just the crewthree black men two young and the older mr cogginsset to it with solid work bob watched them cut into the earth with their spades slice the turf out and then really put their backs into it swiftly the dirt mounded up on the tarpaulin they had set out for that purpose lot of dirt in a hole bob said russ watching the black men dig felt a bit uncomfortable the whole thing was so matteroffact nobody at the cemetery office had seen anything remarkable about the paperwork served but it seemed there were no records left as the cemetery had changed administrations many times since and somewhere along the line the record keeping had grown sloppy and the actual physical materials had somehow disappeared but it was no big deal bob found it easy enough i feel guilty with them doing all the work russ said theyre professionals theyre doing a good job let them earn their pay my father loved a job done well and by god them boys are doing it well through the morning the men dug without much in the way of rest two in one out the shovels a steady machinelike attack against the ground and the hole widened and deepened bob just watched he could be so still russ bored ambled around trying to think of something to do that would be helpful but which wouldnt require his actual presence but then he thought this is my party i have to be here you remember that cop bob said yes you said to me there was something fishy about him right yes what be specific ah russs mind seemed to fill with light another test which he would fail but then he remembered well ive been around cops my whole life my father you know go on get to it well heres how a cops eyes work he stares hard at you and makes a reading reads you up and down its how a cops mind works hes comparing you to type hes got fifty types in his head and three or four of them are dangerous in his first few seconds he eyeballs you to try you against type but then if he determines youre not dangerous he loses interest then youre just an irritating problem for him he fills out the ticket he gives you the directions he takes the statement whatever but hes not interested in you hes not really paying attention to you hes looking around for other threats ummm said bob considering this guy said russ he kept eyeballing unusual cop behavior because any cop could tell in a second that a twentysomething yuppie in reeboks and a polo shirt wasnt dangerous but i puzzled him odd maybe he thought i was dangerous but he wasnt looking at you he was looking at me well we could ask him about it hes been staring at us from behind the trees for ten minutes now here he comes jesus said russ and he drove by us three times while we were in that field yesterday bob smiled at him you be cool now the deputy sauntered up lanky and tawny his big hands hooked on his belt his hat low over his eyes shades on bright reflective lenses that sealed the world out howdy there he called smiling deputy peck said bob well i see you boys are making good progress here on this thing we think we might learn a bit from the body though it grieves me to disturb the dead well sometimes you got to do what you got to do thats true enough you know mr swagger i done some thinking i could help you like fer instance i could fish them old records out of the sheriffs files from i dont think nobodys looked at them in years maybe i could help you find witnesses and the like there might be oldtimers around from them days be of some help to you i could help sam he dont git around much he might need an extra pair of legs be my pleasure well thats damned nice of you deputy fact is right now were just sort of grasping at straws we dont know if theres enough here things change people forget aint much of left we may not be around much longer if we dont get some better stuff well thats how i could help said peck you let me know you come up with something i can help you with meanwhile ill pretty much look for them files and see what i can dig out thatd be great deputy peck call me duane everybody does duane thatd be excuse me this came from a new voice and russ turned to see a bearded man possibly fifty in an opencollar shirt and a pair of slacks holding a heavy leather satchel which looked like a doctors bag wasnt this growing into some big party would somebody here be mr swagger the newcomer asked i am said bob hi im carl phillips dr phillips i teach forensic pathology up at fayetteville in the medical school and im a boardcertified forensic pathologist i was called by sam vincent yes sir the doctor stepped up gestured to the work party a few feet away the remains i assume yes sir said bob all right i arranged with winslows mortuary theyre going to give us a workroom youll have to pay them i suppose sure said bob and i assume all the county paperwork is in order sam said hed take care of it yes sir said bob here you want to look yes i do the state is very particular what can and cannot be done with remains it has more to do with the funeral industry lobby than anything for example the remains must be transported via hearse youre aware of that sam told us i called and set one up it should be here shortly the doctor took the papers and made a quick appraisal of them they seemed to satisfy him all right everythings in order i suppose youll want to go to the mortuary with me yes sir he was my father look let me be frank with you i know youre an experienced man been in combat some said bob so youve seen what high explosives and machinegun fire can do to bodies yes sir well theres nothing that youve seen that can prepare you for the effects of time upon a cadaver forty years after the fact what comes out of the ground is unrecognizable thats why its fine for you to come along but i want you nowhere near the actual work i cant let what his body has become represent what your father is to you when i do these private jobs thats my rule its my neck of the woods you let me do the navigating sure doctor said bob okay were all set mr swagger it was mr coggins who stood by the grave gleaming with sweat he was wiping his forehead with a red bandanna mr swagger were ready he was a long way down the doctor went to the edge of the grave and looked into it mr coggins youll rig the block and tackle next he asked yes sir said coggins bob and russ went to look into the grave the men had done an excellent job in the excavation the graves walls were hard and straight and black the dirt heaped in perfect mountains russ looked down unnerved but it was only a long wooden box caked with mud completely exposed five long feet down the doctor turned to them a cedar coffin thats very interesting im going to have to ask you to leave i have to check something out mr coggins you help me down the two young black men gleaming with sweat as well helped the doctor into the grave there was just enough room for him at one end he reached into his pocket and pulled out a surgical mask which he donned he asked the black men to leave the hole too bob and russ wandered away they heard the sound of wood being pried mr swagger called dr phillips yes sir im afraid i have bad news for you bob and russ looked at each other yes sir said bob this man was killed by gunshot wound i can see it clearly in the remains but from what i can tell from the condition it happened in around damn said duane peck dont that beat all the old man was on a goddamned rampage where the hell was it sam had torn his office apart in the morning and now he was at his home tearing it apart goddamned sonofabitching bastards had done it again on him theyd hidden something they were doing it more and more these days theyd sneak in late while he slept and hide things steal things move things theyd rearrange his drawers so that one day his socks would be in the third one and the next in the top one sometimes his hairbrush and razor were on the left side of the sink and sometimes on the right the fury was like smoke hot and bright and it seemed to fill his veins so that a ropy blue y stood out on his forehead and his temple throbbed strangely the other day they hid his pipe his pipe his meerschaum picked up in germany after the war hed smoked it every night for close to fifty years and it was gone it had vanished they changed the names of his grandchildren on him and they even mixed up two of his surviving daughters they moved his car when he drove to the store they changed the stoplight on him as he accelerated through an intersection and then they honked or yelled rudely to him sometimes they confused him as to what side of the road he was supposed to drive on it was enough to make a man seriously angry but this one their last prank was the worst for so long he had been such a methodical man he was the kind of american who believed not in law and order but that order was law thus he carefully cataloged or recorded his materials he took infinitely detailed notes he went over testimony forward and backwards he mastered evidence forward and backwards and he never ever asked a question twice or to which he did not know the answer he had outargued them all until these new invisible devils had come gunning for him but he wouldnt let them win or if by chance they won if someone finally beat him by god theyd know theyd been in a fight he looked around the carnage of his basement someone had literally dumped his files out of their cardboard boxes onto the floor in a frenzy who would do such a thing then he remembered he had done such a thing just a few minutes ago what was i looking for yes a copy of the report to the coroner he had put together in on a wrongful death hearing in the case of earl swagger he knew he had it he had to have it it was in here somewhere but where the box marked was empty and hed emptied to as well in the thought that maybe sometime when he left office and was transferring these boxes to his home he or one of his secretarieshed buried more secretaries than he could even rememberhad misfiled it or maybe he didnt even have a copy it was a report on an investigation but it didnt lead to a prosecution or a decision not to prosecute but only to a dead end in the coroners office so possibly even back then he didnt file it with his regular case files but in some other file some annex or something it wasnt like he couldnt remember now it wasnt his memory that was going no sir not him it was instead a sense of fog drifting through his mind the memory was still there it was a vision problem he still had all his books organized just so in the library of his mind but for some reason he had trouble reading the names on the spines and he couldnt get them out without groping it made him furious he hated the idea of going to that smug kid rusty or whatever his goddamned name was and saying you know i cant find that document i told you i could but i cant i must have misremembered rusty would look at him as a few of his grandchildren did their eyes would behold a relic a living fossil something that belonged behind glass in a museum well goddamn him anyway sam felt an eruption of anger so intense it was physical his knotty old hand formed into a fist and he imagined smashing rusty or whatever his name was in the mouth that would satisfy him so he bent but discovered his back too stiff to allow him to stay in such a position so he knelt and began to scrape the files up to try and get them into some semblance of order a name leaped out at him it was like a musical tone or something soft and vague but oddly familiar what was it what did it connect with what could it mean nothing he had it it tantalized him then it was gone goddamn them they were doing it to him again he got the files together and saw from the dates they were all s and so again he slipped through them one more time and by god no no earl swagger anywhere where did it go where had it parker he held the shirelle parker file in his hand it was quite thin not much to show for such a horrible crime though it had been an openandshut case why was this important yes earls last case that day july he opened the file and a picture greeted him shirelle at her eighthgrade graduation he remembered some policeman had given it to him before the trial he looked at it now and saw such a pretty girl her eyes so lit up and full of hope she was a colored child in the arkansas of the fifties and she was full of hope now wasnt that something she must have been a wonderful child but he realized he had no evidence about her he knew nothing about her except the facts of the death which are all that matter to a prosecutor it doesnt matter if theyre good bad wonderful or evil if theyve been killed you try and put the killers in the chair or at least in the house the next picture was more familiar it was marked polk county sheriffs department property july evidence the crime scene shirelle on her back on the hard shale wash of the hillside her dress up her privates violated her face still and swollen her eyes wide he put the photo down he could not look at it i got him for you shirelle he thought yes i did i got him for you and earl that was my job he remembered it was so easy hed gotten to the scene late the day after having been devoured by the terrible mess of earl swaggers death in the cornfield by the grief and the rage and all the long and terrible ceremonies to go through now finally at pm on the twentyfourth he arrived at shirelles site he could see in an instant that it had been hopelessly contaminated footprints scalloped the ground around her the litter of candy bar wrappers and pop bottles lay everywhere one lazy polk county sheriffs deputy lounged under a tree smoking a cigarette has the state police forensics team been here sam demanded no sir they aint acoming i hear too busy with mr earl sam shook his head but realized it didnt really matter there was no evidence left to be gotten here it looks like the goddamned armys been here well folks heard about the dead nigger gal they come to look i tried to keep em away but you know how word git around this enraged sam but he saw the pointlessness of exploding at this dim fool instead seething he walked to the body by now shirelle was gray in color almost dusty her negritude had all but vanished she was simply a dead child puffed up with gas that almost took her humanity away you heard about the pocket the deputy asked sam hadnt earl done found it yesterday put it in an envelope for lem to give the state police boys but when they done never showed he gave it to the sheriffs office pocket i hear ripped from a shirt monogrammed said rgf on it pretty as you please amazing thought sam hed been investigating and prosecuting murder for thirty years with five years off for the war and hed never come across anything so lucky but murder was like that it defied rational explanation and was full of crazy things coincidences freaks of happening the sheer play of the irrational in the universe a baptist he hated murder because it always made him doubt gods wisdom and even if he pressed too hard gods existence though he would never utter such heresy im going to call the coroner he told the deputy its time to git this poor little girl out of here now you listen to me you see anybody else pulling up for a free look at the show you chase em goddamn away you understand i dont want to hear about people coming up here no more it aint right sam shes only a nigger gal sam turned away by the time he got back the raiding party was already to go five sheriffs deputies with shotguns and rifles and clubs the sheriff himself already to lead the outfit in search of glory and headlines no sam told them not yet you boys can be cowboys later but the evidence was undeniable a quick scan of tax records in the county clerks office happily segregated by color had turned up but one negro with the initials rgf his name was reggie gerard fuller he was eighteen and the second son of davidson fuller the most prosperous negro in town and owner of fullers funeral parlor which buried all the negroes reggie had a drivers license on record and access to an automobile the hearse or more likely one of the two smaller black fords the parlor used to transport mourners on top of that reggie was known as a sharp dresser his shirts were monogrammed high school records indicated that reggie was a studious though not overbright boy who placidly accepted that he would work for his father in some clerical capacity lacking the grit and smarts to take over the business himself he had no incidents on his record but he was after all colored and young and therefore by inclination more inclined toward deviant behavior most sensible people realized that in each nigra there lurked the secret potential of the rapist and the killer it had merely to be brought out by liquor or jealousy and knives would flash the deputies even had a name for the crimes such behavior inspired they were called williethumpedwillies as in oh hey i hear you caught a williethumpedwillie the other night yeah goddamned coon cut up his old lady with a whiskey bottle bitch died before the goddamn ambulance came i dont blame the ambulance i wouldnt go down there for nothing in this one reggie thumped shirelle but sam was a stickler after examining the evidence he personally called judge harrison and personally drove the eighteen miles out to the judges farm to get the search warrant and the probablecause warrant signed this aint goddamn mississippi he said or goddamned alabam we do things by the law here and he went along on the raid he knew his presence would considerably lessen the thunder and the fury of the event white deputies kicking down black doors in the middle of the night no not in his county so instead of kicking in doors the deputies waited outside while sam and the sheriff knocked on the door of the biggest whitest house in what was called niggertown but was actually a sixblocksquare neighborhood in west blue eye it was four in the morning groggily mr fuller opened the door with a shotgun in his hand and sam was glad he had come along the deputies might have opened fire mr fuller i am sam vincent polk county prosecutor and i think you recognize the sheriff automatic race fear came upon the mans face he saw stern whites in his doorway and behind them parked at the curb four police cars light bars flashing what is this about sir weve come to question your son reggie and to serve papers on a search warrant ive instructed the boys to be courteous and professional but we do have an investigation to run could you please bring reggie down to us say the living room what is mr fuller i know youve heard there was another terrible crime yesterday one of your own kind now we have an investigation to run my boy didnt do nothing said mr fuller you know me to be a fair man and i swear to you nothing will happen here tonight or any night except what the law decrees thats how i run things but we have our duty to do in the meantime the deputies will search the house i have a legal paper here which says its all right the deputies wont break anything and if they do theyll pay for it out of their own pockets but we have to do what we have to do eventually the sleepy reggie was brought before sam he could have taken him to headquarters for questioning but he elected out of respect for mr fullers position to do the initial here reggie where were you five nights ago that is july he was here said mrs fuller you let him answer maam or i will have to take him away reggie was an almost fat boy with pale skin and an unfocused quality about him that had nothing to do with the late hour his eyes drifted he fidgeted he smiled and no one returned the smile he blinked and seemed to forget where he was for a while he stopped paying attention he was wearing pajamas with butterflies on them he betrayed more confusion than fear nothing about him suggested aggression or tendency to violence but nigras were strange that way they looked calm one second and the next they could go amok sir he finally said i dont member just around maybe in my room i cant say no i think i went for a drive in daddys big old wagon the hearse yes suh i went for a drive thats all listen some to the radio you know from memphis anybody see you got people who can testify to where you were no sir reggie were you near the church did you go to the church and that meeting they had there that night no sir reggie you listen to me if you were someplace you dont want your daddy to know about you have to be a man now and fess up you were at a crib drinking you were gambling you were with a woman sir i mr sam my boy reggie hes a good boy hes not no genius but he works hard and sam it was the sheriff sam the boys found something that was it really sam walked into the bedroom and watched as one of the deputies pointed to a little corner of blue shirt that peeked from between the mattress and the box spring of the now stripped bed sam nodded and the deputy separated the two the corner yielded to a larger mass of material very carefully with a pencil sam nabbed it and lifted it off the bed it was a shirt with the pocket missing blue cotton it was streaked with rust which sam knew to be the color of dried blood think we got us a nigger someone said okay sam said mark it and bag it very carefully people are going to be looking at this case and we cant afford to make a mistake then he headed back to the living room to arrest reggie fuller for murder the trial three months later was over in a day the fullers were willing to spend their life savings to hire a little rock lawyer but sam looked at the evidence and suggested that theyd do better to have reggie plead guilty and throw himself on the mercy of the court a fort smith lawyer told them the same thing the shirt was indeed reggies as laundry markings subsequently proved and nobody ever bothered to deny the pocket matched perfectly with the ripped seams on the chest the blood was ab positive as was shirelles reggie had no meaningful alibi he had taken the hearse that night and just driven around no bargain was ever offered because there was no cause to the evidence was such that a confession had no meaning sam made the melancholy but firm decision that reggie though he was young and somewhat distracted must die it wasnt that sam was a cruel man but he felt the simple rhythms of the universe had been violated and must be forcefully returned to normal an eye for an eye it was the best system the only true system he spoke for the dead and it only worked if he spoke loudly besides it was earls last case earl would have wanted it that way too the fullers finally found a lawyer who would take the case on appeal and though sam warned them not to throw their money away they did so anyway on a desperately vain attempt to save their son for over two years mrs fuller wrote sam a letter once a week begging for mercy as the case dragged through the courts and reggie moldered at the cummins farm at gould where the negroes were sent when the fullers ran out of money they sold their house and moved into a smaller one when they ran out of money again mr fuller sold his business to a white man and went to work for that same white man who called him behind his back the dumbest nigger in arkansas for selling a business that did sixty thousand clear a year for sixty thousand then mrs fuller died jake fuller the older boy went off to join the navy and the two daughters emily and suzette moved to st louis with their aunt but old davidson fuller took up the letter duty and wrote sam every week and tried to talk to him to get him to look at the evidence one more time you a fair man sir dont let them do this to my boy he didnt do it davidson even your own nigra people say he did it i have sources i know whats being said in the churches and the cribs dont take my boy from me mr sam i am not taking your boy from you the law is following its course this aint mississippi i gave him a fair trial you had good lawyers the reason he is going where he is going is because he has to pay you had best adjust to that sir i know this is not easy on your family it wasnt easy on shirelles either the balance has to be squared off and restored and we can go on from there tell them i did it if they want a negro to die ill go ill confess take me please please please mr sam dont take my poor little boy sam just looked at him you have too much love in your heart for that boy he finally said hes not worth it he killed an innocent girl there was but one act to be played out and it occurred on october at the arkansas state penitentiary at tucker where theyd removed reggie from the cummins farm when his last appeal was finally denied it was the day of the fourth game of the world series and sam listened to the game that afternoon as he drove the hundredodd miles to tucker just southeast of little rock it was not his first time to make such a trip nor would it be his last on the other hand he didnt make it automatically of the twentythree men he sent to the electric chair he only watched eleven die tonight it was reggies turn simply in terms of convenience it worked out he was able to get a clear signal from little rock and listened numbly to the baseball all the way over warren spahn was on the mound mowing them down sam hated anything with the word yankee in the title just as he hated anything with new york in the title so he lost himself in the baseball hoping the upstart uprooted milwaukee teamreally just the old pitiful boston braveswould triumph sam stayed rooted in the drama the whole way even as the game went into extra innings even as the yankees tied the game in the ninth on ellston howards threerun homer and then scored the goahead run in the top of the tenth goddammit it looked over for the braves but somehow they clawed their way back into the game when logan doubled to left scoring mantilla to tie again and sam had the sense that something very special was about to happen it did shortly thereafter eddie matthewss tworun shot over the rightfield fence braves win sam looked up he was at the prison hed driven straight through town forgotten to eat dinner he doubled back found a diner had roast beef and mashed potatoes eleven pm he pulled into the parking lot of the penitentiary after a nodding acknowledgment from a guard he was known there was no difficulty getting in and getting through the checkpoints until at last with twentysome others he found himself in a little viewing room that opened on the death chamber he recognized a couple of little rock newspaper boys somebody from the governors office the assistant warden and a few others it was an odd group one could listen to the determined banality of the conversation most of it now turning on the great game that afternoon and the braves chances against the pinstriped colossi of gotham with the mighty mantle berra larsen mcdougald and bauer in the chamber a few guards were making lastmoment adjustments the electrician was tightening circuits on the chair a sturdy oak thing that was so well made and severe it could have fit into a baptist church you must feel pret good sam said hank kelly of the arkansas gazette not really said sam you just want it to be over well ill be glad when its over too i mean he is just a nigger and he killed a girl but now they got us believing niggers are human too we had all that trouble with em this summer the goddamned army and everything mark my words its just the beginning sam nodded hank was probably right though old boss harry etheridge was raising hell in the house aligning himself with the dixiecrats and swearing to gut the army appropriation in the upcoming budget to make dwight eisenhower pay for sending the st airborne to little rock and humiliating the great state of arkansas before the nation but everyone knew that boss harry would never do such a thing it was all show for the folks who elected him with percent of the vote every two years none of that had anything to do with tonights drama however which was simply the squalid end of some very squalid business which nobody could really remember except sam and in which nobody had much vested interest and emotion as ceremony it was banal and flat the masons understood ritual much better he pulled away from the milling gents and went up to the glass window where he got a better look at the engine of destruction a chair solid but upon closer inspection much worn somehow institutional and bland for all its presumed meaning sam stared at it as he always did heavy cables ran from behind a screen where the executioner would do his business in private to one leg were bolted to the leg and pinned up the strut of the chair rising to a sort of bakelite nexus smaller wires extended from it two down the front one down each arm and one to lie across the top of the chair which ended not in a wrist or ankle bracelet but a little cap it looked very thirties sam thought assigning to it the style of the decade that had spawned it a phone buzzed the assistant warden picked it up and listened gentlemen please take your seats theyre bringing the condemned man up from death row sam looked at his watch they were late it was am he found a seat as the lights dimmed around him as in the theater people squirmed and made ready then fell silent the minutes ticked by the assistant warden lowered the lights until they sat in darkness and then he too sat in the chamber the door opened two guards followed by the warden followed by a priest followed at last by reggie fuller nineteen of blue eye arkansas negro male pounds eyes brown hair brown though it had all been shaved off reggie was weeping the tears ran down his eyes and his face was puffy and moist a little track of glistening mucus dribbled from a nostril and sam watched as his tongue shot out to lick at it he was manacled walking in little stutter steps talking to himself in a desperate stream of chatter his eyes were out of focus he was still fat prison had not slimmed him down or apparently toughened him up they led poor reggie to the chair and sat him down in it though his body appeared stiff and he had trouble understanding what they were saying to him at last he was seated then came a horrid instant when one of the guards stepped back quickly out of reflex a stain of darkness blossomed at the crotch of reggies prison denims the priest whispered something to reggie but it did him no good at all his face seized up and his eyes closed he continued to mutter madly the guards moved in to secure the boy to the chair one of them applied a slippery saline solution to his bare ankles his wrists and the top of his head where the electrodes were to be tightenedthat would get all the electricity into him and prevent his skin from burning although in sams experience this didnt always work out two others tightened and buckled the straps after the liquid had been sloshed on finally they strapped the little leather beanie atop reggies round shaven head though they got it slightly skewed so that it looked like a dunce cap quickly a little man emerged from behind the screen and checked all the electrodes a last time the sure professional making dead certain that all would work he pointed to one problem area and a guard bent to make an adjustment then the little man stepped back and disappeared sam looked at his watch it was am eight minutes late the warden seemed to be choreographing things he gave a nod and the guards left the room leaving him alone with reggie he gave another nod and apparently a microphone was switched on because he now spoke in a grave voice and his tones were amplified into the witness chamber reginald gerard fuller the state of arkansas in full accordance with the laws thereof finds you guilty of murder in the first degree and sentences you to death this sixth uh seventh day of october reggie gerard fuller do you have any last words it was silent though the mike caught reggies ragged breathing then he took a deep breath and spoke through sobs sir i apologize for wetting myself please dont tell nobody i peed my pants and i am sorry for mr george if i got pee on him as he always done treated me nice he broke down losing his words in a string of choking sobs but then he breathed deeply fighting the anguish a dribble of snot ran out his nose irritating his lips but he could not do a thing he looked out to the men behind the window he took another deep breath and i miss my mama and my daddy and love them very much i didnt kill shirelle god bless all the people who was nice to me and i hope someday somebody be able to tell why this had to happen are you done reggie yes sir i am ready for jesus jesus probably aint ready for him said a man next to sam in the dark the warden leaned over him unsnapping something in the top of the beanie and a blank mask unfurled sealing off reggies features the warden left the chamber reggie sat still in the chair and for a second there was no change sam almost thought thatbut no the first charge hit him from his experiences sam knew it was a cliche of the movies that the lights dim in prison when an electrocution takes place the chair and the prison lighting systems draw their power from separate generators what happens is that witnesses involuntarily flinch for to watch the cold extermination of a man no matter how evil is not an easy thing and in memory they recall the diminution of illumination and ascribe it to a power drain but sam didnt flinch or look away and had no illusion of flickering lights he watched the whole thing because that was his duty he represented shirelle and he hoped that by witnessing he was in some way liberating her soul from the agony of her death reggie stiffened against the restraining straps as two thousand volts hit him the shot lasted over thirty seconds a vein on his neck bulged he fought like a bull his hands seized up into fists which held so tight sam thought theyd explode he seemed to pivot in the chair just a shade as if he were daintily trying to sidestep his fate a small wisp of smoke rose from his skull and another from one of his wrists his head lolled forward but then somehow picked itself up again he coughed and a spasm of vomit mostly liquid spurted out from under the mask to cling in globules to his naked chest huge crescents of perspiration blossomed moonlike under his arms another said the warden into the phone the second surge bucked through reggie but beat him down he was limp by second but the executioner held the circuit closed for another twenty and by the small vibration of reggies now limp fingers could sam tell that he was riding the bolt still but then it ceased the odor of electrification reached sam when the warden two guards and a doctor entered the chamber it wasnt the smell of burned meat or hair but rather connected with sams memories of christmas when hed given various of his boys lionel train sets and usually set them up and ran them for a bit until the kids tired of them but they had an odd metallic odor to them heavy and pungent at once sam flashed back from christmas in the room the doctor took out a stethoscope and pressed its cup to reggies chest bare because the buttons had been ripped off his shirt he stood and shook his head the four retreated so that the executioner could hit reggie again it took five charges before the heart finally stopped beating that boy just didnt want to die said somebody the last official document in the file was the certificate of execution meant to close the file out mark it as justice delivered sam stared at it numbly reggie boy why did you do it it was one of the great mysteries of the human heart why one person will up and kill another sometimes its money sometimes sex sometimes anger sometimes simple meanness sam had studied it for most of his life and didnt know not really in this one it seemed so simple he figured reggie must have picked the girl up after the church meeting and asked her for a kiss she gave him the kiss a young buck a kiss maybe hed had a bit to drink at an oklahoma nigra crib though no evidence as such was ever produced and off he went the more she fought the more he wanted it finally he did it and once he did it he was afraid shed tell so he drove her out route and smashed her over the head with a rock just not noticing she was ripping at his shirt while he was smashing her that simple usually when a negro killed a negro in those days nobody much cared under usual circumstances he would have gotten away with it it just happened to be earls last case and that made it important to white people like himself nothing else the remaining documents in the file were the letters crazy mrs fuller had written him until her death they arrived sometimes three and four a week as the woman fought so desperately for her sons life before a brain aneurysm killed her he had stopped reading them quite early and evidently a forgotten secretary along the linehe could never remember his secretaries nameshad just taken to dumping them unopened in the file fool woman what was the point if she were here and he could remember her name hed yell at her like he did all his secretaries which is why he had so damned many of them over the years most hardly lasted a year sam looked at the letters now they seemed strange to him he was on his knees in his basement looking through an old file why he couldnt remember goddamn it was happening again he looked at the file name parker parker oh yes the girl reggie now it came back earls last case all the letters from reggies mama on their pink stationery but why was one of them on blue stationery hmmmm he plucked it from the stack saw that it was in different handwriting he had no memory of ever seeing it before the date was september he turned it over and looked at the signature lucille parker it took him a second to realize that it was the dead girls mama thirtynine years late he opened the letter at last and started to read so who would have moved your fathers body asked russ stupid question said bob he stood up they were bunked in bobs old trailer on land he still owned seven miles out of blue eye on us abutting black fork mountain in the years since hed left the souvenir hunters had taken their toll and so had the graffiti writers but his keys still opened the padlocks in just a little time theyd restored the place to livability though of course there was no phone and no electricity but a fire kept the water hot and coleman lanterns kept the place lit at night it was a hell of a lot better than camping and a hell of a lot cheaper than staying in the days inn it was dark outside and the drive back from the cemetery was bleak and silent bob wasnt talking hed paid the laborers and the doctor said hed bill him for expenses but not for professional services theyd stopped at a diner and eaten and now they were back why is it stupid russ asked dont they teach you nothing at that fancy university i thought you were supposed to be smart i didnt say i was smart said russ i said i wanted to be a writer different things i guess so you cant ask who until you first find out if and then how who dont have no meaning until you have figured out that there was a who got it well well yourself think about it how could it have happened could the ground have shifted in some way no the earth doesnt work like that i thought you grew up in oklahoma not new york city i did but not on a farm anyway they could have come at night and made an exchange with another body somewhere in the cemetery and russ paused you saw for yourself how hard it was to excavate a body said bob it took three strong men the best part of a morning to uncover one we didnt even get to the moving it would involve block and tackles a hearse or some kind of cart or something then you need the same thing with the other body then you got to patch up all that dirt so nobody would notice couldnt get all that done in a single night too much to do so theyd have to do it in the day under some kind of legal guise but that wouldnt do em no good neither youd have to have lawyers youd have to concoct some kind of legal justification it would end up doing exactly what maybe it was trying to avoid and that is draw a lot of attention to itself russ nodded so what do you do asked bob think son either come up with it or call that princeton place and get back the half million or so your poor dad spent to get you educated he didnt spend a cent said russ oh thats right i forgot your dad was such a bastard anyhow think think i cant it came from nowhere hooray humiliation momentarily avoided the stones they move the gravestones two men could do it in a few hours under the dark of night no problem especially since the original records have long since disappeared and whenever they did it no one was there to give a damn not bad said bob but you are ahead of yourself maybe some night in the sixties a bunch of high school kids got drunk and went gravestone tipping and maybe they was caught and maybe some judge made em replant the stones but they were kids they didnt give two shits so they just stuck em in any which way so what does that leave us fucked said russ yes it does on the other handwell well lookie here russ saw headlight beams sweep across the windows and heard the car engine bob opened the door howdy deputy he called come on in he stepped back and duane peck entered without his sunglasses his eyes were small and dark mr swagger i just wanted to tell you something remember i told you id see about getting the sheriffs records why sure duane you want a cup of coffee russ put some coffee on no no said duane then paused quickly to look around and up and down the room im on duty got some patrol patterns to run i just wanted to say they moved them records over to the courthouse basement thats where most of the municipal records was stored you know it burned down in damn said bob i knew the court records were lost but i was hoping maybe the sheriffs records were different damn im real sorry duane dont you fret on it so far we got pretty much a big zero with the body lost and no cemetery records the whole damn thing is falling apart on us we just may have to hang it up okay i just wanted to tell yall he gave each man a hearty smile then backed out they waited until they heard the car pull out now where were we bob asked you were saying that if it was kids who messed up the tombstones we were screwed on the other hand on the other hand if just for the hell of it we figure someone did this on purpose then dont it follow only two tombstones were exchanged yes and we know the wrong one belonged to a twentyfiveyearold fellow killed in the civil war i got it i got it we try and find recordsin the courthouse dammit burned again no no the historical societyon deaths in polk county during the civil war maybe we can find the names of the young men who fit that category that would cut way down on the possible alternative grave sites but whatexcavate ten or twenty of them i dont but bob was fishing through the familiar manila folder of clippings and soon enough produced the front page of the southwest times record july hero trooper buried it read under a spreading elm on rolling fields filled with trees a group of mourners stood somber people putting a good man into the ground i dont russ said the trees are all gone you couldnt get much out of that picture its just a field the trees are gone but the lands the same look at the rolls in the earth the orientation to the sun the mountains in the distance im betting i can read the land from the photo and pretty much triangulate on that part of the graveyard we link that with a name and bingo youre not thinking of giving up said russ swagger fixed him with the snipers glare not hardly he said duane peck drove away from swaggers then a mile or so down pulled over he snatched the little cellular folder from the glove compartment and pushed a button when the phone beeped he made his report swagger and the kid seem stuck they got nowhere to go cause they couldnt find no body i went over to see em tonight and they were both down in the dumps i think they may be moving out or giving up so far they have nothing also i went over to sam vincents i knocked on the door and he wasnt there so i went around back and looked into his basement goddamn he was sitting there reading some old file couldnt tell what it was but i seen a picture on the floor of some nigger gal i knocked and knocked i yelled i did everything that old goats losing it bigtime wherever he was he sure as hell wasnt on this earth didnt even hear me though i was but ten feet away maybe hes going deaf he hung up and started to drive home but in ten minutes the phone rang he picked it up duane yes sir duane you keep an eye on sam vincent he may be old but hes sharp yes sir you may have to break in and find out what file do you see yes sir said duane bob stood in the sun in the field of the dead around him neat as chiclets in a childs game the gravestones fell away in rows so many dead from so many american wars he took a look at the picture in the light it seemed to fall apart on him hed stopped that morning at a photography shop to inquire about a more useful enlargement but the man pointed out that without the original negative hed simply be enlarging the dots of which the photograph was composed in the old hotmetal rotogravure technology the bigger the photo the bigger and farther apart would be the dots it was at its clearest as it was in the paper russ had a thought about computer enhancement and thought they could fedex it back to oklahoma city where a friend on the staff of the oklahoman might be able to do more with it but bob said no that would take too much time and he wasnt letting it out of his hands so he would make do with what he had so he sent russ to the historical society in search of names that might link up with bobs efforts in the boneyard he turned to the four compass directions hoping to identify the mountain silhouette in the background but it was difficult to make out because only fragments of the line could be seen in the photo and even then he wasnt sure that it was mountain or some imperfection in the photographic process and he didnt want to look too hard at the photo the more he looked at it the more the details disappeared among the dots it was like a magic photo it was only potent in small glimpses to study it was to destroy it he looked up from the picture to the stones martin feamster obrian lotsky kummler kids names lost boys what did it earn what did it matter why a darkness settled over him he could remember still the name of the boys in his first platoon or at least the thirteen out of the twentysix that didnt make it back and the five that lost limbs or the ability to walk and the one that went into the nuthouse and the one who shot himself in the foot that left seven who made it home exactly as theyd gone or some reasonable facsimile thereof those names he could not remember at all he looked about so many of them a starry skyful of them too many of them maybe coming to this place by himself in the middle of the morning was a mistake he yearned to talk to julie or to ykn to someone human and whole and normal get me off this frozen star he thought let me back in the world bensen forbes klusewski obermeyer as he moved his perspective shifted and it seemed almost that the parade of white gravestones was itself moving he thought of old roman armies phalanxes they called them which moved in steady company formations against hordes of savages calm determined believing in the unit concept and the spirit of the legion thats what it felt like moving through phalanxes of the dead who stared at a living man and wanted to know why arent you among us why are you special gunning abramowicz benjamin luftman because i was lucky he answered why did a line come at him it was some poetry thing hed read years back when he tried to understand what a war was and read every goddamn thing on it there was the orient of thick and fast thats what it was too an orient of thick and fast a total world where one damn thing after another happened and maybe you got out and maybe you didnt and not much of it had to do with skill his daddy now maybe there was a man with skill his daddy was a hero his daddy killed the japanese on iwo jima and tarawa and on saipan his daddy must have killed men he himself had killed though the official fiction read so much death their boys and our boys marines and japs marines and gooks or slopes or whatever they called them back then he shuddered so many men who could have had children or written poems or become doctors bergman deems ver coot truely it was a great puzzle he stood and realized that he was on a ridge one of the folds in the land that wasnt really visible until you actually walked it he stood now a little higher and unfolded the photograph and compared what he saw with where he was the site in the photo seemed to be on a ridge too could he make out other ridges behind it all the way to the trees he could not the background was lost in blur as the dots became nonsense he saw that the key had to be the trees now gone for whatever reason his daddy lay under a big tree maybe one hundred yards behind it was another tree and that smudge in the dots was that a tree if so that meant three trees in a rough line headingin which direction couldnt say hey boys help me help the one among you who should have been with you help him but the dead were silent feeling lost and a complete failure he took another step to leave the ridge and find another when in his far peripheral vision some anomaly registered he turned to track it down and saw nothing he turned back moving and again there came a signal from his subconscious that something should be noted were the dead speaking in some odd way come on boys tell me give me your message no nothing only silence far off the sound of a power mower above a jet glinting high in the sky a commercial job leaving a fat contrail a white car in the distance duane pecks of course keeping watch duane who are you working for someday soon we may have to have a discussion with you he turned again another strangeness assailed him he tried to sift through it what was he feeling or noticing it seemed only to come when he moved and in his peripheral as if in focusing on it it went away he set out to duplicate the phenomenon he stepped turning trying to keep his eyes focused straight ahead and his mind emptied nothing did it again nothing felt like an idiot did it the third time now he had it far off in the orthodox line of gravestones was a gap no not a gap an irregularity one stone was slightly out of line why would that be he sighted on it and walked it was yards away mason mason whats your goddamned problem you a fuckup mason you a mamas boy you think the rules dont ever apply to you thats how a sergeant would talk to a man out of formation why are you buried about a foot to the right of shidlovsky and donohue isnt murphy pissed you moving in on his territory was it a mistake or a tree it was gone now but when poor mason went into the earth back in with a spanish mauser bullet in his heart a giant tree must have been right here on this spot and so they made a slight adjustment later the tree died but mason stayed out of whack until eternity bob took the picture out if he looked hard he could force himself to believe that if this was the spot for the tree and since this spot was quite close to the boundary of the cemetery then maybe this was the third tree in the line he looked again at the picture what time of day was the picture taken he ransacked through forty long years of memories putting aside much that was not pleasant and a little that was and at last he remembered a formidable presence named miss connie rushing him through breakfast and dressing him because his mother kept breaking down that put the funeral in the morning before noon in any case figuring then that the photographer would have moved until the sun was behind him and that it would have been reasonably low bob guessed that the photographer was facing west his back to the east so if this was the last tree then the other two in the rough line would be to the east he orientated himself that way and saw only crosses but he took off his blue denim shirt and draped it on mason he didnt think mason would mind then he turned to the east and began to walk the line he found the second gap fifty yards beyond and rushed ahead but where the first one should be according to his reading of the photo he found nothing except a damned sidewalk that led to a little park of what appeared to be abstract statuary a little bit farther out the rows were nice and even he looked uncomprehending how such a huge tree had there been one wouldnt have thrown the lines of graves out of whack what the hell was wrong he looked more carefully at the picture sidewalk he thought where the hell is it going he found it walked to the little garden some confederate thing no dammit vietnam the county had erected a little memento mori to the boys of nam a plaque inscribed with words like honor and duty and sacrifice and of course the names he looked then looked away he knew harrison and marlow he knew jefferson too though jefferson was black jefferson was aircav right a brother of the black horse what about simpson straightleg grunt draft bait caught a booby when he was down to days until deros the towns favorite hardluck story now bobs head ached and he couldnt deal with the problem anymore he turned to leave and as if in giving up he got it the tree comes down for whatever reason but it was so imposing that its very presence had intimidated the gravediggers so theyd never gotten near to it and when it came down thats where they build their garden to the vietnam war dead and thats where they build the sidewalk so that would make his dads now hidden grave somewhere along the sidewalk probably to the right of it he thought it made sense too if some guys were exchanging gravestones that probably weighed two hundred to three hundred pounds apiece late at night theyd need a wheelbarrow or cart and the sidewalk would be helpful he walked a bit until he reached a halfway point and then just turned west he saw nothing then moved up and back and at last up a bit more he was on a ridge he could see two gaps in the line before him to the west one of the tombstones by the farthest gap the blue of his shirt hey he turned it was russ those old records were miserable but i got at least thirteen names man its amazing the records that place keeps bob looked to his immediate right i bet one of them says jacob finley russ dug out his paper looked them over and then said yeah jacob finley fifth arkansas light infantry bob looked at the grave marker limestone corrupted by the passage of time untended leaning ever so slightly to the right he knelt and put a hand on the cold stone hello old man he thought ive come its time this time it was easy they went back to the county coroners and refiled the exhumation papers for poor jacob finley according to them bobs longlost cousin no lies had to be told regarding the reasons for changing the request because the first paperwork already in order nobody in the coroners office particularly cared sam wasnt even necessary a few phone calls later and all the mechanisms of the day before were reinstalled mr coggins and his two boys were luckier this time the grave site being accessible off that helpful sidewalk was now approachable by backhoe and mr coggins was an expert with the machine in less than an hour he excavated the coffin and just as the machine uncovered the box dr phillips showed up how did you find him he asked bob explained well maybe youre right and maybe not he went and looked as the quickly erected tackle drew the box from the ground i will say this thats a metal casket circa the fifties do you remember the funeral home bob said no and then a name shot into his memory like a flare out of the void devilins he said yep said the doctor and your fathers name was earl swagger yes sir thats what it says here thats him okay boys load it into the hearse and well be off it didnt take a long time at the mortuary bob and russ waited outside while a funeral procession formed up in one of the viewing rooms and people filed out to cars the hearse that took earl to the mortuary took some other poor joker back to the boneyard a half an hour later i feel soaked in death said russ presently the doctor came out they went over to a little shady remembrance garden tastefully sculpted into the earth near the funeral home beautiful day late in the afternoon the sun was just setting i can put this in writing for you but itll take a day he said lighting a cigarette writings not necessary the boyll take notes fine first of all then i found the physical remains of a man in his midforties in a state of some advanced decomposition what that means is that little tissue remains which in turn means that some pathological determinations are impossible bullet tracks for example we cant tell which directions the bullets went through the body and what damage they did to softtissue elements like organs and the central nervous or respiratory system damn said bob speak to me daddy he thought this is your only chance but the doctor continued the skeletal remains were in good shape and the marks of the wounds were recorded there yes said bob go on i initially noticed two wounds the first was on the leftside ulna the outermost bone of the forearm just down from the thickness of bone we call the olecranon an inch or so beneath the elbow i could tell from impact beveling that a bullet struck and shattered that bone there was a traumatic ovoid indentation visible on some of the fracture segments this is characteristic of a highvelocity solidpoint bullet delivered at close range thirtyeight super a jacketed super would get the job done nicely yes the bones were in such fragmented disarray that pending further lengthy examination i couldnt rearrange them to get a caliber reading on the damage not necessary said bob the second wound resembled the first the same shattered bone the same fragment presence the same ovoid groove in some of the pieces again characteristic of a smallercaliber highspeed bullet this was observed at the frontal curve of the third rib of the lefthand side of the cadaver bob mulled this over could he move hit like that if he wanted to both wounds were survivable he finally asked well thats a subjective judgment dependent upon the subjects viability given that your father was in extremely robust health that hed been hit before and understood that getting hit didnt automatically equate to death and given that he stanched his blood flow and that help arrived within a few hours and given that there were no serious softtissue wounds not registered in the skeletal system then yes my judgment is that those two wounds were survivable but there was a third wound go on bob said i missed it at first said the doctor some tissue remains were present and the condition of the bones was not pristine of course im not in my lab working under the best conditions but you found something yes finally i did in the sternum a frontal plate of bone that shields the heart and anchors the ribs theres a very neat round hole or almost round ovoid actually suggestive of a downward angle that is a high to low shooting trajectory theres impact beveling suggestive of an entry wound if you extrapolate from the placement of the penetration of the sternum on that angle you get a real solid heart shot the bullet path leads straight into the right ventricle where the pulmonary artery pulls the deoxygenated blood in that artery and the ventricle would have been instantaneously destroyed brain death would have followed in say ten to twelve seconds so he couldnt have been shot in the heart and walked three hundred feet back to where he was found he couldnt have moved a step i doubt he was conscious much more than three seconds after impact bob nodded and turned to russ so hows goddamn jimmy pye hit him a hundred yards out in the corn and he walks all the way back to the car russ just looked at him you measured the hole i take it bob asked the doctor yes i did im guessing it wasnt or right it was what inches good actually as i understand it the impact beveling always widens the diameter by a couple of thousandths of an inch typically said the doctor so the bullet that killed my father it was say in diameter that would make it a caliber rifle bullet thats what every indicator says the doctor replied i dont get it said russ whats all this with the numbers it tells me who killed my father bob said turning to look at him it sure as hell wasnt no jimmy pye who killed your father asked russ a sniper said bob the snake rattled again in the corn the arm hurt the side had gone to sleep the legs ached earl sitting sideways in the front seat of his cruiser straightened his legs out before him he was all right he would make it a little smile came to him if that goddamn snake dont bite me i made it again his radio crackled car one four this is blue eye sheriffs department earl you hang on goddammit we are inbound and closing fast and i have an ambulance a minute or so behind you hang on son we are almost home there was always that moment in the islands when it finally occurred to you that you had somehow made it again it was like a little window opening and a gust of sweet air floating through the room and you experienced the simple physical pleasure in having escaped extinction other things would come later the guilt you always felt when you thought of the good men lost forever the endless dream replays where the bullets that missed you hit you or your own weapon jammed or ran dry but for now it was okay it was something god gave to infantrymen just a moments worth of bliss between the total stress of battle and the dark anguish of survivors guilt you just got one moment hey i made it earl thought of the things he had to do he made a list take bob lee to that football game the boy had never been he himself hadnt been since on a visit to chicago when hed seen the bears play the rams it was a lopsided game he wanted bob lee to see a good game buy a remington rifle model a the new autoloader in hed read about it in field stream said they were building them even more accurate than the winchester model s and you had that second and third shot automatically without a recock kiss his wife tell her how much he liked her strawberry pie buy her a present the woman needed a present hell buy her two presents face it out with edie it had to be dealt with do it put your house in order clean up your mess see sam vincent a policeman had to have a will sam could recommend a lawyer get a will figure it all out but at an odd thing occurred it seemed like time stopped for a second and earls soul flew out of his body he imagined himself floating through space he watched from above as the black arkansas woods and hills flew by in the distance beyond board camp he saw a welllit little house off by itself he descended and flew through the window his wife june was there she was doing something in the kitchen she was dutiful erect a little irritable in an apron looking tired as usual and not saying much he floated up to her and touched her cheek but his finger had no substance and sank through her he stroked at her harder but could make no contact puzzled he flew up the steps bob lee sat in his room trying to put together a revell model airplane it was a bell p airacobra very dangerouslooking but earl knew the pilots hated it and that it never flew after bob lee still wearing that damned coonskin cap and that crockett tshirt was bent earnestly into the effort trying with clumsy boyish fingers to cement the clear plastic cockpit bubble to the cockpit frame a tricky operation because too much cement could smear the transparency of the ersatz glass ruining the entire illusion of reality usually earl did this job himself though the boy glued the bigger pieces together and was getting better and better at it earl reached to help the boy but again his fingers were weightless they touched nothing bob lee he called bob lee bob lee bob lee but bob lee didnt hear him and struggled with the cockpit and somehow got it mounted earl watched as his boys face knitted in disappointment and fury and he beat a single tear away but earl knew too the model was ruined he ached now to take the boy into his arms and say now thats all right maybe you didnt do so good this time but therell be other times but when he reached he touched nothing stop vomiting blood the blood was everywhere what was happening it spread across his chest and poured from his absolute center when had this happened it must have occurred in that split second when earl went out of his body it occurred to him that he had been shot and he looked out into the goddamned darkness and heard only the hooting of the owls and the stirring of other animals it was so dark he had the consciousness of it all slipping away he thought of a drain of being whirled down a drain his mind grew logy and stupid he yearned to see his son again and his wife and his father he yearned but it did no good red was at an executive meeting for redline trucking when the call came and he was almost happy because thewell blackwell ii of blackwell collins bisbee over from little rock was halfway through his briefing on potential complications if interstate commerce regulatory bill h got out of the house interstate commerce committee without serious reconfiguration namely that the requirement for weight inspections at interstate borders be open on weekends as well as during the week which had a longterm downsizing application in terms of routes serviced for outofstate clients it was all very interesting but thewell was hardly the worlds most commanding speaker arid somewhere in paragraph subsection ii subpoint c red began trying to decide whether he should go to a no shot for the long floater at cherokee ridge where next years nationals were slated the buzz against his hip shook him from his reverie he leaned over to brad pauley his vicepresident for legal affairs and liaison with blackwell collins bisbee and whispered be back in a sec brad nodded and red smiled tightly and slipped out of the meeting walking through the quiet hush of the suite that everyone assumed was the hub of his empire he knew the name of everyone and everyone knew his name and as he moved toward the executive washroom just outside his fabulous corner office he nodded and exchanged pleasantries with his employees but at last he was alone and punched in the number on his folder uh sir uh i dont know what this means the dull voice of duane peck spy and idiot reported but um i found out early this morning that bob and that kid done reapplied for a motion of exhumation i got to the cemetery and found out that they removed the body they wanted and it went to devilin mortuary they had that doctor come on down from fayetteville to look at it dont know what he told them but he told them something i dont rightly know where they went i drove by bobs place just a few minutes ago but it was deserted though the truck was there maybe they was out in the woods out back or something so anyway thats what it is ill spin on by the old mans place later and see whats going on red didnt curse or stomp or do anything demonstrative he was too disciplined and professional for such exhibitionism but now he knew he had a serious problem and it must be dealt with swiftly or the time would pass when it could be dealt with at all his first call was back to duane yes sir where are you uh ise headed back to town all right i want you to back off from swagger and the boy youll have no more business with them for now yes sir said duane someone else will deal with them now you concentrate on the old man i have to know what hes up to you find that out do you understand but you have to do it easily you cant carry on like a goddamn hog with a corncob up its ass yes sir said duane ill be gittin right on it red disconnected he didnt like what came next this business was tricky and always involved the immutable law of unintended consequences but thank god hed thought ahead and had good people in place and it could be done neatly and professionally with maximized chances of success he thought his father would be proud for this was an old ray bama trick avoid violence avoid force always negotiate but when violence is unavoidable strike fast unexpectedly and with total commitment and willpower he dialed a number a man answered yeah do you know who this is yes sir the voice had a familiar spanish accent to it cuban probably the team is ready the guys are all in its a good team steady guys been around solid tough know their stuff some are i dont want names or details but it has to be done you do it ill get you the intelligence the routes and you clear everything through this number when youre ready to move you let me know ill want a look at the plan ill want onsite reports no slipups youre being paid too much all of you for slipups there wont be no slipups the man said the man on the other end of the phone in a farmhouse just outside greenwood in far sebastian county let the dial tone come up and then he consulted a card and began to dial pager numbers nine pagers rang two one right after another went off at the blood sweat and tears gymnasium on griffin park road in fort smith where two immense men with necks the size of lampshades were hoisting what appeared to be tons of dead weight at separate nautilus stations each was olive in skin tone with glistening black hair and dark deep watchful eyes identical even to the tattoos that festooned their gigantic arms though one had a crescent of puckered bruisepurple scar tissue that ran halfway around his neck evidence of some grotesque encounter about which it would probably be better not to ask they had bodies of truly immense mass not the beautifully proportioned narcissistic sculptured flesh of bodybuilders but the huge densely muscled bodies of men who needed strength professionally like interior linemen or new orleans mob drug enforcers and hit men another pager rang in the back room of a crib just across the state line in sequoyah county oklahoma where a sleek black man was enjoying an act of oral sex being committed on him by a blondhaired woman of about thirty he knew that she was really a man but he didnt care a mouth was a mouth another pager buzzed on the firing line at on target indoor firearms range over in van buren as its owner stood with a customized paraordnance p in sw calm and steady as a rock blowing an everwidening tattery hole in the head of a b silhouette hanging from a pulleymounted wire twentyfive yards out he finished the sixteenround clip pulled in the target and examined the orifice hed opened then he smiled returned the gun to its case and checked out in the parking lot he made a show of putting the case in the trunk but adeptly slid the into an alessi insidethepants holster after of course inserting a fresh sixteenround clip and cocking and locking other sites ben jackies harleydavidson shop on south where a huge man in black leather and the lush hair of a rock singer drawn into a ponytail contemplated a chromeplated extended muffler the central mall trio theaters on rogers avenue where two rangy men who could have been ballplayers but werent sat watching an extremely violent but idiotic movie nicks chicken shack on route where a large piefaced black man with a great many rings and necklaces ate a second extraspicy breast and finally at the vietnam market on rogers where a snakethin asian also with a ponytail and a webbing of tattoos that ran from his neck down one arm and scared the hell out of the proprietors was trying to decide between diced mushroom and dried asparagus for the threecolor vegetable salad he was contemplating for that night he was a vegetarian the

him up very professional like we are the fucking fbi we get him and his pal on a goddamned country road and then its world war iii well show this cabrón something about shooting now it was his turn to dig he looked around making certain yes yes this was it the fallen loblolly over there snarled in moss that was the first marker the gray chunk of rock ten feet away was the second he remembered it well though it seemed to have worn over the years standing where he could see a notch in the high ridgeline of black fork mountain through a gap in the pines was the third triangulating between the three he knew this was the spot bob set himself and with the same sure spade strokes that he had seen liberate the coffin that was not his father but some poor young man he attacked the earth it fought him but he was in a mood for a fight the spade sliced and cut into the earth and lifted it he began to sweat as he found a rhythm and beside him a pile of dirt grew it was still early hed arisen before dawn while the boy slept and headed up this trail a mile from his trailer he used to walk it all the time with the dog mike but mike was gone now so bob was alone with the spade and the earth as the sun rose it sent slats of light through the shortleaf pines and they caught the dust that his efforts raised enough to make a man cough he worked on taking pleasure in the power of his movements it wasnt a coffin he uncovered it was a plastic tube nearly a foot in diameter nearly four in length pulling it from the ground at last he felt its considerable weight even as its contents shifted a bit but that was fine he got it out on the ground and stood for a moment breathing heavily all around him it was quiet his actions had scared the birds no animals came around and it was too cool yet for bugs he wiped his brow with his handkerchief then he put his boot on the cylinder to hold it steady and thrust the sharp blade of the spade against the cap of the cylinder punching at the loctite bonds that sealed the capsule until at last they gave with his hands he pulled the cap entirely off then reoriented the cylinder so that he could get at its contents easier and began to empty it first came a doskosil gun case he opened it flipped away the envelope of desiccant and took out a colt commander dead black with novak sights and a beavertailgrip safety he pinched back the slide to reveal the brass of a federal hydrashock eight more rested in the magazine it settled into his hand almost nesting he hadnt touched a gun in years thought he was done with guns but in his hand the gun felt smooth and familiar knowing almost it fit so well that was the goddamned thing about them they fit so well he cocked the hammer and locked the safety up cocked and locked was the only way to go somewhere in here there was a holster too and a couple of more magazines but for now he only wedged the pistol mexican style into the belt above his right kidney what came out next was a longer gun case and when he got it out and opened he saw a ruger mini a kind of shrunken version of the old m almost delicatelooking light and handy he seized the weapon threw the bolt and clicked the trigger against an empty chamber it was a carbinestyle semiauto capable of firing a mm cartridge that could chew through metal or men depending it looked fine too though oily after three years underground the film of oil and the packs of desiccant strewn about the tube had done their job he pulled out a last trophy a canvas sack and looked inside four mini magazines one of them an oversize fortyrounder the galco holster for the commander six boxes of federal hydrashocks five boxes of hardball mm and five boxes of m tracer he sat back then turned whynt you come on down and fill in this hole for me he called silence russ you dont know enough how to move through the woods quietly come on out the boy came out sheepishly i saw you go i followed you i heard the sounds of your digging you shouldnt sneak around on an armed man you werent armed when you left well i am now what the hell is going on you have to tell me you owe me what is going on is i want you to go home this thing may get hairy i was meaning to speak to you on it yesterday i realized i should have realized earlier bob im not going this was my idea from the beginning i have to stay i dont want to have to call your father and say i got your boy killed for nothing it doesnt matter about my father your mother then it would kill her shes been killed before bob said nothing russ came over and started shoveling the dirt into the hole im not giving you a gun bob said i dont have time to train you and i wont be around an untrained man if theres shooting boy you just hit the deck and pray for the best i will well well see how it goes im sending you home at the first sign of heavy weather this aint a picnic ask your father hell tell you its about as goddamned scary as it gets now lets move out you carry the ammo its the heaviest they walked down the path it was a fine morning with the sun now up and blazing through the pines between the shafts russ could see the green heights of the ouachitas dominating the horizon it was a quality of his mind that he was highly ironyconscious thus it provoked him that the scene was so innocent and sylvan such an emeraldgreen panorama of natural goodness and here he was walking with a heavily armed and very dangerous man setting off on a mission that this man suddenly thought could end in violence he shook his head he was a writer what was he doing here something funny bob asked its just ridiculous said russ whatever it is it aint ridiculous said bob it may be dirty it may be ugly it may be evil it aint ridiculous and the people who put it together aint funny theyre professionals the sniper who killed your father hes just a little piece of it hes working for someone else someone called the shot someone laid it out someone put it together very tight and solid how do you even know there was a sniper russ finally asked it started with the bullet weights said bob darkly as though he hated to explain to an idiot they recovered three bullets from my father two were grains one was grains the grainers were clearly from jimmys super but the its possible a third grainer hit him and broke apart and only grains worth was recovered but the goddamned list didnt say nothing about that so that gets me thinking where the hell does a grain bullet come from and what is a grain bullet do you know no your father would fuck him its a carbine bullet m carbine handy little job they used in world war ii underpowered but sweethandling okay so what would the significance of that be ill tell you when im ready the next thing was the grocery store job forget why dont worry about why just look at the job too clever the right grocery store the right time of day very professional jimmy was a smallpotatoes car thief howd he figure on that so quickly russ said nothing then the getaway even you got that one howd they get sixty miles south through all them roadblocks you could write it off to luck i suppose unless you looked at it carefully they had a lot of other luck that day too howd they get so damned lucky on the other hand it wouldnt be a thing to load that car in a semi and haul it down here youd sail through trucks sail through all the time russ said nothing the super its a pros gun a criminals gun its a mankiller bank boys love them mob hitters that kind of thing seems very goddamned odd the best manshooter in the world just happens to show up in jimmy pyes hands the day he gits out of jail russ nodded then the shooting site bob said im a professional shooter i kill people for a living or at least i did and if im setting up a shot thats how id do it you have to be high because the corn gets in the way of a level shot hes in the trees maybe a hundred yards away in a stand his job is to watch the setup is to have jimmy pye kill my father with the super but whoevers pulling the strings he has to worry if jimmys quite the man for the job and jimmy wasnt so there has to be another guy there just in case shooting slightly downhill at a sitting target on a windless night it was an easy shot said bob it was at night it was at night shouted russ could he see in the dark yes he could said bob thats why he was using the carbine and not a ballistically better weapon remember the rattlesnake the snake why did this strike a note of familiarity with russ who had spoken of snakes but then yes he remembered the old man had mentioned somebody named mac jimson shooting a snake on the road he said hed never seen anything like it snakes are coldblooded night hunters but they have some advantages bob explained theyre sensitive to heat thats how they hunt theyre sensitive to infrared radiation in other words i dont infrared bob said black light russ swallowed infrared black light infra is light below the visible spectrum the light of heat it has certain military applications if you radiate heat you radiate light in that wavelength and you have an electronic device that can amplify it you can see in the dark or you can put out a beam in that wavelength and you can see it in such a device ours was called the m sniperscope pretty much stateoftheart in it was a scope and an infrared spotlight mounted on a carbine worked best on clear dark nights he puts out a beam he watches my daddy in that beam my daddy never knows a thing one shot only the snake knew it felt the heat it has pit organs in its skin heat receptors and when the light came onto it it stirred rattled then it did what a hunter would do it went toward the source of the infrared thats why it crossed the road no matter all the cops it was hunting the sniper but you cant know said russ its all abstract theory theres no real proof yes there is said bob the bullet hole in my fathers chest it was of an inch which is the diameter with impact beveling that an ml carbine bullet would make jimmy had a super its diameter would be a little more than bub had a special which hadnt been fired my father was killed in the dead of night by a carbine bullet jesus said russ you see the whole thing was about killing my father i dont know why my father must have known something but theres nothing in his behavior that last week to suggest anything unusual was going on but these guys maneuvered very cleverly stop and think they investigated earl and found his weakness his soft heart for a white trashy punk named jimmy pye they got to jimmy in jail made him some kind of offer so good he had to take it and sell out everything he had they set up a grocery store job guaranteed to make jimmy famous even to the little bit about him stopping for a hamburger they moved him downstate he got in contact with daddy to surrender they had access to a stateoftheart piece of hardware and a military shooter who knew what the hell he was doing just in case thorough professional very well thought out all contingencies covered all to kill one little state trooper sergeant in rural arkansas in a way that would appear to be openandshut put the body in the grave say the prayers and walk away from it russ said and its still going on the exchanged headstones duane peck yes it is he nodded only the snake knew repeated bob it was hunting the sniper now i am it came down to a telephone there was no telephone at bobs trailer so after he and russ ate and changed and bob locked the ruger and its ammunition in the tufbox bolted across the back of his truck they got in and headed not into town but to the days inn where bob rented a roomfor its phone and its privacy jorge leading a convoy of hitters got to bobs trailer forty minutes after they left the truck was not in sight goddamn he said he went back to the men in his unit he left one man in the trees across from the trailer with a pair of binoculars and a phone he assigned the remaining vehicles to begin to patrol on preselected routes in blue eye and greater polk county in search of the truck a green dodge one unpainted fender arizona plates sch the instructions were simple they werent to make contact or even follow instead they were to phone in jorge himself with telephone consultations with the boss would try and determine where bob was headed the idea was to set the ambush well in advance and spring it with the whole team in the coordinated way they had agreed upon unawares bob started his hunt with a call to the pentagon department of the army archives division sergeant major norman jenks jenks say norman bob lee you old coot what the hell you still kicking around i seem to be the old sergeant whod first met on bobs second tour when he led recons up near cambodia while assigned to sog and jenks had been s staff chatted for a bit in the profane language of retired senior ncos but eventually bob got to it need a favor name it coot if i can do it ill do it im too old for them to do anything to me now and too topheavy sergeantspeak for having won too many combat decorations yeah well said jenks go ahead pard shoot you remember you guys had a gadget called a goddamned set no m volt that piece of shit my first tour the arvns were using em they were old then and they was supposed to be fungusproofed but whoever said they was never saw the fungus in nam that shitd eat you for lunch yeah it was old by the sixties it was really world war ii vintage based on some piece of german gear an oss team brought back after the war as i recall well anyway im looking at the year suppose a fellow had a need to use a nightvision setup in and he was in west arkansas howd he get a hold of one whered they be were they issued widely to troops would they have been say up at campbell with the st airborne would they have been at bragg with the nd or maybe they were up at that ballistics development lab in rhode island im just trying to get a feel for how common they was and how close to west arkansas and who was their expert who advocated them who trained on them and knew them my feeling is you couldnt become proficient without training you couldnt it was like looking into an aquarium the gooks never did figure it out anyhow when do you need this by if it came yesterday id be late damn bob what the hell this all about its a deal im working on with a writer oh a book itll be a bestseller i can guarantee you you gonna tell him about an loc i might okay i got a light schedule today and a newbie spec just assigned ill get this boy right on it number bob gave him the number you hang tight ill see what we can dig up he hung up now what said russ bob opened his wallet and peeled out i want you to take the truck and head up one exit on the etheridge parkway thats the y city exit i seem to recall a camping store up there you go up there and buy two sleeping bags a coleman lantern some coleman fuel some changes of underwear toothbrushes the works remember the fuel the damn lantern dont work without it were not going back to my trailer for a spell what are you talking about its good to change your base of operations every once in a while we been at the trailer a week well move somewhere else for a couple of days or so but i had a sleeping bag at the trailer i had underwear i had now dont get yourself lathered up man you start to squeal like a pup every goddamned time well leave that stuff there if anybody like a mr duane peck takes a look hell see it and figure were due back at any time got it you are paranoid said russ parawhat never mind russ left bob lay back and rested he gave russ time to drive off then left the room and went down the hall to the pay phone and called his wife collect well hello well howdy stranger said julie thought youd married a movie star and headed for california not this boy no sir ah ahi know that tone youre about to tell me something i dont want to hear sweetie its nothing it just is going to take a bit longer than i thought maybe another week or two are you having a good time its been interesting i went to his grave i had a moment with him we been going through records its very educational saw sam that sort of thing how is he old older i dont know he goes a little strange now and then im worried about him were all older hows my baby girl shes fine misses her daddy ill be home as soon as possible youre not in any trouble are you nothing i cant handle you love trouble thats your problem bob bought a coke and the little rock paper and went back to the room about two oclock the phone rang hello downfilled or polyester huh do you want downfilled or just simple polyester for the sleeping bags maybe its too warm for the downfilled incidentally i had to go all the way to booneville that camp store was closed polyester is fine and a cooler fair enough gotcha he hung up to more silence in the room and the minutes ticked by at last the phone rang it was about hello bob it was sergeant major jenks yes sir all right i got some info for you you guessed right pretty much about the ms at no one time did the army have on its toe more than two thousand of those units they was damned expensive they was hard to operate and they was delicate so distribution was mainly to elite units they never handed em out to the troops at the company or platoon level hell you couldnt even buy one at the px dispersion was mainly to special forces units in europe to the big airborne divisions at brigade or regimental s level to th army in washington state and the rd mountain division up in alaska the heaviest profusion of them was to th and rd infantry on the dmz at the th parallel in korea another complement went to the jungle warfare school in panama just what youd expect damn bob thought okay fine norman i wait a sec aint done yet dont this beat all according to our records three such units were transshipped from the panama zone the jungle warfare school to camp chaffee arkansas in late june of bob waited a second what for well one of the problems with the goddamned things was simple no doctrine they were not effectively used in korea because nobody had thought much about the best methods of deployment and there was thought about junking the things altogether then a brilliant young first lieutenant wrote a paper on nightvision tactical doctrine which he submitted to the infantry journal where it got published and he got noticed so he finds himself tdy camp chaffee where hes put in charge of what theyre calling the experimental night tactical development program codenamed black light where they run a lot of nightfire operations trying to figure out the best way to deploy the thing while also working with ways to refine it they got some rd types they got some intel boys maybe even some agency boys in it it sounds like a black operation the technology would be useful for a hell of lot more people than company commanders with perimeters to defend you got that right give me a name norman i thought youd ask for one said jenks and i got a hell of a name for you preece preece said bob yep thats where the whole army nightsniping program began with black light and first lieutenant later major and now brigadier general james f preece retired jack preece bob nodded the name took him way back tigercat tigercat thats the one and same guy you got an address for the general i went to the computer for you bob you never heard this from me which is why i am calling from a pay phone in arlington fair enough hes now ceo and director of research for an outfit called jfp technology inc in oklahoma city whats jfp technology one of those small unmarked buildings thats really skunkworks for nasty toys their specialty is sound suppressors and nightvision equipment for the worlds armies and swat teams our delta guys use their stuff and so do the seals thats what tigercat gets you in the civilian world norman gave him the number thanks norman said bob then hung up he waited a second letting his head clear tigercat was the code name for the th division sniper school in vietnam where the army ran its snipers through and taught them the doctrine of course there was a problem army doctrine was different than marine doctrine not worse not better just different and it worked or at least the kills said it did army snipers ran up far higher numbers in vietnam than marines did so was it an interservice thing the fact that there was not a lot of love lost between sniper communities in the two services either then or now maybe maybe not bob didnt know what he did know was that preeces tigercat turned out a number of firstclass shooters very quickly and in no little time the army snipers were putting bodies in bags all over nam yet even the army was a little awkward about this triumph its huge and efficient pr machine never made a thing of it no books came out of it none of its high scorers ever became known to the public as had he and carl hitchcock it was well it was different the door opened and russ walked in you want me to unload the truck just a minute said bob now you listen to me he dialed the number as russ sat across from him after a bit the phone was answered by a young woman jfp technology she said yes hello im calling for general preece may i ask whos calling yes my name is gunnery sergeant bob lee swagger usmc retired i was familiar with the generals operations in vietnam he might be familiar with mine the phone went dead for a bit and then gunnery sergeant swagger yes sir it is by god as i live and die the real live bob the nailer i never thought id have the pleasure you did a hell of a job of work in country thank you sir just the job the corps gave me you may not realize this but do you remember when you won the wimbledon cup in after your second tour yes sir i do well i came in third my god yes sir you had it that day sergeant nothing threw you not the wind or the sun or the mirage you shot through everything thats our good marine corps training sir sergeant you dont sir me all right im retired now all thats behind us whats on your mind well sir ive signed up to do a damned book i was there that sort of thing thatll be a hell of a book i cant wait to read that one the things i heard about the an loc valley hell of a fight said bob anyhow im working with a young writer and hes got me convinced we ought to do what he calls context you know background the big picture how it all fits together so i thought id have to describe the marine sniper program in those days and he wanted to look at the whole damned thing army sniping too give it the grand overview he says well sir i thought youd be the man to talk to gunny you know a lot of that is still classified and the army never went public with its snipers in the way the corps did too damn liberal in washington i suppose yes sir off the record hell yes maybe you could just point us in the right direction you in town im actually home in arkansas eight hours away maybe could drive up tonight get here tomorrow morning let me see hell i have a meeting with sales oh fuck ill shift it jean call sales tell them well have the meeting tomorrow afternoon thats it said bob the general gave him an address see you tomorrow bob hung up lets go now i aint getting any younger some nights it was good and other nights it was beyond good into some kind of great tonight was great when he was done and when she had given him the ritual compliments he rolled over and went downstairs the huge house on cliff drive was more or less quiet except for the shiftings of his sleeping children the light snapped off and she went to sleep he poured himself a glass of jim beam walked out on the patio and saw far below the winking runway lights of the airfield he took a sip of the whiskey and enjoyed for just a second the illusion that everything was fine in his empire then the beeper in his bathrobe pocket began to vibrate red checked the number and saw that it wasnt goddamned duane peck at all but instead the number of jorge de la riveras phone quickly he dialed so sir aint got nothing goddamn been up down and around this place left a man at his trailer just picked him up aint seen nothing all day maybe they gone red thought a bit you want us to book time in a hotel sir no no that would look odd ten men in three cars and a truck pulling into a holiday inn all at once no head back up here get back to the farmhouse what by the parkway thats only an hour yes sir we hunt again tomorrow ah lets wait on that get em some good sleep no fucking around when we need em well need em fresh and fast yes sir red waited a second then called duane pecks number hello who is who do you think this is yes sir where are you im outside the old mans house just like you said he did the craziest things today i swear this old mans lost it he make a report after im off the phone listen duane tomorrow first thing you go in uniform to every motel every restaurant every gas station every camp store there around blue eye and you see if anyones seen swagger and the boy theyve disappeared we have to find them fast yes sir instead of the old man for now yes then you call me you get something you call me immediately you understand yes sir red hung up finished the bourbon and went to bed in a foul mood sam woke in a fury but he couldnt remember about what his anger unmoored floated about blackly in his mind looking for a target mabel he screamed wheres my goddamned coffee then he remembered that mabel had been his secretary in for seven months before she quit and went off to have a nice quiet nervous breakdown he thought shed died sometime in the eighties but he wasnt sure mabels untimely death did however mean one thing no coffee so he got up struggled to find his glassesnope they hadnt taken them yetand straggled through the house until he found the kitchen somehow he got some coffee going some things a man never forgets the coffee perking he bumbled back to his room got himself showered and dressed though he had to wear a white sock and a blue sock and headed back for the coffee fortunately the mail had come unfortunately it was from he struggled to put two and two together for a while unable to comprehend why this letter was lying out here on the dining room table blue in neat precise womanly penmanship he looked at the signature lucille parker who the hell was lucille parker then of course he had it it blasted into his mind goddamn woman he bellowed goddamned woman he grabbed his car keys there on the vestibule right next to his meerschaum pipe and his sunglasses and his meerschaum pipe where the hell did that come from anyhow he grabbed it and raced out to his cadillac in the garage he fired her up and backed out evidently his neighbors had mischievously placed their garbage cans in his driveway for there came a clatter and he looked up in his rearview mirror to see them rolling in the street spewing their contents everywhere why would they do such a stupid thing he drove toward niggertown west blue eye it was now called you couldnt say nigger anymore you couldnt even say nigra it wasnt allowed the streets seemed to fill people were staring at him and he wasnt sure why he felt like the queen of the may on some float in a parade horns were honking children screaming what the hell was going on suddenly a patrol car its siren blaring its flasher pulsing shot by him in pursuit of some miscreant but oddly the car forced him to the side of the road a tall lanky paleeyed man got out spat a wad on the ground and approached whats the story mr sam who the hell are you sam wanted to know he read the plaque on the pocket peck it said duane peck mr sam you know me as well as you know your own name i dont know no such goddamned thing what the hell do you want mr sam that was a traffic light you went through back there and you almost hit two cars and some people had to run to get out of the way you must have been doing sixty im in a hurry goddammit what is this all about well sir im just a little worried about your safety and the safety of the public you gonna give me a ticket no sir no need if you tell me where youre going id be happy to follow you make sure you keep your speed down and all or maybe youd best let me drive you thats all why i never heard of such a thing peck get out of my goddamned way or ill call the sheriff and youll spend the rest of your life on night shift do you know who i am everybody knows who you are mr sam sir i guess you can go on now but i am going to follow you so there aint no problems all right you make sure you obey them traffic lights do you hear sam muttered something black but peck had already headed back to his car arrogant sumbitch sam remembered when all deputies treated him like a caesar peck finally pulled away and sam started up again he was very careful not to drive fast and to obey all the traffic signs no one honked at him although he did honk at one goddamned lady who took her goddamned time getting across the street with her baby what did she think she had the entire right of way for as long as she wanted he rolled over the tracks and down the dusty streets of nig of west blue eye these people still lived like bantus why didnt they clean up they wanted to be full citizens they could at least keep their grass trimmed no excuse for it none at all but in his anger he also felt sadness they were so sad who would take care of them who would direct them why did they always misbehave couldnt they see that wasnt the way he shook his head he passed the church and the shell of mansion that had once housed fullers funeral parlor but was now a ruin and in time he came to the house of the address which was still trim and nice and had flowers on the trellis he parked in the street and two little negro children came up and watched him with those big eyes they had go on shoo get out of here he waved them aside and stepped up the wooden steps to the porch he banged hard on the door a woman in her forties answered looked at him quizzically did you write this he demanded she took it and looked at it sir i was five years old when this was written its from mrs parker let me talk to her sir she does not live here who are you you dont know me everybody knows me im sam vincent the county prosecutor no sir i do not know you you must be new in town i have lived here for five years damn i cant believe you dont know me the woman shook her head and a certain expression came across her eyes he knew the thoughts that ran through her head began with the words white folks and went on to chronicle something that she found utterly unknowable about caucasians but he didnt care well where is she where is who mrs parker sir do you really think any black person knows the whereabouts of every other black person well i wouldnt know about that never thought about it much i want to help her thats why im here she wrote me dont you understand you say you the law yes i am in a way but im not here to arrest a colored person its about her little girl she oh said the woman yes i know we dont never forget that you wait here she disappeared and then came back in five minutes shes at her other daughters out in longacre meadows the development it never occurred to sam that negroes could buy homes in longacre meadows a fairly nice residential development east of blue eye where connie longacre used to live do you have an address she gave it to him im sorry for being so loud he said i didnt mean anything by it oh mr sam she said i wasnt here but sheilanow who the hell was sheilatold me how you tried that white man jed posey for beating poor mr fuller to death no white man ever tried a white man for hurting a black before it had cost sam an election and a job he loved more than any other oh that he said he deserved the chair i tried to get it for him but the state of arkansas wasnt about to execute a white man for murdering a black one in at least hes still in the penitentiary rotting to hell slowly death would have been better but rot has its place in this world somewhere i believe you trying to be a good white person i hope jesus is with you hes probably busy today but i do thank you for the thought sam drove cast out of blue eye down arkansas with an odd feeling goddamned duane peck went with him the whole way and sam tried to concentrate on not speeding and staying on the right side of the road a task built on the assumption that he knew which side of the road to drive on in the first place which he did usually unless he forgot as now duane honked and sam looked up to see an automobile coming right at him fool why didnt he turn then he saw he was on the wrong side of the road had they changed that recently agh filling with rage frustration and anguish he moved back where he belonged the driver gave him the finger now whatever for eventually the town fell away there seemed to be a pleasant space of country then he passed the double pillars of rock and cyclone fence that led to mountaintop as boss harrys place was called another ruin now that that goddamned ambitious son of his was running for president and hardly came back to arkansas at all and when he did he stayed in fort smith not down here in polk then he felt not a shock but a terrible melancholy and he remembered why hed stopped coming this way it was when they tore the old longacre place down once such a grand house where old man longacre lived and where his son rance had come with his new bride connie in and where connie had raised her son and buried her husband and then buried her son and his young wife and then lent her cottage to edie white pye and soon enough buried edie then when the county took the child and wouldnt let connie keep it because she was no relation and it was taken off by pye people and then seemed to disappear connie her heart broken for the very last time seemed to finally give up and acknowledge that arkansas somehow wasnt really meant for her though she loved it so where had connie gone back to baltimore he thought so connie wouldnt tell him he had driven her to the bus station that last day after shed closed the house its such a beautiful state said connie and the men are so strong rance of course and my son stephen and earl poor beautiful brave doomed earl and you sam youre such a man i dont think ill find your like in the east connie you dont have to go you know yes i do if i lose another man out here i might not recover she was still beautiful and sam had loved her secretly for many years im sorry i couldnt get the boy for you poor child hell grow up without knowing his father well thats one thing i dont care to worry about said sam hes better off not knowing jimmy she just looked at him and something passed behind her eyes but whatever it was she let it slide im sorry he said about the hearing i thought the judge would understand this was the custody hearing the child she had named stephen after her own son and which she had raised for three months as edie languished and which she had held and comforted and loved when edie had then died was to be given to the pyes they named it lamar and took it from her and drove off in a beatenup old truck a gaggle of toughasnails men and gristly women the state paints with a broad brush she said it believes in family and in kin i agree with that just as broadly occasionally however it makes a mistake oh well if they love him hell be fine i suppose sam didnt see much love in that brood but he didnt say anything the bus pulled in miss connie of course was rich she didnt have to take a damn bus but she was also without airs and if the bus was good enough to the poor white and black people she had loved and loved her she would take it she smiled brokenly and climbed aboard while the driver loaded her considerable luggage into the compartment he watched her as she found a seat the bus shivered as the driver put it in gear and just as it lurched into motion connie turned and their eyes met and sam made a little twitch of a smile and she smiled and disappeared forever he always wondered suppose hed yelled connie dont leave goddammit stay with me connie i love you dont go please we will work it out but he hadnt and knew hed done the right thing he was married with three children and a pregnant wife what could be done about that nothing so connie drove away on the bus and that was all there was to it where her house had been there were now fifty houses and the tasteful sign before them where once the longacre mailbox had hung read longacre meadows a subsidiary of the bama group and the houses were white and looked spacious and well lived in though they were spread with such rigid orthodoxy on the gridwork of new streets that nothing seemed spontaneous or alive quite sam turned in watching damned duane peck turn in behind him but soon forgot about the deputy as he tried to negotiate the dazzle of cutely named streets it was almost more than he could handle he felt sucked into a vortex of houses that looked exactly alike when did this happen he wondered but by a religious miracle the only one hed ever witnessed in his eightysix years he happened upon barefoot boy garth as the street was preposterously called and soon enough came upon a house hardly different from any other with the address how on earth could there be ten thousand other houses on this little lane anyway he pulled into the driveway and sat for a second now when perhaps he needed it most a blessed wave of clarity washed across him he felt focused alive intense he knew exactly why he was here and what he had to find out he got out and went and knocked on the door a young black woman answered her eyes hooded in hostility yes she said he was a little nonplussed most people in these parts called him sir axiomatically possibly because they recognized him and possibly out of respect for his age ah im looking for lucille parker what for its old business about a letter she wrote me youre not some cracker segregationist bible thumper here to tell her the lord took her other daughter maam im a graduate of yale law school and princeton university though i respect the bible id never thump it it is about shirelle yes but i dont believe god had anything to do with it youre mr sam then go on back said the woman we heard youd come around mamas waiting for you she led him through the neat housesam was amazed that negroes lived so nicely when had this happenedand out back where the old lady sat on a lawn chair under a scrubby little tree the chair was a frail almost gossamer thing possibly bowed in strain she was immense serene and queenly in her bulk sitting in her best purple clothes sagacious and calm mrs parker he said i am sam vincent mr sam she said i remember you from the trial yes maam i remember you too no you dont she said you never once looked at us or cared about us colored folks at all you never talked to us or anything nobody ever visited us we got us a phone call from someone at the coroners telling us shirelles body could be picked up thats all we ever got from anybody maam i aint going to lie to you in them days we hardly thought of colored people as human beings its the way it was i was the man i was and now im the man i am but if i say i remembered you i did you wore a black dress because you were in mourning still you wore a white hat with a camellia atop it and a veil your husband wore a dark suit he wore hornrim glasses and walked with a limp i believe from a combat wound in north africa i came about this he handed her the letter yes i cant ever remember seeing it i think a secretary must have put it in the file because it wasnt important maam if id have seen it id have probably put it in the file too it doesnt have any evidence in it only one white person ever told me the truth said mrs parker that was earl swagger he was a fair man the day that man got killed was a sad day for this whole county but mr earl said hed find out what happened to my baby and i know if hed a lived he would have fair and square no matter what or who sam tried to be gentle maam we found out what happened to shirelle reggie fuller killed her and he paid for it its a closed account nowadays accounts dont get closed so fairly but we closed that one no sir the old lady said i know that boy didnt do it just like i said in the letter sam looked at the letter she was quoting herself almost verbatim all these years later mr sam i know that boy couldnt have killed my shirelle she had written in a week before the execution mrs parker everything scientific matched i swear to you i may not be no civil rights holy roller but neither am i the kind of man who would railroad evidence i dont care what the evidence said that boy reggie was over to my house when my shirelle disappeared he was in the house he talked to me about her he looked me in the eye god would not let him look me in the eye and say he missed shirelle if the night before he had killed her mrs parker i have been around murderers my whole life black or white they are wired different they can look you in the eye and tell you that they love you and make you believe it and when you turn your back they hit you over the head with a claw hammer and take your watch and drink your blood and forget about it in the next second they aint normal like you and me a lie dont carry no weight with them at all that may be true sir but reggie wasnt like that dont you understand maam facts is facts mr sam mr earl said the detectives would come talk to us no detectives never did what you call it when you solve a crime what columbo does columbo is a madeup man investigation you call it investigation you never did no investigation you found your shirt you found your blood and you electrocuted your nigger boy he was guilty who would go to so much trouble to frame a boy like that the man what killed my baby shirelle and has been walking around laughing about it all these years madam think about what youre saying a man would have to find reggie break into his house get his shirt take it to the site of the murder dip it in your daughters blood rip the pocket off plant the pocket in your daughters dead hand return to reggies house break in again hide the shirt under the mattress now who would do such a damned crazy thing if he does nothing we only find the body and there aint no other evidence to point to a suspect without that damned pocket and that bloody shirt there aint no evidence aint no case aint no nothing theres only a dead girl she didnt blink or look away but faced him square i knows all that but he did have the time it aint like theres some limit on the time he had like a single night he had four full days between the time he killed my girl and mr earl found the body it could have been done it was the damn tv everybody thought they was columbo or matlock or some such and when peoples loved ones got killed there always had to be some meaning in it sam looked into mrs parkers crazed old eyes shed been fulminating on this over the decades shed invented a goddamned conspiracy about her daughters death no one wanted to face the squalid simple irrational truth as here a colored boy lost control and smashed her poor little daughter to death with a rock mrs parker it dont never happen that way it just dont mr sam i see in your eyes what you thinking you thinking crazy old colored woman she be blaming a white person every last thing its all the white mans fault its race like all the colored thats all they think about thats what you thinking right she regarded him with fierce brilliant eyes sister i you is isnt you tell me he sighed i suppose i am there are some things i cannot overcome some suspicions about yall i havent grown as i should have then let me tell you something surprise you i dont think a white man done it i think a colored man did this threw sam it was the last thing he expected the old woman had him foxed something powerful what you mean there sister in them days the one thing we told our girls and i must have said it a hundred times to shirelle you dont never get in no car with a white boy white boy only wants one thing from you and you dont want to give it to him he may be friendly he may be nice he may be handsome he may have the devils ways to him but he only want one thing girl and if you give it to him he hate you and all the black boys find out and they hate you but they goin try and git the same off of you and really be angry if you dont give it so i know she dont get in no car with no white man some colored man done this to her sam blinked confounded the old lady was smart not white smart fancy sentences smart but somehow she knew things she had seen into the center of it hed known many a detective sergeant who wasnt as sly as this mr sam you the smartest man in this county you smarter even than old ray bama or harry etheridge and his son you smarter than mr earl you got his boy bob lee off when the whole us govmint say he was a killer you got jed posey to spend his black evil days in prison now you a old man and i a old woman we both be gone soon caint you please just look at that case again just sos when you goes you knows you done your job as hard at the end as you done it through the middle well he thought about it his was a life of certitude he was an absolute believer he hated revisionism hindsight detached examination the whole spirit of equivocation and ironic ambivalence which had become the american style in the nineties he hated it goddamn nigra woman wanted him to become what he hated but there was time she was right it was not technically impossible why anyone would do such a thing was beyond his imagining but it was in the technical sense by the laws of the physical world possible and the bit about the black man being the one who did itthat was so interesting as pure mystery as pure problem of the intellect it goaded him powerfully my mind aint what it once was it gits foggy it clouds up with anger i cant find my socks seems like people hide things on me but if i git another clear day like today i will look at the case records again or what of them remain i will look but dont you expect nothing i cant have you expecting nothing mrs parker god bless you sir now dont call me sir call me sam everybody else does it was the football dream a late variant lamar pye and russs father bud were at his football game it was and russ was eight he was not a very good football player in fact hed only played that one year lamar said i think that damn boys got too much gal in him he aint no athlete thats for sure agreed bud you should see his younger brother that little suckers a studpuppy you cant hardly git him to quit i like that in a man and in a boy when they dont quit old russ here lamar explained not only do he got too much quit he dont even got no start the two old boys laughed raucously on the sideline and it seemed that everybody there was staring at poor little russ waiting for him to screw up it didnt take long because he was too small to play the line and not fast enough to play the backfield hed been stuck at a position called linebacker it involved a lot of football knowledge for which he just had no gift and the coaches were always yelling at him for being out of place or slow to react he was never ever comfortable when he charged the line inevitably a pass zinged to the exact place hed just abandoned when he stayed put against a pass someone blasted through the line and veered through the hole he was supposed to plug it was a terrible season and he yearned to quit because he wasnt born with that coolheaded instinct his younger brother possessed in spades but was in truth a spaz come on russ stop em yelled his dad come on russ you can do it yelled big old lamar ponytailed charm charisma big white teeth big sickle in his hands which he was sharpening with an arkansas stone running it with goosepimply grinding sounds up and down the wickedly curving blade russ was so intent on them that he missed the start of the play and when he finally snapped tothe coaches were yelling his nameit seemed that a big black kid on the other team had juked to the left then broken outside and was already beyond the line of scrimmage with no one near him but poor russ in his weakside linebackers slot willing himself to run russ found a surprisingly good angle on the running back and zoomed toward him but as he approached he saw how big the boy was how fierce with energy and determination how his legs beat like pistons against the ground and in some way russs ardor was dampened though everyone was yelling hit him low he hit him high briefly they grappled and russ had the sense of bright lights stars maybe the wind rustling and then blankness when he blinked he was on the ground his face mask having grown a fungus of turf his whole body constricted in pain and as he turned he could see through the ache behind his eyes the runner continue his scamper down the sidelines borne by cheers from the crowd until he crossed the goal line to be festooned with garlands and ribbons he tried to get up but dad and lamar stood over him russ hit him low his dad said with contempt lamar lifted the sickle its blade picked up a movielike highlight from the sun he was jason freddy krueger the guy in halloween all combined into one he laughed loudly sorry boy he said but you shoulda listened to your daddy nutcuttin time whoooshhhh the blade descended russ awoke in a cheesy hotel room in oklahoma city his mind filled with shards of glass pieces of gravel and infinite regrets someone was hacking at him but no it was the door being pounded russ come on someone was yelling youre late again goddammit its time to go oh it was his other father bob lee swagger one more true man to find disappointment in him russ got himself out of bed isnt that illegal not if you have it displayed but it isnt displayed my my if it didnt just fall off the gun rack here bob pointed to the empty gun rack above the seat in his truck behind the seat he had just slid the mini in its gun case plus a paper bag with three loaded twentyround magazines and the immense fortyrounder a curved thing that looked like a flattened tin banana what cop is going to give me a hard time this heres oklahoma that isnt legal said russ my dad catches you with that youd go to jail well id never mess with your old man so youd best come up with a way to talk him out of it bob said sliding the commander in its holster behind the seat too along with the extra magazines i dont know said russ this is getting hairy it gets hairier you drive they climbed in they were in the parking lot of the holiday inn getting ready to call on general jack preece of jfp technology inc what was that address again russ asked bob told him i think its near the airport he said go to it junior they drove in silence for a while then russ said youd better brief me on some stuff why if you and i are supposed to be doing a book on sniping and it turns out i dont know shit about it this guy is going to kick us out on our butts and we get nothing so what do you want to know whats it feel like i used to get asked that a lot whats it feel like whats it feel like smartass punk kid all right why do you hate him who preece yeah i dont hate him hes a fine man you hate him i can tell even behind the famous swagger reserve you hate him he was a fine officer he ran a superior program his people got hundreds maybe thousands of kills they saved the lives of hundreds maybe thousands of american soldiers hes a fine man a patriot probably a father and a republican why would you say i hate him you hate him well its just a thing you wouldnt understand it id say it to another sniper and to no one else what i said to you earlier thats whats important hes a fine man a great officer you have to tell me i cant get through this if you dont bob paused he wondered if he had the skills to articulate what lay at his heart or the energy damn this kid with his smartass ways and his penchant for always coming up with a question that was pretty damned good if you do write a book you cannot put this in it ever do you understand yes sir i dont want it said bob lee swagger he had hard words for an american soldier who in good faith and out of duty and honor risked his life for his country i wont have that thats shit thats whats killing the country i swear then i tell you this now and i will never hear of it again yes sir its about killing russ said nothing in war bob said death comes in three forms usually it comes from far off delivered by men who never see the bodies they leave behind thats how we done most of our killing in vietnam the bs did the most man theyd turn that goddamn jungle into pulp and chew up everything for a square mile and artillery on the ground the artillery does most of the killing the king of battle they call it you may not like it but thats how it is yes said russ second is in hot blood firefight you see forms moving you fire some of them stop moving you may never see them up close you may never know if you got a hit or not or you may you see the little fuck go down you see the tracers cut him up that sort of thing whats going on is really fighting its you or him you may not like it but goddammit you do it because if you dont youre the one goes home in a bag yes i see the third and last form is coldblooded killing thats what we do we being the snipers we put a scope on a man from a half mile out and we pull a trigger and we watch him go still nothing pretty about it but i would say its necessary i believed it was necessary i know it makes people nervous youre death they call you murder inc and god knows what they say about you behind your back they think youre sick or nuts or something that you enjoy it thats what you did i did but still distinctions can be made somehow distinctions got to be made i didnt shoot women or children and i didnt shoot anyone that wasnt out to kill me if someone has a hard time with that well tough shit i was a hunter its called fair chase you go into the jungle or along the paddy breaks you hunt your enemy and you try and find a position where he cant get you you take him down you hit him you get fire we lost a lot of men we had rewards on our heads the vc put ten thousand piasters out for me and eventually a russian bastard claimed it but thats a different story what we did was war find and destroy the enemy shoot him try and go home finish the mission now the army he paused something in him recoiled at this but he had to get it out different doctrine developed first at this project black light and then deployed through tigercat the th infantry division sniper school what theyd do theyd nightinsert fourman teams into a zone three security boys with poodle shooters and one sniper with a rifle they liked to do it just after a sweep so charlie was out and about and feeling safe he thought he owned the night the shooter had what they called their m which was an m nato riflecaliber russworked over and accurized by the army marksmanship unit it carried a suppressorsince you been to the movies youd call it a silencerand a nightvision device an anpvs called a starlight scope so these boys set up in the jungle and they just wait the snipers on the scope the other guys have nightvision binocs they pick something up and the sniper moves into position he puts the scope on them its like theyre moving through green water but hes got them out to eight hundred yards the gooks never knew what hit them they couldnt get a read on the snipers hide because there was no sound they couldnt believe he could see them but through the scope bright as daylight he could put them down lots of kills it was easy one boy got a hundred fifteen kills in about five months they was getting six seven kills a night were they hitting soldiers hell from eight hundred yards out on a starlight who the hell can tell if theyre moving at night i guess theyre soldiers but maybe they were kids going to the john or families trying to move at night so they wouldnt get bounced by our tac air who knew then at a chopper evacs the team the fuck out of there and its back to base camp for pancakes and a good night at the bodycount factory i see said russ you dontit wasnt i dont know i havent sorted it out yet but its different it isnt war said russ and ill say it if youre reluctant it was straight execution work yeah well you hide that you got me you hide that and dont be so quick to judge unless you walked in the mans shoes now this is how its going to work im going to tell him how much weall in the marine corps admired the army way of doing things they got so many more kills than us damn dont that beat all get him to feeling all puffed up hell know youre bullshitting like hell he will hes a general aint he hes used to being buttered up hell want his place in history set straight hell want to show us some hardware son i was a sergeant in the marine corps for fourteen years i know how these birds work there said the general there do you see them he did the phantasms rose in the green gloom two three then four dancing ever so softly their movements fired by incandescent phosphors in the tube of the device which was a magnavox thermal sniperscope it was the latest thing a lens that truly penetrated the darkness no living thing could pass unnoticed in its view through the night the figures danced and one of them came at last to the red dot reticle in the center of the view go ahead said the general take them it was too easy bob was welded to the scope and felt the stock against him his finger on the trigger it was some kind of m only swollen enlarged his hold was rocksolid and the weapon itself secured against the sandbags beneath it he pressed the trigger and the rifle spoke once with a sound somewhere between a cough and a sneeze or maybe a hiccup there was no recoil no sense of having fired yet the action cycled and an empty shell was jettisoned and the first target went down he moved the red dot ever so slightly and fired again same thing twice more end of mission said the general snapping on the lights that filled a long shooting tunnel off of this sandbagged position lets see how you did he turned to a computer terminal and punched in a command the computer answered immediately superb shooting said the general exactly as expected you xd the bullseye on the first two cleanly you broke a line on the third and you xd the fourth again four kills elapsed time seconds recorded noise ah under one hundred decibels about the sound intensity of someone firing a bb gun the general reached over and hit a switch and the thermal scope died bob set the rifle which looked oddly distended with the huge gunmetalgray tube atop it on the sandbags he looked downrange at his targets and at the end of the tunnel saw flattened metal silhouettes clearly on some kind of uneven conveyer belt that gave them the lurching movement of human beings on patrol how do you heat them said bob essentially you were shooting at a common household appliance you just got four toasters or rather their heating elements congratulations theres no infraredlight source on this piece bob said no sir said the general were beyond that were beyond even ambient light the starlight scopes thats passive infrared no infrared beam and it doesnt need illumination the problem with the ambientlight pieces was that they didnt work in total darkness they didnt work in smoke fog or rain they didnt work in daylight even they were limited the magnavox collects all the infrared energy from the target scene by a singleelement silicon aspheric lens the emerging convergent beam is horizontally scanned by an oscillating mirror and then focused on a vertical linear array of sixtyfour lead solenide detector elements which traduce the ir energy into electrical signals each detectors output is fed to a highgain preamplifier the signals from the sixtyfour preamplifiers are then multiplexed to a single composite video signal the composite video signal is then amplified and applied to a miniature cathoderay tube that is viewed through the monocular eyepiece its mtv for snipers pretty goddamned slick bob said the box did in fact look like a television set a long rectangular tube with the huge round eye up front for a screen leading back to the eyepiece well weve come a ways the germans used to shoot at concentration camp prisoners thats how they tested their firstgeneration vampir sight we shoot at decommissioned toasters can the boy try it no thats all right said russ you sure son asked the general its fine said russ the general turned back to bob its not just that the thermal sniperscope is the highest refinement in the nightvision electronics but what we sell is a whole system we wholesale from magnavox we mount it to the rifle we manufacture our own suppressor we pack it into a kit and we provide trainers and a constant technical hot line and emergency system thats not an m it felt heavier than one its a knightstoner sr in shooting a subsonic load and our jfp maw suppressor unbelievably silent accurate lethal isnt it muzzle blast is caused by highpressure gases suddenly escaping from the end of the barrel as the bullet exits reducing the pressure results in less sound generated we reduce the pressure by increasing the volume for gas expansion reducing the gas temperature delaying gas exit by trapping and turbulence damn its a good unit yes it is said bob nothing like your old remington id hate to be matched with my old rifle against a fellow with that outfit you wouldnt have a chance the night belongs to the man who can see through it imagine the kills you could have gotten in combat with this outfit bob rose the demonstration was over come on back said the general well talk in my office jack preece was a stocky man with the short neck that was common to many championship shooters he was handsome and rather slick with a mane of silver hair and a smooth way about him he radiated confidence and charm his skin was tan and his teeth capped were white and perfect he led them back from the firing range through workshops where the systemthe knight rifle the nightvision device the sound suppressorwas being assembled into kit form a single plastic case after assembly zeroing and disassembly for shipment at no doubt a pretty penny to the elite marksmanship units of the worlddelta various special forces units seal team six a ranger battalion the fbis hrt various bigcity swat units that knight rifle gives us an enormous advantage over even the ms we can get minuteofangle accuracy out of a semiauto we can get second or third shots without breaking the shooters spotweld with a bolt guns accuracy bob the days of the bolt gun are over by the decades end all the worlds elite sniper teams will be shooting semiauto i think ill keep mine awhile said bob and the general laughed he ushered them into his office a small paneled warren one wall of which was filled with marksmanship trophies from a hundred forgotten highpower rifle championships the world over as well as photographs of men with rifles standing or kneeling around a trophy each with a fancy target rifle in his hands bob glimpsed and read a shooting history etched on brass plates interzonal us army champion panama games standing rifle nra high master alabama high power sitting champion and on and on no wimbledon cup up there said the general my best year you took it nineteen seventyone sir if id have known you had a gap in your trophy case id have dropped a shot or two the general laughed its all shit of course but i have customers in here all the time it impresses them now whats on your mind gentlemen he lit a cigar and leaned back in his chair comfortably as if looking forward to a good time sir said russ ive been hired to coauthor bob lee swaggers story for the presidio press in san francisco we wanted to at least touch on the wider shape of the story that is american sniping in vietnam as programs and how they affected the war theres not a lot of data on the armys yet i understand the army snipers got much higher kill rates than the marines it had nothing to do with the quality of men said the general with an executives practiced smoothness at the senior noncommissioned officer level the american services all have extremely talented and motivated individuals the marines have stayed wedded to marksmanship as the core of their service thats fine as history has proven out time and again the army has been charged with staying at the cutting edge of ground combat technology that was my job thats where tigercat came from we started in the early fifties trying to develop a technology that would give the night to the american sniper the m sniperscope prompted bob a piece of junk said the general expelling a large curling cumulus of smoke bulky clumsy awkward with a distressing propensity toward showing the vegetation more clearly than the enemy so heavy it could only be mounted on a light rifle like the puny carbine but a start yes sir said bob no doubt if wed have had your gear in the nam we could have kicked ass bigtime the general wasnt really listening do you know what the difference between the marine and the army sniper programs was i mean speaking frankly i love the spirit of the marines but our kills were so much higher do you know why russ inwardly blanched he knew this was the last thing swagger would want to hear from this grinning selfpromoting baboon no sir said bob evenly the marines somehow couldnt commit at the conceptual level to the idea of technology at some fundamental level they believed still in the romantic notion of individual heroism they somehow refused to enter the modern age you marine snipers were like world war i pilots or cowboy gunslingers going off on your own to do battle with the enemy and taking him out oneonone we believed in team spirit sophisticated technology and body counts our body counts were so much higher we saw through to the heart of it it was about killing the enemy not dueling him and our sniper teams moved in and left nothing but stepons when we put a vc down we didnt count it until the next morning we could put our boot on his chest we called them stepons yes sir said bob chastely nothing showing on his bland face i sure wish id had a chance to work the jungle with that kind of equipment his piece said the general returned to the technical and the arcane the m was a great advance over the m system of world war ii yet in korea the troops hated it and the army itself didnt really understand or follow up it was my idea to run the thing through a nightbattle wringer and try to develop doctrine fortunately somebody read my idea in infantry journal and i was given a chance to practice what id preached we called the project black light and ran it out of camp chaffee where we tried to devise some data for night operations with vision devices we were stuck with the goddamned ms but at least we were able to show the rd boys what was necessary in a nightcombat environment no one really knew until that time theyd just copied the german hardware tell us about black light the general launched into a long and somewhat selfserving account of the project and it soon developed that the problem with him wouldnt be getting him to talk but getting him to shut up his chatter soon evolved into performance soliloquy ultimately a oneman show punctuated by theatrical blasts of smoke he looked like the god of war mars himself sitting there under his reasonable gray hair as the clouds swirled and he gave pronouncement much of his presentation seemed to turn on obscure issues like trying to find the right number of men that stayed within command parameters and yet were adequate to provide security for the shooter months were spent determining if six or eight or ten were better and the ultimate choice was four given that the sniper himself could do double duty in a firefight with a greasegun night command vocabulary was tested night map reading was examined and night navigation radio techniques were explored the shooting was a relatively late part in it about we got to the shooting what did you use for targets the germans used people you said on the record on the record heatgenerating targets were not mandatory because we were only beginning to understand the principle of ambient light that is passive night vision we used the ms active infrared that is an infrared searchlight we could have shot at anything but there was a ballistic component to the project which mandated load testing on living organisms off the record we shot sheep and goats cattle would have been preferable because their respiratory system most resembles humans but i had no stomach for trying to bring down a steer with a bullet that at its best generated muzzle energies somewhere between a special and a light magnum on and on it went through the construction of the units problems with the clamps that secured them difficulty with the webbing that supported and so forth and so on russ thought hed doze im just curious said bob finally and russ knew that hed played out the whole long hand nursed the mans vanities and ego gotten through the bullshit lecture on individual heroism vs team spirit and body count to get to this point at last what sort of administrative control could there have been on the units themselves was it standard infantry armsroom administration was it more stringent who actually controlled the units the actual ms technically i did though the true administration of the project fell in the hands of my first sergeant whose name was ben farrell very good nco killed outside da nang in who controlled the armsroom keys well what does this have to do with anything there was an awkward moment then russ said the truth is we think theres a movie potential for this book and the reason i wanted to talk about night vision was that i had an idea for a funny scene young soldiers break into the armory and steal some nightvision devices they use them to spy on a wac encampment some girls with nice tits tits and ass thats the kind of wacky stuff the movies love oh lord said the general why dont you just make it up what do you need my help for sergeant swagger insisted that everything be at least based in reality well i can assure you nobody used our hardware to spy on wacs and if you knew anything about the wacs of the fifties you wouldnt want to spy on them either we could make it nurses said russ would that be better the general made a face of disgust hollywood he said no its impossible there were only two armsroom keys three i assume the base commander had one but he paid us no mind we had our shop our barracks space and use of three range facilities and various field assault courses the only two keys were controlled by first sergeant farrell and myself and he was a prussian in the discipline department no one used those weapons without our permission or knowledge which means no one used them period bob veered away from the point did you find the units equally effective no said the general relaxing somewhat and expelling a long whoosh of dark smoke and went on to explain the difference in the units the difference in the lots of ammunition the difference in the three carbines themselves it went on like that russ pretending to keep notes bob prodding with gentle questions up to and including the generals astonishingly successful stewardship of the tigercat sniper school the record number of kills racked up once the mounting problems for the starlight on the m were solved and so on late in the afternoon bob circled in for another pass could we just get back to black light one more time sir he asked certainly sergeant said the general we agreed the young man and i that this book would be better if there were some personalities in it so im thinking there at chaffee in any outstanding personalities involved how big a team was it who were they the usual good men toward the end representatives from varo inc and polan industries who ultimately got the initial starlight scope contracts some civilians tdy from army warfare vision at fort devens you know i have a picture is that interesting to you yes sir like to see it its over here on the wall he led them to the wall and pointed the picture out like the others it was a mixed group of civilians and soldiers standing and kneeling preece himself much thinner but somehow rawer crouched in the front row holding the carbine with the huge optical device mounted he wore armygreen fatigues with his name on a white name tag and one of those goofy turret caps that were issue in the fifties the men around him were doughy unimpressive unmemorable they looked like nasa flight controllers faintly ridiculous in the casual clothes of the era mostly shortsleeved white shirts with slacks and lumpy oxfords i should have had them write their names down the general said with a laugh i only recognize a few thats ben farrell thats bob eadings of polan whos that one asked bob pointing to a kneeling figure at the edge of the photograph a young man with a certain pugnacious set to his square blocky head who looked strong beneath his clothes and had a set of fiercely burning eyes that guy said preece lord i remember him he was from motorola i think he was only on the project for two weeks but it happened to be the two weeks we took the picture i cannot for the life of me remember the name were all these men shooters russ asked no not really ben farrell was a very good shot not exceptional but excellent who did the shooting was it a team oh there was only one shooter said the general exhaling a long flume of smoke like a dragons breath me after they had gone the general sat very still for a time his cigar burned out and he didnt touch it he didnt call his girlfriend or his daughter or his divorced wife or his lawyer or any of the men on his board of directors or his head engineer or any of the old boys in his sniper cadre finally he got up opened the cabinet behind his desk took out a bottle of wild turkey and poured himself a tall glass he sat looking at it for a time and then reached for it noting as he drew it to his lips that his hands were still shaking some dang days a fella couldnt win duane going on just a few hours sleep after having spent all day yesterday bouncing around polk county on the tail of old sam plus answering a few unavoidable police calls was bushed but he was up and at it early this morning on his ordered sweep across all the commercial establishments he could find along the etheridge parkway corridor yet he struck pay dirt early enough goddamn he thought when the indian dayclerk woman at the days inn at parkway exit said yes an older man and a younger man had checked into a room yesterday at around ten was there anything wrong duane puffed and acted like some sort of important investigator and pretty much bullied the poor womanshe was foreign with some kind of fucking dot on her head so what difference did it makeinto giving up the whole story theyd checked in at ten the boy disappeared for most of the afternoon the man made longdistance phone calls all day and theyd left about six in a truck loaded with sleeping bags and technically still had a contract on the room at least until checkout time noon she remembered because usually they dont rent rooms before one but the tall man had insisted duane asked to see the phone records though he didnt have a subpoena fortunately the woman was too stupid to know or too indifferent to care in his notebook he wrote down the numbers in his big silly handwriting like a childs he thanked her helped himself to a free cup of coffee and by ten was on the phone he gave his report to the answering machine including the numbers then sat back waiting for praise it didnt come the phone rang peck where are you now well sir uh im in the parking lot of the days inn git back down to blue eye you stay with the old man today you understand you let me know what hes up to that was it no nice going nicely done good job just get back on the job damn you couldnt please some folks red bama had experts everywhere that was one of the pleasures of being red bama so he called one a communications specialist formerly of southwestern bell who handled telephone problems for him and inside half an hour had a make on the phone calls bob had made one was to the pentagon the office of army historical archives the other was to a firm in oklahoma called jfp technology it took another couple of calls to get to the product line and meanings of jfp technology when he did he whistled fucking swagger was smart he was inside this deal already and getting closer and closer to secrets so carefully and professionally buried over forty years ago this was a powerful antagonist the best that had come against red in many a year next red made a call to a lawyer he knew in oklahoma city a good man who was as they say in the life the lawyer for a not unsubstantial fee was quickly able to hire a licensed private detective and on a crash basis the detective set up a surveillance at jfp after establishing in the parking lot the presence of a green dodge pickup with an odd unpainted fender license number arizona sch the lawyer reported back to red who took a bit of a moment to appreciate what hed brought offi found you you tricky bastard and then issued further and very specific orders i want one thing and one thing only just the time they leave that office as determined from an observation site as far away as possible i do not want and let me say that again because i love the sound of my own damn voice i do not want any tail jobs or moving surveillance nobodys to follow this boy is too tricky he told the lawyer i dont know what kind of men you got in oklahoma city good men mr bama yeah well not that good this boy is very very smart and he has instincts for aggression you would not believe i guarantee you he will see any kind of tail you put on and if he does every damn thing upcoming will fall apart is that understood yes sir said the lawyer the time is very important meanwhile i will think this thing through said bama and if i need your services ill call you back i will expect you to be available mr bama youve never talked to a more available man they do grow em good in oklahoma city then bama said he put down the phone in his little office took another sip of rancid bar coffee and then felt something very strange upon his face by god it was a smile he was happy he was as happy as hed been in say years other than the success of his children nothing filled him with more delight than a good challenge and oh boy was this bob lee swagger proving out he tried to apply his purest intelligence to the problem the key was what time they left that visit to jfp if they left soon they could easily make it back to blue eye before dark which was not good because he didnt think he could manipulate his elements and set up what he had in mind fast enough and everything had to be in place if they came back later it would be a night drive he didnt like that at all he did not want to set up an afterdark hit too tricky on the open road in the city was a different matter but on the open highway in the country at night with a tricky bastard like bob lee swagger it got real iffy and if the thing fell apart who knew when hed get another chance so hope they spend another night in okie city and come back in the morning that gets them into the area around midafternoon which would give him plenty of time so assume theyll come back to blue eye from oklahoma city tomorrow next question which route would they take any normal man would do the normal thing the dogleg take us like a shot over to fort smith then veer south on the parkway that hollis had named for his daddy down to blue eye or maybe out of sentimentality bob would pass up on the new road and choose the slower more awkward route his father had died on that road maybe he would too but he doubted bob would feel that sentimental bobs nature was essentially practical sentiment was for late at night when the day was done red wished he knew how theyd got there in the first place swagger wasnt the kind of man to come the same way twice he pored over the map wishing he had something more expressive more revealing he wanted data information numbers facts he wanted to drown himself in them he saw quickly enough that there were really only two other routes into blue eye both were more or less direct eastwest roads though much smaller than the fort smith route both involved dropping down from us to mcalester then heading east on a twolane blacktop to talihina shortly thereafter they diverged one oklahoma followed the crest of the ouachitas from talihina fiftyseven miles into arkansas where it turned into arkansas it would be a high road a couple of thousand feet up with plenty of visibility it was called combining the names of the towns on either of its ends the taliblue trail and the state had designated it as a beautiful road with mountain vistas on either side he had driven it himself in a porsche he once owned and had a goddamned great old time the other road oklahoma crossed oklahoma at about the halfway point then became route as it cut east and ran parallel to on the valley floor beneath it eventually linking up with a little above blue eye he realized that was the road off of which bobs blue eye property lay where the man now had his trailer maybe hed go that way and set up again at his trailer that was the logical way or was it he looked at it very simple high road or low road he didnt have enough people to play it both ways at least not under the mandate of maximum firepower high road or low road and then he knew the answer hes a sniper hes a shooter he works by seeing his whole life is built on seeing the input he gets from the world is all visual information which he processes and from which he makes his decisions he sees and he likes to see things a long way off he doesnt like surprises he likes to be the surprise the high road a plan formed in his mind three cars and a truck coming from different directions snaring bob in the middle ramming him off the road burying him with full automatic fire ten men firing full automatic in the first second after the crash the phone rang hello sir it was the lawyer in oklahoma city yes they just left ray looked at his watch jesus it was after five they werent going to drive home tonight hed won good work sir we found the rooms they rented the holiday inn near the airport i told you very discreet mr bama no direct inquiries were made we were able to get into the chain hotel computer directories they reserved their rooms for two nights checkout time ten am tomorrow good work said bama are you looking for a job mr bama im very happy where i am the check is in the mail then i know your word is good its good in every city in this country red said hanging up he quickly dialed jorge de la rivera yes the team is ready yes sir all stood down relaxed the girls you sent over went over real nice they all been fucked or sucked they all been fed their weapons are cleaned heres how its going down itll be tomorrow midafternoon on oklahoma about ten miles east of the crossroads its called the taliblue trail nice high mountain road not heavily traveled should be nice and private and wide open you site your cars in opposite directions and let him get in the middle then you close in on him so hes got no place to run youll want to take him off the road and get the guns working overtime right away you want to bury him youve got the advantage of both surprise and firepower it sounds very good muy bueno easy to do we get him for you but sirhow will we know hes coming oh ill let you know over the radio ill be watching youre going to get involved in this mr bama you cant miss me he said just look up ill be the one in the airplane sam woke in a fog after a dreamless but restless night he had the nagging feeling that something important was scheduled for today was he due in court did he have to file a motion was some defense lawyer deposing him for an appeal but nothing snapped into clarity and the goddamned maid had forgotten both the coffee and to pick up that woman was getting sloppier and sloppier he had half a mind to fire her but he couldnt remember her name then he remembered that he did fire hertwelve years ago then he remembered mrs parker that was the woman he should have fired when did the colored get so uppity they had no respect anymore it was a case of the rules simply eroding away until nothing was left but chaos and anarchy then he remembered little shirelle he got up straggled through a shower and got dressed remembering his undershirt forgetting his underpants it went on like that for several hours he felt a deep and mournful pain that he was not all there he knew he was not all there but somehow he could not get out of the track which was a kind of infantile literalmindedness an unwilled concentration on petty things he wanted to cry where did my mind go who took my mind finally a squall of clarity blew in by midafternoon and everything popped briefly into place he felt sane cool smart again taking advantage he quickly went to his basement and remembered that he had originally committed to discovering his brief to the coroners office on the earl swagger shooting for bob lee swagger but that would have to wait this was so much more interesting he seized the file that hed looked at the day before and this time he really bore down sliding through the documents with a professionals easy authority examining the case against reggie gerard fuller it held together it might not hold together today when the evidentiary rules were much tighter and the fact that reggies initials were rgf and that those initials were found on the pocket crumpled in shirelles hand might not constitute probable cause for a search warrant but it sure as hell did then as even judge harrison confirmed sam had a moment of pleasure i did it by the book by god i dont have to look back and be ashamed that somewhere i took a shortcut i cut a corner i faked this or that or lied about the other no sir the law was the law the law was always right and the law looked at the shirt and the blood and reggies absence of an alibi and said reggie gerard fuller did it he was satisfied what else could he do he had no other files the actual evidence was burned in that damn fire nothing else could be learned but then oh little niggle of doubt little qualm little tremor little twitch he thought back on that night and his actions what cast the longest shadow over the case was the rgf initials once theyd identified rgfdone really before hed put his full concentration on the matterthe case developed a peculiar momentum that could not be stopped it was such a fat huge piece of evidence like a proverbial eighthundredpound gorilla that it sat anyplace it wanted to it shaped all thought all interpretation all investigation it became the central organizing principle of the case a perceptual reality that could not be avoided in fact sam had even played that one out straight hed spent one whole day with betty hill the towns switchboard operator going through the phone listings to ascertain if just possibly there wasnt another rgf of any color or sex there wasnt hed gone to the town registry looking for other rgfs who might not be on the phone list hed gone to every motel in a hundred square miles looking for another rgf in the area no such thing that rgf that was the monster it occurred to sam suppose there was no rgf suppose we never found that rgf would we have ever tied the killing to reggie no he thought not if it werent for the dying girls spasm and the angry boys fury the case might never have been solved but then he thought imagine an investigation without the weight of that discovery that wasnt misshapen or guided by it that progressed quite naturally and led where it led if anywhere of course he couldnt imagine such a thing rgf made that impossible little tingle little tremor little buzz where did it come from what was he feeling he couldnt pin it down nothing forget it then he had it earl earl swagger had discovered the body earl had investigated the crime scene earl took notes earl made observations and suggestions all of it untainted or untouched or unseduced by the mighty power of the rgf initials pointing the finger right straight into the heart of reggie gerard fuller earl was dead before they ever linked anything to reggie gerard fuller too bad earl hadnt lived long enough to another bell went off in sams old mind his son bob had brought earls notebook and some other effects with that fool boy rusty rufus whatever the notebook whatever was in the notebook was put there without any knowledge of reggie gerard fuller only trouble was where the hell was the notebook the old man was on a goddamn toot duane had never seen him like this his gears had slipped or something he was literally destroying his house from the inside out duane had worked his way around back of the proud old dwelling on reinie street which sat under a canopy of elms and maples with its stately porch like the house that andy hardy lived in and peered in through the windows though it was not yet dark the old man had turned on all the lights one by one he was emptying the insides out of every drawer every closet every box every cupboard every vase in the house he had cracked finally he was in a frenzy jabbering insanely to himself after doing the downstairs he moved upstairs though duane could no longer see him he took a chance and opened the door inside he could hear crashes and dumpings and things being thrown against the wall and curses goddamn sumbitch where the goddamn hell are you came the screams as from a desperate man a man close to an attack or something mr bama wasnt going to have to worry about this old guy hed end up doing himself in before the moon rose a vein would pop hed be a lump in a body bag for the coroners office duane called in a report but there was no immediate answer where the hell was bama you old worthless goat you dying old bastard you brainless worthless old dog you aint good for nothing ought to put you down take you out and put a bullet behind your ear only merciful thing sam looked about him the house was ruined smashed destroyed the rooms where his children played the room where he had loved his wife the room where so many thanksgiving dinners had been eaten the room where so many christmases had been celebrated all gone all lost all ruined all wrecked and for what for nothing because he couldnt remember where he put the goddamned notebook only the garage remained he was full of despair how had he gotten so old and feeble so infirm he hated and loathed himself heprosecutor man of the law war hero deer hunter father husband lover american how had all that gone away and he come to this current state of nothingness his daughter had told him it was time to move in with them or if he wanted into an apartment or even a home and his eldest boy had said no pops all right but now he thought she was right he could the office you old goat you never brought it home he remembered nowbob had handed it to him at the office and hed locked it in the safe he looked around for his coat but the only thing he could find immediately was his wifes pink bathrobe from years back he threw it on and miraculously found his keys he stepped into the garage fired up the cadillac and backed out with a shriek and a lurch hitting somethinghe wasnt sure what he drove and a new fear assailed him the combination did he know it could he remember it or was it gone like so much of the past he felt a whimper or possibly a sob rise from his chest and felt enfeebled by the task ahead he lacked all confidence he was over finished but after parking and somehow getting up the steps unlocking the office and walking through the waiting room into his lair a mercy came from on high and as his fingers flew to the ancient lock he saw the numbers before him big as daylight and in a second he had the vault open and the cardboard box out he took the treasure to his desk clicked on the light and stopped for just a second to fill his pipe with tobacco lighting it he drew a hot burst of smoke into his mouth felt it buzz then expelled it and for just a second was back in the good part of his life in command a man of respect and power not a cornpone backwoods lear raging on the moors of polk county the box held but two objects and then he remembered that bob and rustyrufusralphwhatever had taken the third a manila file with some yellowed newspaper clippings in them no matter what was here was what counted not the book of old traffic and speeding citations but the notebook earls jottings from early july it bore a brownish streak across the cover like one of those flings of paint that jackson pollock was so famous for and the edges of half the pages inside were brittle with the same brown substance sam drew back earls blood as he lay dying earl must have bled in the car on the notebook with a shudder he opened it the shock hit him first of all for ten years as theyd collaborated enforcing the law sam had read reports that earl filed and the mans handwriting was as familiar as his ownthen forty years of nothing now here it was back again in its familiar loops and whorls its orderliness its occasional underlinings its occasional misspellings the blood the writing it was as if earl himself had suddenly walked into the room so overpowering was the sense of his presence another little shudder went through sam as he tried to enter into earls mind earl how did you work what was your style investigators all have styles little things that are important to them that they recognize as they try to bring order to chaos what was earls he tried to remember then he remembered earls bench in his basement with every tool in its place and a place for every tool earl had no need for the creativity of chaos he believed in putting things in order his mind would work thus site body evidence conclusions no no no it wouldnt hed make conclusions after every section then hed list the conclusions at the end adding them up thats how hed do it thats how he always did it first up a drawing of the body in exactly the posture that sam remembered seeing it the next day with dotted diagonal lines orienting it toward landmarks tree rock and distance estimations earl had also scratched in some kind of crosshatching behind the body and identified it as shale wash adding in parenthesis no tracks hmmmm sam thought about that it was a new detail what kind of original site investigation had been done he tried to remember he himself hadnt gotten there till late the next afternoon after all that with earls death and hed been sleepless and irritable as well as depressed he remembered a lone deputy telling him the state police forensics people hadnt shown up and that lots of people from the town had come out to see the dead nigger girl so evidently there wasnt much site investigation other than earls the crime scene was hopelessly contaminated he turned the page to find concearls comments on the site it said only body moved dumped where no tracks could be found body moved this was new body moved why would reggie have but then he remembered reggie hadnt been uncovered yet no one would ask why reggie would move the body just as later investigators would not trouble to think about the body being moved since they already had reggie he turned the page the body itself there were descriptions of the various violations worked on poor shirelle including scrapes and abrasions visible in the private area as earl had so demurely called it he also described a grayish cast to skin suggesting passage of several days and some bloating he looked at the killing wound looks to be a massive hematoma in the right frontal quadrant of the skull and noted nearby rock smeared with blood as possible murder weapon but then something strange cause of death maybe not blow swelling and bruising around throat area suggests strangulation sam sat back also new to him strangulation where was this coming from maybe earl was mistaken on the other hand when the coroner looked at shirelle another two days had passed possibly shed swollen more and the swelling and bruising on her throat werent as visible or possibly because reggie was already in custody and there was a good deal of blood already in evidence nobody looked that carefully at the body what was the significance of the strangulation sam sawed away on this one and then had it if he strangled her there wouldnt be no blood or not much yet reggies shirt was stained fairly extensively with shirelles blood sam didnt like this one damned bit then he thought reggie strangles her hes not sure if shes dead he smashes her with the rock yes that would explain it but it was a raggedness an awkwardness an uncertainty where before there had only been absolute confidence his pipe was empty he scraped the cake out with his keys then refilled it lit and sucked it gurgled burning too hot wet and harsh a sure sign he was agitated and somewhat diluting the great tobacco rush he looked about it was dark now quite still he got up went to the window and looked out upon a small town at night lit here and there by a window radiating heat and light but generally still the only thing he could see was a sheriffs car parked down the street was it that goddamned duane peck what the hell could he want was sam now so feeble he needed fulltime supervision he went back to his desk wasnt this a goddamned fine kettle of fish how long was this going to last the old goat was completely wacky now he was at his office duane looked at his watch it was nearly nine hed been on the go since seven that morning this on three hours sleep off of yesterdays roaming only one thing to break the monotony middle of the afternoon there had been some kind of dustup on the radio some kind of big gunfight over on the taliblue trail in oklahoma about forty miles away he couldnt make any sense of it oklahoma highway patrol shit and calls for originally ambulances and fire trucks but then coroners but it was none of his business now he was just waiting from where he was he couldnt see muchjust the light beaming out of the old mans office from the window the old man had come to it a few seconds ago sucking on his pipe and stared for a bit then hed gone back duane wasnt quite able to see the old man which had him worried he was parked parallel to the curb across the street and down a bit so he got out of his car and walked into the square passed the statue of general george f james the iron general of vicksburg whod actually been born in polk county though he died in a brothel in savannah georgia at the age of eightyone surrounded by painted harlots and went and stood on a bench at the far side standing so with his binoculars he could see the top of sams body as the old man bent over whatever he was examining he was working away steadily and he looked to all the world like perry mason except of course for the pink bathrobe sam looked at the drawing it appeared to be a window on a onestory rounded building with a single line drawn from the top edge of the window to an inscription and here his penetrations into the mysteries of earls handwriting ceased reed dept it seemed to say now what the hell could that mean he looked at it a mystery what was the building what was the department of reeds he searched his memory for a fortyyearold hint but couldnt come up with a damned thing he looked again at the drawing maybe it wasnt a building maybe it was a television set but in there werent but ten televisions in all of polk county maybe it was a drivein movie screen but the nearest drivein movie screen was and always had been the skyvue in fort smith where sam sometimes took his children his pipe puffed dry he turned it upside down and smacked it into the ashtray dumping the shards of ash he looked around for his pouch working slowly enjoying the ritual and the cleansing effect it had on his mind he was going to pack the baccy into the bowl when he remembered to clean the cake but he couldnt lay a hand on his keys they were across the room he rememberedand so with his thick horny thumbnail he scraped gunk off the bowl and wiped it on his pants there that cleared the bowl he scrunched a wad of tobacco into the pipe clenched it between his old teeth lit a match and drew it to the bowl he sucked in and watched the suction take the flame draw it into the pipe and ahblast of smoke scented with the forest such a his fingernail his fingernail wore a crescent of ash deposit under its edge he looked again at the drawing it was the girls fingertip her nail the line ran from the rim of the nail to the inscription which he now realized said red dirt not reed dept for the period after dirt was a minor imperfection of the paper not from earls pen red dirt under her nails but there was no red dirt at that point off us wasnt now wasnt then red dirt means she was killed somewhere else yes and brought here red dirt meanslittle georgia he turned the page at the top under conclusions earl had written little georgia little georgia was a patch of red clay deposit not off route north of town but off northeast of town just before ink if shirelle had red dirt under her nails it could mean thats where she was killed but so what who would move her twelve fifteen miles what would be the point still sam could see how unimportant the red dirt under the nails would have been to a coroner who already knew that reggie gerard fuller had been arrested and charged with the murder or maybe it wasnt red dirt maybe it was blood from reggie but there had been no forensic material of that nature entered sam cursed himself maybe he hadnt pushed hard enough maybe he should have forced the coroner to do a bangup job and not miss a trick why had he been so sure it was reggie well because of the pocket the blood match the but more because of a limit to the imagination it was after all the world was a straightforward place with a straightshooting president a known red enemy with the hydrogen bomb and white people and colored separate and apart nothing was mixed up everybody knew where they stood things were what they seemed now all this that was going on with reggie and shirelle nobody could really have imagined it there wasnt room in the american mind in those days for such imaginings they came later after the murder of jfk after vietnam and watergate thats when people began to see conspiracies every damned place because once you admitted the idea of conspiracy the world changed paranoia ruled there were no limits there was no certitude that is what he hated so much about the modern world he had helped create it beheld no certitude for if there was a conspiracy involving the death of shirelle parker a poor negro child in the west arkansas of who knew where else it went and what else it contained and for the first time sam began to see that it might also though he couldnt understand how or why involve the strange behavior of jimmy pye and the death of earl swagger and if furthermore it involved a black man on the basis of the fact that no colored girl would have gotten into a car with a white man then things had gotten dense and complicated to no end it was like some terrible modern novel of the sort that sam couldnt read twisted crazy paranoid ugly cruel he knew he was onto something it scared him it exhilarated him it made him angry it made him sad quickly he jotted some notes on a big yellow legal pad so he wouldnt forget but he knew he wouldnt forget he felt dynamic forceful brilliant by god he thought i will get to the bottom of this and earls son and that damned boy rusty will help me duane peck called in and made his report sir i dont know but this old guys onto something hes all excited i can tell he discovered something and i dont know what hes been looking for something for three days and by god now hes found it what should i do the call came almost immediately bama sounded downcast depressed angered a bad day at the office he made peck go through it again very slowly he considered and then he told him what to do they stood on a little yellow hill under the blinding sun off to the east like a whitewalled city from a fairy tale lay some intricate structure with towers and mansards and subbuildings mcalester state penitentiary off to the west simple rolling oklahoma countryside here there were markers bleak and unadorned so thats it bob asked you brought me all this way to see this yes i did said russ thats what became of jimmy pyes only son thats what remains on this earth of what happened july the inscription simply said lamar pye a few feet away lay another one odell pye it said his cousin said russ jim pyes brothers boy a hopeless retardate belonged in an institution where no one would bother him you see what the pye blood got the two of them russ i just see two gravestones on a bare hill on a little bit of nowhere in oklahoma its like boot hill in some goddamned cowboy movie it dont mean a thing its just so obvious said russ dont you see it its all here murder a family of dysfunctional monsters the seed going from father to son its the brothers k set in oklahoma and arkansas over two generations son i dont know what the hell youre talking about but if it helps you to come look at it and say yeah hes dead hes gone thats fine glad to oblige russ looked at him sharply you scream at night russ said bob sometimes two three times lamar you scream or dad dad you got a mess of snakes up there you best get yourself some help see the chaplain wed say in the corps but see somebody russ shook his head im all right he said i just want to get this thing done with it aint about you and lamar pye your daddy took care of that all right lamar is in the ground hes finished its over thats your dads present to you the rest of your life and his girlfriend was his present to himself the end of the family that was his present to himself russ things arent as easy as you make them nothings that clear it feels clear said russ bitterly you going to be all right this thing could go crazy at any second maybe you ought to stay here in mcalester take the bus back to oklahoma city you could get your old job back work on the book from there id let you know what i eventually found out no this is my project i invented it well solve it together okay russ if thats what you want they walked down the hill a black inmate trusty waved at them you find what you want yes sir said bob that was lamar pyes grave you stopped at wasnt it yes it was said russ did you know him oooo no said the man as if a taboo had been violated no lamar was not friendly toward the brothers he was as mean as they come got to say this for him though he was a brave man he stood up in the joint and when it came his time he went down like a man he kilt two polices actually he just killed one the other one lived russ said my my do tell said the old trusty mildly they walked another fifty feet to the truck finding themselves in some kind of depression in the land so that down here the whitewalled prison was not visible you drive said bob russ climbed into the truck parked a few feet away shall we head back up to us hell no said bob looking at a map well go back the scenic way i got some thinking to do well head down to hawthorne and then over to talihina theres a real pretty road down that way takes us back over the mountains to blue eye the taliblue trail youll like it well be home for supper around noon red filed a flight plan that set him on a course of degrees southsouthwest toward oklahoma city it took him another half an hour to fuel up the cessna conquest and ten minutes after that for a takeoff clearance as american eagles pm from dallas into fort smith was landing but at last he was airborne the plane surged upward as red eased the stick back seemed to catch a little thermopane and rushed even faster skyward he leveled out at feet well below commercial traffic patterns scudded southwest toward the green mounds on the horizon that were the ouachitas the first leg all twenty minutes worth was easy flying beneath him the land was a blue haze rolling and vague without true detail not particularly revealing he loved to fly and was quite a good pilot perfect solitude the fascinations of the intricate machine that held him aloft with its clever compromise of dynamic forces and its endless stream of numerical data yet at the same time as mechanistic an equilibrium as it was there was still the wildness of the unpredictable the sense of being a true master of ones fate also it was for rich people mainly and red liked that quite a bit when he got ten miles north of blue eye he dropped down to feet and the details sharpened considerably he had no problem picking up the parallel roads of and as they plunged westward from just above blue eye which itself looked like a scatter of dominoes blocks cards and toys against the roll of the earth as he flew west the town disappeared and below him were just two roads cutting across the rolling mountains and valleys traffic on both of them was very light he leaned to his radio console switched to the security mode in the digital encryption system and keyed in the code hed selected from the quadrillion possibilities the same code selected in de la riveras radio on the ground the radio was now secure from intercept he picked up the microphone punched the send button and said yeah this is air come in please the radio fizzed and crackled and then de la riveras slightly hispanic tones came back at him yes i have you loud and clear that extender is working nicely said red i have you loud and clear no trouble installing it no sir one of the boys did army commo good position report please ah i have you visually you just buzzed my position im at the wayside just inside oklahoma i got a car with three men with me i got my other two units about twentyfive miles ahead right where cuts across what units are those were just calling them alpha and baker my car here is charlie im mike alpha and baker you there yes sir came a voice you got me visually i see you on the horizon youre still a few miles away okay im going to buzz to talihina and back thats where ill be when i get a visual ill confirm then ill trail him into your range when you see me youll know hes coming yes sir came the replies red dropped down a thousand feet at his altitude the cars on the mountain road were easily recognizable by type and color though not by make he was looking for a green pickup with one unpainted fender suppose he found one and directed it into the ambush and it was some mexican family traveling from bean harvest to bean harvest or some group of tender young college girls going to the little rock pearl jam concert he had a set of zeiss binoculars the finest that could be found in fort smith on a crash basis and from feet up he found he could get a very solid upclose and personal view of the vehicle there wouldnt be any mistakes he flew onward enjoying the freedom and the sense of the hunt off far to the left and a thousand feet higher he made out another flight a lear obviously headed south to dallas there was no other air traffic the road below was equally empty though he made out a station wagon pulling tourists along the vividly beautiful road as it rolled along the crest of the green mountains one of those ludicrous camper things a couple of private automobiles and one black and white oklahoma smokey pulled off by the side of the road on watch for speeders or merely dozing in the sun he switched from his secure channel to the oklahoma highway patrol frequency and heard nothing except the odd exchange between troopers somewhere in the area nothing of note he passed over the crossroads and the possibility of contact drew him ever lower down to feet maybe too low he didnt need faa complaints against his license but there were no other flights in view the road beneath him bright in the afternoon sun was a ribbon onward he flew all the way to talihina spotting nothing he veered and headed back along the highway now having risen to feet and raced back toward the ambush kill zone he could monitor the road just in case hed missed something but there were no green trucks okay boys he said into the radio when he was in range so far i got nothing you all okay were fine said de la rivera no police interest or anything havent seen a cop all day sir he glanced at his rolex it was by this time where the hell were they it was beginning to look like a wash hed guessed wrong he used some left rudder then dropped back down to feet and began to zoom up the road eyes peeled the traffic had really thinned out by now it wasnt green vehicle he dropped a little lower pickup truck he overflew it and got on the radio i got a possible got a possible copy you air okay let me just check this out he banked wide to the left left wingtip falling right rising the world going giddily topsyturvy as the two big engines drove the props through the air and came around again levelout about a half mile to the right of the road and saw the truck ahead of him he reached for the throttles eased them back the sound of engines racing could be heard for several miles and he didnt want to alert them at all gradually he gained on them trying not to force it or rush or anything when at last he was nearly parallel he set the plane on autopilot and drew the binoculars into position and diddled with focus green pickup unpainted left front fender dodge got you he thought exultant he applied a touch of right rudder a little aileron and gently banked to the right settling on a course of degrees due south he held the course for one minute loafing at eighty knots looking innocent putting distance between himself and the target two minutes he drummed his fingers on his thighs two minutes forty seconds red could take no more he quickly reset the trim tabs increased the pitch and pushed the throttles forward as the revs came up he executed a hard climbing turn to the left straining for altitude he was sweating air to mike air to mike are you there are you there he said hoping he was still in range yes sir said de la rivera i have them confirmed about twenty miles west of the cutoff theyre coming your way eta pm heres something i thought of said russ a theory let me just throw it out bob said nothing just waited they were cruising along the taliblue trail a twolane blacktop that ran along the crest of the ouachitas and had just blown by the crossroads with oklahoma ahead of them stretched empty road gritty and dusty from poor upkeep here in oklahoma on either side the mountain fell away not a cliff but a steep slope beyond on either side the valleys were deep and green to the right he could see the lesser ranges of the ouachitas the jack forks the kiamichis the winding stairs he heard something somewhere on the far edge of his consciousness that he couldnt quite place he ignored it go ahead he said in the movies or in books theres no such thing as coincidence no ones going to pay to see or read about some guy who just finds something or something just happens to him forrest gump shows that ones full of shit no no i mean normally forrest gump being an exception to the rules you cant russ i was just joking dont you got no sense of humor anywhere well said russ thinking no no he probably didnt anyhow in real life however absurd and irrational coincidence occasionally happens and i cant help but notice you have an army nightshooting program thats trying to develop tactics around nightvision devices in roughly the same area as the one where your father got hit at night maybe its not a conspiracy maybe its one of those insane ridiculous coincidences you saying forrest gump did it bob laughed russ breathed out his frustration now suppose he continued they had a patrol or something and they got lost got turned around and theyre off post and they watch this gunfight through the infrared scope where the details arent clear they watch as one guy kills two others and then he gets in a car hes going to get away maybe the sniper cant help himself he pulls the trigger and thats that wont work bob said he was in a tree had to be otherwise he couldnt have seen through the corn and there wouldnt have been that slight oval shape to the bullet hole russ nodded he thought goddammit he thinks hes so smart okay okay now maybe well you know the attitudes were different then there was very little press scrutiny they all thought they were on some kind of crusade against the communists they did test atom bomb radiation biological warfare lsd and some other stuff on unwary civilians maybe it was some test they had to shoot at a human target so theyre on the track of jimmy and bub because they know thosere clean kills without problems but theres a terrible mistake and your fathers the one that gets hit not bad said bob after a pause not bad wrong but not bad why wrong ill tell you why you remember that short little guy in the photograph the one preece couldnt remember yeah couldnt remember my ass i knew that little prick and anybody who knew him would remember him who was he his name was frenchy short he was cia all the way a cowboy on my second tour i was detached tdy to lead recon teams in liaison with the agency up near cambodia the frenchman was hanging around it was an outfit called sog studies and observation groups lots of very nasty boys frenchy had a little war going on in cambodia with some mercenary chinese called the nung and a marine officer named chardy as the xo frenchy thought he was lawrence of cambodia he was one of those goddamned screwball showboat guys the rules didnt apply to him he was bigger than the rules he was bigger than the service or the agency hell he was bigger than the fucking war he just happened to work for us but hed have worked for anybody it was the work he loved not no cause the point is i put out the question earlier who could put together the kind of operation fast and on the fly that connected the criminal world jimmy pye a wellplanned robbery a daring escape and brought it all off with my father getting whacked as the end result and nobody knowing any better well maybe two or three men in the world one of them being frenchy short that was his goddamned specialty and theres one other thing yeah when i derosed out of sog and headed back to the world frenchy drew me aside and asked me to ship him five hundred rounds of civilian ammunition i dont he carried a colt automatic in a tankers shoulder holster over his tiger suit i just assumed it was a same as mine no it was a super he told me how he loved the super it had so much less recoil than a for the same killing power plus extra rounds in the mag he called it a pros gun jesus said russ its more than but bob stopped a plane that was it the sound of an airplane engine steady not increasing in speed just low enough and far enough away almost a flys buzz go on said russ just shut up bob said what is dont look around dont speed up dont slow down you just stay very calm now bob said he himself didnt look around instead he closed his eyes and listened trying hard to isolate the airplane engine from the roar of the truck the buffeting of the wind the vibrations of the road in time he had it very slowly he turned his head yawning languidly as he went along off a mile on the right a white twinengine job maybe a cessna those babies went miles per hour either there was a terrific headwind howling out of the east or the pilot was hovering right at the stall speed to stay roughly parallel and in the same speed zone with the truck its more than coincidence bob said that you got the one man in america there who could do such a thing and that hes a great believer in the super just what jimmy was shooting i smell frenchy all over it i think frenchy threw it together real smart very fast a fucking agency home run the whole way not for the agency maybe but for someone else someone powerful that i guarantee you he glanced quickly out the window the plane was turning lazily away yeah wellits okay i mean you tensed up there now youre relaxed everythings okay right oh every goddamn things just superfine said bob yawning again except of course we are about to git ambushed air to alpha and baker said red holding steady at feet running east loafing again dangerously near stall alpha here came a voice what about baker oh yeah uh im here too i figured he said he was here youd know i was here forget figuring tell me exactly what i ask you got that yes sir said baker contritely okay i want you in pursuit hes about four miles ahead of you traveling around fifty miles an hour no smokeys no other traffic on the road you go into maximum pursuit but i am watching you and on my signal you drop down to fiftyfive i dont want him seeing you move superfast do you read yes sir then step on it goddammit yes sir you hang steady there mike and charlie no need you racing anywhere they are coming to you i see intercept in about four minutes im going to let alpha and baker close in then ill bring you and baker into play mike you read yes sir he looked back along the road and out of the distance watched as two large sedans roared along the highway at over a hundred miles an hour trailing dust and closing fast with the much slower moving truck oh i smell blood i smell the kill its looking very good alpha i see you and your buddy closing you just keep closing youre getting close okay now slow way down mike you and charlie now okay you start moving out nice gentle pace about fiftyfive we are two minutes away i got you both in play someone inadvertently held a mike button down and red heard strange things over the radiosome harsh tense scraping and what sounded like someone systematically turning a television set on and off then he realized that was the dry breathing of men about to go into a shooting war and they were cocking and locking their weapons for it words poured out of russ as if hed lost control of them and he could not control their tone they sounded high tinny almost girlish should we stop he moaned should we pull off and call the police is there a turnoff should we you just sit tight dont speed up dont slow down we got two cars behind us i bet we got some traffic ahead of us and we got a plane off on the right coordinating it we are about to get bounced and bounced hard russ saw bob shimmy in the seat but he could tell he was reaching to get something behind the seat without disturbing his upright profile he looked into the rearview mirror and saw two cars appear from behind a bend in the road heres the first and only rule said bob steadily cover not concealment i want you out of the truck with the front wheel well and the engine block between you and them their rounds will tear right through the truck and get to you otherwise russs mind became a cascade of silvery bubbles he fought to breathe his heart weighed a ton and was banging out of control there was no air i cant do it he said im so scared youll be all right bob said calmly were in better shape than you think they have men and they think they have surprise but weve got the edge the way out of this is the way out of any scrape we hit em so hard so fast with so much stuff they wish they chose another line of work ahead one and then a second vehicle emerged from the shimmery mirage the first was another pickup black and beatup and behind it keeping a steady rate fifty yards behind another sedan russ checked the rearview the two cars were drawing closer but not speeding wildly he made out four big profiles sitting rigidly in the lead car dont stare at em boy said bob as he overcame the last impediment and got free what he was pulling at in his peripheral vision russ saw that it was the ruger mini and the paper bag he pulled something compact from the bag russ realized it was the short automatic which he quickly stuffed into his belt on his right side behind his kidney he groped for something else russ looked up the truck drew nearer it was less than a quarter of a mile away it would be on them in seconds now where is it demanded bob of himself harshly fear large and raspy in his voice as he clawed through the bag his fear terrified russ more powerfully than the approaching vehicles what is he looking for russ wondered desperately red watched as his masterpiece unfolded beneath him with such solemn splendor it was all in the timing and the timing was exquisite de la rivera in the mike truck followed by the four men in charlie closed from the front at around forty miles per hour meanwhile the alpha and baker vehicles moving at the speed limit steadily narrowed the distance between themselves and swagger they would be fifty or so yards behind him when de la rivera hit swaggers truck and blew it off the road youre closing nicely alpha and baker he crooned youre looking good there mike they had him it would work red pulled in his breath felt his heart inflate and his blood pressure spiral de la rivera was now taking over okay muchachos is so very muy bueno lets be very very calm now lets stay calm and cool i see you alpha youre so very fine lets do a quick double check on our pieces make sure we got our mags seated our bolts locked our safeties in the red zone lets stay muy glace icy icy very icy very cool its happening oh its gonna be so good for all of us the vehicles were closing they had reached a flat high section of the road where the dwarf icepruned white oak lay gnarled and stunted on either side yielding swiftly to vistas on either side of other ranges now you listen said bob fiercely this trucks going to try and whack you the split second before you pull even to him i want you to drop to second and gun this motherfucker that should carry us by his lunge and cut the two boys off behind us then i want a hard left you rap the rear of his follow car really mess him up shake up the boys inside you continue from that into a hard left panic stop we skid across the road and come to rest in the shoulder on that side sos we can fall back and get into them trees and down the side of the mountain if need be okay youre coming out my side of the vehicle and youre breaking left to the front wheel well where youre going to cover you take the bag your job is going to be to feed me magazines from the bag as i need them you watch when i pop a mag you hand me the next one bullets out sos i can slap her in and get back to rock and roll yes sir said russ trying to remember it all desperate that he would forget it but amazed somehow that already there was a plan and somehow also calmed by it and bob seemed calm too you gotta stay calm you gotta stay cool said bob im okay russ said and he was ah said bob here the goddamn thing is and with that he withdrew something from the bag and russ could see that it was a long curved magazine different from the others with a redtipped cartridge seated in its lips the truck was on them it was happening right now whats that russ had time to ask as the universe unlatched from reality and fell into dreamlike slow motion he heard bob seat the magazine and with a clak let the bolt fly home forty rounds m ball tracer said bob were fixing to light these boys up red watched in full anticipation of his precisely choreographed envelopment simultaneously banking to the left and adding power so that he could hold the spectacle beneath him as he circled around it gulllike he watched as the vehicles seemed to combine and it was almost magical the way hed seen it in his mind and it was working out in reality but there seemed to be something it was happening so fast there was dust so much dust he couldnt confusion hed never seen a battle before except in the movies but in the movies everything was clear that was the point of movies here nothing was clear it was a helterskelter some new dance a reinvention he heard them on the radio as it unfolded in microtime ah no goddamn whang the jarring bang of metal on metal jesus what is look out hes firing hes oh fuck were on fire christ were burning im hit im hit oh shit im hit the flames the flames beowwwwwwwwwwwwwww a highpitched scream pierced reds ears as he banked around he winced shuddered wondering what the hell that was and when he saw the geyserlike surge of blazing gasoline he knew the microphone had melted it was happening the trucks fender with its cyclopslike headlight was as big as a house falling on him but at that second russ slammed the gearshift punched the pedal and with a surprising giddy lightness his own vehicle shot ahead and the oafish rammer missed veered to correct and jacked out of control tumbling savagely backwards amid a sudden huge blast of dust bobs left hand reached for the wheel and wrenched it to the left with a tremendous jolt the pickup slammed into the follow car rocked crazily and continued to spin around hauling up a shroud of dust as it fishtailed then came to a rest crazily canted to one side half in and half out of the roadside gully through it all russ had the ghastly sensation of ghosts as faces lit up by rage and surprise floated by in the follow car so close yet so far away he felt that he was looking at men under ice in a different world their mouths working madly their eyes swollen like his mothers deviled eggs from so long ago then it all went to swirl and blur and vanished in the weird perspective of the canted windshield and the cloud of rolling dust he blinked wasnt he supposed to be doing something out goddammit barked bob and russ clawed at his safety belt glad that hed had it on felt it fall away and began to slither across the seat after already vanished bob and out the door he remembered the bag and felt the loaded mags rattling around inside as he disengaged from the vehicle slid fast down the front fender of the truck to the wheel well where bob had already set up in a taut hunched shooters position russ couldnt dive for cover he had to see when he looked over the hood the spectacle stunned him upside down the black pickup had cantilevered onto the shoulder on the other side of the road in its own cloud of dust cutting off that lane the two cars following bob and russ had slewed to a halt behind it just coming out of their own panic stops and skids they appeared to have collided themselves the rear one smashing into the front one the trucks follower had also slewed to a halt to avoid smashing into the destroyed truck it was almost directly across the road from russ there was a moment of horrified silence inside the cars men fumbled in confusion trying not to shoot each other trying to locate their target which wasnt where it should be then from just behind russ bob fired even in the bright light of day the tracers leaked radiance to mark their passage as they flew across the narrow distance they were like phenomena in a physics experiment ropes of incandescence as straight as if drawn by a ruler unbearably quick quicker than a heartbeat or a blink illusions possibly bob fired three rounds inside a second low into the car directly across from him what was he shooting for not men for he was shooting not into the passenger compartment but above the rear tire and russ then the car was gone in a huge flash as the tracers lit up its fuel tank the noise was a thunderclap throwing feathers of flame everywhere as it seemed for one delirious second it was raining flame all around them the world caught fire and a wave of crushing heat rolled against russ he heard screams in the roar and a flaming phantasm ran at him but fell under the weight of its own destruction into the roadway motion struck at russs peripheral vision and he saw that one of the follow cars had gunned from behind the topsyturvy truck coming around coming around he screamed but bob was shooting even as russ yelled and the tracers flicked quick and nasty like a whipcrack and seemed to liquefy the oncomers windshield it dissolved into a sleet of jewels as the car lost control and went hard into the gully kicking up a gout of dirt magazine magazine bob screamed and russ slapped a twentyrounder bullets outward into his palm and he sunk it into the rifle freed the bolt to slam forward just as the third car came around bristling with guns but bob took it cleanly riddling its windshield with a burst of ball ammunition and then held fire emptying what remained of the magazine into the windows and doors as the car went by the car never deviated but sped by furiously more as if it hoped to get away than do them any harm and a hundred yards down the road it noticed that its cargo was dead men and it veered into a gully lurched out surfing a wave of dirt and grass and came to a broken ending amid splintered white oaks and suddenly it was quiet except for the dry cracking of the wind and the hiss of the flames jesus you got them all russ said in utter astonishment and devotion but bob was by him in hand hed seen something two men with submachine guns had extricated themselves from the wreckage in the gully just before them and started up the little embankment but bob stood above them and got his pistol into play so fast it was a blur did they see him yet one did and tried to get his weapon on target but bob fired so quickly russ thought for a second he had some kind of machine gun floating six empties in the air and the two shooters went down like rag dolls one was an immense man in an expensive jumpsuit with gold chains on he lay flat eyes blinkless and vacant as the blood turned his sweatshirt strawberry and an odd detail leaped out at russ he had a necklace of scar tissue as if someone had gone to work on his throat with a chain saw but only got halfway around before thinking the better of it another moment of silence bob used it to change magazines russ looked around jesus christ he said it reminded him of tv coverage of the highway of death out of kuwait city after the warthogs and the blackhawks finished a good days killing four wrecked vehicles one on its back one boiling with black oily flame of petroleum products oxidizing into the sky bodies and blood pools and shards of glass and discarded weapons everywhere what do you think of that you motherfucker bob suddenly shouted and russ saw that he was screaming at a white airplane a half mile out low and banking away to the south you got them all said russ you must have killed twenty men more like ten they were professionals they took their chances now lets see if we done bagged a trophy then he strode across the littered roadway to the ramming truck upside down and half in the gully the odor of gasoline was everywhere he opened the door and peered in russ looked over his shoulder inside in a posture of unbearable discomfort that signaled something important had broken was a toughlooking hispanic with creamy silver hair and an expensive suit over an open silk shirt the angle of his neck suggested that it was broken pain lay across his handsome face like a blanket turning him gray under the olive tones of his skin his eyes were glazing and his breath was labored bob pointed the the man laughed and his eyes came back into focus he held a lighter in his left hand fuck you man he said im already dead you cracker motherfucker his voice was a little lilting with cubano accent an odd play of chs through it i flick my bic and we all going to heaven it wont blow partner itll only burn fuck you said the cubano whos the man in the plane bob demanded the man laughed again his teeth were blinding white he made a little move with his free hand and russ flinched but bob didnt shoot instead both watched as the hand reached his shirt and pausing only once or twice in pain ripped it open the brown chest was latticed with extravagant tattoos whats that supposed to mean bob said im marisol cubano you norteamericano cabrón you puta fucking castro couldnt break me in his prisons man you think im going to talk to some hillbilly homeboy he laughed you are one tough customer said bob that i give you he holstered the lets go he said to russ hey screamed the man in the truck i say this to you motherfucker you got some balls on you my friend you cubano maybe desi arnez done fucked your mama when your daddy was out fucking the goats i dont think so said bob we didnt have no tv they turned and were back at their own truck when the cubano ended his misery the truck flared as it went and the heat reached bob and russ it was nearly dark when red landed back at fort smith he taxied the conquest to the hangar and instructed his mechanic to secure it from the flight he went to the parking lot where his two bodyguards ever astute ever loyal ever dreary waited in their car he got into his mercedes and drove home honey said miss arkansas runnerup how did it go today oh it was all right he said you know sort of unsettled but all right then he and his two youngest children watched a videotape of black beauty a favorite of the kids and truth be told a movie that he himself didnt find too irritating after the kids were in bed he watched the news the big story of course was the drugdealer shootout only a hundred miles away in oklahoma on the taliblue trail ten men dead four pounds of uncut cocaine recovered an oklahoma state police spokesman said authorities were still trying to figure out what had happened but the unburned bodies had all been identified as professional criminals tied to miami dallas and new orleans with long records of violent felonies and that conjecture at this time was leading in the direction of some kind of drug shipment ambush that got out of hand and ended up in a flatout battle on one of oklahomas prettiest highways thank god the cop said no innocent people were hurt only after the news was over and the kids were in bed did he step out of denial and face the reality he was in big trouble this guy swagger was the best whod ever come at him and at least in the ten years after his father had been killed men came after him regularly and hed beaten them all now he knew he had to do something very clever very subtle and extremely professional or he would lose it all he looked around at his house and thought of his kids from this marriage and the kids from his first marriage and wondered what would happen to them if this guy swagger took him it terrified him he had a drink and then another and then the buzzer on his beeper sounded he called his number and got pecks report then he called peck hes gone now he asked yes sir what should i do peck i have to know what hes onto can you get inside that office yes sir said peck okay i want you to break in and make careful notes of his papers i want to know what he knows do you understand yes sir i dont need any more surprises he said he hung up he would have gone to bed but somehow miss arkansas runnerup real tits or no didnt seem to amuse him tonight instead he placed one more phone call and arranged for a quick blow job from a black crack whore that expressed his mood perfectly he watched as the old man finally turned the light off and then fortyfive seconds later emerged from the office still in his wifes bathrobe climbed into the cadillac and drove off with a shaky squeal of brakes and too much acceleration duane checked his watch it was he decided to give it another fifteen minutes but only lasted seven before he started to drift off he knew he was dangerously exhausted so he got out of the car walked down the street with his flashlight throwing beams into crannies just as if he were on patrol investigating a prowler or something then boldly pushed the door naturally the old man had left it open he stepped in and followed the flashlight beam up the stairs to the office dammit that door was locked he reached into his wallet and fumbled with a plastic credit card like many policemen he was skilled at some small criminal crafts that hed picked up over the years and it didnt take more than a few seconds manipulation of the card and the doorknob before he popped the lock and stepped into the outer office he strode quickly through it and into the old mans lair the odor of pipe smoke still lingered sweetly in the air he went quickly to the safe behind the desk and pulled it gently sometimes a man will snap his vault closed and not spin the dial and therefore not set the lock but no crazy old geezer that he was old sam had spun the dial and the lock was solid and beyond duanes abilities to penetrate so instead he went to the windows and pulled the shades then he turned on the lights the place was a mess the old bastard seemed to be on some mission of selfdestruction he was systematically trashing everything he owned or held dear papers were strewn about everywhere one of the file cabinet drawers had been dumped on the old carpet duane sat at the desk littered with old files and reports he paged through them hmmmm most seemed to have to do with there was a letter from some woman which he slipped into his pocket he shifted papers about and came across a report on a pretrial hearing dating from july for the case of reggie gerard fuller on a count of firstdegree murder hmmmm what the hell was this all about it probably had to do with the niggers the old man had been visiting why was he visiting niggers what was he up to did it have anything to do with swagger he noticed a legal pad it wasnt written on but someone had just torn the top page off of it and the heavy inscription of a pen had been embossed in the texture of the paper beneath he held it up to the light shifting it trying to find angles on it words in old gnarled writing began to emerge moved body little georgia strangled hmmmmm again he felt a smug little blast of triumph wouldnt mr bama be pleased he heard a clatter of noise the swift thump of feet and the door blew open what the goddamn hell are you doing said sam vincent the old man drove home heavily agitated his imagination foundered against one significant problem who on earth in in west arkansas would have considered it worthwhile to engineer a great conspiracy to place the blame for the death of a young girl on an innocent black boy what would be the point he could see no point but he tried to break it down into parts and see how it fit together and he kept coming back to one thing someone didnt want anybody to know that shirelle was killed at little georgia little georgia was the key the significance of moving the body had to be that there was evidence somewhere somehow that linked the killer to little georgia if someone had found the body at little georgia then by god there was some obvious physical link to little georgia which would have led inexorably to the killer what could that have been what would have placed someone at little georgia he tried to think what he could do to dig up the connection what it could be there had to be a document or at least something prominent in the memory of someone easily accessible at the time maybe a landuse permit maybe a site examination as from an engineer or an architectural firm maybe a bill of sale he tried to consider all the documents that could relate to a piece of land or a section of the county suddenly he screeched to a halt panic hit him suppose he forgot this suppose it had vanished in the morning in that great black fog that rolled in across his mind so frequently home was still ten minutes ahead the office was only five back he cranked into a uturn bumping up on a curb and crushing what had to be someones bushes and with a blast of acceleration headed back what the goddamn hell are you doing here demanded the old man who the hell are you anyway ahmr sam its duane peck the deputy i uh seen your lights on i came up hell you left the door wide open and the lights blazing ise just checking to make sure nothing was missing or that there werent no prowlers the old man didnt blink or back down he didnt retreat into confusion the hell you say i did no such goddamned thing i turned my goddamned lights off and locked my office what are you doing here sitting at my goddamned desk like you own the place pugnaciously he advanced his shrewd old eyes ate duane up he saw that duane was holding the tablet in his hand what the hell are you doing with that nothing duane said you were snooping you were spying you damned spy what the hell are you doing then his eyes knitted up into something tight and knowing who you working for you working for them aint you you nocount piece of white trash sir i aint working for nobody duane said rising awkwardly still the man advanced on him you aint working for the sheriff no sir i know the sheriff and you aint working for him who are you working for you tell me you trashy dog or by god i will beat it out of your scrawny hide and hang you out to dry in the morning sir i aint working for nobody duane said alarmed at the old mans fiery temper well goddammit you better believe well find out about that yes sir we will get to the bottom of that he pivoted slightly to pick up the phone he dialed duane watched him stupefied it was happening so quick he tried to think what to do his mind was blank a vapid empty hole would they make him tell about mr bama what about the money he owed would he still owe it to mr bama what about his new job and how well he was doing on it what about working for mr bama personally the flashlight rose in his hand almost as if on its own will and duane brought it down with a thunderous thud on the back of the old mans neck he felt the shiver of blunt instrument striking meat and bone and in the impact thought he heard or felt the sensation of something brittle breaking sheriffs department came the voice over the phone the old man stiffened reached back for his wound and turned his face black and lost his eyes pools of emptiness duane smashed him again this time where the neck met the shoulder a powerful downward diagonal blow that made the head twitch spastically the phone fell free and banged on the floor and the old man took a stricken step backwards face gray old tongue working pitifully in an old mouth then toppled to the earth as his eyes rolled upward sheriffs department anybody there duane recognized the voice as debbie tills the nightduty dispatcher he hung it up he was breathing hard his knees felt weak the old man lay still but was still breathing duane tried to figure what to do next he could just leave and theyd find him here and ascribe it to a prowler but then thered be an investigation suppose someone had seen his car parked outside then he had it he wiped the phone off with his handkerchief in case hed left prints then he quickly turned off the lights pausing to rub the switches with the handkerchief he stuffed the tablet with the engraved words into his shirt then he hoisted sam under his arms feeling the old mans lightness and brittleness the old man stirred weakly then went limp duane hefted him because he knew if he dragged him hed leave a trail in the dust and got him to the head of the stairs he paused for just a second this is what mr bama wants he told himself he took a deep breath gathered his strength and then launched the old man into the air sam hit on the fourth step shattering his teeth and rolled legs and arms flopping down the stairwell gathering speed and violence as he went until he smashed to a halt on the downstairs doorjamb duane breathed heavily he went back to the office pulled the door shut and heard it click he wiped his prints off the knob then he went down the stairs stepping over the body after the fight bob bypassed blue eye and caught the boss harry etheridge parkway and took a straight shot north up to fort smith he wanted to put as much distance as he could between himself and the shooting site from now on we operate as if we can be jumped at any time do you understand they are hunting us we only got out because the boss man didnt trust his troops and had to control the thing from the air and i saw the plane without that jump i wouldnt have had time to make a plan and wed be dead russ nodded gravely as if he understood as if he were functioning normally but he was not he was still half in shock so much carnage so fast so much noise so much smoke it was so confusing was all he could think to say then it poured out i mean my god it just happened the shooting was so loud jesus the explosions we were so lucky the whole thing just went berserk i never knew the universe could go so psychopathic so twisted jesus you were unbelievably calm you were like ice i could hardly breathe bob wasnt listening he was thinking aloud and i want to stow this truck as soon as possible itll take the police two days worth of forensic examination before they realize there was another vehicle involved and another weapon then theyll find our tread type and match the paint we left on that boy when we cropped him and come looking for us i dont think theres enough left of that car to get a sample of its own paint much less any of ours russ said you cant be too sure ill longterm it at the airport and well rent a car next i got to find that frenchy short it was six before they were checked into a ramada inn on south of town the truck hidden and bob set about finding frenchy short first he called a friend he knew at the retired marine officers association in los angeles a retired gunnery sergeant who ran the clerical section of the association and quickly came up with the number of a former captain named paul chardy whom bob placed in memory as having worked with frenchy at sog he dialed the number in some town called winnetka illinois and got no answer until after several subsequent tries he connected around pm a woman answered the phone hello maam im trying to reach captain paul chardy usmc retired may i ask what this is in reference to yes maam he and i served together in in the central highlands im trying to locate a third man both of us knew one second please he heard her yell paul paul honey its some marine thing the voice came on hello captain chardy well no ones called me that in quite a while im a high school basketball coach now sir i dont know if youll remember me i ncoed up at base camp alice near cambo and briefed you when you came in country in august i served with you for six months before i derosed home my name is gunnery sergeant bob lee swagger and bob the nailer my god yes i remember you you were the best recon team leader sog ever had and when you went back for your third tourwell gunny its an honor to talk to bob the nailer hell yes i remember thank you sir thank you gunny you had a hell of a war you showed the rest of us how to do it sir reason im calling im trying to find another man in country with us he was civilian spook type you were closer to him than i was you and him ran a number of missions together as i recall frenchy yes sir oh christ i havent thought about frenchy in years poor old frenchy bob thought he heard something in the mans voice some odd tone regret buried pain the stirring of memories best left untouched in the darkness sir well gunny the frenchman didnt make it his adventures caught up with him bob cursed silently frenchy was pure spook that ill tell you he crammed several hundred lifetimes into one yes sir yes well he recruited me i spent well its not worth going into a long story not a very pretty one after the war i spent four years on an agency contract and frenchy was my case officer i went back for a hitch tdy in but frenchy well he paused bob could sense the pain i shouldnt tell you this its all off the record you never talked to me frenchy was captured and killed by a soviet gru colonel in vienna in tortured to death not a pretty story im sorry sir bob said and then had to ask the next question what happened to the colonel somebody blew him out of his socks said chardy in a voice that said he didnt want any more questions asked can i ask you something go ahead gunny what was frenchy short capable of under orders or not under orders what would he do chardy thought a bit finally he said anything he was capable of anything the truth is even though they had his name on a plaque on the wall at langley frenchy sold me to the russians in when i was in kurdistan there were unpleasant consequences he had no conscience he was a great man who was capable of great evil not that uncommon a combination whatever you think he did he probably did and worse did he ever say anything about a job in arkansas in the fifties an agency scam something very black involving infrared stuff gunny he never talked about the past and if youd seen him operate you wouldnt want to know about the past yes sir thanks very much you okay gunny you need help or anything no sir im fine you told me what i needed to know good luck to you sergeant semper fi semper fi sir he turned to russ good man but goddammit now where we going to go what aboutto dinner russ said yeah yeah said bob they went to the motel restaurant and sat down bob ordered a cheeseburger russ the tuna salad but bob wouldnt or couldnt talk russ had never known a man quite like this he just locked himself off still almost in repose his face dark and wary his eyes alert but a definite no trespassing sign impressed in the set of lines he only pretended to eat something about chardy or frenchy or that lost war and the men it devoured was dogging him russ guessed uh i have an idea said russ what i said i have an idea lord spare us said bob frenchy short is gone youre not going to get anything out of the agency thats a given so we have to move from what weve got our first principle your father knew something thats what got him killed well my thought is that we should locate whoever is left of the people he spoke to on the last day not casually but his friends your mother is gone sam we spoke to sam he didnt say anything but didnt he mention bob nodded miss connie he said he remembered her too from all those years ago an imposing beautiful woman in her fifties who came from the east and was married to and widowed by rance longacre the county aristocrat she had a son he died young too she had a kind of doomed quality about her everybody she ever knew or loved died he had some memory coming home on leave back sometime in the early sixties before the war that someonehis mother possiblyhad told him shed left and gone back no his mother was dead then sam sam knew her shed be in her nineties now bob said that is if shes alive if her mind hasnt gone if we could find her if she would talk maybe sam would know where she went he would have said something i have the impressioni dont know whythat there may have been something between them but it ended badly he never talks about her um said russ digging into his salad damn boy dont you ever eat meat it isnt good for you hell it didnt do me any harm im fifty goddamned years old and i may live another two or three days if im lucky he smiled finally and russ saw that he was joking again but its a good idea he continued its a damned good idea maybe sam will know wouldnt that be nice well call him tonight maybe hes found that coroners brief or whatever it was they got back to the room and called but there was no answer and russ tried ten more times i wonder where that old bastard is bob said maybe hes got a new girlfriend russ said finally in the morning somebody answered at sams the voice vaguely familiar confounded bob sam uh im trying to reach sam vincent who is this please asked the man ah my name is bob lee swagger and bob bob its john vincent sams eldest son john was a physician in little rock bob knew and he also knew the tone of voice that hushed exhausted tone that communicated in its remoteness the bad news is something wrong bob dad died last night oh god said bob who really thought sam would live forever like some magnificent old blackmaned lion howling toothlessly at the moon he felt the news as a physical pain a loss of breath and stability he sat down on the bed what happened he finally asked you know dad was slipping in and out of gears well last night he went to his office late on some fool errand or other something in the way his mind worked he was wearing my mothers bathrobe and no socks and two different shoes he slipped and fell at the top of the stairs and broke his neck in two places at least it was clean and over in an instant john i owe my life to your father he was a damned good man but you couldnt tell him anything i pleaded with him to move in with us there was plenty of room he could have gone to any of his children you know there was money for a nurse a home anything but dad was set in his ways bob could say nothing they found him at seven this morning i got a call at seventhirty and just got here lord i dont know what got into him he tore his house apart and he tore his office apart he was looking for something bob realized he was looking for that coroners document i just saw him a day or two ago he was big as life and twice as mean you know he loved your father he thought your father was the best man that ever lived and he loved you bob im glad you got to spend some time with him before it happened the funeral will be in a few days friday i think and after well hold a family wake wed really like to see you ill be there said bob he sat on the bed paint it black hello darkness death was no stranger hed seen it come in many forms and shipped it out more than any man ever should but this one hit him particularly hard he sat and looked at the wall until the wall went away replaced by a great nothingness in time russ came in from his room dressed and ready to go and asked what was wrong and bob told him then retreated back into his emptiness nothing seemed to happen bob just sat there lanky and still and sealed off who could tell what was going through his mind russ thought of achilles in his tent sulking nursing his anger into a fury so pure nothing could stand before it the funeral russ finally asked no said bob not with people hunting us thats sure where theyd look he shook his head then he said they took my father then they took his body his memory now theyve taken sam you think you saw sam whatever he was he was not infirm he did not have balance problems he would not fall down stairs someone pushed him because again he found something out he was looking for that coroners report or something he found it someone was watching him he had to be stopped some hero sent him flying down those steps russ saw where they were the place called paranoia deep into the culture of conspiracy where everything was a part of the plot evidence of the sinister tendencies of the universe he could have just fallen he was an old man he didnt just fall some men fall not sam you think im nuts you think im making all this up tell me sonny they was hired gunmen with submachine guns trying to fry our asses in oklahoma wasnt they yes its true but to whered that goddamn deputy who was dogging us go we was dogged by that deputy then he disappears and the gun boys come onto the scene so wheres the deputy go we wont go to the funeral but we will go to the wake you nosy around you see if anybody saw that deputy thats your job but hes just a little man theres someone behind this thing you mark my words watching us setting all this up and i will by god find him and face him down and well see who walks away yes sir said russ seeing that no headway could be made against the iron of bobs rage but the funeral aint till friday todays tuesday todays the day you find connie longacre you got that russ nodded then he said all right i can do that no sir said duane peck no sir not at all sir i never seen him i went up there i got what i could what i just give you and i got out that was it like many policemen he was adept at lying he had the liars best gift he could absolutely convince himself that what he was saying was the truth convince his own respiratory system and come eventually to believe it wholly he didnt swallow or tremble he didnt breathe raspily or touch his mouth he had no difficulty meeting anyones eyes his pupils did not get small and far away his face color did not change you had nothing to do with the old mans death then said red bama they were in the back room behind nancys flamingo lounge where he had summoned duane when he heard the news no sir did not hell i wouldnt do nothing to a old man i got respect for the old thats whats destroying this country sir lack of respect his face was perfectly passive as he spoke his voice was calm earnest under control his throat unfilled with phlegm his heart beat dully you cant be killing people when you decide to said red theres something called the law of unintended consequences it brings everything down besides he was such an old man i swear to you said duane sir i swear to you i had nothing to do with that all right said red wanting somehow to believe in him but not quite yet doing so entirely sir he had gone crazy i told you how he tore his stuff apart going back to that office in his wifes bathrobe falling down them stairs hell it was a tragedy the old gentleman needed looking after its a crime his damn family didnt do nothing for him all he done give them bama nodded he examined the exhibits before hima scrap of a hearing report from a letter in flowery script from some woman named lucille parker dated and a yellow tablet faintly inscribed with the impression of writing on a top page now missingthen looked back at duane sir if you hold that tablet up to the light you can sort of make out what the hell its all about i see the word all right peck thats enough i want you back in blue eye but doing nothing you wait for me to contact you is that clear you do not want to be eyeballing bob lee swagger you stay away from him for now he may sniff something out on you i may need you for him later if i can figure out a way yes sir uh sir uh about my gambling debts forgotten duane youre no longer working in the red youre in the black dont blow it the pays five hundred a week starters full medical benefits of course you keep your deputys job thats why youre worth anything at all i bet i could git bob lee for you dont even think about it said red hell know and hell come for you there are ten men fried to crisps on a highway who thought hed be easy now go on get out of here after peck left red went over and filled a styrofoam cup with the rancid bar coffee it was an important time he had to make some decisions he had to kill bob lee swagger and kill him quickly but firepower the best professional killers a dream team of hit men had not worked he realized now that sheer violence wasnt the answer stealth was cleverness planning nerve execution again by god underneath his melancholy and his acid distaste for duane peck he was oddly happy swagger this guy was brilliant he was the best that red had ever come against smart and brave and calm and resourceful if many guns couldnt do it what could hmmmmm maybe one could how else to kill a sniper but to snipe him in his orderly mind he tried to list his advantages first though swagger of course knew he was being hunted he had no idea by whom or why other than the general suspicion that it had something serious to do with issues of forty years ago which he was currently investigating that gave red the opportunity really for any kind of approach and the more he thought the more he realized that the key to today lay in yesterday there had to be a way to put something before swagger something which beckoned him and which he could not deny whose call he would answer even if he knew it might kill him in that way the cautious and wary man could be destroyed red was in a curious state he throbbed with creativity he understood the shape the values the thrust of the project he was undertaking he just did not yet know the details the connections yet really the details could come later it was the excitement of creation that overwhelmed him so he set to work he had to understand everything about forty years ago the past held the answers with that in mind he went back into another room where an ancient wall safe lay it held the treasures and secrets of his own fathers empire he had a moment here of sentimentality as his fingers touched the worn old knob of the dial he knew his fathers fingers had touched it thousands of times he thought of his father that shrewd and disciplined man selftaught and vast of insight part tyrant part genius who came from nowhere really that was the thing the man came from nowhere he was born dirtpoor and barefoot in a sharecroppers shack in polk county in amid appalling conditions of nutritional deprivation impoverishment brutality and the general coarseness of life in that station and that time he had been beaten savagely which is why he never beat his only son he had been laughed at and called hillbilly and white trash by the quality who secretly feared him as they feared all longboned paleeyed members of the rural proletariat yet hed come up to fort smith in a fourteenyearold boy on his own because he was smart enough to sec nothing could happen in polk county and if there was a future it lay in the city hed gotten a job as a numbers runner for colonel tyree who ran the town then from a grand suite in the old ward hotel it wasnt a big job a comers job just a job running numbers for a criminal organization that would not mourn him for a second if he fell under the wheels of a train or was ground to pulp by the wagon teams that still dominated garrison street in those days but like the gift he passed on to his son red ray bama had a talent for numbers for lightning calculation and understood that the secrets of the universe lay within none of reds own children had such a thing but then bless them they didnt need one he was wary and shrewd and his rise was the classic american gangsters which mirrored the horatio alger myths of the larger population that in crime as in industry the hardest most tireless worker and the shrewdest most able calculator ended up the winner he went from running numbers to running pawnshops to shylocking to managing casinos and cribs to investing there were always three or four layers between himself and his violence though three times assassins attempted to nail him he trafficked in flesh but did not partake of it he lent money but never borrowed it he sold drugs but never took them nor allowed anybody around him to take them he understood the dynamic of the separate black and white populations though he was even at some remove a killer he never committed other crimes which some would judge more harshly he was not a racist and did business with black gangsters eventually taking over their rackets not out of fear but out of trust he was not a psychopath and only killed when it was necessary he never killed families or siblings he never killed indiscriminately he never tortured or brutalized he was the last thing a redneck pauper should have been an honorable gang lord a gentleman but of late red had been thinking that there was more to his father than his professional triumphs it wasnt that he succeeded eventually it was that he had the imagination to conceive success in the first place and that the most precious gift he gave his only child wasnt a business or an inheritance or a network of connection though all were nice no it was his whole life as red drove the highways in his mercedes hed sometimes see himself but in overalls weighted down by hopelessness toothless and scrawny destitute of selfbelief hed think except for dad that could be me his fathers single bravest act had been to leave the country and reinvent himself as a city man on the face of it quite an accomplishment no chums nobody looking out for him nobody easing the way a scrawny poorwhitetrash hillbilly from the remote ouachitas barefoot and unexposed to any kind of culture whatsoever almost illiterate yet in a single generation he was able to give his son a whole different world a prep school education four years at the university of arkansas exposure to ideas possibilities stimulations his son never had to wake at four to slop the pigs or wake at five to bring in the wood to light the fire or work in the fields from dark till dark to chop enough cotton or plant enough corn so that the man would leave a few kernels for the sharecropping family to live on and his sons children they were so far removed from that they couldnt even imagine it to them it was a bad movie called the beverly hillbillies not funny at all just about crude backward stupid trashy people i hope im up to you old man he thought i will sure as hell try and be equal to your legacy reds father died in a bomb blast out front of nancys in red was working as a vicepresident of what was then called bama trucking inc his immediate response was not to mourn but to prepare for the assault on his power his position and his organization that inevitably followed the assassination of a boss yet strangely it never came though some years later and some years after that interlopers moved against him both easily defeated thus the mystery of his fathers death became a prime obsession of his he had spent over on private investigation trying to solve the mystery why when lieutenant will jessop the fort smith homicide dick who had been assigned the case retired in red put him on retainer per annum to keep up the investigation privately red himself had used all his underworld contacts through a variety of subterfuges and come up after all the time effort and money with nothing the problem with the case was simply that it yielded only one answer to cui bono that is red himself and he didnt do it though it had probably been said of him he knew lacking a motive to sustain it no other explanation made any sense for example no lieutenant of the organization benefited and no phone tap or private observation had yielded the slightest smattering of a clue no outoftowner gained anything from it it could only be revenge for some longago act but such deeds are usually messy and emotional and this one had been accomplished with the most amazing efficiency control and precision the work of a true pro in the bomb business suggesting access to higher levels of craft thats what lieutenant jessop said too red this boy knew what he was doing this was the best goddamned bomb that anyone ever exploded in arkansas that ill tell you he was a goddamned specialist in time all investigations run down and reds into his fathers death did itself after a hard decade and a half red finally gave it up and tried to make peace with the gaping hole in his life the fact that whoever killed his father for whatever reasons had gone unpunished and was laughing even now i tried daddy hed think when the bourbon got to him late at night and all the kids were down and miss arkansas runnerup snoozed contentedly in her peignoir i tried so hard with that recalled melancholy heavy on his shoulders he spun the dial and opened the old vault the past was broken down by years in ledgers long lines of figures recording inflow and outflow all costs noted all sums accounted for every third page or so was covered with notes of explanation his father wrote in small perfect hand dispassionately recording details in that way in very short order red learned all there was to knowor all his father wanted known and recordedabout the last two weeks in the month of july he met remarkable people a frenchy short for one and a young army first lieutenant at camp chaffee named jack preece but others too a whole slew of clever fast operators men of zeal and commitment jimmy pye was there as well as boss cons and screws from the bama organization in the sebastian county jail and of course earl swagger was there and as he examined what lay before him red saw the logic behind what he had taken on faith and marveled at the professionalism of all involved of course one name was missing it had to be for it was not and could not be committed to paper but red realized instinctively what the ledger documented the key moment in bama family history when the bama gang ceased to be a gang and his father ceased to be a gangster but in which it began its climb toward legitimacy public power and glory and the bastions of respect and admiration ithenow commanded red poured himself another cup of coffee he called the office checked his voice mail talked to his secretary he called the runnerup and told her hed be late and she reminded him that his son nick had a swimming meet that night and he said hed go directly he thought hed get there by nicks event the meter backstroke as that probably wouldnt run until and they could stop on the way back for barbecue then he cleared his mind and began to study the documents that duane peck had procured it seemed clear that they related to some other event of occurring almost in the same time period as the murder of earl swagger what was the connection no wait that wasnt important what rather did bob lee swagger and the boy think was the connection for what they thought would guide how they behaved the one document was a preliminary report from the polk county prosecutors office on a bail hearing for one reggie gerard fuller negro seventeen of such and such an address blue eye on a charge of murder in the first degree against one shirelle parker negro fifteen of such and such an address blue eye shirelle must have been lucilles the letter writers daughter the prosecutor sam vincentred winced thinking of sam on those steps an old man whose time was upsam was arguing that the crime was so serious that no bail be set and the defense lawyer one james alton of the county public defenders office pled nolo contendere to the prosecution request so of course the suspect was held in lieu of bail so a murder presumably of a black child by a young black man july then he read the letter itself two years later the mother of the murdered girl pleads with sam to reopen the case because she claims that this reggie could not have done it strange youd think a mother would want vengeance not justice perplexed red consulted his rolodex and came up with the name of assistant city editor of the southwest times record and put in the call he got voice mail left a message and got a call back in seven minutes mr bama what can i do for you jerry dont yall keep all your old papers on file yes sir on computers since and over in the library before then on microfilm rolls good scout now can you do me a half an hours worth of digging yes sir you know i can the kids okay jerry just fine sir where you going on vacation this year ah well sir were thinking about florida daytona beach oh jerry you know i own part of the blue diamond resort on sanibel island very nice place yes sir i could never afford sanibel daytonas it for us this year ive got to pay for braces and jerry you want to take the wife and kids to the blue diamond a mile of beach three heated pools very nice rooms well i jerry nineteen fiftyfive july a murder polk county shirelle parker committed by a reggie gerard fuller i want to know everything about it and i want to know it fast got that git right on it sir jerry you know my fax number and jerry yes sir ocean side or pool side ahwell ocean side the kids love the ocean the last two weeks in august well thats fine sir youll get the reservations tomorrow he sat back and waited an hour passed then the fax machine began to hum and soon enough it had spewed out four dense handprinted pages a chronology of the shirelle parker case running from the discovery of the body the trial the appeal and the execution he read it carefully then a second then a third time the salient feature was that the body was discovered by earl swagger the day he died and the times record had a brief editorial in noting with pleasure the execution of reggie gerard fuller and the closure of the heroic state policeman and arkansas war heros last case but that wasnt the last entry in the summary of the times records coverage that came five years even later with the information that a life sentence had been delivered against a white man named jed posey for the firstdegree homicide of the father of convicted murderer reggie fuller a former undertaker named davidson fuller who had become stridently active in the west arkansas civil rights movement it was the first time a white man had been convicted of firstdegree murder against a negro in the states history the report said and the prosecutor sam vincent was to be congratulated for forging ahead with the prosecution even against death threats and the sure reality that in pressing forward vincent was dooming his own reelection which would cost him a job hed held for eighteen years red chewed all this over obviously sam had come to the conclusion that there was some connection between the death of earl and the death of the girl had he told them was it their idea what did they know in the first place he didnt know but something else he did have to know jed posey what had happened to him it took a phone call to find out that after thirtyfive years in prison the old man named jed posey resided still on cell block d at the state penitentiary at tucker now that was useful that was very useful a plan began to form in his mind the more he thought the more excited he got i like it he was a little early but it was better to be early hed worn better suits too but when you buy a suit at the fort smith walmart at eleven oclock to wear to an appointment at one you cant expect to make the pages of gq can i do this russ thought then he thought yes i can do it bob dropped him at it was a nondescript building sheathed with new siding that cut off all windows promising fluorescent dankness inside it wore the odd sign donrey house over the single grim entrance certainly there was no oldnewspaper feeling to it and nothing in it harkened back to glorious old days when cigarstomping or tobaccochewing reporters smartassed or exaggerated their way into national reputations while having a hell of a good time no the offices of southwest times record like the offices of most newspapers in america looked as if they headquartered a smaller insurance company or a medical supply house or a catalog service he went into a foyer that was blankly efficient if unprepossessing and told the receptionist that he had an appointment at one oclock with the city editor and the copy chief he was asked to wait until a very young black woman came down and gave him a cool professional greeting and escorted him up it was only one story and the trip took them through the newsroomlit with bright fluorescents as he had guessed messy filled with troglodytes and mutants sleeping or haphazardly cranking away at vdts like chimps beating on toy pianos any newsroomand into the city editors office thats when he got his first surprise she didnt make the introduction because there was no one there to introduce him to instead she herself slid behind the desk ah what was the name again oh yes longly longly longly claudia longly she was looking at the résumé how long were you at the oklahoman mr pewtie a year i started on the features copy desk and they seemed to like me and i became the assistant lifestyles editor after six months and you left well i had a great idea for a book and i didnt think i could do justice to both careers so i left the oklahoman two months ago to work on it exclusively id saved a little money the research got me here and here ive been for three weeks now but its going to take longer and im running out of money so i thought if you had copy desk openings and you were interested i could sign on i am good on copy im fast i dont make mistakes im pretty smart and i work hard but its not a career thing you dont see yourself committing to a career on the record oh to be honest my main thing is the book i dont want to lie to you but if you offered me a position id take it as a matter of course that id stay at least six months you went to princeton i see yes i was lucky i got a scholarship i was a superbrain in high school but i got tired of the east and i felt i needed a change after two years i did do an internship on the miami herald ive got names and so forth for you to call if you want can i ask what the book is about there was an act of violence in polk county in that had a direct bearing on a subsequent act of violence in oklahoma that affected my family my idea was to research and dramatize both of them and show how they were connected im just having trouble running down people from its going to take several months not several weeks i should tell you if you were offered a position its a guild paper ill give you a copy of the contract wed start you at the one years experience mark it would be threefifty a week youd be on the morning rim probably from four to midnight we expect hard work professionalism and a good attitude i dont like a newsroom that talks too much thats fine he said well lets go introduce you to bruce sims our copy chief well give you the test and well see how you do thats fine thanks very much bruce sims was a folksy older guy about fortyfive with thinning hair and a newsroom pallor he jawed with russ for a bit showed him around the newsroom the cafeteria the wire room dons officedon the managing editor would have the final sayand then finally the library this is what russ was waiting for what databases are you into nexus entertainment data service and online search cool what about the phones just as i was leaving the oklahoman theyd bought into a cdrom national service oh yeah we started that up too phone disc power finder yeah i think thats what we had very useful by this time theyd reached a little room off the corridor youre ready yes i am okay its twoten ill be back at threeten swell russ said bruce left the room and russ started the test at he finished it at of the general information questions he knew he had gotten right and only had to guess on the year of the little big horn he guessed and it was the percentage of the vote upton sinclair received for governor of the state of california in right and whether willa cather or edith wharton had written my antonia and since hed seen a movie based on a wharton novel and knew that she was a new york kind of girl he guessed cather right again then there was a badly written news story to straighten out which once he got the lead into english fell into place in a second the last page was for a short personal essay on why i want to work for the record hohum then glancing at his watch he rose took off his coat loosened his tie and discreetly stepped out into the corridor nobody that hed been introduced to was in sight trying to look as if he belonged he went to a coffee urn in the newsroom and got himself half a cup in styrofoam he picked up a ballpoint and a notepad from an untended desk he didnt look ahead but he knew his newsroom culture everybody read everything nobody paid any attention to anything he turned into the library taking a quick peek to see that no one hed been introduced to was here either all clear he went up to a desk that said information service hi im russ im new in metro he said hoping they called it metro but what else could they call it it was always called metro oh uh hi said a middleaged woman looking up over halflensed reading glasses im looking for some numbers could you run the cdroms for me please she turned and opened a desk where a stack of cds in their little clear plastic containers were which section of the country she asked key question bob had searched his memory that morning and came up with the idea that miss connie was from baltimore or maryland anyway he didnt know why he thought that it was just an impression from some clue stored irretrievably in his head but would she retire to baltimore would she return after her twentyfive tragic years in arkansas or maybe she did return and died there in the eighties maybe she did return until she got very old and then moved to florida or mexico or california or arizona or northeast region maryland she selected a disc and they walked over to a large computer terminal on the adjacent desk she loaded the disc into the tray which with a hum absorbed it into the machine which buzzed clicked flashed to life phone disc power finder from digital directory assistance inc and yielded a menu do you know how she asked sure call me when youre done he sat down and snapped through the commands until he got an entry prompt he typed constance longacre the machine hummed and flashed and diddled and in seconds across its blue screen in white there traveled a list of endless c longacres constance longacres conny longacres connie longacres fiftynine of them spread between maine and virginia he scanned the list anyone could be her or none of them could be her what could he do now write down the fiftynine numbers and call them one at a time well what about something else he restarted this time narrowing the field to maryland only thirteen longacres resided in maryland that was something he could write those down he did in fact in the notebook now he could call those thirteen and but he knew another capability of the cdrom it could be entered via phone number or by street address or by institutional identity returning to the menu he called up a prompt by institution he typed nursing home and narrowed the field to maryland clicketyclick whicketywhack the screen flashed suddenly it was alive with names and addresses eightyseven of them according to the helpful listing up top he examined the thirteen longacres and found between them only five different exchanges he wrote them down and crossreferenced to the eightyseven listed addresses and numbers and came up with eleven matches he compared each of the thirteen numbers with each of the eleven matches there was only one match c longacre and downy marsh st michaels md russ took a deep breath he looked about nobody was noticing him there was a phone he picked it up dialed to get an outside line then dialed the digits the phone was answered downy marsh yes this is robert jones im an attorney in fort smith arkansas im trying to reach a miss connie longacre mrs longacre is sleeping well please dont disturb her shes been named in a will out here or rather a connie longacre who lived in polk county arkansas between and has ive been trying to track her down has your mrs longacre ever mentioned living in arkansas thats confidential information im afraid well i think shed be upset if she didnt attend the reading the sum of money involved is considerable mrs longacre is not a needy woman mr jones i see well with the money theres news news of the people she knew and loved for twentyfive years and that she left cold for reasons that nobody has ever understood out here there was a long pause on the phone she never talks about arkansas i only know she was there because her photo album is full of pictures of the country and once i asked her oh she said another lifetime far far away arkansas believe it or not and then i knew it upset her because that night she was crying thank you very much for the information you wont hurt her no maam not at all shes been through so much shes ninetyfive now and very frail yes maam and of course shes blind has been for ten years giddy with joy at his triumph russ downloaded the machine and returned the disc to the librarian and with a light step hurried out the door he ran smack into his new friend bruce sims who looked at him in surprise russ felt stupidity drain into his face but then said in a frenzy of fake desperation bathroom not in the library down the hall thanks the test is on the table im all done sorry but when you gotta go and he took off running down the hall you gotta go called out bruce laughing russ went and hid in a stall for ten minutes then made a big deal out of washing his hands he emerged to find bruce waiting sorry i shouldnt have left the room but i never went back thats okay dont worry about it i picked up the test so when do you think ill hear well can you give us a week or so well look it over and see how it fits into our needs do you have a phone no im sort of mobile now let me call you a week yes thats fine they stopped to pick up russs coat and then were sauntering through the newsroom when russ noted that nearly everyone had left their desks and gathered around a television set suspended from the ceiling near the wire room oh god said bruce willie just called i think this is it bruce said someone rushing by if it is meeting at three instead of four whats going on russ said come on watch this youll find it amusing russ followed sims over to the mob of reporters and editors mesmerized by an empty podium a microphone and the dreary look of a banquet hall in a chain motel near the interstate a label on the screen identified the setting etheridge campaign headquarters los angeles california go cspan somebody cheered soon enough surrounded by aides and accompanied by a handsome but remote woman a thin man with silver hair and a professionally distinguished face approached the podium he looked about sixtyfive and wore one of those almost uniformperfect blue suits a red tie and a white shirt there wasnt anything out of place there wasnt anything interesting either the party reached the podium there was shuffling chatter awkwardness two years and still not organized said someone what a hopeless wanker someone with a british accent editorialized who the hell is it russ whispered to sims even as the mans features were beginning to vibrate with recognizability like a character actor who always plays the best friend holly etheridge sims responded you know former senator hollis etheridge he chose not to seek reelection two years ago and has spent the past twentyfour months running the most inept presidential campaign since ed muskie yeah yeah i remember said russ hes the one who built the road for his dad the etheridge porkway who says theres no free lunch in america if you knew harry and then holly you got very rich my friends said hollis etheridge reading stiffly from a prepared statement and members of the press who have chosen to honor me with your attention for years and years my father had a dream he dreamed that his only son would become president of the united states it wasnt too much to ask for after all he had come out of the backwoods of arkansas and become united states representative for thirty years as far as he saw it in this great land of ours anything was possible and no dream was too large russ thought hed seen the guy on talk shows over the years he was always a fillin a somewhat orthodox man in whose mouth english seemed a foreign language one thing about old holly whispered bruce salaciously he got more pussy than a toilet seat i shared that dream hollis droned onward i worked ceaselessly to make it a reality i gave up my position in the august body known as the united states senate to make it come true i raised money and went to banquets and gave speeches but as my fourthplace finish in last weeks california primary has made clear that dream will not come true there were some audible groans from the audience whom russ gathered were campaign workers and true believers though what in holly etheridge was there to believe in truly other than the practical craft of the professional politician that coupled with a third in new york a third in massachusetts and a fourth in new hampshire has made it clear that the party will seek another for standardbearer and that my continued presence distracts from the message of the two from between whom you will choose the candidate he paused amid the groans there goes my pulitzer prize somebody said to laughter you were never going to win a pulitzer prize someone else said you dont work for the washington post the new york times or the miami herald true enough said the first i should have said there goes my fantasy of a pulitzer prize his colleagues hooted someone threw a waddedup ball of paper at him russ smiled journalists cynics smartasses calculating everything as a career move first and history second shit said sims to russ little rock had its time in the sun we thought fort smithd get a goose out of old holly but no way too square too slow too orthodox he could put no doz to sleep somebody else said unless he was chasing stewardesses i heard his specialty was nurses somebody else said he liked the uniform thing and the white stockings look at his wife somebody else added i think she has a dovebar up her ass the woman stood just behind the man with one of those paintedon smiles lighting up a face that was pure stone dotty god somebody said she makes pat nixon look like mary tyler moore she makes pat look perky a dovebar is the only thing shes ever had up her ass and so said hollis etheridge i hearby announce my withdrawal from the presidential campaign i want to thank my wife dorothy paul osteen my campaign manager and all you loyal workers you people worked like heck and i do appreciate it now its back to private life for this son of arkansas thank you very much senator a question came what will you do with your delegates and your war chest you still lead in money raised thats to be determined at a later time in consultation with key members of my team said etheridge he could still carry some weight somebody said hes over hes finished came a counterverdict color him the jeopardy answer without a question god bless america and god bless the state of arkansas etheridge said then turned and walked stiffly away we wont have holly etheridge to kick around anymore some wag said hell there wasnt enough of him to kick around in the first place someone else added it had been a good day for the general at eleven he had finally closed a contract with colonel sanchez of the honduran army colonel sanchez was el comandante of battalion the counterterror and insurgency specialists americantrained though the hondurans had plenty of money to spend the general could see no justification for pushing the no system as it was called the sr with the magnavox thermal sniperscope and the jfp maw suppressor was the most sophisticated system in the world but it was laborintensive maintenancewise and he doubted a thirdworld nation without a sophisticated technical culture would be able to maintain the units through heavy usage and heavy usage was expected the current guerrilla war showed no signs of abating and indeed was moving into the cities where battalion and military intelligence rightly understood that a longrange precision nightvision sniping capability would prove invaluable after much hassling and wrangling the general had finally convinced colonel sanchez that a system built around rebuilt army anpvs starlights mounted on stateoftheart mcmillan ms with the jfp technology mss suppressors was exactly what the doctor ordered twenty of the units would be in winchester ten in winchester magnum and ten in remington giving battalion a great deal of tactical flexibility of course jfp sniper cadre would fieldtrain designated marksmen in the usage of the weapons system and serve for an interim time as consultants and advisers visàvis their deployment in the combat environment the general had a talent pool of several exswat and green beret snipers who performed such tasks and were damn well paid too both in money and in the odd extra kill they could pick up the general and the colonel then went to lunch demolishing mighty amounts of rare roast beef at one of oklahoma citys finest establishments and the general dropped the colonel off at his hotel to prepare for the flight home the general himself went to his club where he played three quick games of squash with his lawyer and one of his board members he took an hour in the steam room showered and got back to the office at four he expected to spend another two hours on paperwork and to begin work on a presentation set in a months time for the german gsg antiterrorist group if he could snatch them from the jaws of heckler koch and its blasted overrated psg it would be a wonderful feather in his cap he sat at his desk and judy his secretary came in with his messages anything important no sir your wife shes waiting for her payment dammit i sent that check he said two calls from jeff harris at the fbi yes yes they may go nightvision wouldnt that be something a mr greenaway the procurement officer for the cleveland municipal police oh ill get right on that one longdistance mr arrabenz from salvador that old pirate okay ill get back to him in fact you may as well start trying to put the call through now itll take hours yes sir and mr short the general thought he misunderstood im sorry mr short he said it was about arkansas he said hed call back frenchy short the name was the general nodded smiled thanked her she left the room the general sat there finding his breath hard to locate in his chest it was coming back swagger now this goddammit he waited and waited his technicians left at five as usual and judy went home at six but the general stayed in his office twice after judy left the phone rang one was a wrong number and another a hangup you bastard he thought nursing a glass of scotch neat you bastard finally at the phone rang he snatched it up hello jack jack preece you old son of a gun how the hell are you its your old pal frenchy short the voice was southern and arrived in a laughing tone of fake heartiness who are

swagger came for him it was over then im out for keeps you go back to your life i go back to mine how tomorrow you move out with your gear you go to a farm way out on a dirt road on county off of just north of blue eye arkansas its way way out near a little place called posey hollow your contact will be a boy named duane peck hell get you settled in meanwhile im working to set swagger up in the woods hes got to be drawn in slowly carefully it cant be rushed but im thinking a few days maybe a week when it happens youll have to move fast and quiet ill get you your shot you better not miss general jack or he will bury you good and deep i never miss said the general beyond the bridge the land changed it grew flat and plain and gave way after a time to perspectives over water choked with reeds huge vistas of almost colorless marshlands broken here and there by clumps of trees the water sparkled in the sun there isnt this much water in the whole state of oklahoma said russ they were on the eastern shore of maryland heading toward st michaels which a map suggested was a small town situated on a promontory that jabbed out into the chesapeake it seemed like land only marginally reclaimed from the sea the water winked at them from behind the trees or off beyond farm fields or it lurked black and still in deep pools that lapped around the edges of dark trees that seemed to stretch off for infinity or finally it was in the rivers and streams that lashed this way and that like saber cuts wet was all bob could think to say maybe she wont see us said russ oh i think she will do we tell her about sam it might upset her tell her the truth on all things she was a damned smart lady as i remember back in the days when nobody thought a woman was smart they all said miss connie is smart that says a hell of a lot about her i do believe all the men were half in love with her my own father and sam vincent included shes ninetyfive said russ ill bet shes still as sharp as a bees ass youll see they passed through st michaels a town so quaint it looked as if it belonged in an antique store window and then off route still farther toward the chesapeake they saw a discreet sign expensive and muted that said downy marsh and pointed the way without explanation russ turned down the drive came to a gate under overhanging elms a guard stopped them visitors russ said to see miss longacre mrs longacre the guard uniformed and black nodded and let them pass it had to have once been the estate of a robber baron or steel or railroad tycoon an asphalt road curled across land which grew tenuous as they progressed through the high fluttering reeds and then at last yielded to a crescent of garden and lawn scalloped out of the marsh dominated by a brick mansion the building was gigantic monstrous capped with a mansard roof green copper in the sun and festooned with balconies themselves intricate with wrought ironwork on many levels and multipaned windows unbearable ugliness that spoke of the violence and inevitability of capital russ thought it was a relic from a nineteenth century full of black smoke and grinding engines an arrogant eyesore that faced five miles of serene marshlands and beyond the shifty sheetglass calm of the bay it had the look of a place where rich people came to die russ pulled into a parking space marked visitors noting that his was the only visiting car out on the grounds he could see ancient people hunched in wheelchairs being guided about by black nurses or aides whatever it was two in the afternoon the sun was bright the sky windex blue a vee of geese flew far overhead an egret stood on one leg off to the side of the house by a little pool let me do the talking said bob i think shell remember me they walked in both in suits and felt their shoes crack on the linoleum in the hushed silence there was no sense of the medicinal in here but more the devotional it felt to russ like a religious space they came to a counter where two welldressed women suspiciously watched them approach hello said bob im wondering if its possible to see one of your patients residents he was frostily corrected residentsnamed mrs connie longacre im the son of an old friend what is your name sir swagger bob lee swagger tell her im the son of earl swagger shell remember they sat and waited for the longest time and finally a woman came she is frail but shes alert coherent and tough i can give you no more than half an hour try not to excite her yes maam said bob she led them through double doors back through vast rooms that were largely empty and out on a veranda that faced the bay but from such elevation that one could see the lacework of islands and marsh and miles of blue water the far shore was not visible though in the distance green islands poked out of the waves the old lady sat facing the view in a wheelchair she was swaddled in blankets she wore dark sunglasses and most of the flesh had fallen from her face revealing taut powdery skin well fissured with wrinkles but two bright dabs of rouge brightened her gaunt cheekbones and her hair snow white sat on her head like a pillbox hat miss connie said bob lord id know that voice anywhere she said brightly turning i havent heard it in forty long years but i hear it every night before i go to bed he was a wonderful man your father do you know that bob lee most men are not wonderful it has been my experience to learn but your father truly was yes maam i wish i remembered him better did you ever marry bob lee and have children yes maam finally i met a fine woman a nurse on an indian reservation in arizona i look after horses now we have a daughter named nicole nicki shes four we love her a great deal im happy earl deserved a grandchild i wish he could have known yes maam said bob maam im here with an associate a young writer his name is russ pewtie its a pleasure to meet you mrs longacre said russ here take my hand young man i want to steal some warmth from you russ put his hand out and she seized it fiercely her fingers cold but still tight with strength there now russ you describe for me what is before me please i insist i want to borrow your eyes im told it is beautiful but i have no way of knowing russ bumbled through a description of the scene feeling less than articulate but she was kind you speak well she said hes a writer bob said what is he writing is he writing your life story bob lee that would be an exciting book no maam he is writing a book about my father and how he died a terrible tragedy said miss connie a terrible day worse than any day in the war worse in some ways than the day my son and his wife died my son was a drunk if you drink and drive in fast little cars you must face certain consequences so be it but your father was doing a job important to the community and setting a moral example he deserved so much better than a guttersnipe like jimmy pye yes maam said bob we came to talk about that about what happened that day what was said the timing of it what you remember is that all right miss connie may i ask why i just want to know how my father died bob said any sons right go ahead ask away you saw him yes i did he arrived at the cottage at about two he made an awful deputy who was hanging around go away most men did what earl told them he had that way but earl was upset he didnt show it because your father was a man in control he didnt say much he did a lot he was a still man a watcher when he spoke he had such a deep and raspy voice just like yours but he was bothered by jimmy he could not understand it he believed in jimmy why was that do you suppose russ asked i look at the two of them jimmy pye and earl swagger and i see the two americas earl was the old america the america that won the war when i say the war young man of course i mean world war ii yes maam with young people today you can never be sure what they know anyway earl was sturdy patient hardworking stubborn very courageous jimmy was the new america he knew nothing but he was handsome slick clever cute and evil he only cared for himself his theory of the world put him at the center of it that was all he never cared even for edie white except to have her and say to the world no one else can have this beautiful thing she was a lovely lovely girl earl would not allow himself to face the truth about jimmy that was his flaw his hubris thats why its tragedy not melodrama did my fatherwhat was he working on those last few days was there an investigation a project i have to know what he was thinking i was only with him for a half an hour that last day maybe less then i left and he and edie were alone i never saw him again by the time i got back she was sleeping but i do remember this he had found a body that day earlier the young black girl said russ yes weve heard of that shirelle parker her name was she was murdered your father was very troubled by the event i could see him turning it over i remember exactly what it was he said he thought there were signs of monkey business what those were he never elaborated but from what i understand there was no monkey business bob said a black youth was arrested the next day or two sam prosecuted it was openandshut the boy was executed two years later that was all there was to it yes said miss connie all there was to it so my father was wrong said bob she turned and set her face outward as if she were looking across the bay then she turned back to face them your father was right reggie gerard fuller didnt kill her i found that out many years later who did i dont know but i do know what happened and why it happened the night that girl disappeared there was a meeting at the church russ remembered a note inside the notebook that earl swagger had left behind meetingwho there in those days the south was being prepared for the civil rights movement which no matter what you might think did not spring out of nowhere for a decade very brave young black ministers and young white volunteers traveled from church to church where they tried to prepare the people for the dangerous work ahead the night that shirelle disappeared there had been such a meeting at the church shirelle was at the meeting so was reggie after the meeting he drove people home in his fathers hearse people all over polk scott and montgomery counties thats why he never had an alibi he didnt drive shirelle home because she only lived two blocks away i dont the white man was a jewish radical from new york his name was saul fine i believe he was a communist he was later killed in mississippi he was taken out and shot by some young white men who called him a nigger lover that night he gave an impassioned speech to some of the younger people that the reverend believed in then they went home and saul moved on but when shirelle was found and reggie was accused he must have decided that if he told about the meeting thered be consequences it would get out that a revolution was being planned that a communist northern agitator was down south stirring up the colored white people would get upset thered be violence against the church the whole thing would come apart the klan would ride again white people were very frightened in those days i recall she looked out and took off her glasses her eyes were still blue though now sightless and opaque a tear ran down them your father was a brave brave man bob lee swagger he won the medal of honor and he never spoke of it to a soul but he wasnt the bravest man i ever heard of the bravest man i ever heard of was a nineteenyearold negro boy who sat still in the electric chair while they strapped him in and then they killed him and he never made a peep because he believed in something he didnt get any medals or glory he never went to meet the president he understood there were consequences to everything and he faced them squarely and followed them where they led him thats what saul fine had told them people will have to die the struggle will cost in blood nobody will remember those who die it is the simple brutal process of progress she paused nobody ever knew except the people at that meeting and they couldnt tell his mother didnt know his father didnt know and not even many of the blacks in blue eye knew sam never knew sam prosecuted him and believed he was doing gods work i believed justice was served when i found outthis was in when i met george tredwell he was the black minister who traveled with saul fine in those daysi almost called sam but then i thought whats the point it would kill sam to find out hed made such a tragic mistake so that was the only gift i ever gave sam as much as i loved him it cant hurt him now sam died night before last i thought i heard death in your voice he fell down some stairs he was eightysix spry and tough he was another good man i have missed him so over the years was he on a case yes maam never really retired arkansas it produced some terrible men it produced jimmy pye and boss harry etheridge and his idiotic son hollis who wanted to be president holly isnt that what they call him i believe its a mistake to give a man a girls name always he certainly paid his share of girls back too im told but arkansas also produced earl swagger and sam vincent yes maam have i helped yes maam i think you have well be moving along now now i have a question for you yes miss connie im not sure i have the courage to ask it no one ever said miss connie didnt have no courage you got us through daddys funeral all right then the child what became of the child im sorry i dont started bob she means edies boy edie and jimmys son yes lord i wanted to save that child i tried to adopt him after edie died sam argued the case for me i cared for that child for three months he was so strong so alert so bright but no court in arkansas in the fifties would let a northern widow take over a newborn child from an arkansas mother if there was family around i named him stephen after my own son they made me give him to jimmys people it broke my heart i never found out what happened to him her question was met with their silence oh she said finally he did not turn out well the pyes didnt care about him said russ and they beat him and the more they beat him the worse he got eventually he went into the reform school system by age twelve he was an incorrigible they finally sent him off to live with jimmys older brother in oklahoma he became russ paused go ahead young man ive buried enough good men so that i can take anything by now he became a violent felon he killed many people and traumatized many many more he did time in the state penitentiary where he became even more violent a career criminal the worst kind of bad news lamar pye that was his name a policeman killed him in nothing good came from that day did it said miss connie i hope theres never another like it an evil day the houses were all the same but duane knew the address and he remembered what it looked like and didnt have any trouble he pulled into the driveway the street was a dream of america an america hed never ever be a part of niggers niggers lived here and he lived in some trailer out beyond the interstate but he told himself to cool off to dial it way down he had to be smooth thats what mr bama had said you got to be smooth peck youre not going in there to kick ass and show them what a stud you are you got to crawl and snivel he quoted somebody called neechee that which does not kill you makes you strong peck so he took a deep breath climbed out of the cruiser tucked his hair up behind his stetson then walked up to the house he took some pleasure in the fact that someone was nervously watching him from a window they still get scared when the man comes calling he knocked on the door he waited seemed to be scraping and jostling inside finally the door opened and a young black woman peered out at him her face was tight and she was scared peck liked that a lot yyes she said he smiled maam he said as charmingly as he knew how maam im deputy duane peck of the county sheriffs department im here to talk to a mrs lucille parker thats mama what is this in reference to please maam im investigating the death of sam vincent the former county prosecutor he died night before last that day he came out here and talked to mrs parker i happened to see him out here im just checking up to make sure everythings on the upandup i know shes an elderly lady maam and i dont mean her no bother just got a few questions is all be over and out of here in a jiff just a minute the woman said stonily shutting the door the anger rose in duane like smoke a nigger gal treating him like that he has to stand in the hot sun but he quelled it telling himself to be cool for this here goddamned thing was going to lead to a bigger job working for mr bama permanent and no one would treat him like white trash ever again neechee said so the minutes passed and eventually the door opened mama will see you shes upset over the death of mr sam you go easy with her you hear shes eightytwo years old duane walked into the house astonished to find it so nice and whitelike hed always thought these people lived like pigs in a sty the womanthe daughter he knewled him through a living room to a back porch where the old lady sat like a queen of the village in regal splendor and glory maam im deputy peck hope im not bothering you none but we have to make inquiries ill try and be out of here fast she nodded ah you know that poor sam vincent fell down the stairs of his office night before last and died she nodded poor sam duane said anyhow it looks like a straight accidental death but i have to ask a question or so go ahead deputy maam did he seem agitated about anything was he in control of hisself what was he talking about my daughter was killed in this town fortyodd years ago said the proud old lady he prosecuted the boy they said did it i had written him a letter about the crime some years back he came by to talk about it thats all i see but he was okay i mean he werent in no state what you might call it so excitedlike he might fall or something balance problems did he have balance problems he was a good man it seems like good people die around these parts and the bad ones just go on and on yes maam it do seem that way sometime but he was physically all right wasnt he is that what youre telling me i dont think mr sam would fall down no stairs no sir said the woman he was strong as a bull and very sharp and clear i didnt see any evidence of balance problems yes maam his death is a terrible thing he was a good man i agree maam old sam he was like a daddy to me he was the only man in this state with the gumption to prosecute a white man for the murder of a black man that took courage yes maam said duane trying to bite down his delight the woman had brought him right to where he wanted to be i looked it up he said jed posey convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of davidson fuller back in beat him to death with a shovel the old lady shook her head she was tracking the tangled coils back to the murder of her daughter shirelle shirelle was killed the law said by reggie fuller who was sentenced to death davidson fuller his father lost everything trying to free his son but was somehow made strong by the ordeal and emerged in the early sixties as the most energetic and fearless of the civil rights leaders in arkansas he had stopped for gas out near nunley and a terrible white man came out of a gas station and hit him three times with a spade just for nothing just for being black then went back on the porch to drink a cherry smash until the police arrived mr sam couldnt get the death penalty but he got jed posey to spend the rest of his life in prison as if they both reached that destination simultaneously their eyes met and duane gave her the news hed been sent to deliver dja hear they finally paroled that old boy jed posey she looked at him in horror yep he gets out today they say hes going back to his brother lums cabin somewhere in the damn mountains a shame a boy like that cant die in the pen where he belongs he smiled well thanks so much maam you cleared it all up for me jack preece opened the gun vault and stepped inside it was a large vault extremely expensive with space in it for two hundred rifles but there were only thirty or so all ready for shipment various of his products destined for the worlds hot spots he tried to think it out night shot infrared or passive ambient light range two hundred yards or less what to take match the weapon to the mission stateoftheart of course was the knight sr with the magnavox thermal sniperscope mounted and zeroed and a jfp suppressor the no system it was at this moment in time the best sniper rifle in the world but the businessman in him looked at the one unit locked in the rack the demonstrator it represented an investment of about for the rifle the very expensive thermal scope the suppressor and the complex array of armorers skills to unify all the elements into the single system there was always the possibility of a breakage or even a battlefield loss could he absorb that much of a financial bite worse the gun was not wiped clean it still bore knights serial numbers and the magnavox unit bore the magnavox numbers both traceable to him if by some twist of fate he got out but the gun didnt and it was recovered by authorities it led them straight to him literally in a matter of hours of course he had his powerful allies in the intelligence and military communities and the helpful mantra of national security could always be invoked but that was much less powerful nowadays you couldnt be sure it would work at all newspapers had no commitment to a higher thing called national security they hardly believed in the concept of the nation much less security his friends could only protect him so far in the realpolitik of washington he could find himself served up fried and covered in gravy for somebodys pulitzer prize so the stoner was out he looked next at the rack of lesser semiautos these were mostly recovered ms or springfield mlas all in nato reconfigured as the standard army m sniper rifle of vietnam accurized and mounted with an ambient night scope usually the anpvs starlight scope and the jfp suppressor fine weapons with a hundred custom tricks to make them shoot straighter and more reliably than offtherack s but they had something in common with the knight weapon they were traceable to him although there might be some salvation there as the guns were older had a much longer history and had come through many sources and via many avenues that meant that the paper trail could be very complex with dead ends and red herrings strewn throughout it depending on the actual weapon would it be complex enough to protect him if the weapon was lost and then recovered there was no way of knowing and he wasnt sanguine about living the next ten years of his life waiting for some government computer to kick out the serial number connection to him nix to the s next were the bolt guns these too came from a variety of sources many of them civilian all were basically the same rifle the remington though they had been worked over by secondary contractors in some case the remington custom shop some cases robar or mcmillan or profiber or individual custom gunworks like tanks rifle shop or dl firearms or fulton armory some had the nightvision device one or two had lasers one or two had simple leupold police marksman scopes or unertl xs the marine choice again the possibility of tracing these guns was present though possibly not paramount if he consulted the records and chose carefully but another difficulty presented itself to this system that was tactical preece knew hed be hitting two targets swagger first and then that kid the bolt gun was a highly accurate system as swagger himself had proven in vietnam and hundreds of swat and delta or fbi hru engagements had since proven it was the quintessential exemplar of the professionals code one shot one kill but it was not the system of choice for engaging multiple targets there was that damned bolt throw after the shot an inch up three inches back three inches forward an inch down peter paul mauser had cooked it up back in it was a hundred years old a good trained rifleman could do it under a second and there was a time when preece was as fast as anyone in the world this was not that time he didnt want to be throwing a bolt then looking for target number two the whole thing fell apart if one of the targets made it out so he wanted a very clean gun untraceable he wanted a semiauto capacity he wanted accuracy there was only one choice really it was outmoded weapons technology to be sure but it had the great attraction of stepping out of the long tradition of black operations he owned it more as a curiosity than as an item for sale who would buy something so antiquated the agency had evidently used it in nam as part of sogs operation phoenix the infrastructure eradication program that targeted highprofile vc suspects for assassination by special killer teams then it had gone god knew where done god knew what for a number of years if weapons could talk then this one had the experience of a bestselling book in its sleek contours certainly it had seen much action in south and central america perhaps even in africa and europe as well preece had bought it sub rosa from one of his own sniper cadre a man with much experience one look into that mans lightless hunters eyes and at that flat dead face told the general that further inquiries were pointless the man was facing his third divorce needed to raise cash he sold it to the general for no questions asked no papers given nothing recorded it was the weapon that never was unless it was firing at you the piece was an m firing the little mm round but at its muzzle it boasted an old long thin sionics suppressor the helha model and by special mount it wore the last operational american military infrared weapon sight the anpas this was no ambient night sight and still less a magnavox thermal sniperscope but it was miles better than the old carbine sniperscopes for one thing its battery pack had been miniaturized specs described it as a batteryoperated sight and aiming device consisting of an infrared light source an infrared sensitive image forming telescope with integral miniaturized highvoltage power supply and a light source power supply a beltmounted vdc rechargeable nickel cadmium battery the telescope assembly was thirteen inches long the telescope and light source were approximately fourteen inches long the entire sight assembly weighed about twelve pounds it looked like a scope with a searchlight mounted atop it awkward and crude but surprisingly easy to manipulate it had but one disadvantage that light source that is it was active infrared as opposed to the magnavoxs passive mode it had to project a beam of infrared light from the light source to the target area for the sensitized telescope to pick up in a technologically sophisticated combat environment such a system was inherently dangerous because for sure the enemy would have an infrared spotting scope through which his light beam would be a vivid indication of his locale and countersniper measures would be undertaken with massive firepower thus it was better in the undeveloped portions of the world central america africa west arkansas he picked the weapon up ran a quick battery check everything was fine he snapped the charger back and released it felt the weapon cock with a satisfying clack the trigger pull was a dry light snap like a glass rod breaking he set the weapon down and went at last to the ammo locker within the vault and selected six boxes of ball m mm confident that the night belonged to him the funeral was in the late morning but they couldnt make it because the baltimoredallas flight and the hop via american eagle to fort smith didnt get them back until about noon but there was a wake to be held at sams old house at four and driving hard down the parkway they knew theyd make it by at least fourthirty russ drove bob was even more sealed off than usual the snipers stillness part of the legend his bitterness his repressed anger his sense of isolationall a part of the same package but behind those calm dark eyes russ knew there was something going on so what are you thinking russ finally asked that we just wasted a good solid day and that im out thirteen hundred bucks in tickets ill pay you it aint that i dont want your money it was just waste we are heading in a wrong direction no sir said russ i honestly believe that there has to be a connection between the death of that child and the death of your father you bonehead said bob cruelly not even looking at him thats impossible my father was killed the same day that girl was found theres no way they could have set what they set up that fast it was a four or fiveday operation frenchy working at his goddamned craziest and second there was no way anybody could have predicted that my daddy would find that body that day or any day that was pure goddamn luck or whatever her mama came to him and he went alooking suppose he hadnt have found that body hed still be dead by pm that body could have laid for weeks yet before someone came across it and by that time it could have been so decomposed that it would take still more weeks before they got around to identifying it no what happened to that girl is a crime and if poor reggie fuller died on its account that is a pity and a sorrow but it dont mean shit to us russ still believed that there was some connection it had to what else could possibly have been going on in polk county in that would have been worth setting up that elaborate conspiracy frenchy short wouldnt just do something for that is right as rain said bob so heres what i think i think my father was on some kind of investigative team or something the state police were running maybe it had to do with what was going on at camp chaffee and somehow he found something out and had to be stopped that sounds like a crummy movie said russ i know it does and i dont even go to movies said bob grumpily well maybe slow down said bob and dont turn around fast a moment or two ticked by bob slid his out of the insidethebelt holster which russ hadnt even seen him put on what the hell easy easy said bob russ became aware of a van blue riding in the dead mans slot just where his mirrors couldnt track it the van suddenly accelerated and began to pull even dont look said bob and if i say go you hit the brake hard you understand russ swallowed tasting pennies they were back but the van kept passing them and russ could no longer obey his head sneaked sideways where he saw in the backseat a very pretty little girl who stared intently at him she stuck out her tongue shit said russ you had me scared maybe i am losing it said bob sliding the pistol back behind his jacket i didnt see that boy pull up he was in the slot i got to be paying more goddamned attention so what do we do next asked russ youre the princeton boy you tell me well said russ and then he realized he didnt know either the complexity that had been sam vincent was on full display in the odd mob that congregated at his house to mourn his passing or possibly to celebrate it or at least to get drunk at his expense african americans from the west side of the tracks aristocrats from little rock cronies from the thousands of hunting trips hed taken old boys whod guided him farmers whod traded with him politicians police officers children bitter secretaries opposing lawyers corrections officers even a few men that sam had sent away each had a sam story to tell but the one that was making the rounds when bob and russ finally arrived and found parkingthe street was thronged with cars everything from mercedes to fortyyearold pickupshad to do with the ultimate disposition of sams estate itself quite large from a lifetime of extremely shrewd investing and trading hed been wisely sidestepping the estate tax by dispensing his wealth in peryear chunks for a number of years to his children and even to his sonsinlaw and daughtersinlaw divorced or not second marriage or not no questions asked on the principle that anyone whod had to put up with him in the family deserved a nice little present hed also already established trust funds for each grandchild worth but only payable to educational institutions in the form of checks for tuition food or housing he left each of his fired or resigned secretaries except for the one whod become a drunk she got that left an untidy sum in the estate of god dad said dr john vincent scotch on his breath the bar was well stocked and amazement in his voice he left to the nras ila fund and to handgun control inc i can see him cackling when he thought that one up he was a good man said bob who seemed in the crowd of revelers the only one who was morose and still grieving oh he was a mean old bastard said the doctor the eldest son the one whod borne the brunt of his fathers rages and praises smart as a whip mean as a rooster he whaled the tar out of us when we were growing up but by god each of us turned out two doctors a lawyer a travel agent an investment counselor and an impressionist painter whos the painter bob asked jamie i thought he was a lawyer he was for ten years then he finally screwed up his courage and did what he wanted not dad i think dad respected him for it he was a stubborn bastard bob said jesus and tough you know in twentytwo years at home i only saw him cry once he didnt even cry when mom died he only cried when your father was killed i remember he sat downstairs all by himself when he got back must have been well toward dawn he sat down there and had a drink i was awakened by a sound id never heard i snuck downstairs he was sitting in that old rocker therejohn pointed through the crowd to a threadbare old chair that had stood in the same spot for fifty yearsand rocked back and forth and sobbed like a baby he loved your father he thought earl swagger was the most perfect man ever put on earth hero father police officer incorruptible symbol of everything that was right and strong about america i keep telling people my father was only a man well my dad didnt think so bob i have to ask whats going on i keep hearing things about old crazy bob lee digging up some confederate yes that and suddenly youre here and theres a terrible gunfight over in oklahoma and ten men are killed never happened before you came back nothing connects you to it but people still remember you went hunting a few years back and two boys came out of the woods in body bags old dad saved your butt in a federal court nobody went into a body bag around me that didnt deserve to its just some old business about my father did it involve mine i asked him to do some legal work for me thats all thats it my young friend over there he come to me because he wanted to write a book about my daddy no one remembers earl swagger except maybe your father and old miss connie hes dead she will be soon it seemed to me to be worthwhile bettern writing a book about me okay you should know people are asking you walk alone but you cast a long shadow my friend now come with me i have something for you they walked through the crowd which in effect was a walk through the fragments of bobs past he saw sara vincent sams eldest daughter who had married twice and divorced twice she was now the towns travel agent prosperous and lonely she alone of the vincent kids did not have sams magnetism though shed once conceived an awful crush on bob and even now threw an awkward hoteyed glance at him but she alone made eye contact for the others he knew he was an embarrassment i killed men i am the sniper i am apart it was the crushing sense of exile that the killer feels which sometimes makes him more of a killer everyone knew from the publicity three years back bob lee swagger not just a drunken marine vet alone on his mountain but a sniper an executioner a manhunter the man who reached out and touched eightyseven somebodies in arizona nobody really cared because thats who he was from the start but here it had the effect of a scandal they connected him with a past and wondered why him what sets him apart what does the sniper know that other men dont whats it like to send a piece of lead and copper through somebodys head and blow his brains out the pink mist effect turn a man to colored rain whats it feel like there was a girl once named barb sempler hed been on a date with her in high school but she thought he was too wild a country boy wasnt her father a lawyer or something now she was oddly inflated having picked up the forty pounds her once beautiful features spread across the wide face a boy over there now fat and bald and well dressed had once blocked him blindside on a football field and laughed about it until bob had jumped him and the coach had pulled him off hed grown up to sell insurance bob to kill men strange that woman he thought her name was cindyah what tilford that was itand hed gotten backseat tit off her one night in so long ago tit seemed like paradise she was now slim and hard where shed been fat and dumpy a divorcee therapy lots of aerobics she smiled scaring him he yearned for his wife he yearned to feel whole and connected again father family man layup barn owner julie ykn horses he missed them but also what they represented which was the normal way not the snipers way but they parted to let him pass to let him stand alone i am the sniper i stand alone they reached the stairs again the crowd parted magically and they went down into the basement where sam had had his office john walked to the closet opened it took something off the shelf i had to clean out dads office he said here i think this stuff belongs to you it was locked in the safe he held out a cardboard box in it were his fathers old notebook with its brown blasphemy of blood that old tablet of halfissued tickets and this too said john holding out a sheet of yellow legal paper dad had inscribed some notes he seemed to be working on a case maybe itll help you russ was talking to an extremely pretty girl who seemed to know all about him or at least to be very interested in him it was slowly dawning on him that in this odd world he was a minor celebrity the sidekick of the famous mysterious dangerous andyessexy bob lee swagger he felt a little like mick jaggers gofer so princeton the girl was saying whyd you drop out oh my mother and my father separated i knew it would be hard on my mother so i didnt want to be twelve hundred miles away i spent the last year in oklahoma city working on the daily oklahoman that plus the fact i didnt really like the east i spent my life trying to get out of oklahoma because i was too good for oklahoma then i got to the ivy league and the people seemed to be so you know little they were fundamentally bigots they viewed the world through such a perverted prism everyone outside was a redneck nazi anyone who owned a gun or was in the nra or voted republican was subhuman at worst and an amusing ignoramus at best i just couldnt stand it they didnt know anything i somehow ended up working for a year on the oklahoman where i discovered that i fit in nowhere oh go on im sure youll find a fit youre very bright i was very bright in oklahoma i was so smart then i got to new jersey and i was just another toad on a rock she smiled arent you some sort of writer the unpublished sort very glamorous are you going to write a book about bob the nailer no bob has secrets so deep ten years of therapy followed by ten years of torture couldnt get them all out hes spent his life trying to live up to his fathers ideal and unlike the rest of us id say he made it he wouldnt say he had but i would anyhow the book is reputedly about the dad earl swagger was an extremely heroic man killed in a shootout with whitetrash scum after winning the medal of honor on iwo jima i had the idea of doing a long narrative on his last day how it summoned up a whole slew of american pathologies but all ive done is run around and get coffee it sounds interesting i like the idea of a symbolic episode you learn so much about the macrocosm by evoking the microcosm wow he said you must be an english major im a junior at vanderbilt thats a good school thank you im writing my senior thesis on raymond carrrrrr russ not quite catching the last name raymond writer begins with c has rs russ panicked had she said carver hed never read any carver but maybe shed said chandler that was much better he hadnt read any chandler either but at least he could bluff his way through the la privateeye guy lots of neon that sort of stuff yes but so much more she said and russ sighed with relief he could really tell a story maybe its a southern thing but i love it when you can just sink into a books language will your book be like that yes said russ thinking i hope how far are you well were really still researching listen im sort of mixed up who are you oh she laughed one of the grandchildren you knew grandpappy now he got it at the end i went with bob to see him he was a crusty old boy ill say that he told me a thing or two crusty as they come the original male tyrant king but somehow a necessary man she said and sweet underneath he was getting vague though we noticed but there was something heroic in the way he fought it he was an arkansas lear russ said really pleased with the lear remark though hed never gotten around to reading it either such a man a tyrant a ruler but somehow oh i dont know necessary they dont make them like that anymore do they no they make em like me he saidshe laughedand i agree its a kind of a comedown oh russ youll do fine youre whose daughter my father is john grandpaps oldest son hes a doctor in little rock an internist im jeannie the new york one i heard someone call you the new york one oh that i interned last summer in new york at mademoiselle oh said russ shit she was ahead of him i just got coffee for assholes in too much makeup whod done too many drugs and now did too much aerobics not helpful it all helps or so they tell me have you picked up on the big scandal yet no whats that all the blacks are scandalized i just learned this from my friend tenille shes over there with her mother i dont my grandfather won the silver star at the battle of the bulge but the bravest thing he ever did was prosecute a white man for the murder of a black man his name was jed posey the name rang some kind of bell with russ but he couldnt quite nail it down in he beat a civil rights leader to death with a spade in a gas station oh yes russ said one thing about this im becoming quite an expert on the faulknerian substrata of polk county arkansas faulkner would have won two nobel prizes if hed been born here that is if he didnt drink himself to death beforehand anyhow grandpappy prosecuted him and though he couldnt get the death penalty jed posey went away for life yes said russ it cost grandpappy the election and he was out of office for twelve years after eighteen years in office finally in he won again and had eight more years by that time hed turned into an antiguncontrol liberal if you can imagine such a thing just barely said russ anyhow they just paroled him jed posey two days after grandpappy died they paroled him jesus said russ thats disrespectful no she said thats arkansas but suddenly russ wasnt there it all fell away the wake the noise the crowd even impossibly bright and pretty jeannie vincent in front of him he saw that name somewhere in infantile print but couldnt quite pin it down jed posey it was part of a list lem tolliver lum posey pop dwyer where russ are you going to faint ah no i just he remembered suddenly jed posey his name was on the inside of bobs fathers last notepad he was in the party that found shirelle parker he and miss connie were the only two people still alive whod spent time with earl swagger on his last day on earth july do you know where this jed posey would be i dontwhats going on we have to find him we have to he said and thought hed explain it to her when bob grabbed him suddenly and pulled him away from the young woman with a look on his face like the war was just about to start and it was time to load the damned guns sometimes he even impressed himself red bama sat back for just a moment and reflected upon the wondrous thing that he had brought off and how quickly he had snatched an apparent victory from the jaws of defeat he felt now like crowing loudly from the roof of nancys the secret war he had been fighting was about to pay off his lawyer reported the parole of jed posey happened with alarming alacrity posey himself was well prepared initially by a screw whom red controlled and then by a private detective in reds employ he had been told that he would be paroled and that in order to stay out of stir he had certain obligations to the man unspecified who had arranged all this he would be located in his old cabin a mile or so off old county at the foot of iron fork mountain in the densest hardwood forest in arkansas by this time jed was an experienced professional convict with over thirty years in stir surviving and finally flourishing he had become an adept liar a shrewd manipulator a vivid reader of human weakness a tough scrawny tattooed old jail rat capable of witnessing the most extraordinary violence without a wince other peoples sorrow meant nothing to him at all empathy had been milled out of him by the prison and in fact his favorite of all memories was the recollection of that blissful day in when he had stove in that niggers head with a spade then sat down and had a last cherry smash before cops arrived so it turned out freedom meant little to him a chance to strike at the goddamned skunkass swaggers was enough to get him happily through his old age his role was easily within his grasp he was told that sometime in the next week or so bob lee swagger would come to him in the forest dont ask how or why he just will trust us your role jed is twofold first simply step on a rigged floorboard that will send a radio signal the second keep him there until after dark or at least until twilight you have no other responsibilities in the daylight bob lee is a formidable man in the night he is just another target jed knew he could do this cackling evilly through his toothless gums he thought he had a trick or two up his sleeve that would keep them boys busy for a time the sniper was the second part of reds plan now located on a farm just on the other side of in the charge of duane peck jack preece had spent the past few days in nightfire exercises and duane reported that at ranges out to two hundred yards he was extremely deadly he regularly patrolled both by day and by night the terrain on which the engagement was slated terrain familiarity after all was the snipers best ally when he was alerted that swagger had arrived at jed poseys he would move swiftly over the familiar ground to intercept the access in and out of the draw in which the ratty old posey cabin sat was through a narrow enfilade where a creek cut between two hills under combat discipline of course swagger would never take such an obvious path but he wouldnt be thinking in such terms but merely be obsessed by the mystery he was trying to unravel plus it would be dark and going up or around the hills would be dangerous and timeconsuming preece set up his hide about yards out oblique to the left with a good clear field of shooting an arc of more than forty degrees the m didnt have much recoil theyd come along into the cone of infrared light bright as day and hed drill the man first the boy second one grain ball round to each chest velocity a little under feet per second delivering about footpounds of energy the man would be dead before the boy knew a shot had been fired the boy would be dead before the man had begun to fall as this was explained to red he thought of it as an incoming simo in sporting clays two birds coming right at you you panic the first or second time but you learn quickly enough to simply pull through the last bird to the first shooting as the barrel covers up the bird its a shot thats quite easy to master but demands aggressiveness and confidence more than talent it was beautiful it turned on bobs predictability he would learn that jed posey was free for red had seen to it that the black woman herself was told he would think on it he would investigate and satisfy himself that it was not a trap he would sniff paw hesitate think but in the end because he believed he would go forward he had to it was his nature to push on heroic to the end destroyed by his very heroism only this last bothered red a bit the man like his father was a true hero bold smart violent and aggressive such men were harder and harder to find possibly bob was the last one left in america outside a few army rangers or green berets red respected heroism but he was not sentimental about it if it came at him it must be destroyed and what was accomplished must be preserved it was that simple the phone rang bama mr bama it was a bama lieutenant who was officially on the books as a security consultant to redline trucking but actually served as reds troubleshooter in all aspects of communications that his enterprises demanded yeah go ahead will sir you know we broke down the calls from the motel out to the army archives and that jfp technology place for you yes i do will that was fine work well sir i got to thinking that if this boy is smart as we think he is he wouldnt use a traceable phone for a private call uhhuh said red hed use a pay phone so i dropped by that hotel yesterday and i took down the numbers of all the pay phones in the lobby yes said red wondering where this was going then i designed a software program for the phone company mainframeyou know i can still get into their system yes and it turned out on one of them phones there was a collect call to ajo arizona hmmmm said red so anyway i backchecked the number to find the address you said he was from arizona well sir thats our boys home hes got a wife and a daughter there you know sir i know how important this is to you but you could now use that to strike at him the wife the little girl red nodded excellent he said you are one smart boy will i am grateful and you will be rewarded thank you sir you want me to alert the boys ill do that said red dont you worry he hung up it was appealing he could strike at the family now he really had him but it was a nobrainer he thought of his own little squirmers and the warm and safe place hed made for them no we dont do families it isnt about families we leave the families out of it the families arent on the board he wasnt an idealist buthe just didnt do families it was his only rule bob was still grim and freaky with paranoia he radiated hostility and sat hunched and tense always silent communicating in grunts he didnt want to return to the trailer or get a set of motel rooms or anything to make them easy to find they sat in the flicker of a coleman lamp deep in the ouachitas the silence even more forbidding than usual whats eating you russ finally said youre pissed i can tell somethings going on bob typically said nothing he looked like achilles again and russ thought how the severe planes of his face would fit so appropriately under the bronze of a fierce greek helmet scarred from much action outside the walls of troy you learned something russ said again bob breathed out a wisp of vapor like liquid anger possibly enough to allow him to live another moment or two before the demons inside chewed him to pieces he had an ulcer of anger like a gigantic leach sucking fluid from his soul i ran into a neighbor lady he finally said i couldnt get rid of her and then she said i wonder where that wonderful deputy is im surprised he isnt here seems our boy duane peck done been hanging out in sams neighborhood she saw his car parked there two three days running and later saw sam driving cross town duane right behind we gonna have us a chat with duane real soon you ought to reconsider that said russ what for bob demanded flashing a bronze age glare at russ if you call him out and kill him youre a murderer what does that prove it proves that duane peck is dead but it doesnt get the man or men who killed your father for whom we both believe duane works you have to wait until duane moves against you then you do him and its righteous nobody cares you go home to ykn and julie put your anger aside until its time bob stared out into the darkness his eyes narrowed into something pale and bitter and russ knew he was looking at the pure soul of a killer it was the first time hed ever recognized how much anger smoldered in bob and what terrible things the man was capable of but bob got himself under some kind of control well deal with peck when the goddamn time comes he finally said good because i have something to work on whats that russ told him about jed poseys parole bob wanted to know what shed said where had the information come from was it tainted was it a trap well no it seemed to arise spontaneously someone in the black community had found out about it they werent even talking about it to white people but one of jeannies friends a black student at vanderbilt had heard about it from her mother how would the blacks find out bob wanted to know you know they talk among themselves a black prison guard tells his wife that goddamned jed posey has been paroled his wife tells her sister tells her friend tells her husband tells his brother it goes like a telegram and down here they probably hear faster than anyone its how an oppressed community would survive it would develop extremely refined communications and intelligence skills but who originally found out thats what i want to know where does it start i dont know its lost i guess it cant be lost bob said irritably do you want to go housetohouse knocking on doors in blue eye russ said in exasperation look its simple this guy is one of two people left alive who saw your father on his last day maybe his testimony is important they searched for shirelle parker they were together for near as we can figure it out close to three hours thats a long time maybe he can remember bob just didnt like it why now why release him now hes been in prison since thats over thirty years it was time do you want to go down to tucker tomorrow and make inquiries as to why do you want me to call the paperthe paper russ thought what about that joband see what their cop guy says or do you want to check it out tomorrow go straight to jed and find out what he has to say it was like arguing with a stubborn old man bob never agreed or disagreed he simply affected a blank look that stood for a strategic retreat while he reconsidered his options nothing ever budged him except himself and he only believed in things he could see or touch we dont even know where he is he said i found connie said russ i will find jed fine said bob get some sleep now bob himself didnt get to sleep instead he lay in the hissing light of the coleman lantern trying to settle down put his furies in the far place and nail them to the floor he was now looking through the materials that john vincent had handed over the old book of tickets the bloodsmeared notebook now yellow and brittle with age and fresh the yellow legal paper with sams notes on it he looked the notes over carefully on the first runthrough it seemed clear that sam was reinvestigating his fathers last case why would that be important bob asked himself what had started him what could that have to do with anything it puzzled him he simply could not imagine a mechanism by which the two could be connected since the time element was all wrong the body of shirelle was found on the day that earl was murdered there couldnt have been time to set something up based on earls discovery but on faith he progressed sam seemed to be noting ways in which earls notes diverged from the later official version of the crime sam had written body moved what significance then underneath in bolder pen strokes to disaffiliate body with site of crime bob took this in sure what would the point of that be he read on fingernail red dirt under fingernail would that be shirelles fingernail and if so what would the significance of that be but sam himself had solved it little georgia hed written in all caps then adding must be authentic murder site bob himself knew that little georgia was a red clay deposit a few miles west of town a notorious place where teenagers went to neck just over the town line and in the county so what hed been there even then mrs parker says it would be a black boy no black girl in would get into a car with a white boy then hed written damn bob saw why had shirelle gone off with a white boy some kind of conspiracy theory might actually work particularly though he couldnt imagine how yet if it was leveraged into the plot against his father but if shed gone off with a black boy nothing made any sense for of course if the murder of shirelle parker was another elaborate conspiracy who in the black community could possibly benefit and who would have the resources to put together the elaborate plot by which reggie gerard fuller took the fall that was the cruncher shirelle would not get in a car with a white person in bob knew why too black girls wouldnt get in cars with white boys five years later they probably still wouldnt because the white boy only wanted one thing he rolled over still confused and lay there trying to get to sleep bob drove around the town square six times russ had never seen him so tense his eyes would not stop working the landscape the terrain the buildings the mirrors his muscles were tense and his neck so stiff and rigid russ thought hed break it off you okay fine goddammit said bob breathing harshly theres no one here said russ its smalltown america ten in the morning bob didnt even listen or stop working security finally he said okay you git in there and do your goddamned business and git out no fucking around no messing with the pretty women nothing but work you dont go to the bathroom you eyeball anybody comes in you pick an escape route i hear you said russ you dont ask for no help you dont let anybody see what youre doing you dont leave nothing behind you find what you got to find and you fall back watching your back the whole way man said russ you got it bad ill watch from out here bob said you know dont you doubt it for a second said bob they are hunting us russ nodded and stepped out of the car of course he felt ridiculous this living in the red zone what bob called condition oneit took too much energy and passion it left you breathless and actually he thought duller than normal you were beyond paranoia in some strange and squalid place where that lady up there with the baby buggy could reach into it and pull an ak or that friendly mailman could reach into his pouch and come out with a sawedoff shotgun he couldnt live that way no one could except some kind of nutcase so he put it out of his mind and walked the thirtyodd feet to the steps and bounded in nobody shot him nobody even seemed to notice him it took a while but not forever no phone books listed any posey family but he requested the bound volumes of the weekly polk county star for the year received the heavy volume in due course and paged through it until he came at last to the big news county man slays negro it said there under the headline which ran across the top of the page was a picture of the glum and trashy jed posey his cheeks sunken his jaw clenched about a mouthful of tiny jagged teeth his eyes baleful and dark a polk county sheriffs office id number under his chin there was an odd lopsidedness to his face as if it had been broken apart then cemented together again imperfectly next to it was a picture of davidson fuller a haggard black man in his sixties with a short brillo pad of gray for hair and the haunted eyes of a father still mourning his loss both pictures were inset upon a shot taken at the gas station soon after the police arrived with a body supine next to an old truck its top half covered by somebodys old blanket but a raggedy track of black ran out from underneath and russ knew it was old davidsons blood he shuddered then read the account which gave poseys address as county route he went to the county map and quickly found a rr but was it the same he looked around for someone elderly to ask but then recalled the federal writers project guide to the states from the thirties the card catalog yielded a call number and he found the volume in seconds on the open shelves he paged through county by county until at last he came to polk and to a map that dated from yes in the old days that road was called next he went to the filing cabinets for the county land plats and sifted through them again luck or whatever was with him the plats offered a much more detailed examination of the terrain and he found the area and looked at a map of the place he found county route a straight line running perpendicular and east from past iron fork lake it plunged deeper and deeper into map blankness like an arrow a road that went nowhere except to the very limits of the known world civilization hadnt reached that far into the dark woods evidently not even any sewers appeared to have been laid but that wasnt important instead he looked at the words along the road marking local placenames way way backmaybe twenty miles inhe came across a posey hollow in what had to be the shadow of iron fork mountain the map there was blank except for the ominous word forest a squiggle denoted a rough road snaking inward toward nothingness as best as he could he copied the directions down drawing up a facsimile then he headed back outside feeling good hed found him that fast that simple they drove the until they reached the dirt road that was county where a sign pointed toward iron fork lake there there he shouted but bob did not turn down it keep your voice down he said he threw a uturn when a gap in the traffic permitted and headed back to the closest town which was called acorn where a slatternly convenience store sat in isolation behind some gas pumps across from a onehorse strip of dying retail outlets and a trailer post office bob pulled into the convenience lot i need a coke he said come on they went in and bob took a plastic bottle of the soft drink from the glass case got one for russ then went up to the counter where a black woman watched them sullenly he threw something at her that caused russ to bumble into a moviescale double take a smile a beaming radiant howdythere smile she smiled back maybe you can help me he said i got some friends supposed to come through from little rock to look at some hunting camp property damn i may be lost you seen any groups of strangers citylooking boys very careful types truth is were all little rock cops you know that cop look way the eyes is always traveling way one guy is sort of hanging back taking it all in the way they dont talk loud and keep to themselves you see my friends in here in say the last few days mister in hunting season you see boys like that all the time i aint seen a soul in months i dont know his mama and his papa and his brothers no fourwheeldrive vehicles sunglasses expensive boots clothes look real new you aint looking for no cops no i aint truth is i am worried about these damn boys and would be grateful if youd think about it a second no sir i aint seen nothing like that okay good work thanks he left a five on the counter they walked back to the truck man you are careful said russ i am alive bob said and i goddamn well intend to stay that way they drove back along to the dirt road turned down it and began to pick their way along periodically bob would stop get out and examine the dirt road for tracks there were no fresh ones they passed a lake far off to the right flat pewter water against the green bulk of a mountain they drove and drove the forest swallowed them the canopy trees interlocking to block out the sun and the blue sky as if they plunged through a green tunnel toward blackness every mile or so bob would pull over get out let the dust settle check the road for tracks listen intently his persistence and his patience russ found really deeply annoying come on he was thinking they crept past deserted farms timbered or burnedout patches of field the occasional meadow but soon enough the forest grew denser black oak and hickory and winged elm a curtain of hardwood shot through with an undergrowth of bristly saw brier and yucca finally they came to a ragged track off to the right thats it said russ if the cabin is here its back there but bob continued on for at least a mile then pulled off the road sliding the car as deep in the woods as he could it would be easier to walk down the road russ said it aint about being easier its about being safer he got out waited again for the dust to settle bob i shhh bob cautioned use your ears shut your eyes and listen russ heard nothing bob concentrated for a good five minutes waiting to discover if the faroff hum of a following car would announce itself but nothing came the world was quiet except for the occasional squawk of a bird and the quiet hiss of the wind in the trees okay bob said looking at the crude map russ had drawn from the land plat youre sure this is accurate its almost a tracing russ said looks to me like the road trends back to the southeast that would put the cabin a mile and a half in we ought to be overland from it about a mile bob shot an azimuth on a small compass he pulled out of his jeans grabbed a pair of binoculars and they set off into the woods the forest absorbed them it was dense and green the light overhead filtering through the canopy more like a jungle than russs idea of a forest every so often bob would shoot another compass angle then veer crazily in an odd direction it was soon enough gibberish to russ they seemed just to be wandering through the heavy woods in the heat the bugs biting the birds singing he was hopelessly lost you know where were going yep you can get us out of here yep we must have come miles weve walked about three yeah by beeline weve come less than one however in the jungle you dont go nowheres in a straight line less you want to be taken down russ thought hes been here before hes taken men down before look at him he thought a force of nature bob slid so easily and silently through the trees his boots never slipped he never stumbled or grunted just maneuvered with the easy grace of the man whod done it before his face was blank his eyes working the edges of the horizon the demeanor utterly calm and concentrated leatherstocking natty bumpo daniel boone davy crockett damned john wayne like his father whom everybody always said looked like john wayne soon the sweat showed on his blue denim shirt but bob paid it no mind he just kept on trucking the grip of that sticking out of his jeans above the kidney in time they came to a creek cool and dark and swiftly flowing russ scrambled over the rocks and got a mouthful of the water which tasted faintly metallic you make too much noise that way bob said cup it up to your lips and sip it you never was a marine right not hardly said russ okay lets go it aint far they cut across a path which ran between two low hills and appeared to lead to a clearing in the dim overgrown trees ahead but bob never did things the easy way instead halfway through that little draw bob took them off the path through some heavy growth and then broke onto the barer high ground under a maze of pines ahead russ could see the light of vista and openness but bob dropped to a low crawl and slithered ahead coming at last to the edge and setting himself up behind a tree russ feeling utterly like an imposter did the same two hundred yards below in a hollow by the stream sat the cabin it was built of logs low and primitive with a woodpile an outhouse a feed trough for the pigs who scurried in a pen a beatup chevy stood near it rusted out one fender gone to primer yet it had nothing of rustic dogpatch your quaint rural hamlet to it instead it looked mean and squalid and impoverished no phone lines bob said no goddamned tv aerial no electric wires question said russ if hes just out of prison how come the place looks so lived in he had a brother named lum said bob the brother had a son who also lives here its the sons work youre seeing not old jeds okay said russ so lets go see if hell talk to us no way said bob you stay here you eyeball the place you got another hour then the suns too low to the west and itll reflect off the lenses you got a watch yes its two fortyfive you eyeball it till three fortyfive what are you looking for uh anything thats out of the ordinary how do you look uh completely new question russ flubbed around hard he finally said no dummy divide it into quadrants thirty seconds a quadrant blink to black between then move on follow the same pattern for ten minutes then reverse it or change it around take frequent breaks and study the woods around use lens discipline never let them rise above the midpoint you might throw a reflection youre not looking for men and guns because you wont see them and theres no point youre looking for regular outlines nothing in nature is regular if you see a straight line in the woods you know somethings off got it one hour then put the glasses down and just go to regular vision wherell you be im going to circle around and see if i cut any tracks in the woods i want to know if parties of men have moved through here to that damned place if its empty and you havent seen anything then well go down okay said russ were not going to get out of here until after dark dont you worry about that donnie you just eyeball the place with that he slid back and in secondsthe snipers gifthad disappeared who the hell is donnie russ wondered jack preece was working on budgetary projections for one of his most favorite things he loved the steady march of the numbers across the page the semblance of order they brought to chaos the inflow and outflow as his fortunes advanced it answered some deeply felt need he had battalion honduras army salvadoran treasury police detroit swat baltimore county quick response fbi hostage rescue atomic energy commission security teams library of congress swat navy seal team six it was amazing really nobody had ever looked at it this way but sniping was a growth industry the explosion in terrorism in the seventies its ugly reappearance in the nineties the profusion of heavily armed drug cartels with paramilitary capacity the specter of armed rightwing militias the increasing liberal call for sophisticated ie surgical or lowlethality police operations all added up to one thing the precision rifleman and the gear and culture to equip and train him were a skyrocket for the nineties and the century beyond the millennium he was surprised come to think of it that the wall street journal hadnt done a story yet every town every city every state every agency every country needed the trained rifleman with the worldclass equipment life was becoming psychotic rationality had broken down crushed and shattered by disappointment political domestic or economic many men turned to violence the workplace berserker the family hostage taker the organized criminal gang the drug security goon squad all heavily armed who would stop them not the patrol officer or the security dork not enough training not enough guts no it would be some replication of himself a man with the coolness the experience essentially the will to lie there in the dark and when the whole thing was going down to do his duty trigger slack out breathing controlled absolute confidence in weapons system not a hitch or a doubt or a twitch anywhere the trigger goes back a hundred yards away a small piece of metal driven at supersonic speeds enters the cranial vault expands like a fist opening to hand then spurts out the rear in a fog of pink mist its over he jack preece had seen this earlier than anyone and was now prepared to ride the wave to a better a safer tomorrow general it was peck longboned and paleeyed and trashy as death itself in his deputys uniform his gold badge shiny and bright general he said its time signal just come through give me a sitrep please huh report on the situation you idiot oh yes sir theyre there they must be coming in the old man got a good visual else he wouldnt have sent it then lets saddle up preece was already wearing his ghillie suit a ghastly jumpsuit apparition painstakingly festooned with thousands of strips of camouflage cloth threaded through thousands of loops giving him indoors the appearance of a great shaggy green dog that walked on two legs and had just stepped out of the swamp but in the natural environment it conferred an instant shapeless invisibility he rose feeling the swish of the strips and quickly went to the bathroom before him on the sink were four wide paint sticks black brown olive drab jungle green he hated the masks some of the boys wore too hot and limited peripheral vision he worked quickly in applying the combat makeup diagonal streaks an inch wide the darkness of the jungle ate up the pink of his face like a lion swallowing a pie it was gone that pink bland square handsome mug behind which he faced the world and hid his inner nature a warrior gazed back ancient and fearsome his white eyes preternatural against the jungle tapestry that muted his flesh he grabbed his boonie hatthe original worn in nam for the two years he commanded tigercatand raced outside pausing only to pick up the cocked and locked browning hipower that slid into a shoulder holster under the ghillie duane peck had a fourwheeled atv fired up and a long plastic case which packed the weapons system tied across the handlebars jack preece climbed aboard and with a spurt of the throttle peck gunned ahead they had not used the vehicle at all in previous recons of the area but had plotted a path through the trees that would in ten minutes bring jack preece within a half mile of one of the hills that overlooked the creek and the path the little vehicle ate up the distance though peck kept the speed moderate so there was no wailing engine they reached the destination and preece dismounted took the case and opened it the m with its gigantic eye atop its gigantic tube mounted to the receiver was a black shadow in the decaying light the suppressor protruded from the gun muzzle like an elegant snout a sleek cylinder fully a foot long the metal was all tefloncoated lusterless and somehow dead to the touch he bent quickly attached the miniature battery pack to his belt lifted the rifle and locked in a twentyround banana clip with only nineteen cartridges always a sound precaution when working with magazinefed weapons with a snap he pulled back and released the charging plunger loading and cocking the weapon and thumbed the safety to on he threw the support harness around his shoulder rose and lifted it less than eighteen pounds total quite easily done get out of here now peck you meet me at the staging area at midnight if im not there check each hour yes sir said peck the general turned and headed up the slope hearing the low buzz of the engine as pecks atv lurched off and slowly faded away he walked for ten minutes and saw before him a broad flat needlecarpeted forest floor broken by the vertical maze of the trees lit at one edge by the setting sun on the other side of the clearing he moved through it fluidly advancing twenty or thirty feet at a time then melting into the earth and listening intently he reached the edge and placing himself beside a pine tree with the lowest possible profile peered downward he could see figures behind the window speaking animatedly it was hard to make out binoculars would bring them out but the sun was just low enough to present the possibility of a reflection instead he brought the rifle up and with a snap of his thumb first to light and then to scope went to infrared the cabin two hundred yards away was a bit out of range for the reach of the searchlight so he didnt get great illumination the lack of total dark also eroded illumination but he got enough in the murky green light he could see three figures they seemed animated details were lost one appeared to be tall and thin and could match up easily with the bob lee swagger who had visited him two weeks ago another was the boy do them he thought right now why wait do them be done with it he could put nineteen rounds through the window in less than two seconds and the though not a powerfully heavy and accurate longrange round was a true speed merchant and still offered more than feet per second of velocity at that range theyd be dead before they hit the ground but jack was professional you go by the plan which youve rehearsed painstakingly when you improvised the law of unforeseen accident always took its toll he snapped the beam and the scope off and withdrew snaking along the ground until he was lost in the trees he stood then and traced his way back along the ridgeline making no noise raising no dust by the time he got to the hide it was nearly full dark a thatch of plastic greenery which would never give itself over to dead brown and thereby reveal its position lay across it jack pulled it aside the hide was not so much a conventional spider hole as a long narrow trench scooped out of the earth deep enough to conceal a prone man but easy enough to bail out of if the shit hit the fan the dirt the digging had uprooted had been meticulously spread through the woods to attract no attention preece slid into position pulling the screen atop him quickly enough he found a solid shooting position bracing the weapon against the sandbag he went to infrared and instantly it all lit up before him in fishbowl green the white winding ribbon of the path the wavering wands of the vegetation the lighter tonal quality of the rocks the path passed before and below him a mere fifty yards away thats where hed take them putting the reticle on the taller figures chest pumping one silent round out then pivoting ever so slightly to the other figure hed done it a hundred times in practice he snapped the light off it had a good eight hours worth of battery but he knew hed hear them as they came up the path and there was no sense wasting power you leave nothing to chance in this business and the one thing he could not control was the length of time it took for the two targets to get into range he settled back slipping the camo band back to reveal the face of his watch he guessed another hour or so but maybe longer and he had to stay alert preece was really more a visionary a leader an administrator a trainer and a coach than any real sniper but even in vietnam he believed a commander should endure and face the same chances that his men did if only to understand their problems more fully thus he went on the missions on a weekly basis over his two years hed accumulated thirtytwo kills none officially recognized of course because officers were not supposed to do such things still the thirtytwo men were all unquestionably dead one night he even got four in about two minutes incredible occurrence incredible sensation but they say you remember your first kill best of all and that was true with jack preece and as he lay there in the hide in the intensifying darkness and the night forest was beginning to come to life all around him he remembered perching in that deer stand in the dark of another arkansas forest not far from here less than twenty miles as the crow flies he hated the weapon impossibly heavy with a huge infrared spotlight bolted underneath the barrel and a huge scope atop and a huge battery pack on his back its straps cutting into him all this for a puny caliber grain full metal jacket that hit with just a little more force than a special it was the good rifle of the three working m sniperscope units and he had it loaded with the most accurate lot of ammunition and as frenchy short had explained he probably wouldnt have to shoot he was backup bubba you got to do us a job frenchy short had said to him we got us a goddamned badass state cop whos acting as cutout to the russians huh said thentwentyfouryearold first lieutenant preece still an unformed boy whose celebrity as the author of night sniper operations a doctrinal theory in the infantry journal was beginning to fade when he thought about it later preece recognized what a load of bullshit the story frenchy sold him had to be but to a twentyfouryearold infantry officer seething with anticommunist bacillus as inculcated by the political culture of the year who worshiped joe mccarthy and had justdammitmissed korea it made a kind of sense and part of it too was frenchy who had that weird psychos gift of utter conviction frenchy could sell stalinism in the gulags frenchy had the odd chameleonlike ability of absorbing your personality of becoming you and so in effect entering your subconscious as he ground you down with furious and onepointed eye contact smothering asskissing charm and a bandits utter ruthlessness we thought wes years ahead of the reds in ir frenchy who was originally from pennsylvania breathed in the assuring tonalities of preeces own south georgia accent but goddamn were gittin reports they got ir working on an experimental sniper rifle combateffective out to two hundred yards shit the young man said now you know they aint that good and i know they aint that good how come they that good spies said preece you got that right seems this oldboy state trooper got his ass in a little gambling trouble so some old red army spymaster sniffs him out and makes his ass a propositionhes got to git inside black light or hell go down so this old boy arrests a corporal on a fag charge and threatens to destroy his life but the copll let him go if he supplies certain documents cid got the kids statement and the kid in the hoosegow now we got to send the reds a message this is what happens when you go against the us army we dont take no prisoners if preece believed it it was because he wanted to believe it and because it was of course well known that red army intelligence had penetrated the entire establishment lurked everywhere and was capable of anything as frenchy pointed out many times them boys dont even blieve in god and once you give up your spiritual heritage youre capable of doing anything so it was that four nights later he found himself in the deer stand watching a drama play out before him as he understood it frenchy had gone to some lengths to set up an arrest scenario where the real shooters were to take the cop down the point was to disguise the murder as a dutyrelated killing so that only the russians would get the message it had to be done it was duty but suppose the pros missed that was jacks job he watched from the tree as the police cruiser pulled in backed around sited itself jack put the scope on the man snicked on the ir unit and watched the dull scene spark to incandescence the officer sat in his car he looked sad nervous he took his hat off and rested patiently at one point he tested his searchlight jack had good elevation and saw clearly over the corn but the corn was a problem because its leaves reflected too brightly in the iridescence but still he knew he could hit that shot easy in time another car pulled in it sat across from the police car as the rogue officer put his beam on them two young men got out one a james dean clone hair slicked back in a wavy pile an insolent cigarette dangling from his lips his jeans tight and sexy and the other a doughy sullen farm boy in a tshirt it was too far to hear distinct words but the two youths had their hands up the cop got out of the car it appeared to be some kind of surrender thing the cop was yelling instructions the slicker boy threw something into the dust preece put the scope on it as it lay there and saw at once that it was a wrench not a gun the heavy boy started across preece watched in grim horror the night seemed to have stalled out there was a terrible frozen moment and preece at that instant utterly changed sides his natural respect for the uniform and what it represented overriding the rational part of his brain he has a gun he wanted to scream to the cop he put the sight on the slick boys chest and almost fired almost took the slack out shoot no he lowered the rifle and realized he was sobbing he watched in the next second the slick boy pulled his gun the flashes lit the night but the sound of the shots was flat and far away dust rose as men ran and dodged preece raised the rifle again and in the green of the scope saw the sullen farm boy flat on his back a big dark stain spreading across the glowing greenish white of his tshirt dust or gun smoke floated in the air still the cop was down by his car reloading the other boy had disappeared into the corn stay put jack yelled in his head call for backup he isnt going anywhere but the cop finished his reload and rose jack could see that he too was hit and he moved with the slow pain of a man locked into his duty by forces too broad to be understood by other men stay put jack commanded but the cop was too bullstubborn or proud too much of a goddamned rareashensteeth authentic american hero to stay put and he sloughed along the edge of the dirt road one arm dead walking the slow walk of a man losing blood but not heart some kind of fiend for duty jack lost him in the reflection of the corn he put the carbine down and waited the minutes dragged by jack heard yelling voices again indistinct then the crackle and flash of shots from the corn it was silent he waited near the car a figure emerged from the cover of the corn jack watched unable to identify him until he at last recognized no single feature except the rhythm of the walk it was the cop now so laden with melancholy he could hardly move he made it to his car and sat sideways in the seat he seemed to be fumbling with something then jack saw him talking on the radio he put the mike down he waited and tried again a third time he tried he set it down then he stirred as if popped by something he seized it up spoke animatedly then he put it down hed made contact the cop sat in the car jack hoisted the rifle flicked on the scope and the beam of black light reached out to ensnare the policeman he put the crosshairs square on the center of the chest the lawman was breathing heavily and seemed to be talking to himself do it jack told himself hes a red he told himself though he no longer believed it do it he again told himself the rifle grew heavy the crosshairs wavered came off the chest rode down the leg to the ground do it he raised them until they quadrasected the square broad chest the trigger broke and through the silencer the rifle spoke with a cough but no flash there was no recoil or hardly any jack saw the rifle bullet strike saw the body jack with shock then topple sideways and catch against the steering wheel he turned off the scope jack put the safety on and slung the rifle it was only a short climb to the ground even with the monstrously heavy battery pack he turned and was halfway down the hill on the other side when he heard the first siren voices jack flashed back to the present he snicked the scope on they walked talking animatedly the tall man the shorter boy the optics were superb they were big and clear as life rushing down the forest path by the creek in the enfilade between the two low hills now seventy yards distant now sixty jacks thumb pronged the silent safety to off he pivoted the rifle ever so slightly ever so smoothly tracking the large man a green phantasm in the glow of the scope lit by the infrared lamp atop he felt the slack coming out of the trigger as the crosshairs came onto the chest until in a magic moment they seemed locked there they came out of the woods into a sudden late burst of sunlight russ felt liberated from the green gloom of the forest before them was the squalid cabin incongruous wildflowers lit up around its messy base and front yard hes watching us said bob i can feel him and i just seen something move behind that window as they approached a man semiemerged from the doorway and stopped hiding in the darkness he observed them with ancient embittered eyes as they approached he dipped inside and retrieved a shotgun yall git on out of here he yelled glaring this aint no goddamned freak show youse on my property and you be gone or ill give ya some buckshot jed posey had the look of a man whose life had been consumed in fury he was scrawny leathery and toothless and the denim overalls hung on his frame showing an old mans wiry body he was nothing but sinew and hate his bare arms wore the dapple of three and a half decades worth of prison tattoos and he had two tears inscribed in the taut flesh of his face though his eyes were tearless and fierce his hair was the prisoners gray bristle you go on he said bringing the gun up or i will by god blast you out of your goddamn boots and be damned we have business said bob we aint got no business mister you working for the niggers bet the goddamned niggers sent you down here im telling you to stop by god or ill send you to hell where i sent that goddamned nigger we dont work for nobody said bob i am bob lee swagger the son of earl swagger im here to talk about the day my father died jed i dont care a damn about nothing else jed lowered the shotgun but the aggression that suffused his entire body and made it tight and shivery like a pointing terriers diminished not a bit his dark little eyes narrowed in anger and if possible he got even redder and tenser he seemed to be breathing hard your goddamned father done socked me in the jaw he said thats how come my face is broken ive had forty years of pain on account of your sumbitch old man if my daddy smacked you jed by god it was a smack youd earned and ill bet it was a smack you aint never forgot jed seemed to melt backwards a step something flashed through his little eyes and told them yes yes by god no matter what had happened jed posey had never forgot the day earl swagger broke his jaw what you want he said all thats long time ago jimmy pye kilt your daddy and your daddy kilt jimmy pye and his cousin bub i got some questions why the hell should i answer one goddamn question for a goddamned swagger nothing in the law or nowhere says i got to talk to you he hawked a squirt of tobacco venom into the dust

dollar cost you forty dollar swagger for forty dollar ill tell you any goddamned thing you want to know russ started forward but bob caught him i said twenty dollars and i meant twenty dollars i dont bargain with scum come on russ and he pulled the boy back and turned russ shot him a whatthehell look but bob yanked him backwards and they turned and started walking back toward the woods goddamn you swagger thirty dollar bob turned i said i dont bargain with trash you take whats on the table or i will leave the table and thats true today or a hundred years from today and you wont never make no twenty dollars goddamn you swagger goddamn me one more time you old coot and i will come up on that porch and knock in the other side of your face and finish my daddys work let me see the twenny bob pulled his wallet and removed a twenty jed considered narrowly as if he had a lot riding on the decision you give me the twenty now if you want to hang on to something you hang on to your dick you eggsucking piece of trash ill hang on to the money until i am finished with you and then i will hand it over you know no swagger in these parts or any other ever broke his word or welshed on a bargain theres a goddamned first time for everything said jed bitterly you come on then but you keep your distance bob and russ climbed the rickety steps into the dark dwelling russ was always amazed at how things diverged from his imagination of them but this time he was absolutely correct it was one grim big surpriseless room rank with odor a deers shabby antlers were nailed to a crossbeam the stove was old and stank of cold ancient grease the bed a pallet in the corner supported a scurvy nest of swirled blankets one wall had been transfigured into jeds hall of fame by the industrious use of thumbtacks as his front page from the paper had been pinned to the wood where it was now yellow and crackly with agecounty man slays negro it said uniting him and davidson fuller in journalistic immortality the smell of unwashed clothes dead animals human destitution and loneliness hung everywhere in the thick air ah could i have a decaf cappuccino and a mocha for my son asked russ and the chocolate biscotti shut up russ bob said as jeds squirrelly little face fell into anger this aint no time to be smart the old man threw down at an oilclothcovered table clinging to the shotgun and bob sat across from him there was no place for russ to sit and there wasnt enough money in the world to induce him to physical contact with that bedyccch he shudderedso he just sort of leaned against the closest wall tell me about that day said bob jed pulled a pack of red man from his pocket and stuffed some of the stringy tobacco in his mouth did some manipulating with his tongue until he got it lodged between cheek and gum on the right side where it bulged like a tumor he smiled showing brown gums aint much to goddamn tell they woke me in the blue eye drunk tank along with my brother lum rest his soul and that fat old deputy lem tole me he had work detail ise so hung over i didnt realize where we was until we got there let me tell you swagger i wasnt in no mood to go horsing around in them hot woods lookin for no nigger gal what happened bob said talk me through it jed looked around spat at an overflowing maxwell house can on the floor and then narrated a rambling account of the day of the heat and dust of the forest even high in the mountains of the agony of picking through the saw brier and the bracken of the mosquitoes and other things that buzzed and bit and the stench of the dogs and the final thing the girl shit he said she was a ripe one all blown up like bloon you could see her goddamned lil mouse tell you what just out there in the open now they show that stuff in the magazines in them days boy you never saw no mouse heh heh he absently chortled in memory of the smoky pleasure of it and russ saw a flicker of rage play across bobs face then subside why did my father belt you cause hes a mean sumbitch is why said jed not meeting bobs eyes my father was many things but he wasnt a bully whyd he hit you old man i didnt mean no harm i said a little something about riding the gal is all bastard he had no cause to do that she was a nigger gal and i was right a nigger boy kilt her i said so then and thats way it turned out then that nigger boys daddy he go all around pretending to be some kind of big shot well i showed him i ripped open his skull with a goddamned spade best feeling i ever got yes it was by god and worth ever damn day of prison niggers tried to kill me in prison you know yeah look at this he pulled down the strap of his overall and the bib fell and russ saw a long purple crescent of scar tissue a witless smile of pucker running from one nipple almost down to the appendix jeds eye lit with yellow madness niggers done that two hunnert and thirtyfive stitches doc sewed me up like a burlap sack but they couldnt bleed me out no sir i got more damn blood in me than a sloat pig on slaughter friday by god not no niggers not no earl mr fancy medal swagger done got the best of me by goddamn he sat back spent and awarded himself a recreational gob of tobacco juice which he launched like a missile in an arching parabola until it hit dead center in the can raising a tiny mushroom cloud russ shuddered in revulsion and looked away but jed wasnt done he looked up i was right about the niggers too i said you give them people anything next thing you know they be shooting and fucking and killing all over the goddamned place and they is too aint they niggers is fine in africa bring em over here and look what good it done us niggers theys the end of america thats for damned sure bob kept still through this tirade as though he were waiting patiently for a dark storm to blow over then he said tell me about my father what was his mood what was he doing how did he act he was soft on the niggers that was his problem said jed i could smell it on him this little missing gal hell youd a thought it was his little gal not some niggers he was sad whole goddamned morning that is when he werent coldcocking me i could take him in a fair fight not on your best day you old dick ask the japanese they knew him well bob fired back who did he talk to what did he say mainly old lem and pop dwyer who run the dogs he liked pop but he didnt like them dogs i dont know why but i could tell he hung back from them dogs but mainly he was fuckin around on me mr high and mighty hes on my case like a bastard from the start said jed didnt your old lady give him none it was like he hadnt had nothing in weeks bob just glared at him so he runs us up and down the road and into the woods goddammit it was hot nigger work all the time hes jawin on me like i say and when he finds that damn girl i hears him telling goddamn lem to order all this fancy equipment teams shit like that from little rock like it was goddamned important or something hell it were just a raggedyass nigger gal bob took all this in evenly his face drawn and remote how did he know to look there what led him to that spot do you recall jeds features knitted up in concentration as if summoning a memory he summoned up a gob of juice and fired it toward the can missing by a wide margin russ noticed that the gobs were coming closer and closer to him something about a lady calling in saying shed seen a nigger boy acting peculiar four days earlier out by the texaco sign yore damn daddy always poking his nose in other peoples business when he heard the girl was missing he put em together and thats how he got us out there bob nodded it squared the black boy in local lore would have been reggie fuller but it wasnt reggie fuller because he was driving people home from the meeting in secret but if it was a black boy whod killed the girl someone was doing an elaborate operation to frame reggie why why what possibly could there be to gain did he say anything about other investigations or matters asked russ was he consumed with anything else hes tired said jed thats all tired he always seemed tired from what asked russ of bob he didnt work no regular duty day said bob recalling hed be gone sometimes fifteen sixteen hours a shot sometimes two or three days hed work the mornings and the afternoons maybe come home for a couple of hours at dinner maybe take a nap then hed go back out on the road monitor the state police network look for speeders mischief answer calls that sort of thing he worked like a goddamned dog bob ended letting it hang quiet in the melancholy air is that it swagger jed demanded bob just looked at him thats all you wanted hah that aint worth no twenny dollar you aint got no more questions and im still hottern a firecracker he laughed as if hed won some great victory you boys been here so long its dark out ha and whatd you learn nary a goddamned thing hah you got my money swagger bob threw the twenty on the table have a party posey it was full dark and russ felt both exhausted and liberated when at last he sucked in a lungful of air that wasnt tainted with the odor of bacon fat and stale sweat we didnt learn much he admitted as they stepped off the porch i told you we wouldnt said bob you keep trying to make this link between poor shirelle and what happened to my father you keep trying to do that but it dont work out in time or in logic well said russ but then he paused consider this first coincidence is it logical that there would be two elaborate conspiracies engineered within days of each other in a remote backwater of west arkansas i mean things like that hardly ever happen in real life doesnt it make some kind of sense to presume they were in some way connected that there was only really one bob said nothing then consider russ said that although each conspiracy is different in terms of objective they share the same mechanism or pattern in both cases theres two levels the first seemingly impenetrable offers a plain and simple crime complete to motives and very obvious clues jimmy and bub pye rob a grocery store ten hours later theyre confronted by sergeant swagger who guns them both down and is killed himself openandshut shirelle parker is raped and murdered twelve miles outside blue eye her hand conceals the monogrammed pocket of her killer at his house the rest of the shirt smeared with her blood is found openandshut but in both cases at the level of the most excruciating detail the anomalies begin to assert themselves and if you go beyond the openandshut you see that in each case some genius operator set it upnight infrared for your dad moving the body from the site of the crime in the other case dont you see consider yourself said bob the boy that killed shirelle was black you dope shirelles mama told sam she was raised so she wouldnt get in no car with no white boy now you got to ask if hes a black boy who the hell in arkansas in had the wherewithal to throw together a frame for a black boy dont make no sense at all if it were a white boy maybe but no it was a black boy shit said russ im convinced my daddy was investigating a crime and thats what got him killed he learned something something big that powerful men wanted stopped how else would they have had the resources they had the cia an army sniper stateoftheart gear in exasperation russ shouted i am the son of a state police sergeant my dad couldnt investigate an outhouse shut up we just passed our mark what im counting what steps once we hit two hundred forty steps from that big boulder we head off this goddamned path veer to the left and begin our zigzag back we move in units of two hundred forty of my long steps hard left hard right by the compass and that gets us back to the car but russ hadnt been paying attention they had now reached the draw where the creek bed off to the left cut between the two hills the trees loomed above them more felt than seen the wind gently pressed through them filling the night with whispers the dark lay like a blanket suffocating russ a flash of paranoia illuminated a far corner of his mind he thought of being alone out here with his hyperactive imagination zero visibility lost in some maze that wore an ancient cloak alone completely he would die then he heard something terrifying from close by it was the raspy dryly cracking rattle of a poisonous snake it released an almost archetypal toxin of fear into his system these were difficult days for red he could do so much and then had to let go sit back and trust the others to execute his plan he couldnt as amy had said of her father indulge in his capacity to overmanage he had to trust would bob read the clues correctly would he show up as predicted would the damned duane peck be able to bring off his end or would the mans stupidity and impetuousness bring them down would jack preece hit the shots that needed to be hit would the old man the scrofulous nasty jed posey hold together in a long session with bob ironically of them all red trusted posey the most he was familiar with the type the prison rat so hardened by a life lived at the extreme end of existence hed been turned into some nietzschean thing a being so intense and onepointed he hardly had any other life left him except the life of duty the other irony was that this whole thing even now as it had for so long completely delighted him it was remarkably fun such a clever plot so astutely calibrated based on such an intense analysis of bobs character really truly a masterpiece red youre away that was jeff seward first operating vicepresident of fort smith federal the others in the foursome were neil james of bristow freed bartholomew and jeffers attorneysatlaw and roger deacon of mcconecarruthers advertising agency it was the weekly golf foursome of the fort smith rich boys club at hardscrabble country club off cliff drive and red was indeed out and jeff was indeed delighted his ball lay a long fiftythree feet from the pin between it and the hole was a wilderness of elevations switchbacks slopes and bare spots it was the eighteenth hole red had shot low standing at a but damned jeff who had never beaten him was standing at a and had hit an uncharacteristically nice approach shot that had deposited him a few feet from the pin his oneputt would put him out at reds twoputt would leave him at alsodamnand if he threeputted a distinct possibility hed lose the image of jeffs smirk filled him with dark rage which he enjoyed because it cut through the mesh of anxieties that he otherwise had suffered jeff was an old friend and enemy hed played on the same razorback football team with red in the early sixties and had at least kept up with him in the wife department trading in an older model on a newer one every fifteen years though hed never reachedand never wouldthe beauty pageant level as had red theyd been in and out of business deals a dozen times and made at least four or five million off of each others friendship and connection but golf was thicker than blood red did not want to lose he approached the ball and knelt to read the green around him the vivid beauty of the course expressed itself in full vertiginous glory the most agreeable golf course in west arkansas and better than all of the courses but one in little rock so red looked across the ball into a treacherous maze of possibilities he glanced at his watch it was late suddenly he felt a strange thing a collapse of will it was as if his warriors spirit which had sustained him these many years had suddenly vanished he didnt want to putt out he wanted to lie down i am getting old he thought he read the putt as a lefttoright crosser and knew it demanded courage above all else it would seem to die a half dozen times seem to quit and sputter or slide off into irrelevancy would live a whole odyssey of adventures before it even got in the neighborhood of the cup you had to hit it hard you had to believe you could not shirk or flinch or whine go at it like a man and live or die like a man that would be a hell of a putt red said jeff you wouldnt want a side bet would you jeff hmmmmm considered jeff something in the neighborhood ofoh a grand a grand it is bubba said red smiling wolfishly and setting himself up did i ever tell you boys about the time i took three grand off clinton thats why he wont play with me no more damn the buzz of the vibrator on his beeper scuse me gents he stepped off the green and took his folder from his caddie he punched up the phone mail and heard duane pecks breathless voice call me fast red punched the number in mr bama yes its working i just dropped preece off the old mans got em in there im holding now at the fallback point waiting for preece to dust them by god its going to work theyre here reds heart filled with joy he was so close and it would all be over another threat to his empire and its little secrets defeated life its own beautiful self would go on and on and on hed put all his children through college and maybe in a few years when the runnerup wore down hed gracefully retire her to some country mansion and get himself the actual thing he wanted more than anything a true authentic miss arkansas young hot and nubile wouldnt that beat all duane you call me the second it is over do you understand yes sir i do red handed the folder back to the boy and remounted the green good news red the best another million for mr bama said neil james and that means another twenty thousand in billing for me boys said red when the big dogs happy everdamnbodys happy he addressed the putt filled to the eyeballs with blazing confidence jeff you want to make that five grand even up hell red said jeff ise hoping youd let me off the hook on the grand everybody laughed except red who bent into the putt and laid the considerable pressure of the bama concentration against it until he thought hed explode then almost reflexively with a sharp rap he struck the ball wrists stiff head down shoulders loose a perfect putt built on courage iron determination and in golf lessons over the years like xenophons lost greeks it wandered across the persia of the green this way and that up mountains and down into lush green valleys seeming to die at least twice but always getting over the next crest on the apparent delusion that the sea lay ahead at last it descended bouncing and gathering speed and hit the cup spun with a whiskery soundand halted damn said red five grand shouted jeff it may drop still said neil red stared at the ball balanced on the very equipoise between hole and green seemingly riding on nothing more than the sprig of loam fighting the balls weight and preventing red from achieving yet another triumph if a jetd come along and a sonic boom would hit maybe it would drop said roger deacon you could probably call the air force on your phone red damn said red you could explode another car bomb said jeff that might loosen it but neil had the best idea order it to drop he said it knows who you are damn right said red everybody does he squinted assumed the position of an especially pugnacious bulldog and issued his command ball drop damned if it didnt red sat around the nineteenth hole with his fellow rich boys choosing a very expensive twelveyearold george dickel tennessee bourbon as the nights poison finding himself in a boisterous mood he said hed let poor jeff off the hook on his thousand if jeff would just pick up the tab jeff agreed and red set out to drink a thousand dollars worth of dickel he wasnt celebrating too soon he was trying to get a certain part of his brain disengaged from the drama that was surely playing out seventy miles to the south even now in a forest battleground if he let himself think on it he was sure hed die his heart would go into vapor lock hed pitch forward in rigor mortis and theyd have to cut him out of his golf shoes hed end a joke the total golfer who died in a bright red his favorite color polo shirt and a pair of lemonyellow slacks you okay red yes i am tell that gal another round red you are so generous with my money said jeff though not bitterly damn i have to give it to you you always squiggle out i got you on the goddamn hook and presto youre off it but it was said in something like respect many a man has thought he had me on the hook only to find out the hook was in him said red as the girl deposited another dickel straight up before him he took a hit blam hot straight and tough just the goddamn way he liked it hey red got a question for you shoot son have you heard the holly etheridge rumor every goddamn one of em no i mean the rumor which one would that be its all over town hes your friend youd know he isnt my friend he went to harvard he aint hardly ever come back to the old stomping grounds hell he went to prep school in washington dc st albans school i think he aint no arkansawyer ill tell you that i know him some they say he cut a deal with old mr you know who the frontrunner hed drop out early and work behind the scenes and that would get him the vicepresidential nomination roger deacon pitched in with a comment we have been his local media buyers for eighteen years and believe me if holly etheridge were going on the national ticket wed know it by now you have to buy into prime time early its too late otherwise you aint thinking right rog said red it aint a senatorial race the buy would come from national party headquarters and not in his name you check and id bet youll see the parties already got money down on the time they need through one of the big little rock shops so it is going to happen huh red neil i aint heard diddly about old holly hes too busy trying to fuck every living female between maine and southern california i think hes made it through illinois and is just starting on missouri i dont think hes given up his national ambitions said jeff his daddy gave him an order and one thing about holly he always obeyed his daddy i think i ought to give him a call hell probably end up looking for a good chief of staff maybe ill be moving up to washington shit his team is set said red i shot sporting clays with judge myers a few weeks back and hes the boy with the inside track but he didnt say nothing holly may surprise us yet said neil we made a hell of a lot of money off that goddamn road he wanted to build for his daddy though red said hear hear cheered the rich boys for they too had made money even at some remove from the million that the federal government had poured into arkansas to build the boss harry etheridge memorial parkway down to polk county it went on that way until eleven when red finally broke it up toward the end as the booze wore off he found himself becoming morose and meanspirited the vibrator on his beeper had not gone off what did it mean what was going on it was so goddamned perfect he pushed aside his fears and went to the car but for the first time in years his two obedient discreet bodyguards irritated him though they were so steely efficient there was no cause for the annoyance they just bugged him tonight he said im going to the lounge not home yes sir came the reply untainted by human emotion he climbed into the big sclass and turned right down cliff drive and back toward the city instead of left toward his big white house overlooking the airport at the halfway point he called the runnerup hello beth honey something has come up ive got to nurse one through the night sweetie are you all right i am fine and soon ill be finer are you sure dammit even she was irritating him tonight yes yes everything is fine you know what i want you to do plan a vacation a nice one the whole family both families hawaii well rent out a goddamned island to ourselves your mother even all right yes red honey your brother he can come too thats my babe he hung up crossing rogers turning in toward town took his next right and followed the progressively seedier midland boulevard until at last he came to nancys his parking place was wide open as usual and he pulled into it as he leaped out his two bodyguards seemed to materialize from nowhere and took up position next to him he threw open the door and about six dreary drunks and four dreary pool players looked over at his magnificence and withered in it he blasted through telling fred the night barkeep just one word coffee in his lair he felt a bit more relaxed here at last was a world small enough and known enough to be completely dominated he sat at his fathers old desk he felt comfortable he set his folder on the green blotter before him and willed it to ring phone ring but unlike the golf ball of late afternoon it did not obey him what adventures could it be concealing what extraordinary battle what act of profane violence what deliverance or destruction he tried to shut it out by concocting a plan to implement if he were to fail utterly swagger lives swagger kills both men no worse swagger captures poor duane who spills the beans about the bama connection what would swagger do next hed come after me he realized he leaned out and gestured to his bodyguards it is very possible he said that a very tough man will be coming after me in the next few days not sure but possible therefore yall will need to be at your absolute tops understood yes sir said the talkative one we go into condition one all the way well need support teams aerial surveillance motion detectors the works i aint going to give it up without a fight well get him sir maybe he thought that would be better face it do it get it over with he and swagger manonman then he laughed swagger was too good that would be suicide he looked at the phone damn you ring but it wouldnt the hours leaked by he read the papers tried to work on his books had a lot of coffee watched some tv on a ratty blackandwhite he may even have dozed for a time for it seemed that there was a moment when it was dark followed by another moment when the dawn was suddenly breaking he went out looked down the broad boulevard that was still lifeless odd even a slum like north fort smith could look pristine and wondrous in the first wash of moist dewy light but he knew his sentimentality was phony more a function of stress and exhaustion than genuine feeling now he began to feel sorry for himself it went with the territory the long night nursing through a crisis that he himself was incapable of influencing at this point one which he must fight with surrogates he mourned his father that great man he wondered again at the great bitterness of his life who had killed him he missed his two wives and his five children he missed the boys at hardscrabble the men he hunted fished flew to super bowls and occasionally caroused with he mourned his life was someone going to take it away from him now at least his children would know who killed him more than he knew of his own fathers death he saw swagger as a paleeyed avenger a figure of death come to take it all away part of him yearned to fire both barrels of that expensive krieghoff into swagger and blow him to shreds he calculated two blasts of remington from five feet thats almost sixteen hundred pieces of bird shot delivered at over feet per second hitting him that close before the shot column opened up into a pattern but instead traveled through space with the energy and density of a piston wow total destruction but in the end he weakened his warrior spirit was spent his dick was soft and would never be hard he needed sleep he needed help he faced the phone it was nearly seven i can take it no more i have to know he dialed duane pecks number the phone rang once twice three times and red feared that catastrophe had occurred his heart bucked in terror but on the fourth ring peck answered yeah whats happening peck there was a pause that seemed to last an epoch in geological time as ice ages rolled down from the north then retreated whole species were created and evaporated civilizations rose and fell and then peck said its over got em both goddammit why didnt you call me ah began duane i told you to follow orders exactly dont you get that yes sir said peck sorry i is the general all right yep his heart soared in gratitude and intense pleasure bury the bodies get the general home and disappear for a week call me next week i want a full report yes sir said peck red snapped off to the dial tone the most beautiful sound hed ever heard russ had an instant of clarity he thought ive finally done it ive pissed him off so bad hes going to beat the shit out of me for even as the snakes rattle registered in his brain bob had turned and driven savagely into him knocking stars into his brain behind his eyes taking his breath from him forcing him in a wild plunge to the precipice of the creek bed where he panicked at the instant surrender to gravity yet through his fear as he fell literally in bobs arms toward the black cold water he heard one other thing this was the sound of a whip crack next to his car for the air was full of buzz and fury a sense of presence that russ couldnt identify for it had no real antecedent in his life and as he fell toward the water he also noted the appearance of explosions of some sort on the far bank geysers of earth spouted upward filling the air with grit and dirt but fastfastfastfast so fast he couldnt believe it and the water was cold it knifed through him he shivered like a dog breathed some in it tasted like cold nickels in his throat and he fancied he saw black bubbles climbing until he broke free of bob and started to rise but bob had him again and smashed him forward into the bank as three more silent blasts erupted into the dirt above and seemed to turn the darkness gray with haze and dust to the tune of three more whip cracks russ had come to rest in the lee of the shallow bank it was about a foot deep a narrow gulch the water cascaded over him swift and numbing he gasped for air and understanding sniper hissed bob hes up there on the elevation above the path infrared the snake russ i heard the snake all was silent except for the rush of the cold cold water over their limbs fuck said bob aint he a smart one though can you see him russ hes got infrared he can see us we cant see him russ rose as if to peer over the lip of the bank but bob pulled him back he can shoot your eyes out he can see you you cant see him it was so close what you heard was sonic boom he has a silencer you cant hear his muzzle blast it dawned on russ where they were no longer in the precincts of paranoia where every living thing seemed a threat but in the actual universe of hurt where every living thing is a threat this was it then the ultimate existential horror of the snipers worldto be hunted in a dark forest by an invisible antagonist who could see you when you couldnt see him who could fire without giving his position away and to be yourself unarmed not unarmed bob had his out can you get him not likely he dont have to close fuck smart motherfucker who is it what the fuck difference does it make but then he knew preece its his specialty goddamn so smart preece how dont think about that now think about where we are what we got were going to die arent we i dont know i dont want to die welcome to the club sonny in the dark bobs features screwed tight in concentration he looked both ways up the creek bed threw himself into the problem searching his mind to recall the terrain that lay between himself and the car where he had a rifle all right he said heres the deal you work your way up the creek bed about a hundred feet you stay low you stay in the water hes scanning right now im going to work my way in the other direction in four minutes when youre set ill make my move and try and draw him away when i go loudly you go softly back to the cabin no theres nothing there but death you back up into the woods and find someplace to go to ground i dont want you moving in the dark hell find you remember its alight a black light but a light if you aint in the light he dont see you then in daylight that rifle is more of a problem than a help here he gave russ the compass thisll get you through the woods after first light you make good tracks theres a hill behind us i dont want you going up it you cut back around it then you head due west by the compass and soon enough maybe fifteen miles you pass iron fork lake five miles past that youll come to you call the cops you tell em whats happening meanwhile ill try and make it back to the car and get my rifle then ill hunt this motherfucker down and fucking nail him his face was a hard mask set in stone and psychotic anger hell kill you russ said the simple truth you dont have a chance against his stuff it aint the gun sonny its the operator preece felt neither rage nor panic he did not curse his luck or wonder what could possibly have alerted the two and caused them in some incredible way literally to disappear as his first brilliantly placed shot rocketed toward them he recovered quickly but they spilled into the creek bed exactly as he reacquired them and his next four rounds puffed against the far bank in the circle of the scope in the cone of black light it was bright as green noon there was some verdure reflection but not much it was like peering into a tinted photographic negative a soupy almost aquamarine world brilliantly illuminated by the infrared searchlight he scanned up and down the creek bed knowing that bob would realize that to stay put would be to die bob would have to make some kind of move it was his nature now how would he go the creek bed was like a narrow trench about three hundred feet long at this point and only deep enough to sustain cover for about one hundred feet he could snake out either end or he could go over the top fading into the woods but that would take him straight against the incline of the far hill hed be staked out against the rise like a butterfly on a pool table no bob would go out either one end or the other and that was the problem with preeces system it depended on a beam of invisible light which gathered strength by focus it was not powerful enough to illuminate both ends of the creek therefore he had to scan continuously covering the one then the otheror figure out which one bob would choose it occurred to preece to move lower down the slope to lessen the angle to the trench in that way hed narrow the degree of muzzle arc hed have to cover from one end to the other but at the same time suppose bob moved when he himself was moving could he recover to shoot in time no stay put be patient you have the great advantage do not squander it be strong keep the heart hard keep scanning then at the far end of the trench back toward the cabin he saw a target the cross hairs came onto him head shot he thought very carefully preece began to take the slack out of the trigger russ watched bob slither away down the creek bed totally animal now feral intense driven bob was out of sight quickly in the dark and he moved so expertly he made no noise it was his gift he vanished now russ was alone a great aching selfpity came over him he did not want to be here he did not want to be alone in the dark with a worldclass sniper with worldclass gear hunting him he looked up and down the creek bed feeling the numbness of the cold eat into him looking desperately for at least the energy to obey his meager instructions which were only to position himself farther up the bed wait for bob to make his move then slip away he moved tentatively along discovering in his twentysecond wellfed year what every infantryman learns in his first week of duty that crawling along the ground particularly through mud and water over rough stones with somebody trying to kill you is quite unpleasant it is in fact sheer misery russ shivered as the water bubbled and frothed against his face he slithered noisily through it fighting for leverage slipping occasionally he scraped his numb fingers raw on the rocks he was so cold at one point he lay gasping for air he looked back down the waterway and saw only the glint of the liquid and the claustrophobic walls of the creek bed ahead more of the same an immense depression came and sat upon his shoulders he just wanted to curl up in a little ball and go to sleep he wanted mom and dad and jeff to tell him he was all right he wanted to be in that beatup little house on the outskirts of lawton with his fat old dad on the sofa watching football and drinking beer and his mother in the kitchen working like a dog and his brother just come in from hitting a home run and he himself upstairs reading nietzsche or mailer or malamud or whomever and feeling infinitely superior but also infinitely connected to them fuck he thought i am turning into dorothy theres no place like home he clicked his heels together three times but it didnt work he was still in the oz of the ouachitas alone with a wicked witch with a rifle trying to track and kill him he squirmed ahead another thirty or forty feet suddenly he realized i am out of creek bed this is it this is where i ought to be he gathered himself for a rush and someone spoke to him time for some cappuccino motherfucker heh heh heh it was jed posey with his shotgun bob looked at his watch the minutes hustled by three minutes thirty three forty three fifty from where he lay half in and half out he could see nothing though to a sniper the dark itself has textures and may be read like a map he knew where the hill was across the path because the black there was dense and impenetrable there was enough illumination in the sky that he could read or sense the horizon at the top of the hill to his left the forest rolled away essentially downhill the path zigging off bob knew he had about two hundred naked yards to go uphill then over the crest moving through a screen of trees it was too far it was too damned far fifty he might make a hundred at the farthest reaches of luck but two hundred to the point where he could fade into the forest past the crest and in its protection beeline north to intersect the logging road where the car was hidden no too far nobody would be that lucky three fiftyfive it was a lousy plan it was a terrible plan why had he committed to it he now saw it made better sense to go to hide right here at this end then maybe in the dawn preece or whoever would have to come and investigate he might get into range with the and bob could take him but he hated that plan too preece would come at night and hed come with his black light blazing and there was no place bob or russ could hide and hed see them cowering in the water and from fifty yards out hed do them both easy as pie you have to move or youll die he tried to remember was he this scared in vietnam was he this scared ever everyone thought he was such a hero such a cool hand in the insanity of a gun battle he didnt feel heroic he felt like a little boy when major benteen comes and tells you your daddy is gone and the loss sits upon you and you face the universe totally alone i am alone you think and it scares you i am so alone bob thought then he thought of his wife and his daughter i will get back he thought and with that he launched himself screamed preece loud as he could and started to run you know whatd happen to you in prison puppy them old consd use you like a gal youd be a gal in prison russ cowered at his feet still in the rushing water freezing trapped please dont hurt me he begged it wasnt the wizard of oz anymore it was deliverance please dont hurt me laughed posey i never did anything whimpered russ damn aint that the way it always happens said posey scrofulous and old so rancid of odor that russ could smell him even now bye bye maryjane said posey lifting the shotgun here comes both bar an interesting thing happened as he was speaking the upper half of poseys head that is from the nose up simply vaporized into a cloud of mist as if it had been somehow squirted away by a giant atomizer there was no sound there was no agony or death spasm it was simply that in a nanosecond a living man became a totally dead one the instant rag doll as jed posey imploded like one of those poetically rigged buildings where the explosives knock out all the weightbearing girders and the thing dissolves downward into its own rubble so it was with posey who melted downward im melting russ thought incongruously returning to oz spun and in a second had fallen with such looselimbed thunder that when his crownless skull hit the ground it sent a spray of brain gobbets and plasma spattering into russs face it was raining brains ycccch he bolted backwards and puked for several seconds then he cowered in the water no way he was going anywhere preece knew from nam what it looks like on the green scope when you hit he saw the exact second the shot hit the brain and blew it out noted the instant of utter stillness that came across a body from which life has just been ripped a white glowing spume expelled from the stricken skull the body fought the inevitable for a split second then yielded to death and collapsed into the creek bed one down bob probably the boy at that moment came the call preece from the other end of the creek bed and preece cursed recognizing bobs tone in it and pivoted swiftly to track the man down but bob was outside of the field of fire of the hidedammitand preece lost a valuable second deciding what to do and another one or two in the actual doing of it with a stout elbow he punched aside the plastic roof of the hide and sat upright dragging the rifle with him it took still more seconds to reorient as his target now lurked in the range of forest and slope just beyond the hill he brought the rifle to his shoulder and the scope to his eye and through its lens began to scan he pivoted back and forth in and out listening intently waiting for the device to yield a treasure for surely bob was out there running crazily outward toward the crest of the next low ridge damn nothing he blinked wiped his eye reset the rifle and began again to pivot now cursing that he had active ir instead of ambientlight or passive ir technology for it made him dependent on the range of the ir searchlight atop his scope he looked for indicators wavering bushes crushed undergrowth dust in the air all of which might signify that the man had come through then he had him bob was zigzagging toward the crest near it but preece had him could see him nearly two hundred yards out and at the ragged edge of the black lights ability to illuminate he laid the crosshairs on the man waited to take the tremble out of the sight picture until the reticle sat perfectly astride the shoulder blades and pressed the trigger bob ran like a crazed man zigging this way and that trending north toward the crest of a ridge he ran blindly through the dark trees beyond caring what came at him branches cut his face slashed at his arms snarly roots tried to bring him down sending him spinning at one point nearly out of control he ran in darkness and all his wounds screamed at him he ran in fear and all his doubts began to yell at him he could not will his imagination to cease he saw it a man in a ghillie suit with a big silenced rifle superbly accurate drawing a bead taking the slack out of the trigger sending a bullet through him the sniper sniping the sniper something enraged him about this he was the man on that end of the rifle and now he was the man being sniped oxygen debt clawed at him shrapnel from an old wound seemed to have worked its way free loose glass ground and clicked in his stomach he could see the crest line just a few yards ahead but the trees thinned and he hated his nakedness his gunlessness his terrible vulnerability just a little bit more and yet as he moved from the trees to the open area just at the crest the huge weight of intuition clamped down on him if preece was going to shoot this is when hed do it involuntarily bob went to the earth sonic booms filled the air the sound clapped loud and when the rounds struck the ground they yanked up huge gouts of dirt and he could hear the whine of ricochets spiraling away hes shooting goddamn him thought bob low to the ground and squirming desperately through the vegetation he crawled like a madman for surely preece would be scoping the area where he had to be preece couldnt see him but he could feel him recon by fire every three or four seconds preece put out a probing round there was the closeby crack and the earth suddenly erupted as a bullet tore into it bob found cover behind a tree which might stop a bullet or might not he crawled to his feet crackkkk a bullet struck nearby filling the air with dust behind him crack another one bob stood behind the tree as still as he could hold himself whacccckkkk preece put a bullet into the tree it exited an inch in front of bobs face spewing slivers of wood and bark as it blasted outward he blinked blood away and saw lights flash as his optic nerves fired off a tongue of pain licked through his brain oh christ bob thought hes seen me he stood very still would the sniper fire again if he fired again the bullet would go through the tree and hit him would it have enough velocity to kill him nothing could be done you just stood there your ass on the line if he fired again into the tree the bullet would hit bob and yes would kill him please he prayed get me out of here whaccccckkkkk another round tore through the tree something stung bob in the arm and made him flinch furiously the bullet had torn through the dead center of the tree but as bullets will by the alchemy of velocity terminal energy rotation and target density had somehow deviated off the true and deflected enough to tear a furrow in an arm it must have missed his body by a half an inch would he shoot again run he told himself run like hell get away from here but he knew if he ran he was dead crackkkk a bullet tore into the ground ten yards behind him the sniper fired again farther away still he was probing another area bob heard a last shot maybe thirty yards away how big was the cone of his light maybe not that big without willing it he broke for the crest crackkkkk the bullet broke the earth just to the right of him kicking up a wicked spout but he dove and launched himself feeling achingly vulnerable and landed beyond the crest as crackkkk another round tore into the ground he was beyond the crest he was safe he lay there breathing hard damn preece thought possibly hed hit him but couldnt count on it the reticle had been dead center as the man leaped over the crest but he had a memory a sensation that his trigger finger may have rushed just enough to pull the aim off now what one down now what a certain part said disengage its over youve lost the advantage he knows youre hunting him he can hide a hundred places and ambush you but another part reminded him that bob had yelled his name and figured out who was coming for him he would come again preece decided move forward aggressively set up on and scan the ridge you still have the advantage in the dark you can overtake him in his flight and still get the nice clean shot between the shoulder blades he stood removed the magazine and reseated a fresh one with nineteen more s in it time to go to work he moved out at the trot and swiftly traversed the two hundred yards to the ridgeline and set up again very carefully he scanned the two hundred yards ahead of him he could see no sign of bob but on a far crest line where it should have been still in the night a bush still quivered as if something had brushed it in blind panic hes on the run thought preece his past flared up before him all his regrets his mistakes the terrible things hed done the shame he felt his weaknesses his failures his rancid uglinesses the forest was his own mind with all its crudities and barbarities its insensitivities its selfishness its indulgences its cruelties he couldnt stop running and he hated running hed never run before in his life and now he couldnt stop panic flared through him he didnt want to die he had a wife he had a daughter he had a life now after three tours and the terrible business in now he was going to die please dont let me die he thought abject and broken he crossed a ridge dropped for a second had he been running mindlessly was he lost could he just drop and wait for the dawn and come out in a few days he could get out get in the rental car and speed away for arizona he could forget all this the hell with it what was the point no matter what happened it wouldnt bring his father back he rose ran again directionless but no not really he knew he was trending due north for that was the dipper above and at its farthest point the north star the lost mans only and truest friend he ran farther through dense shortleaf pines through tangled scrub oaks and briers and vines up ridges at one point through a creek he fell once too stumbling on a root that pitched him forward scraping his hand ripping his knee he lay there on the edge of exhaustion feeling as ancient and as doomed as the egyptians i am fifty goddamned years old he thought and i aint going to make it but somehow he rose and kept going through the dark and dreamy forest now up another ridge now down another one ahead he saw a white winding river glowing ever so in the dark and ran toward it fled toward it feeling the hot sweat race down his chest and neck sensing his own hot smell rising finding some kind of leftright rhythm that recalled the faroff cadences of a parris island drill field and all the jodie chants how jodie was fucking your girlfriend but he never had a girlfriend and how jodie was the pride of your mama and your daddy but both his mama and his daddy were dead so who was jodie anyhow and why did he have it in so bad for poor marine recruits trying to master the intricacies of closeorder drill on a pitiless south carolina field assaulted by men with leather lungs who tried to make them feel like maggots but jodie came through here as then hating jodie somehow liberated a last squirt of adrenaline from a secret gland store in his body and he hit the river only to find it was a river of dust it was the road he crossed it quickly without a thought to security suddenly realizing he was far enough ahead of his pursuer he faded into the underbrush following the road from twenty feet off it gathering strength and passion with each step at last he saw it a little brown rented chevy would they have set up here were there more than one no there couldnt be one man a good man hunted him not a team he ran to the car got the key out opened the trunk he grabbed the mini flicked the scabbard away so that the gun itself was in his hands then he dug through the bag thinking that he had one yes one more and here it was a last box of cartridge mm m tracer he broke the box open and quickly threaded the rounds into the fortyshot magazine twenty of them then he broke open another box cartridge mm m ball and slipped five in atop the twenty tracers he racked the bolt felt a round feed he was armed he knelt put his fingers into the loam and came up with dirt which he smeared abundantly on his face to take the brightness off there was a bandanna in the old bag too and he tied it swiftly around his head to keep the highlights of his stillblondish hair from glowing he needed one more thing how do you fight infrared what is infrared it is heat it sees heat you have to fight it with heat you have to fight its fire with your fire at last he found the last thing the gallon can of coleman fluid for the lantern he picked it up feeling its liquidsloshing weight and terrible awkwardness but that couldnt be helped he slammed the trunk shut all right he thought time to hunt peck sat in the forest slouched atop the atv in the dark he was in the middle of a serious crisis of confidence his imagination soared with negative possibility he felt himself growing shaky testy rancid he kept looking at his watch willing the numbers to melt more swiftly into other later numbers but they were stubborn boys theyd hardly moved a notch since the last goddamned time hed checked three minutes ago this was going to be a long night he rested in a hollow a few hundred feet off the trail by which hed brought the sniper into his territory around him towered huge trees that leaned gently in the breeze but he could see exactly nothing and had no sense of space or distance the nearby trees yielded merely to textureless black he felt like he was hiding under a blanket and at any second someone could sneak up on him and put a bullet into him he didnt like it a bit he spat a gob into the undergrowth he listened his only connection to what lurked around him was through his hearing he knew no news is good news the sniper worked silently if peck started hearing things happiness wasnt just around the corner and so far he had to admit so good he heard the whisper of air now and then the scream of something small and furry dying before its time the hoot of the occasional owl but nothing metallic or mechanical that was good that was very good he knew sound traveled miles in this place under these circumstances and his worst fearbob silently dispenses with the sniper and then comes hunting himcouldnt come true he dreamed now of a simple pleasure a world without this bob lee swagger that was the world he wanted because in that world with the patronage of mr red bama behind him he at last had found his place his niche no redneck deputy with little education gambling debts dental bills zero savings and an amphetamine habit no sir he would count he could have a nice woman a place hed be part of what he had always seen as it meaning people who knew what to do people with friends and possibilities instead of as he was now a little man out on a limb all by his own lonesome no one to catch him if he fell no one to care he was on nobodys agenda he was just an angry white man and if he didnt take care of himself who would thus when the first sound arrived he went into denial he convinced himself it didnt come he had heard nothing it was some trick of nature out to hornswoggle him but then it came again this time classifiable by direction it was from the north and it was the sound of metal striking metal familiar but still unidentifiable he fought a bit of panic what was it he tried to search through his memory and the only image that seemed to associate itself with the sound was ludicrously automotive it sounded somehow like someone working with a car in some way possibly opening a trunk then throwing things around inside the trunk he waited listening so hard he thought his brain would explode how could there be a car nearby and how nearby was nearby then he remembered the dirt road north of here about half a mile he knew that bob and the boy would have come by car and would have parked somewhere before they moved into the forest he looked at his watch pm could swagger have made it all the way back to the car in that time he waited for the sound of an engine to signify that whoever it was was moving out of the area leaving him to his own mission but then he heard louder than anything before the solid crunch of metal locking into metal he knew it instantly a trunk lid being slammed shit and goddamn he suddenly felt achingly vulnerable the atv was out of the question he couldnt be bopping around the woods on a fourwheeled motorcycle generating noise and exhaust easy meat for all and sundry instead he dropped off the vehicle and quickly calculated the point where the noise originated and the point where the sniper hid and thought to intersect them if bob was moving around in the woods he would be hunting a sniper not any old poor nobodygivesashitabouthim duane peck with a chance to make his way in the world he didnt want to do it but sometimes as duane well knew wants dont have nothing to do with it he flipped off his hat and began to nightnavigate through the woods he drew his glock repeating to himself what that neechee had said that which does not kill you makes you strong bob tried to recall the terrain why do you never pay attention to the things that become so goddamned important but he willed himself to recollect and had a memory of what he thought would work best if the plan hed cooked up were to have a chance wasnt there a place hed noticed on the left maybe half a mile in where the trees thinned for a bit opened to a clearing possibly left over from a logging operation some years ago at the base of a ridge or was that from some goddamned dream would he just bumble around until he placed himself before the sights of the sniper who would nail the nailer he tried to press that out of his mind he tried to think what will preece do will he follow me yes he has to but how aggressively hell dawdle scanning the woods afraid to get too close for risk of an ambush knowing that hes got all the advantage if he doesnt blow it with overaggressiveness thats what id do now how to draw him toward me there was only one answer he drew the mini to his shoulder aimed it pointlessly into the dark and fired three times fast the gun cracked and flashed spitting empty brass lighting the vault of trees that curved overhead kicking ever so slightly the noise was loud and in its echo a few sleeping birds screamed or flapped airborne uncorking a sense that the night had been disturbed bob wondered is he close enough to see the flashes he didnt know but now hed informed his antagonist that he was armed on dead reckoning he started to move to the left praying that up ahead just where he dreamed it was the clearing waited preece heard the shots three fast ones much less than a mile away though they were flat taps without texture or resonance he knew by the whipping crack that followed in their wake that they were supersonic and therefore rifle bullets not pistol bullets it had to be swagger hed gotten to his car gotten a rifle from the swiftness of the fire a semiauto not a full auto for they werent quite fast enough and didnt have the deadening mechanical regularity of a machine gun it sounded like an m or a mini nothing big like an or but more bob had panicked he thought he saw something move and ventilated it now he cowered breathlessly afraid that hed missed probably afraid to go forward hed move laterally knowing that whoever was stalking him would move toward the sound or hed fired deliberately to attract whoever was hunting him didnt really matter the solution was the same you move left or right of the source of the noise then set up anticipating a target to come to your new front if hes moved left he comes right to you if hes moved right hell come around you but hell be making the noise preece drew a compass from his pocket and shot an azimuth to a tree on a ridge two hundred yards away he flicked on the scope and took a last scan of the area looking for movement in the black light of the infrared nothing but the shimmer of vegetation he left his position and moved swiftly to the tree setting up on the ridge he scanned again this time for several minutes nothing ahead through the trees he saw another ridge he shot another azimuth to another tree and moved to it not rushing not making undue noise feeling relaxed confident and aggressive he was the only one who could see in the dark at the ridge he looked down a clearing the trees ended halfway down the slope and yielded to a kind of meadow or something where perhaps once thered been a forest fire or some logging operations hmmm it scared him in the forest he was invisible but out there possibly an experienced man might read his darker textures against the texture of the grass and send a shot home even without night vision this perplexed him maybe bob was playing some extremely subtle game on him whatever the trees cut off a good view of the ridge after scanning for several minutes to convince himself that bob wasnt hiding on this side of the clearing he moved stealthily over the ridgeline and keeping trees between himself and the clearing moved down toward the edge he was almost there when krak krak two shots lit off across the clearing and he could see the vivid flash not a hundred yards away was bob shooting at him but no rounds came whipping through the trees and the supersonic whissshcrack of bullets overhead didnt sound he dropped behind the tree scooted back into a solid prone and quickly brought the rifle to his shoulder simultaneously going to ir the rifle rested on the girders of his bones not the uncertain power of his muscles it was solid and the reticle didnt drift or wander in the green scope he could see it all the high grass of the clearing undulating in the breeze just like the corn the blunt verticals that were tree trunks and yes there he was the man bob the nailer he was on the other side about as close in as preece was moving back and forth evidently trying to decide whether or not to move across the field preece put the crosshairs on him mmmm no no it was a hard shot because he was wandering back and forth between the trees visible for only fractions of a second between them what the hell was he doing now that hed fired hed know preece would be on him but he couldnt know preece was already here had he gone mad had he flipped out then it occurred to him that he was hoping his fire would draw preece and that maybe he could lure him into the field and gun him down there where he was marginally visible sorry bob im already here i have plenty of battery time hours more i can just watch you and when you get impatient and step out from the trees i can take you down it was that easy he watched now as the glowing man settled behind a tree he kept peering nervously out he was waiting for preece i can wait longer than you bob im not going anywhere at all peck heard the first three shots from far away a dry sound almost like a tapping he gauged that they came from his right slowly he began to move in that direction scuttling between trees taking up a good observation position before moving on he moved across the night terrain steadily growing in confidence that was bob shooting but not at him had he hit preece he didnt think so the shots had more the sense of panic in them than anything he moved through the trees from ridgeline to ridgeline taking cover at the top of each crest and scanning beneath him for signs of movement but he saw nothing he was halfway up another ridge when he heard krak krak two fast shots maybe a quarter mile off and over to his left still farther he climbed the ridge and could see nothing but instead of descending he decided to traverse the ridge and moved along it for a bit until at last he saw what light no not light openness there seemed to be a clearing or something ahead he scurried along the ridgeline and at last came to rest overlooking the field this should be where the shots came from he had a feeling that if something were going to happen this is where it would happen bob peeked around the tree he had no indication that any human eyes or ears were within a hundred miles of him he felt alone on the face of the planet no he told himself hes there hes tracked me by the shots hes seen me move among the trees hes there hes all set up right now hes in a good solid prone a hundredodd yards out hes got this tree zeroed he knows hes got me but there was no snake to announce the sniper this time thats because there arent snakes everywhere in the forest he had gotten a snake in the draw he wasnt getting one here hed used up his snake luck it didnt matter preece was there he had to be there was no other place for him to be he looked at his watch it was close to ten thats when my father died didnt he at ten after a running fight some guy in the trees a hundred yards out puts the scope on him pulls the trigger and goes home to cold beer and rare steaks well lets see what happens this time he pulled himself out darted quickly between the trees back and forth drawing the snipers scope to him until he felt the crosshairs but he was relatively confident the man wouldnt fire because the trees interfered with his sight picture why should he shoot between them when in seconds his target would step out into the open how long would it take how quick would he shoot would he shoot fast yes hed shoot fast hed be on him like a flash put the crosshair center mass and with a champions longhoned trigger control fire in a second one second no two seconds he wont rush theres no need to rush he has it all right there before him theres no need to rush two seconds you have two seconds he told himself bob leaned the rifle against the tree and picked up the gallon can of coleman fluid with his fingers he explored the can until at last he found the bottom he took out his case xx pocketknife pried open the blade quickly holding the can upside down he punctured its metal skin right at the bottom three times on each side the sound of the blade plunging into the sheet metal had an odd thrum of vibration to it he tossed the can out beyond the tree where it hit tipped but gurgled as the volatile liquid inside poured out of the holes and soaked into the brush he seized the rifle listening as the fuel chugged out it formed a pool and its vapor began to rise in a palpable mist its stench washing over him it would linger for a second or two a balloon of gas without a skin time to go he thought and stepped out it felt so familiar it was so like the first time hes waiting a hundred yards away for a man to emerge except not from the trees but from the corn the weather was almost identical and so was the time it had the ache of déjà vu to it he knew it was close to time bob couldnt wait any longer he had to move in the scope against the green of the infrared preece saw him behind the tree fiddling with something possibly checking his rifle an odd banging came metal on metal signifying what he watched as something was launched from the tree and landed with a thud beyond now what the hell was that he grew impatient come on marine he thought lets do this lets finish it it has to be done at last bob stepped out into the black light which was green in preeces scope faced him frontally and appeared to step toward him got you thought preece he placed the crosshair dead center of the chest and felt the trigger begin to slide back of its own volition encountering just a whisper of resistance as it pressed against the internal mechanisms straining for release it was a fivepound trigger he had two pounds of weight against it then three then it was all gone the black light wiped white in harsh incandescence what the hell he blinked hard involuntarily drew his eye from the scope and looked into the heart of fireball that vaporized his night vision detonating his optic nerves filling the eyes in his brain with pinwheels skyrockets illumination rounds of sheer wild color bob stepped out his rifle in his left hand his held behind him in his right hold it he told himself smelling the vapors one hold it again he told himself as the vapors rose around him he felt crucified he was on the cross there was no help he fired the pistol it bucked in his hand its muzzle flash ignited the column of vapor behind him as he dropped it he felt the whooosh as the darkness ruptured with a blade of light so fierce and radiant that it bleached the colors from the forest and the field even as it briefly exposed them starburst nova supernova the universe ending in fire the heat rolled across him and he felt his back pucker and blister as he fell forward across the clearing like a dogs eyes caught in the full light two lenses captured the radiation from the fireball and reflected it back at him they were stacked circles the lens of a lightamplifying scope and the lens of an if searchlight but still they were the eyes of a beast bob fired over his sights not through them aiming out of instinct following the illuminated trajectory of his first round the tracer flicked fast and a little low kicking up some dirt in a nanosecond he corrected fired again the tracer skipping across the distance so fast a whipsong of illumination and it went to the eyes and struck between them fire for effect he thought thats in the book of countersniper operations locate then overwhelm with superior firepower he jacked ten fast rounds into the eyes the tracers snaking over the clearing and plunging into the position across the way a sleet of light he threw darts of light bolts of light missiles of light as he burned through the rest of the magazine a controlled burst three shots a second walking the rounds across the position where the now vanished eyes had proclaimed themselves the tracers struck and sunk or they bounced crazily away like flecks of an exploding star he looked and all about him fires burned but he was done jesus h christ peck drew back astounded at what he saw before him a column of flame like the detonation of a bomb gushed upward through the trees then in a second someone was shooting tracers they dashed across the field fast low and ugly snapping remorselessly at the base of a tree on the far side he had a terrible suspicion that jack preece was on the receiving end of the fireworks his night vision was shattered but enough of it came back in time to see a dark shape rush from the tower of flames cross the clearing and close on the far position and bend to probe a body it was enough peck knew he was overmatched time to get the hell out of there bob found preece in his ghillie suit looking like a sofa that had exploded he lay on his belly and bob almost put a shot into him but held up the body was still the fingers relaxed fuck you if you cant take a joke he thought he turned the body over in the illumination of the fires flaring across the clearing he saw that the man had taken at least four or five shots in the head and upper torso blood everywhere the face smashed and broken bob flipped the body aside preece was the ultimate stepon bob knelt to examine the weapon and saw quickly that it too was destroyed a bullet had smashed the scope and another had shattered the lens of the infrared searchlight now it occurred to him he was illuminated in the firelight maybe there was someone else around he felt no triumph or power but only the emptiness of survival he moved out now what it was first light and the sun had begun to filter through the black trees turning them gray and then green russ stirred painfully his limbs were numb from the water that had washed over them all night he tried not to look at jed posey whose skull had been evacuated and now seemed like a queerly semideflated balloon he had no idea what was happening sometime last night the sky had lit up for a second or so as something huge and hot burned fast thered been gunfire too a batch of rounds tapping out almost fast as a machine gun he thought but since then silence he remembered his instructions wait until dawn the snipers rifle is worthless in the light as well as awkward and heavy so youll be safe then strike out due west moving quickly six or seven hours away is the road us get into town call the cops tell everything to everybody and what about bob no sign of bob possibly bob was doing all that shooting possibly not russ couldnt imagine a world without a bob in it it somehow seemed impossible he pulled himself out of the creek and climbed up the bank he searched for the compass in his pocket found it held it level and let it orient itself then he shot an azimuth due west picked a landmark at its end and started out for it the woods in the increasing light were quiet green and oddly lovely something about the freshness of the morning dew the sense of a long and bloody night past and having somehow survived it wouldnt this make a terrific book he wondered if he had the strength to write it maybe not now but after a few weeks rest he had an image hed take that job on the fort smith paper get a little place and work hard in his off hours on the book maybe he could go up to nashville to vanderbilt and see sams granddaughter jeannie who something crushed into russ knocking him flat he thought it was bob rescuing him but the iron strength applied against him pushing his face into the loam and the sudden spasm of pain as a knee drove into his kidneys told him no he struggled pointlessly as the larger stronger man dominated him toward submission another knee thundered into his kidneys and sent a rocket of terrible pain up his body he couldnt see he felt something hard and cold against the flesh under his ear and he then heard a voice you move you fucking whelp and ill kill you right here it was duane peck something snapped around his wrist and then around his other wrist he was handcuffed come on baby boy said the deputy pulling him up peck looked crazed splotched with sweat his hair a damp mess his eyes wild with madness were going to meet your pal bob crawled from the brush at first light he thought hard about his own next move and saw that attempting to intercept russ in the forest was pointless instead he decided to move back to the car escape the immediate area and set up somewhere on route where russ would probably emerge around noon then they could go get a good hot meal and return to base camp and figure out a next move whatever a next move might be he looked at his watch it was about am he had one subsidiary stop to head back to the far side of the clearing where he had to recover the mini a rifle that was traceable to him and whose spent shells would match the spent shells found on the roadside of the taliblue trail that might lead to more explaining than he cared to do warily he looked around and in the gray but increasing light could see nothing there was no noise except the occasional peeping of an awakening bird a low mist clung to the ground all the better he crawled from cover reached back to check his and then began to move low and zigzagging through the forest did he want to recheck the body no he decided not to if there was another man in the forest one thing such a boy might do is set up there he determined that there was no incriminating evidence at the body nothing to connect him once he got rid of the mini the rifle was the important thing he approached from the southeast slithered up to a fallen log and examined what lay before him he could see no signs of human activity only an undulating wild clearing a hundred yards by a few hundred yards crazed with kneehigh grass and speckled with flowers at the oblique a scorched blackened tree stood where he had detonated the fireball lucky the forest was damp and the flames didnt spread very lucky it was something he hadnt thought of in the craziness of the moment last night its better to be lucky than good he thought carefully he maneuvered around the perimeter of the clearing until at last he had returned to the site of last nights action a few small fires still smoldered and he kicked them out he stood in the core of the fireball a blackened cylinder seemed to have been cut in the trees but it would grow out quickly he went to the tree behind which hed hid and saw the rifle lying a few feet out in the high grass he went quickly to it and lifted it while he was out there he collected spent shells and seemed stuck at nineteen but then remembering the sense of being pronged in the face by a shell ejecting straight back it happens he slid backwards and found the twentieth shell far from where the others had landed and near it the single casing that had lit the fire shit hed forgotten that one he stuck it in his jeans pocket then he remembered hed fired twice more to attract attention back in the trees a bit he moved back and had a little trouble at first but then a glint of brass announced itself and he picked up one and nearby the other shells at car he thought three of them pick them up too he took a quick look back across the way he could make out very little of where jack preece lay it occurred to him to bury the body but he didnt have a shovel he didnt feel like getting preeces blood and dna all over himself and some forest animal would come along and dig it up anyhow if preece was found preece would be found and someone could have a field day coming up with a conspiracy theory as to how he got there and what he was up to some johnnie would probably write another goddamned useless book on it he was set it was time to go he stood and began to move and then he heard something not sure what it wasa shout a call a squawk something natural something humanhe slid back pulling out the thumb rising to the safety as the empty mini was now useless what the he waited and it came again yes it was a human call blurred and almost recognizable from somewhere off to the left his eyes scanned the terrain he caught a flash of motion across the way in the trees and watched as it tumbled into focus the awkward form of a man walking clumsily he saw it was russ tumbling forward but yanked back then pushed forward again bob made out the second man behind him controlling him it was peck of course peck screamed again sniper come on and fight me sniper goddamn you duane peck saw his future in a second when the boy stumbled toward him he would take the boy and through the boy take the sniper in that way he would endear himself to red bama and the bama organization and enjoy a life of respect wealth property and importance everything he yearned for and the boy presented himself so easily snotnosed punk stumbling through the woods duane had subdued many prisoners in his time the secret was leverage and meanness one of which he obtained by surprise and the other of which he had always had by genetics or environment the boy captured cuffed and pushed before him he now had to determine how to handle swagger but it didnt take long to figure that out the glock had a hair trigger when you took the slack out of it the muzzle held against the boys head the trigger gone back on itself as far as it could go and he was invulnerable to any rifle shot for a rifle shot would surely cause his finger to constrict and the boy would be dead too that he knew about swagger he cared about the boy he would not let the boy die he would draw swagger to him unarmed and then simply shoot him what could swagger do he could not risk losing the boy that was his code that was his weakness it was the one thing that duane knew better than his own name attack through weakness this was swaggers this gave him an advantage that neither the ten professional gunmen nor the nightvisionequipped marksman had it was in fact the one advantage duane peck had always had and he knew it he was willing to do the dirty work he didnt have any illusions he didnt mind the blood spatters and the screams he could get through anything he knew he could do it hed been spoiling for this chance his whole life he pushed russ along savagely not seeing him as human he was full of rage and power and felt at last he was coming into what was owed him for having put up with having so little for so long go on you little fucker he hissed his mind foggy with anger you give me any shit and i will kill you right now i the boy started and duane clubbed him hard with the gun driving him to the earth drawing a rivulet of blood down his neck and into his shirt he reached down and sank a hand into the boys thick hair pulling his head back hard while putting his boot between the boys shoulder blades as if to break him on a rack yeah you give me lip you little bastard and you will be sorry as a sack of shit he pulled the boy up to his legs and shoved him ahead you moron the boy shouted back at him he knows you killed sam hes been looking forward to this hell kill you dead cold duanes breath left him that wasnt a good sign he felt adrenaline flare through him and the urge to dump the boy shoot him in the head and run like hell spiraled through the deepest and most frightened part of his mind but no goddammit maybe the old duane peck not the new one this was it his chance grab it and make it happen be strong git going you little bastard he hissed in what seemed like not much time at all they reached the clearing duane held russ close and looked about it he could see nothing was bob there he didnt see him he shoved the boy ahead they moved through the grass into the clearing duane started hollering come fight me swagger come on goddammit or i will kill this boy right here come on you gutless asshole come and fight me but nothing happened see hes chickenshit he said to the boy you say hes a man but he aint he likes to kill people from a long way off and scurry away like a little toad but when it comes to mans work by god his little dick gets small and goes away he paused come and fight me sniper he screamed again and then he saw that he was going to get his wish across the way he watched as a man emerged tall and strong and walked toward him with the slow and steady pace of a gunfighter youre fucked said russ bob had the commander cocked and locked over his kidney not in the insidethebelt holster but wedged lightly between his jeans and his shirt too delicately situated for vigorous action it was set just so for one reason to draw he could see peck hardly at all as he approached only russ his arms jacked tight behind him was visible the boys face was pale with fear and he looked as if he were in great pain now and then peck peeked around for a glance but quickly retreated behind his human shield with a good rifle bob could have possibly hit the brain shot but he didnt have one he just had the and he didnt like pecks damned glock with its tricky dangerous trigger its black snout pressed at the boys temple it seemed to take forever that long slow walk through the grass across the clearing the sun was shining through the trees the birds were singing the grass ruffled in the breeze it looked to be a glorious radiant arkansas summer day get in close he told himself you get in close then you get ten feet closer he kept moving am i fast he thought well see if im still fast thats far enough called peck what bob said taking another few steps i said hold it peck bellowed the gun coming off russs head and toward bob bob stopped and raised his hands and the gun went back into russs neck just under the ear bob was five feet away close enough to see the whiteness of the taut index finger as it rode the trigger right to the breaking point and the way the square muzzle actually plunged a quarter inch into the soft skin in the gap between the boys jaw and his skull just under the ear russs eyes bugged like deviled eggs aint this a pretty picture bob said fuck you swagger said peck you are checking out today partner shoot him said russ through a throatful of gun shoot through me and kill him you shut up now russ said bob peck this heres between you and me isnt it let the boy go let him run free then you take your shot at me and we will see whos the quicker man today i got a better idea said peck i shoot him and then i shoot you and then i go home a big hero who you working for said bob you aint ever going to find out said peck now and then hed lean out from behind russ and just a bit say a twoinch slice of the side of his face would be clear but only for a second like many stupid men he was quite cunning he was not exposing anything for bob to shoot at assuming bob could even get his gun into play fast enough shoot him screamed russ i got some money said bob i been financing this thing off a killing i made in a lawsuit years back got sixteen thousand left small unmarked bills buried not far from here what you say peck that money for the boy then you and i have our business winner take all might as well get paid peck considered the money was a little tempting but nothing would keep him from his idea of the good life no way he said turn around turn around or by god i shoot this boy then take my chances with you here it was if he turned peck would shoot him shoot the boy if he drew he might be able to hit peck before he fired but the odds were against it but he had to move the time had come he looked at russ who had his eyes shut and whose face had gone gray hed made his peace like many a soldier whos about to die will do so here it was keep them hands up peck was shouting more and more insanely gone now lost in madness and turn around or by god i will a telephone rang incongruously there in the middle of the clearing with the sun rising russ choking to death bob with his hands up duane peck playing his last and grandest hand the telephone rang peck leaned out in surprise and bob saw the confusion in his eyes as he tried to figure out what to do and then in just a split second his eyes involuntarily veered downward to look at the phone on his belt and by the time they came back they were surprised to see not bob but a blur of bob a bob whose hands already seemed to have a gun in them and were moving so quickly up his chest and leveling toward him that there was no way to make a measurement or take a picture and peck tried to get the glock over on him to catch up but knew he never could the bullet hit him in the right eye crushing through it bounding through the cerebrum opening as it went and plunged to the dense tissues of the cerebellum the impulse to fire was trapped forever in his nervous system never reaching his trigger finger he fell backwards stiff as a bronze statue his knees so locked that when he hit he bounced the glock thumped into the grass russ was stunned by blast his face peppered by flecks of hot powder and one eye was blurred and watery his ears rang thunderously he turned and looked at peck totally defunct one word came to his mind cool he croaked but bob was already kneeling at the man and had pried the ringing folder phone off his belt he looked at it in terror how did it work the button under the earpiece push it russ cried bobs quick hand reached it yeah he said gutturally whats happening peck came a voice that he had never heard an arkansas voice not without its polish and charm though now undercut with urgency bobs mind emptied at the question then he said in a slightly better imitation of peck its over got em both goddammit bellowed the voice why didnt you call me ah bob began but the voice plunged ahead i told you to follow orders exactly dont you get that yes sir mumbled bob trying to keep himself bland and simple sorry i but the voice had lost interest and shot ahead to new topics is the general all right yep bury the bodies get the general home and disappear for a week call me next week i want a full report yes sir said bob the phone clicked to dial tone nicholas bama fourteen was dreading his biology test because he hadnt really studied for itor at least to the degree he was expected to he had small gifts for certain thingsmath for examplebut not for biology and mr bennington st timothys school for boys entire biology department was known as a mean and nasty sucker even in the summer semester which was saved for boys who possibly werent up to the relentless course as part of their five majors during the regular academic year so nick sat with a combination of selfloathing and anxiety in the schools lab as mr bennington a large man who peered at the world through flat pale eyes over the halfcrescents of reading glasses bore down on him like the bad news that couldnt be avoided the test was distributed a word flashed from the text that terrified him pith ray now what on earth was a pith ray it seemed somehow to touch something he knew someway somehow but pith ray he felt his mind purge itself of its few torturously acquired biological concepts yielding a great empty void yet suddenly there was a commotion and he looked up astounded to see the headmaster mr wilmot and his stepmother the beautiful beth miss runnerup as everybody called her behind her back earnestly conversing with mr bennington mr bama spoke mr bennington in his best fake english accent your services are required nick turned the test over and obediently trotted to the front of the room the immediate envy of all the other nonbiology geniuses in the lab well arent you the lucky boy said mr bennington imperiously saved from yet another brush with distinction madame take him hes yours is he not beth didnt know quite what to do in the face of this continental hauteur but she managed her best thing which was a smile of such glacial aching beauty that its failure to impress bennington proved for once and all the man was homo and she nodded to nick and out they went beth is anything wrong he asked is daddy all right keep the long face up hon she said conspiratorially i told them he was in the hospital hes as right as rain beth ushered nick through the signingoutofschool process down the dank frosty corridorsit looks like a morgue nicky beth whispered and it would to a girl who grew up in a town called frog junction arkansasand out into the sunlight where her gleaming black mercedes sclass awaited nick could see that he was the last pickup beths own twins timmy and jason were in the backseat looking grumpy for having been pulled out of soccer camp nicks older brother jake lounging in the front seat his hair a thistly unshowered mess as if hed just been roused from his bed he had and his oldest sibling amy pert and pretty and perfect looked as usual pissed off at being hauled out of her job at the tennis club by a stepmother who was closer to her own age than her fathers whats going on nick asked oh you know your father he called me at nine and said get the kids all of em its time for a party a party said nick yes said beth a party thats what he said you know your father and his ways they drove through town and in twenty minutes beth had driven them up cliff drive to hardscrabble country club of which their daddy was majority owner it was a vast baronial building red ragged stone and gabled windows set on the highest point in a lush kingdom of golf course and tennis courts and swimming pools the doorman ushered them in this way please he said mysteriously mrs bama jeff will park the car the whole unruly unwashed mob straggled in through the foyer and into the banquet hall making odd sounds of confusion and alarm what on earth what they saw astonished them the long table had a groaning buffet on it all the styles of eggs in the world sausages pancakes mounds of fluffy grits fruits pastries golly said nick and next to it nick blinked this was the craziest thing his father had ever done next to it a twelvefoot fully decorated christmas tree heaped underneath with presents is everybody here his dad said stepping out of the kitchen come on lets eat then well open presents uh hello said amy earth to daddy its august i thought christmas was in december oh well have one then red said but i thought wed have one today too red said beth when did you start planning this believe it or not less than three hours ago i called the staff of the club to get them going i called that

themselves a fine old time chowing down with the exception of course of amy the smith freshman who stood apart and would not participate because she considered such ostentatious displays of wealth and capital vulgar she pronounced i am vulgar said her father twitting her i admit it gauche even what about crude overbearing ostentatious selfindulgent selfish and boorish but honey you have to admit vulgar puts the food on the table lots of it daddy she sniffed you are so gross then it was time for presents each one of you red said as he took command of the assembly each one of you should have a rolex life is much better with a rolex than without one so the theme of todays christmasinaugust celebration is rolexes for everyone even those of you who have a rolex now you have two rolexes he walked among his children and wives with an armload of gift boxes lets see he said i think this one is for timmy oh and what do we have here we have one for jason and i think this one is for jake at last he got to nicholas now nick isnt this better than biology yes sir it sure is said nick gazing up at the loony tune who was his father go ahead his father said open it nick opened the package yes

arm mr bama yes what is it ralph telephone ralph im with my family now it can wait mr bama its washington they say its urgent i dont suppose nobodys hunting us now said bob lets get some goddamned breakfast they pulled over at a dennys on just south of fort smith and went in it was about eleven now all the ejected shells had been picked up the mini had been dumped in a deep and remote part of the black arkansas river and they were an hour north of the ouachitas the bodies would be found when they would be found maybe in days maybe in months maybe in years russ was going on sheer adrenaline he was out of the shock and numbness which had been replaced by a burst of manic energy i feel great he proclaimed dennys god i never thought id ever be so glad to see a place in my life i could eat a horse they ordered two big solid breakfasts and reduced them to crumbs and grease slick for russ life after a night as tense and dramatic as the one hed just survived seemed especially poignant with meaning and sensation he turned to bob twice you saved my life you stopped us from getting sniped you hit peck in the head unbelievable shooting my god i thought my father was a good shot that was unbelievable shhh said bob just relax youve still got a gallon of adrenaline in you in an hour itll dump and youll feel like shit we got to get you some sleep and get them abrasions fixed russ just for the hell of it let me tell you this you did good okay lots of people would have lost their heads out there you did real good your old man would be proud of you okay russ said nothing well anyway said bob next move before your adrenaline dumps and you whack out on me give me the next move youre the genius okay said bob we beat the man again we got to find the man now and bring the fight to him whos the man hell if i know i know hes there i just dont know who the hell he is any idea no the only people who could tell us are turning to fertilizer in the forest we have nothing are you sure best bet said russ go back to fort smith we have a few days when he thinks were out of it when he thinks hes won we go back to the paper i can get in and spend a day in the morgue i can investigate the fort smith of where all this began maybe somehow i can but bob wasnt really listening whats going on russ wanted to know we do have a prisoner said bob he held up duane pecks flip phone and i think i know how to make him talk he added they found what they needed in the central mall off rogers avenue a dark cathedral to consumerism one of the hushed devotional niches in the long corridor was dedicated to cellular phones pagers faxes and other newage information technology they entered and in a second bob had selected the wannest and palest of the young men there to chat with soon snaring him in fatherly power and sheer marine corps sergeant charisma now see heres our problem said bob we were hunting in the woods and we come across this here phone now im thinking some important man needs this phone id sure like to know how to return it to him you have any ideas there young man the boy took the phone and examined it a motorola nc the very latest and most expensive thing have you tried autodial asked the young man no and i havent tried that redial either now if i tapped that redial button wouldnt that connect me with his last phone call it would said the young man why dont you just call and see what you get hmmm said bob that would work wouldnt it let me ask you another thing you been working around phones long ah a couple of years said the boy im sort of into phones very interesting stuff know what said bob squinting up his eyes as if hed just come up with a hell of an idea bet if i hit redial and you listened to them tones as the number played out you could read them for us couldnt you you know the numerical values of the tones right the boy looked a little uncomfortable i think thats against the law he said is it said bob damn i didnt realize that its just to return the phone right said the boy yes indeed we definitely want to return the phone to its rightful owner the boy took the phone held it close to his ear and pushed redial the phone issued a bleat of beep music a chatter of robot tones before the call could connect he broke it off okay he said its an number let me try again and concentrate on the last seven numbers he hit it again i get let me try it again the beeps poured out thats it what does that tell you ahnothing i never heard of an exchange i never heard of an exchange beginning with a zero its not from around here i never heard of that exchange do you have a cd phone disk asked russ the boy nodded his head really into it by now lets see what we get he said this took a bit of time but in a minute or so at a computer terminal the young man had a phonefinder running on cdrom and quickly learned that the exchange was wholly unlisted anywhere in the united states what would that mean said bob well these disks have a lot of unlisted numbers on them but ever since deregulation private exchanges private companies private information networks have sprung up all over the place only lightly monitored by the fcc my guess is this is somebodys most private line not immediately accessible to the public or maybe even to the government its just a very very private number i still say just call it well for now we dont want to do that listen thanks so much sure not a problem they left the mall it was too much to hope said russ he wouldnt have been so sloppy as to leave something at risk that would point the finger straight at him damn said bob what else do we know about this bird well he must be rich powerful and connected if he was able to get jed posey paroled if he was able to put together a team of hotshots if he was able to get jack preece on the job hes got a lot of clout hehe has an airplane russ wasnt sure where that popped out of it just issued from his deep subconscious he has an airplane said bob presumably from around here now if hes in the air the day of the big shootout didnt he file a flight plan yes hed have to thats a public document isnt it uh i think said russ now whynt we go out to the airport and see if theres someway we can get into the faa records for that day maybe on that flight plan hes got to list a phone number maybe its this one or close to it goddamn said russ goddamn yourself russ he has an airplane youre a goddamned genius at the airport russ himself did the deed he went into the faa regional office pulled his daily oklahoman press card and explained that he was doing a big takeout on civil aviation particularly the conflict between private plane owners and the commercial carriers in crowded aviation corridors he spent an hour taking notes as a droning administrator explained the governments position to him two or three times in case he missed anything russ finally told the man that one way to do such a story would be to set it into the context of a single day in the american air why hadnt he thought of this before and it might be nice to profile who was in the air at a given moment as a kind of cross section of the problem he seemed to pluck a date out of his memory which was in fact the date of the shootout on the taliblue he wondered if he could examine the records of that day and get in touch with some private plane owners who were aloft again the minutes ground by but in time he had a thick file of flight plans fetched from the files and he peeled through them recognizing nothing until at last he came to a cessna conquest twinengine job cn registered to redline trucking whose pilot had filed for oklahoma city that day leaving at am and landing at pm that was very interesting but what really caught russs attention was the phone number that the pilot had listed on the plan it was only three numbers off the mystery number and it had the strange prefix russ realized that redline trucking must lease or own a whole bank of numbers for its various enterprises under a private exchange of which would have to be one he looked at the pilots name bama he said the name aloud randall bama the next day much rested after an eighteenhour blast of sleep in a ramada inn south of fort smith russ and bob went to the fort smith municipal library where they accessed all the information that was in the record about randall red bama of fort smith bama construction redline trucking the bama group real estate development hardscrabble country club the chamber of commerce president and the rotary the opera guild and so forth and so on it explained a lot how three carloads of professional shooters and a deputy sheriff and a worldclass sniper could be set up to hunt them down but did it explain enough they went back through the stacks and found as many references to his father the great and notorious ray bama pawn king of fort smith denizen of nancys flamingo lounge known compatriot of the big little rock and hot springs mob and rumored mob kingpin with ties to santo trafficante and carlos marcello in new orleans and big jim westwood in dallas whose life was ended in a mysterious car bomb in but by late in the afternoon when they reached the end of the research they still had nothing but speculation which led them to a certain conclusion that somehow someway earl lee swagger had learned something about the old gangster and was therefore targeted for elimination but nothing in the last weeks of earls life made any sense along those lines he was a rural state police sergeant a good one but not an organized crime investigator or a member as far as could be determined of any elite unit of investigators county state federal or otherwise that could be moving against ray bama then at the start of his burgeoning career and there was no accounting anywhere that suggested any connection to the death of shirelle parker discovered on july the last day of earls life by earl himself at dinner that night bob said i think we should move against him anyhow hell explain what hes up to at the point of a gun jesus said russ the guys sure to be heavily guarded hes a gangster for crying out loud no matter how civicminded and philanthropic and visible you just dont walk up and point a gun at him so that seemed to be it all right said bob settling down weve still got more work we have to find someone in the state police in and see what my father would have been doing where he could have known or learned something about ray bama russ shook his head i think youre overvaluing your fathers profession you want him to be some kind of superinvestigator hot on the big case so that his death will have a lot of meaning but the truth was your father was just like my father a rural state policeman my father probably hasnt investigated two things in his life hes not an investigator unless hes detached to a special unit and your father clearly hadnt been detached to a special unit bob chewed this over all right he said bitterly youre the expert what does a state policeman do thats the most elementary question i aint ever asked it i guess what does a state policeman do you tell me maybe thats the answer russ thought well he goes on patrol he appears in court he answers calls he clears accidents he reports to his barracks commander he goes on training he writes tickets he stopped smiled he writes tickets he said if my father has done one thing over the past thirty years its not hunt down lamar pye and his gang its write tickets he probably wrote ten thousand tickets in his time the moment hung in the air bob had a sense of something before his eyes something luminous and heavy something palpable and dense something big he looked at russ russ looked back somethings on your face said russ ah bob thought tickets he finally said tickets so i then he too felt the touch of the breeze in my fathers effects remember said bob a last book of tickets half gone right to the end he was giving out tickets tickets he thought tickets pull incomers they shot from the trap a simultaneous pair and rushed at him as if they were bound to destroy him but red was together today the krieghoff barrel was a black blur as it rose through the lowesthe firedand then moved instinctively a bit right and up through the highestand fired again the two birds detonated spectacularly against the green of the forest powdered literally obliterated by the remington charges you are on a tear red said his companion i am i am he said pleased hed hit thirtyeight straight he hadnt missed the expensive shotgun felt alive and beautiful in his hands hungry to kill it sought the birds as if liberated from all restraint like a purebred ferocious dog just off the leash and gunned them out of the sky mercilessly pounded them to puffs of orange powder i feel good said red next week im taking the family to hawaii all of em both wives all the kids except goddamned amy who wouldnt go across the street to see me hanged my guards the whole thing my first wifes mother goddammit the runnerups worthless brother for gods sake well have a great time youve been through a lot said his companion you want to be fresh for the fall yes i do said red they walked through the forest to the next station it was a beautiful day in west arkansas and the trees towered majestically green and dense against the pure blue sky and the surrounding mountains the path occasionally yielded to openings where they could look out on the humps of the ouachitas stretched before them or in another direction to the flatter lands of oklahoma to the west its good to be alive said red ahead his trapper scampered into the trap station and red stood back as his friend took the next cage rising teal far out a tough one a single a following pair and a simo pair as he set up to shoot red absently closed his gun took out his choke wrench and changed his improved cylinder and skeet i and screwed in modified and modified improved for the longer shot his friend was shooting an expensive perazzi and was an excellent shot but not up to reds standards today he fired took the single but only one of the following pair just relax called red im too relaxed he called back pull he called and the two birds climbed out of the tree line against the blue sky he followed and tracked them and fired but only one vaporized damn he said you have too much on your mind red said you have to be empty zenned out you have to trust your instincts his friend laughed whenever i trust my instincts he said i get into trouble red went into the shooting cage a little wooden gazebo that oriented him down a long yellow draw to a clump of bushes between two golden hills slid a remington into the lower barrel and set himself pull he commanded and the bird announced its own launch with the whang of the trap arm and soon rocketed into vision with leisurely aplomb red followed it and dusted it felt so good he ejected the shell dropped two more into the chambers reset himself he gave himself a second to think out the sequence see it move mount shoot follow through he took a breath looked for little indications of panic or doubt and found none pull he shouted whang the bird rose and he waited until it came to a dead rest that wondrous moment where gravity and acceleration were in total equipoise and blew it away he dropped the barrel a bit to pick up the rise of the following bird and there it was there it was he rose up and through it and squeezed and the bird was vapor ah he thought a warm surge of pleasure hed never shot a hed had seven s dozens of s and hundreds of s and s but never a and hed never been this close and this teal simo was the last really tough shot he had to get this shot and then it was downhill he broke the gun watched the small mushroom of gun smoke rise from the chambers as each shell popped out and threaded two more in he set himself but didnt want to take too much time because its more than possible to think yourself out of a good shooting sequence he liked where he was looseygoosey ready hot fluid quick and in the zone pull he called nothing happened no whang no birds nothing damn he hated it when that happened thats how you lose concentration he made a mental note to chew out the trapper when the round was finished are you ready he yelled there was no answer he took the silence as assent set himself again wiped his mind and once again called pull again no birds mike he called the trappers name what the hell is going on there was no reply he looked back to his friend and the vibrator on his pager buzzed against his hip damn that meant peck was calling him what the hell was this about he thought about ignoring it just shooting the round out but how do you ignore it call him get it dealt with then get back in the round he leaned the shotgun against the gun cage stepped out have to make a call he told his companion he dialed the message line waited for it to connect heard that he had one new message and then got the message call for the birds again it said fine he thought stepping back into the cage picking up the shotgun then his mind computed the significance a tremendous sense of unfairness came over him he picked up the shotgun gripping it tightly but he could see nothing he set the gun down looked back at his unconcerned partner and seized the folder off his own belt he dialed pecks number he heard the phone ring in his ear and twenty feet away he grabbed the gun and ran out of the cage off to the left and saw pecks phone hanging from the limb of a tree ringing peck didnt make it said somebody he turned and saw his nightmare the sniper in full camouflage regalia an ancient god of vengeance his face not even human but a warriors face lost in the swirling colors of the woods his hair wrapped tight in a camouflaged bandanna his eyes narrow and dark he had simply stepped from invisibility into reds life he lifted a automatic and pointed it straight at reds face set the shotgun down bama or i will kill you and you know i will red set the shotgun down guards he screamed guards theyre tied up two stations back said the man it wasnt their day red turned swagger he said because it was all he could think to say in person said bob then pivoted to point the gun at reds friend this has nothing to do with me said the man i dont see a thing im not involved in this at all then drop that gun or i will drop you sir i am not here to fuck around the perazzi fell to the ground you may think im frightened of you swagger said red his face narrowing in fury but im not guys have come at me before and if this is the day i check out fuck you because my family is taken care of and my children love me so fuck you swagger you do what you have to you got some balls red that ill say said swagger talk to him screamed the companion negotiate with him make him an offer this doesnt have to happen you shut up said bob to the man i have a boy a hundred yards out there with a right on your chest you shut up and sit still until i talk to you the man went silent as if struck the idea of the rifle on him chilled him out and he sat as if to move one inch in one direction would earn him a bullet now red said bob i do want you to talk to me whyd your father kill my father back in fuck you and the horse you came in on swagger i have allies i have people who know i was gunning for you if you kill me theyll hunt you down and take you out well maybe thats a fact but it wont mean no never mind to you red that i guarantee you now you going to answer me or do i have to shoot a kneecap off whos kidding whom said red furiously you dont have it in you to shoot my kneecap off youre a soldier not a goddamn torturer talk to him screamed the terrified companion tell him what he wants to know make him a deal a cash deal fuck cash said red hes not a cash boy he looked at swagger his eyes burning with furious contempt and rage finally he said all right ill tell it once then its over then you do what you have to do talk said swagger your father was looking to buy some land he had been examining plots in the polk county deeds and claims office and hed learned that something called the southland group had bought up most of the land in polk county because he was curious hed investigated and found out what nobody was supposed to know that southland was a dummy corporation owned by my father and a man named harry etheridge a us congressman theyd funneled thousands into it with the idea that etheridge would push through a parkway or highway and open up that part of the country for development it would be worth millions your father bumbled into the information he was the only one who knew of the secret powerful very profitable link between the etheridge and the bama men it was the linchpin of my fathers power and position your father had to be stopped so the congressman and my father put together a plan that turned on some contacts we had in prison and they recruited a kid named jimmy pye just due out they told him if he did it theyd set him up in hollywood he wanted to be the next jimmy dean but we were worried he wasnt good enough so harry etheridge who was on the intelligence oversight committee called in a cia chit and got a case officer named frenchy short to ramrod a secondary plan through the backup shooter nailed your dad and nobody was the wiser end of story sorry but business is business and thats the truth as i live and die now fuck you do what you want guess what red what youre wrong there was a long moment of silence then red turned and stared at the sniper fuck you no fuck you because youre wrong you been played like a yoyo and your daddy too another long moment yesterday said bob id have believed that id have blown you away and gone home a happy boy but not today what are you talking about said red his eyes narrowing in concentration it aint about land i bet if you wanted to you could pull that story apart real easy i bet the dates dont match the money dont match it dont quite work out its what you were told its what got your family involved but it aint quite right its a cover story not only because my daddy loved his own land and wasnt about to move for nothing whats it about then said red its about a boy who didnt want to pay his speeding ticket there was another long pause as red looked bob up and down his rage somewhat tamed by curiosity what are you talking about on july at am my father issued a speeding ticket to a nineteenyearold kid for traveling eightytwo in a fifty zone near a spot on route between blue eye and a town named ink called little georgia what my daddy didnt know was that the reason that boy was speeding was because he had just raped and murdered a little black girl named shirelle parker fifteen years old at little georgia which was a red clay deposit hed picked her up in blue eye on the way back from a church meeting and whyd she git in the car with a white boy when her mama had told her never to get in no car with a white boy because that was a civil rights meeting and shed met a white person who believed in her and believed in her struggle so shed learned not to hate white boys and it got her killed red stared at him who was the kid he asked bob said a harvard kid raised in washington dc the son of a powerful politician himself loaded with ambitions then he turned and pointed at the man on the bench him he said red turned and faced his friend the son of his fathers friend hollis hollis etheridge stood hollis you you hes lying said hollis he went home in a panic and told his father his father being congressman harry etheridge boss harry etheridge and being the sort of man he was he couldnt see his boys life being ruined by a little mistake with a black gal so he moved quickly through his sources and came up with frenchy short who moved the girls body to get it away from little georgia and set up a frame on the lightestskinned black boy he could find a boy named reggie gerard fuller who was executed for the crime the problem was the state trooper they could get the ticket out of the court records but they couldnt get it out of the troopers mind and they knew the trooper would put two and two together they knew from the start they had to kill the trooper but in some way that didnt look suspicious and didnt invite close examination of the troopers last days and for which there was a ready explanation and a convenient killer thats how jimmy pye the next jimmy dean and jack preece the sniper come into it all for him for the next vice president of the united states theres no proof said hollis its all lies all political figures are used to rumors like this youd be laughed out of court red its nonsense its nothing he doesnt have a thing i have this said bob he held up the old book of tickets your signature the time the date the place any crimelab can authenticate the age of the ticket and the age of the ink its just as good now as it was then it puts you at the site of the murder at the time of the murder itll put you in the chair today just as it would have forty years ago and this time your goddamn father aint around to pull strings and if my fatherd had another day hed have seen the connection and put you on the row he lifted the gun and pointed it at holliss handsome head hollis bowed please he said you know how much evil came out of that night you know the people who died you know the train of destruction you set in motion you know the lives ruined the lives ended the lives embittered because of that night why why did she laugh i didnt mean to he said she started to scream i had to stop her from screaming i never meant to bob lowered the gun my friend is a newspaper reporter he said well go to the paper and publish this well get the case reopened theres been enough killing he slipped the back into its holster and turned to face red bama who now held the loaded krieghoff through the lenses russ watched red bama pick up the shotgun from a hundred yards out he watched the man raise the shotgun watched its barrels pivot lazily do something he told himself involuntarily his fingers closed on a trigger but there was no trigger he had no rifle why didnt you give me a rifle he screamed to bob lee swagger his eyes glued in horror to the binoculars i could have done it red thank god said hollis yes said red thank god and he fired both barrels one two fast as they could be fired the no shot hit its target it didnt have time to open or spread but delivered an impact similar to that of a nineteenthcentury elephant gun a tremendous package of weight and velocity and density the first charge literally eviscerated the chest the heart and lungs the spinal column the second hit just above the mouth and destroyed the skull all the facial structures the features the hair the body was punched backwards and came to sprawl in the bushes gun smoke hung in the air russ watching from a hundred yards away bent and puked nice shooting said bob itll cost me a million dollars red said to straighten this out and its the first fatal accident in the history of sporting clays he shook his head he would have been vice president you know it was set he might very well have been president everybody has to pay it was his turn bob said yes said red but do you know why i did it to save me the trial to save the humiliation to save the legal fees to avenge that poor girl because he broke the rules and hurt a child maybe but the real reason is that i now realize he not only killed your father he killed mine my father must have been the only man alive who wasnt an etheridge but who knew the secret and when boss harry died son hollis got to worrying about that so there you have it did we pay our fathers back for what they did for us not really but ill say this swagger we sure as hell tried damned right said bob but red had a last surprise for him he looked up his eyes narrowed in sly concentration and i know you think youre much smarter than i am because you figured all this out and i didnt so i give you that but i have a surprise for you too bob looked at him when you go home i want you to say hello to julie and ykn for me there was a long moment my family said bob the pay phone we tracked your collect call i had your wife and daughter swagger i could have used them to get at you you made a mistake bob saw how it could happen but i dont do families thats my policy now you have no more business around me and mine and ill have none around you and yours you evened your scores i evened mine its over its finished its done we are free men right that sounds like a deal to me said bob state police investigators descended on the accident scene in their legions along with hundreds of media types and for a few days the little sporting clays range in west arkansas was the most famous site in america leading all the network news shows the newspapers were full of the etheridge tragedy a grand jury was swiftly empaneled by sebastian county prosecutors but by the end of the week no true bill of indictment was voted and prosecutors announced their acquiescence to the inevitable ruling of accidental death there just wasnt any evidence to the contrary red bama clung to his story and his two bodyguards and the trapper all of whom had witnessed the event confirmed his account hed just loaded the krieghoff when his cellular rang and he turned to step out of the constricting cage to get it off his belt momentarily forgetting that he held the loaded shotgun and he banged the stock against the cage and somehow the gun fired although investigators could not get the gun to duplicate the accident in the ballistics lab but that is the tragedy of the firearm so enticing so alluring so beguiling so damned much fun is the gun and yet when a mistake is made with it the consequences are beyond all scale to

magazines and on tv shows in the arkansas state legislature a bill was introduced to rename the parkway now called solely after his father the hollis and harry etheridge memorial parkway and it passed

and let me give you one last piece of advice all right russ said okay make peace with your father youll be a lot happier hell be a lot happier hes your only father you only get one id give anything

better but my dads just a man hes an asshole he finally gave in to his selfishness thats all there is bob was quiet for just a second and then he said you know youre a very bright kid you were right

you missed something russ you missed something big russ turned what could he have missed what surprise was left what are you talking about ask yourself this if the child who became lamar pye was born nine months after jimmys death when did jimmy get his young wife pregnant russ paused considering he never made it back to blue eye said bob my father stopped him in that cornfield edie pye never saw her husband alive from the last time she visited him in jail a month earlier russ shook his head what did where was this going i think miss connie might have figured it out but she was the only one if she did she didnt let on i dont russ began oh yes you do said bob russ looked up at bob my daddy was alone with edie that last day for at least an hour he liked her a lot she liked him a lot later when he left to go for jimmy he told me about two kinds of bad bad evil where you decide to do wrong and say fuck it and bad mistake where you want to do the right goddamn thing but it gets clotted up and confused sometimes and before you know it never meaning to you done made a mess he was talking about himself youre saying thats right russ big bad old lamar pye he was my brother russ didnt stop having lamar pye dreams right away in fact two weeks after he got back he had a terrible one the worst yet a screamer full of lamar shotguns this time jeannie vincent thrown in his hero bobs gun empty and not shooting a real monster but as the weeks passed the space between them seemed to widen and then one day in late september hed been so busy with his arrangements and his goodbyes he suddenly realized it had been almost a full clear dreamless month so he knew it was time for the last thing it was a small house much smaller than he expected and he checked twice to make sure he had the address right but he had the day was beautiful now chilly with the coming fall but very clear and the constant oklahoma wind pushed through the trees shaking them dry of leaves russ got out of the truck and went up to the house climbing up the porch and going to the front door i feel like an idiot he thought but he knocked anyway and after a bit the door openedit was still the midwest and people opened doors without looking out firstand a young woman stood before him she was in her late twenties strikingly attractive thin with a spray of red freckles on her whitish skin and a crop of reddishblond hair yes she asked youre holly he said yes im sorry who are im russ she still looked blank she was not getting this russ pewtie he said my dad lives here russ russ oh god russ i didnt recognize you its been so many years and you were a teenager come in come in hell be so happy she all but pulled him into the house which was modest but clean and had a lot of books and gun magazines around little indicators of domestic intimacy irritated russ a lawton constitution tv guidebook a pair of nike running shoes his fathers by the size a table with a checkbook and a stack of bills where someone had been paying what was due a frame displaying a batch of decorations from the oklahoma state police but he pushed the anger and the pain away this is the way it is he told himself from somewhere deeper in the house came the sound of a football game bud bud bud honey guess whos here goddammit holly came his fathers irritated voice from the sunporch where the tv evidently had been placed its the fourth quarter who the bud its russ russ his father came booming out of the doorway and stood there huge and looking more like john wayne than ever his hair was shorter but just as gray and hed lost that pallor and grimness that had been so evident when hed been recovering from his wound several years back russs freshman year he no longer seemed halting or confused oh russ its terrific to see you he said beaming his face flushing with pleasure hi dad said russ a little sheepishly feeling fourteen again this is making him so happy said holly crying a little he just said to me oh gosh id like to see russ again holly get the boy a beer no get the man a beer lord how hes grown and toughened up i talked to your mother on the phone she said you were going back to school vanderbilt in tennessee thats a good one i hear its real good its better for me because it isnt so eastern you think youre going to stay in the newspaper business well sir im going to give it a try im majoring in english and ive got some projects in mind is that why you were in arkansas yeah you wont believe this i decided to try and write the life story of lamar pye he said so i went back there and looked into his background he had quite a background russ why why he was a violent scumbag he lived as he died he hurt people yes i know dad and i wanted to know why did you find out yes said russ i did it has to do with family anyway howve you been you look great whatve you been up to they talked for three hours the sun hid behind pale clouds the day was gray and dreary in the distance the prison showed white the only source of radiance in the grim day as always it looked exactly like it was what it wasnt a magic city an enchanted castle the tall thin man climbed the scruffy little hill around him the oklahoma plains rolled away toward the horizon he walked among the grave markers seeing the names of felons long forgot bad men whod done terrible things and now lay unlamented in this forgotten parcel of america the everpresent wind whistled kicking up a screen of dust that swirled across the ground and between the gravestones at last he came to the one hed been seeking lamar pye was all it said that one somebody said that was a bad one bob looked and saw the old black trusty whod been here before when russ showed him the spot wasnt you here a few months back the trusty asked his face screwing up in the effort to remember yes i was he said you was looking at old lamar then too right we came to see lamar thats right he said we dont get many people stopping by you was the only one ever came to see old lamar id remember if there were more nope you and that boy the only ones bob looked at the gravestone there wasnt much to see just a flat stone overgrown and dusty showing the wear of wind and dust and time a bad bad boy said the trusty the worst boy in the joint lived bad died bad bad to the bone bad at the start bad at the finish he was a bastard bob said no one could deny that pure evil said the trusty i do believe god sent him to us to show us what evil is maybe so said bob but from what i understand someone did a good job of beating it into him id say men put the evil in him not god its what happens when you dont got nobody pulling for you or nobody who gives a damn about you the old black man looked at him and didnt know what to say there was the sound of other vehicles and both men turned as a tractor with backhoe began to lumber down the prison road followed by a long black hearse what the hell said the trusty bob reached into his jacket and pulled out a document here im supposed to give this to the supervisor but hes not here so i guess i give it to you the old man opened the document with a puzzled look fumbled with some glasses and tried to make sense out of what was there its an official exhumation order bob said were taking lamar back to arkansas hes going to be with his father the old mans eyes were filled with incomprehension but no further explanations came bob turned and headed down the hill where his wife and daughter stood waiting
