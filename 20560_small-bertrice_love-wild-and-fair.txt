farmers nae got it come now off wi yer riding clothes whew ye smell like the stables ye know the earl is coming to dinner this night to help celebrate yer birthday i carina believe ye are fifteen i can remember that stormy december night ye were born catriona stripped off her clothes she had heard this story many many times before the snow swirled about greyhaven and oh how the winds howled and roared continued ellen the old countess yer greatgrandmam insisted on being wi yer mother i had just had my seventeenth birthday i was the youngest of my family and been spoilt something fierce but as i showed no signs of wedding and settling down my old granny spoke to her mistress yer greatgrandmam and they decided i should look after the new baby old lady leslie took one look at ye and said this ones for my laddie glenkirk sure enough ye were barely out of nappies when she was arranging yer betrothal if only she could have lived to see ye grown and wed but she died the following spring and me old granny followed her but a few weeks later while ellen talked she worked setting up a bath for her young mistress in a great oak tub placed before the fire pouring scented oil into the steaming water she called out come now my lady tis ready the girl sat dreaming while her shoulders and back were scrubbed then she took the soap from ellen and finished up the job while ellen fetched a small jar of shampoo from the cupboard she poured a thin stream of golden liquid into catrionas hair added water and building up a sweetsmelling lather washed and rinsed the girls hair twice seated by the fire swaddled in a large towel catriona let ellen dry her hair the excess water removed the tiring woman brushed and brushed the thick heavy hair until it gleamed pinning up the darkgolden mass she motioned her young mistress to stretch out and then massaged her with the palegreen cream her mother ruth made up the girl stood up and ellen handed her her silken undergarments she was standing in her petticoat and blouse when her mother entered at thirtysix heather leslie hay was at the height of her beauty she was radiant in a darkblue velvet gown trimmed in gold lace and a marvelous rope of pearls that catriona knew had belonged to her greatgrandmother her lovely dark hair was mostly hidden beneath a blueandgold cap your father and i wish to speak wi ye before our guests arrive please come directly to our apartments when you are dressed yes mama said catriona demurely as the door closed behind her mother automatically she let ellen dress her all the while wondering what her parents wanted she was their only daughter having an older brother jemmie eighteen and three younger brothers colin was twelve and the twins charlie and hughy were ten her parents had always been so involved with each other that the raising of their children had been left mostly to nursemaids and tutors she had had to plan her own life from practically the very beginning it would have been different had her greatgrandmother lived she knew that tutors had been hired for jemmie but no one thought to teach catriona how to read and write until she forced herself into jemmies lessons when the startled tutor told her parents that their daughter learned faster than their heir she was allowed to stay consequently she had been educated as a boy was but only until jemmie went away to school after that it had been up to her she had insisted that her parents hire a tutor who was fluent in french so she might command that language and she saw to it that the young man employed by her family also spoke italian spanish and german considering how thoroughly educated both her parents had been there was no excuse for their neglect twenty years after their marriage heather and james hay were more in love than ever the neglect of their offspring was innocent a matter of thoughtlessness the children were well fed well clothed and well housed it did not occur to the young master of greyhaven or his wife that their children needed more than these essentials the boys had felt secure in the warm love of their nurses but their daughter had needed more ellen moreleslie knew it and did her best but cat hay grew up spoiled and willful with nobody to check her standing in front of her pier glass the girl studied herself tonight she would meet her betrothed for the first time in several years he was twentyfour and had been to the university in aberdeen he had also been to paris traveled extensively in europe and spent time at queen bess court in england he was handsome assured and wellspoken she knew he was also about to sustain what she hoped was a severe shock to his ego she smoothed the forestgreen velvet of her gown and smiling went off to see her parents to her surprise her oldest brother was there too her father cleared his throat it was he said gravely always planned that ye marry glenkirk sometime after yer sixteenth birthday however wi the untimely death of the third earl last summer and young patricks investiture as fourth earl of glenkirk it has been decided that yer marriage will be celebrated at twelfth night astounded she looked at him who decided father the earl and i wiout asking me her voice was angry asking you why daughter ye were betrothed eleven years ago the marriage has always been a fact james hay sounded annoyed his daughter irritated him she always had she was not the soft gentle creature his wife was ye might hae told me the new circumstances and then asked if i minded being wed a full year in advance she shouted at him i dont want to be married now and yeve wasted yer time entirely for i hae no intention of wedding patrick leslie at all why ever not dearest asked heather hes such a fine young man and yell be a countess hes a rutting bull dearest mama since uncle patrick was thrown from his horse and broke his neck and the new earl came home a day doesnt go by i dinna hear of his conquests the countryside rings wi tales of his prowess in the bed in the hay under a hedge i will nae wed wi the dirty lecher the master of greyhaven was stunned by his daughters furious outburst jemmie began to laugh only to be silenced by a look from his mother heather realized too late that she had neglected a very important part of her daughters education leave us heather commanded her husband and son sit down catriona she said to her daughter when the men had gone do ye know anything of what goes on between a man and a woman in the marriage bed aye said the girl harshly he pushes his cock up the hole between her legs and a couple of months later the baby comes out the same hole heather closed her eyes a moment oh my child she thought in my great and consuming love for yer father i forgot ye were a woman too ye know nothing of the delights shared between lovers and i dinna know if i hae the words to tell ye opening her violet eyes she took a deep breath ye are partlycorrect heather said calmly but the act of love between a man and a woman need not result each time in a baby there are ways of preventing conception while still enjoying the delights of love i shall be pleased to teach these things to ye before yer marriage the girl looked interested lovemaking is quite nice catriona is it how mama she sounded scornful dear god thought heather how do i explain hae ye ever been kissed my child perhaps some of yer boy cousins hae tried stealing kisses at parties aye theyve tried and i hae hit them hard they dinna try any more heather wanted to shriek her frustration kissing is very pleasurable catriona so is fondling deliciously so i might say cat looked at her mother as if she had lost her mind i canna imagine mama anything pleasurable at all about a man and a woman squeezing each others bodies she was so damned superior that heather lost her temper well it is daughter i should know jesu cat ye are woefully ignorant ye hae no idea what it means to be a woman and thats my fault in the next four and a half weeks ye shall learn ye will marry yer cousin of glenkirk on twelfth night as we hae planned it is a wonderful match and ye are fortunate to hae gotten so good a one i will not marry him mama heather took another tack then what will ye do if ye dinna marry wi glenkirk there are other men mama my dowry is quite large only to glenkirk my dear cats eyebrows rose in surprise at last i have her attention thought heather relieved catriona your very large dowry is for glenkirk only mam arranged it that way should ye marry anyone else your dowry becomes quite modest did grandmam not consider that glenkirk might die or even cry off demanded catriona outraged if patrick had died ye would hae married james mam meant for ye to be countess of glenkirk and there was certainly no question of yer bridegrooms crying off come child patrick leslie is an educated charming man he will love ye and be good to ye i will not marry him the choice is not yers to make my dear now take that frown off yer face by this time our guests will be arriving your cousins will all be here to wish you happy her cousins oh god fortunately her uncles colin and ewan lived in edinburgh so shed not have to contend with their broods but the rest the boys werent so bad but those six simpering girls fiona leslie was a widow at nineteen poor owen stewart had not withstood the rigors of the marriage bed lush auburnhaired fiona with her stormgray eyes her red pouting mouth and her lowcut gowns next came sixteenyearold janet leslie who was to marry fionas brother cousin charles in the spring jan could scarcely contain her delight at being the future countess of sitheanthe silly cow ailis hay was already fifteen and slated to marry james leslie glenkirks next brother that marriage was at least two years off beth leslie was sixteen but adoring of her uncle charles was to enter a convent in france soon so she might have close family nearby her fourteenyearold sister emily was betrothed to uncle donalds son jacques de valoisleslie last was little mary leslie who at thirteen would wait three or four years before marrying cats brother jemmie cat hoped that by that time mary would stop giggling at everything jemmie said though jemmie didnt seem to mind catriona entered the hall with her mother at once she was surrounded by the cousins and their good wishes this was her birthday celebration and she found it impossible to remain angry suddenly fiona was saying in her husky feline voice cat darling here is your betrothed hasnt she grown patrick shes almost a woman catriona shot her older cousin a black look and raising angry eyes met the amused stare of patrick earl of glenkirk his large warm hand raised her little one to his lips cousin his voice was deeper than she remembered ye were always lovely catriona but tonight ye surpass every woman in this hall drawing her hand through his arm he led her to the dais left alone fiona was surprised and laughed the earl seated his affianced at the main table why are ye angry wi me he asked her im nae angry wi you then gie me a smile sweetheart she pointedly ignored him and the earl became irritated when the meal had been cleared away and the dancing began he found his aunt and seeking the quiet of greyhavens library demanded to know what ailed the girl its all my fault patrick wailed heather i am so sorry i hae wiout meaning to ignored a most important part of catrionas education the result is that she is void of emotion and cold as ice in other words my beautiful thoughtless aunt ye hae been so wrapped up in yer jamie that ye forgot to love cat but of course i love cat did ye ever say so did ye cuddle and cosset her as a baby a child a young girl nay aunt ye had no time for it ye were too busy putting into practice wi the master of greyhaven all the delicious things mam taught you heather blushed to the roots of her hair patrick what could ye possibly know of that what my mother told me he grinned wickedly at her my mother assured me that my bride would be warm and educated instead aunt i must thaw this ice maiden ye plan for me to wed she says she will nae wed ye said heather in a little voice gods bones swore glenkirk perhaps ye would enlighten me as to why not i dinna know patrick lied his aunt when her father told her this evening that the wedding had been moved up from next year to twelfth night she became furious she said no one had asked her opinion but it didnt matter as shed nae have ye have ye spoken to anyone of an earlier wedding we planned to announce it tonight aunt go discreetly and bring my uncle to me poor little cat he thought when his aunt had gone left alone from babyhood to run yer own life then suddenly the largest moment in yer life is abruptly decided for ye no wonder yer angry as to the other thing he gave but the briefest thought leslie women were by nature hotblooded and once awakened to the world of sensual pleasures he knew cat would bloom it would take time and patience but he was bored with easy conquests and he had the luxury of time james hay entered the library with his wife well nephew what is so important that i must sneak away from my guests i think we should hold off an announcement of my wedding date uncle catriona is obviously angry and frightened and i would nae distress her girlish nonsense was my aunt heather like that before ye were wed nay james hays voice became soft with remembrance she was all sweet eagerness i congratulate ye on yer good fortune would ye deny me the same luck heather and i were fairly well acquainted mused james hay precisely said the earl i hae been away for six years studying and traveling cat wasnt even nine when i left she doesna know me i am foreign to her and yet within four weeks time she faces the terrifying prospect of being wedded and bedded wi a total stranger come uncle yeve led a life of conjugal bliss gie me the time to win yer prickly daughter so i may hae the same pleasure well reasoned the master of greyhaven the wedding was not scheduled until this time next year but if shes not won over by then willing or not she goes to the altar agreed said patrick but uncle you and my aunt must agree to something else there will be times when my methods of wooing may seem strange and perhaps even cruel but no matter what happens in the courting i plan to make catriona my wife remember that aye aye assented the master of greyhaven but his wife felt a little shudder at her nephews words why he loves her already she thought surprised he has probably felt this way towards her since childhood first he will woo her gently but if that does not work he will woo her harshly for he means to have her oh my innocent daughter i hae best teach ye what i know before your impatient lover loses his patience and fills your belly wi his bairn she heard her nephew speak again i will tell her myself of this change she must not know that we ever discussed it when patrick reentered the hall catriona was dancing with his brother adam taking his younger siblings place patrick finished the dance with her she was flushed and laughing it was all he could do not to tumble her there and then so strong was his desire he caught her hand and drawing her away from their families into the privacy of a little alcove told her i hae been thinking that perhaps we should nae wed until sometime next year when i left glenkirk ye were a little girl i return to find ye a lovely woman i am anxious to make ye my wife sweetheart but i realize ye dont really know me would ye mind if we took the time to know each other for the first time that evening she smiled at him nay my lord i would like that but what if we find we dont like each other he cocked an eyebrow do ye snore catriona or perhaps chew the betel nut of the east laughingly she shook her head in the negative do ye like music and poetry and the melodious sounds of foreign tongues do ye like riding out in the misty quiet of a spring morning or beneath a border moon on an autumns evening does the first snow of winter delight ye do ye like bathing naked in a hidden stream on a hot summers day aye she whispered softly and for some reason her heart beat quickly i love all those things my lord then my dear ye should love me for i love those things also catrionas thick darkgolden lashes brushed against her flushed cheeks and the little pulse in her throat quickened my first breach in the ice patrick thought and pressed his luck further will ye seal our bargain wi a kiss he asked she raised her head and her leafgreen eyes gazed at him a moment closing her eyes she pursed her rosebud mouth at him thank ye catriona he said gently thank ye for yer first kiss how did ye know innocence has a beauty all of its own my love he stood let me escort you back to your guests when they appeared in the hall heather noted with relief that her daughter no longer looked sulky and her nephew looked content hell win her over she thought and looking on glenkirk with a womans eye she said softly to herself oh my cat what a lovely adventure awaits ye chapter fiona leslie lay on her bed musing about her cousin patrick the earl of glenkirk she thought how very much she would like to be his countess instead that milkandwater virgin catriona hay was to be his wife ridiculous fiona knew that there had once been talk of a match between her and glenkirk then grandmam had interfered and shed ended up married to that weak fool owen stewart how she had hated the old lady for that grandmam had known it owen had been sickly and though eager for his lush seventeenyearoldbride unable to consummate the marriage it didnt matter at all to fiona who hadnt been a virgin since thirteen shed quickly found what she sought on her husbands estate his name was fionn and he was a huntsman he was big and brutal with no sexual refinements but when he pushed himself into her she thought shed go mad with delight then the impossible happened and she miscalculated she wouldnt believe she was pregnant and by the time shed accepted the fact it was too late to rid herself of the brat she told her husband of her condition expecting the weakling to accept it and keep his mouth shut but again she had miscalculated crawling from his sickbed he called her all the things she was and told her that come morning he would expose her to the world for a whore here however owen stewart had miscalculated while he slept his wife smothered him with a pillow his death was put down to an asthmatic attack and much attention was lavished on his pregnant widow when the child was born only fionas maid flora moreleslie attended her the lusty boy was smuggled out and given to a peasant couple who had recently lost their own child fiona wanted no children cluttering her life a dead infant was substituted for her own and buried with much mourning in the stewart family vault fiona had not escaped unharmed either it had been a hard birth the doctor and midwife summoned afterwards had agreed that lady stewart would never bear another child but her secret was safe only flora knew the truth and flora had cared for her since she was a baby fiona was gleeful this night for she knew someone elses secret she had slipped into the library at greyhaven to escape the attentions of her cousin adam leslie adam had been lusting after her since they were twelve hidden behind the drapes drawn across the window seat she had heard the entire conversation between heather patrick and the master of greyhaven shecould not have been more delighted virgin cat was afraid of sex glenkirk would not put up with that for long and in the meantime fiona intended to dangle her ripe charms before him as often as she possibly could without seeming indiscreet shed also see that cat continued to harbor fears when ye smile like that mistress fiona i know it bodes nae good what mischief are ye about no mischief flora i am just thinking what dresses ill wear to glenkirk for christmas flora sighed delightedly christmas at glenkirk she breathed leslies of sithean leslies of glenkirk hays of greyhaven moreleslies of crannog we havent had a christmas at glenkirk wi all the family since yer grandmam died im glad the new earls put off mourning the old lord patrick wouldna hae liked it i imagine that since the earls to be wed next year to mistress catriona theyll be celebrations regular at the castle again yes purred fiona christmas should be lots of fun but cat unwittingly stole a march on her cousin fiona ten days before everyone else was due she arrived at glenkirk by special invitation of her aunt meg the dowager countess of glenkirk meg stewart leslie had been apprised of her nieces attitude by both her son and heather and she willingly supplied her eldest the opportunity to court his bridetobe she too had once arrived at glenkirk a frightened bride and mam had welcomed her warmly with love and understanding mam was long gone but meg intended to pay her debt by helping mams favorite greatgranddaughter who was her own lovely niece the weather was perfectcold and sunny patrick won his first victory when he presented catriona with a snowwhite mare shes a descendant of mams devilwind he said yell find her fast surefooted and loyal what will ye call her bana it means fair in the gaelic i know i too speak the gaelic oh patrick she flung her arms around his neck thank you for bana will ye and yer dubh ride wi us so they rode the hills about glenkirk during the day and in the evenings catriona sat with her aunt and cousins in the family hall of the castle the fire blazed merrily while catriona and the young leslies played at charades and danced with each other the dowager countess smiled indulgently and the earl swallowed his frustration for he was never alone in the evenings with his betrothed suddenly his luck changed the night before the entire family was to descend upon them he found her alone it was late his mother had retired early and expecting the others to seek their beds he had gone to the library to do some estate work returning late through the family hall he saw a figure seated alone on the floor before the fire cat i thought ye sought yer bed he sat down beside her i like sitting alone before a fire in the dark of night she said do ye like glenkirk my love aye she said slowly i wasna sure i would i remember it to be bigger but i suppose i saw it wi a childs eyes its really a lovely little castle then ye will be happy living here yes her voice was a whisper they sat quietly for several minutes then catriona spoke my lord would ye kiss me not like before but a real kiss i hae spoken wi both mama and my ellen they say the kiss ye gave me to seal our bargain was quite proper but she paused and bit her lower lipbut a real kiss has more substance she lay back her leafgreen eyes glittering in the firelight slowly he bent and touched her lips with his gently gradually he increased the pressure and then her arms were around him ohh my lord she said breathlessly when his mouth released hers that was ever so much better again please he willingly complied and with astonishment felt her little tongue flick along his lips a moment later she spoke again did ye like that my lord mama said the sensation is quite pleasurable it suddenly came to him that she was experimenting with the things heather had told her about but was feeling nothing herself chancing her anger he caught her in his arms and running his hand from the nape of her neck to the base of her spine molded her to his body fiercely his mouth took possession of hers using all his expertise he gently but insistently forced her lips apart plunging deep within her mouth he caressed her tongue with his and rejoiced silently when a great shudder tore through her he could feel her rising panic as she tried to struggle but he held her firmly until it pleased him to release her patrick she gasped and burst into tears he gathered her up and soothed her there hinny there he murmured at her while his big hand stroked her lovely hair dinna greet my love why did ye do that she demanded through her tears because my precious little bridetobe ye were experimenting wi me the things yer lovely featherheaded mother has told you ye did them without feeling anything yourself never my sweet cat never make love unless ye feel it yourself i did feel it what did ye feel he asked i felti feltoh gods foot i dinna know what i felt then i simply didnt want ye to stop but then i did i was all churned up inside and she stopped confused he stood and helped her up putting his hands on her shoulders he looked gravely down into her face when i was a lad of thirteen years i was formally betrothed to a wee maid of but four after the religious ceremony was over we were seated in a place of honor and a servant brought refreshments the wenchs blouse was low and i was just beginning an interest in the female form i could not take my eyes from those fat white bouncing boobs suddenly the child by my side poured her wine into the girls cleavage and scolded me roundly i fell in love in that moment and i have stayed in love all these years she looked up at him i am forever hearing of your conquests how can ye claim to love me when yer life is so full wi other women a man has special needs cat if he is unmarried and has no wife to satisfy those needs then he must seek elsewhere do ye seek elsewhere now she asked especially now damnit cat i want you naked in my bed wi your lovely hair in disarray crying out for love of me she felt a little thrill run through her at his words and looking up at him said if ye will gie up yer other women patrick i will wed wi ye on st valentines day of the new year if ye would say good morning and good night to yer true love then it must be adieu to all your other women would ye dictate to me sweetheart i will nae share ye patrick i will come to ye a virgin and ye may make of me what ye will for yer pleasure but i must be yer only love when we are wed i will consider it he laughed now off to yer cold bed you nagging little minx before i lose my selfcontrol and take away yer right to wear yer beautiful hair unbound on our wedding day giving him a pouting look she left the room patrick chuckled what a wench she was his cat hay not yet married to him and already trying to run his life well he knew two things now his bride was not the ice maiden he thought she might be and life with her was certainly not going to be dull chapter by the following afternoon glenkirk castle bulged with leslies and hays because she was to marry the earl catriona was spared the ordeal of the dormitory with her cousins fiona also escaped that fate because of her age and because she was a widow upon learning that catriona had been at the castle for the past ten days she hurried to find her and do what mischief she could cat was embroidering in the family hall and was alone fiona settled herself well little cousin how do ye like glenkirk castle very much said cat ill enjoy being mistress here she shot fiona a wicked look fiona gritted her teeth yer a brave lass to go into the wolfs maw as calmly as ye do what on earth do ye mean lord child ye must know glenkirks reputation his women cat feigned boredom gods toenail fiona everyone knows glenkirks a devil wi the lasses tell me something i dont know all right my dear i shall she lowered her voice and leaned forward they say that glenkirks cock is too big they say hes built like a bull having been married i know and i must pass this on to ye we leslie women are very tiny a big cock can tear us asunder why my late husband lord stewart was of an average size yet when he planted himself in me on our wedding night she paused for effect gleefully noting catrionas white face well cousin the pain was terrible and it got worse each time god assoil him it was a mercy to me when owen died but im a hay fiona it canna be the same wi me yer mother was a leslie cousin daughters are fashioned after their mothers i certainly dinna envy ye terrified cat repeated the conversation to ellen not so said ellen firmly that fiona stewart is just trying to scare ye theres but a moments pain the first time when the virgin shield is broken after that its just fine yer cousin is hot for the earl herself the wicked hussy shes trying to frighten ye off little silly she ruffled the girls hair all yer mother does is moon after yer father is that the act of a woman who suffers constant pain annoyed at having been so easily spooked by her feline cousin cat watched fiona to see if ellen was right fiona grasped every opportunity to be near patrick to wear her lowestcut gowns to display her ample charms the bitch cat thought the redhaired bitch she looked for her brother finding him she said jemmie tell me what ye know about cousin fiona jemmie snickered its said shes overgenerous wi her favors but i hae never gotten her into bed they say the bairn she bore stewart was not his he was such a weakling its doubtful he ever stuck it in her he looked at his sister ye like glenkirk now dont ye cat aye then beware cousin fiona for its plain to see shes stalking him though i doubt poor glenkirk realizes it but patrick was quite well aware of fionas interest and had cat not been staying in the castle he might even have amused himself for a bit with his hotblooded redhaired cousin he knew the whispers about her were probably true but it might be fun to confirm them one night just after christmas fiona attempted to force the earl with everyone else long in bed the earl remained talking before the fire with his brother adam he wanted a match between the forbes heiress and adam adam however convinced him that their youngest brother seventeenyearold michael would be far better suited to thirteenyearold isabella forbes than he i want to marry soon and not a child michael willna be ready to wed for three or four more years yet by that time the forbes lass will be ripe make the match between them shell go mad for his handsome baby face patrick laughed all right brother but whos the maid yer saving yerself for adam smiled and his eyes narrowed ive nae opened my suit wi her but i will soon the brothers sat awhile longer drinking the mulled wine special to the holiday season both were tall as their father had been but where patrick had his mothers dark hair and the leslies greengold eyes adam had the leslies red hairhis was a warm russet shadeand the amber eyes of the stewarts now warm with brotherly camaraderie and rich red wine they climbed the stairs to their apartments ive some good whisky from old macbeans still said the earl come in lad and hae a drop wi me twill help ye to sleep he opened the door to his bedroom and walked in his brother close behind him jesu adam gasped on his brothers bed the firelight playing across her naked white body lay fiona stewart why bless me coz yer the sweetest sight ive seen tonight what the hell do ye do here demanded the earl suddenly very sober and icy with rage ye wouldna come to me patrick she said softly so i hae come to you he could smell the warm musk of her perfumed body i pay for my whores fiona how much do ye charge patrick she pleaded huskily with him please im mad for ye cousin marry yer milksop virgin if ye must but take me be my lover yell nae regret it patrick by god said adam dryly whats yer secret brother fve yet to receive such a marvelous invitation from any woman patrick turned to his younger brother ye want that adam looked back at him aye for some time now then take it ill sleep in your room tonight no screamed fiona angrily i want you not that boy coxcomb my dear cousin said the earl calmly from all the rumors i hear ye hae certainly had much experience ye must know that making love to someone ye dont want is not only aesthetically distasteful but damned boring to boot turning his back on her he walked from the room adam closed the door behind his brother and shot the iron bolt home with a loud thunk well fiona luv he drawled lazily i hae been wanting to get ye in this position for some time now go to hell she spat furiously at him and standing up she tried to walk to the door adam reached out and grasping an arm pulled her back nay hinny he said cruelly crushing a pointed breast in his hand nay tonight yell spread yer legs for me he pushed her back onto the bed and fiona suddenly felt afraid since shed first been tumbled in the straw of a darkened stable at thirteen by her fathers head groom shed always held the upper hand in these situations helplessly she lay on the bed and watched her cousin slowly strip off his clothes the back and shoulders that faced her were broad and wellmuscled they ran into a narrow waist off came his trunk hose his hips were slim his buttocks nicely rounded adam leslie turned around and fiona gasped in shock once shed seen her fathers prized stud stallion mounting a mare in a field shed hoped then she would find a man with one as big now suddenly he stood laughing before her aye sweetheart for five years yeve been running away from the very thing ye wanted jesu she whispered yell kill me wi that but the moist secret place between her legs was throbbing hungrily practically crying she held out her arms to him his body quickly covered hers and he felt her warm hand eagerly reach to guide him carefully he pushed into her and having ascertained that she could easily receive his bulk he began a slow sensuous movement her body writhed wildly beneath him her nails raking his back as his movements became faster and fiercer she began a low moaning that a few minutes later culminated in a shriek of pure joy he rolled off her and lay quietly catching his breath then raising himself on one elbow he looked down at her and said for a wench whos been whoring since she was barely pubescent ye know damned little and its yer own fault yeve confined yer activities to amateurish lowlifes bending his head he thoughtfully nibbled for a minute at a pointed breast while his fingers played between her legs now i sweetheart he continued have been educated by the finest whores in paris london and aberdeen i shall happily teach ye everything i know still resisting him somewhat fiona said ive nae said id be yer mistress you vain boy i dinna ask ye my dear she looked puzzled i am sure that by now he said the church is used to giving leslie cousins dispensations to wed fiona was stunned im older than you she protested feebly by five whole weeks he chuckled ill be twenty next week luv he pulled her under him again and she could feel his hardness against her leg i dinna want ye she raged at him i want glenkirk ye cant have him hinny he doesnt want you he forced her legs apart ye hae no money said fiona besides ill nae live in someone elses house i have quite a good income from investments grandmam made for me as do you alone i am worth more than many a belted earl i also hae a share in the family shipping and the sheep businesses ye have a house in edinburgh that belonged to yer grandmother fiona abernethy well travel for several years and when wee king jamie is grown well return live in edinburgh and go to court he pushed deep into her then lay quiet fiona never understood why she spoke but she said i canna have any bairns stewarts brat ruined me i know he replied with irritating calm the midwife ye called afterwards has delivered at least three of my bastards it cost me two gold pieces to get that information and sweetheart i know it wasna stewarts babe he laughed as she swore a string of oaths let patrick jamie and michael carry on the family name wi a pack of babies he said i want just you but if i ever catch ye wi another man ill beat ye black and blue and deny ye this he thrust viciously in her for a month his amber eyes narrowed and glowed down at her the thought of losing what shed been seeking so long made a shudder run through her wrapping her legs around him she whispered in a frightened voiceill be good adam i swear it the following day to everyones surprise adam leslie announced to his assembled family that he was marrying his cousin lady stewart since neither his mother nor fionas parents had been informed pandemonium broke loose patrick spoke up in his brothers defense they asked my permission he lied smoothly but uncle i must apologize to you for not consulting wi you beforehand my own upcoming nuptials have addled my brain he turned to his younger brother and said sternly it was nae yer place to announce yer intentions until i had spoken to our uncle adam looked properly contrite come my uncle of sithean said the earl of glenkirk let us speak privately even a beautiful widow must have a dowry before he could protest the lord of sithean found himself borne off to the library where adam apprised him of the fact that his daughter would always be barren and that he was lucky to get any soninlaw at all considering that fact then why do ye want her asked sithean because uncle i love the minx sithean said no more he had never found his daughter particularly lovable and he knew her reputation considering himself lucky to be rid of her again he named a very generous figure for her dowry and was accepted the wedding was set for the spring when their uncle had left glenkirk turned to his brother why he asked ye could have had pretty isabella forbes and legitimate sons because patrick i really do love fiona i have since i was a boy shes a whore forgie me adam but shell lie wi any man not now she wont dinna look so skeptical patrick remember nelly baird aye said glenkirk ruefully recalling a particularly lovely wench hed been keeping in edinburgh shed been all his until he let his brother spend a night with her adam laughed and then becoming serious again said fiona will whore no longer its just that her capacity for love is great and until last night no man was big enough to fill it i am and shes content now but ye could hae had legitimate sons wi the forbes girl you and james and michael will all have sons to carry on our branch of the family id rather hae my little redhaired bitch ill not say ye nay brother said the earl for young mistress catriona hay has me dancing a merry tune take my advice patrick and tame the wench or yell hae no peace in yer house aye but how adam shrugged his shoulders that he said is yer problem brother ive got my own and her name is fiona margaret leslie

fiona may be my niece but i will nae allow one of my boys to mate wi that shewolf patrick drew himself up and looked down at his mother i would remind ye madame that i am the head of this family not

mine wi fiona meg leslie burst into tears and her two sons put their arms about her ye were always willful all of you boys madame we would be happy you and our father set us the example said adam she sniffed delicately wiping her eyes she smiled at them very well my lord earl and my foolish younger son i shall welcome fiona though i still believe it to be wrong the lass has a streak of mischief in her she can be wicked when she chooses i dinna like it chapter the earl of glenkirk wooed his bridetobe with the elegance and grace of a french courtier when ellen brought cat breakfast each morning there was always something on the tray from patrick it might be simple perhaps a sprig of pine and a gilded cone tied with red velvet ribbons or it might be as valuable as a carved ivory box holding a dozen diamond buttons cat and patrick became better acquainted on short rides through the december snows and long walks in the sleeping gardens patrick leslie was a welleducated man and his young betrothed who had struggled so hard for her own education listened to him eagerly it amused the earl to find this serious mind housed in such a lush young body but it worried him that she was so innocent raised in the insular world of greyhaven she understood almost none of the facts of life she had grown secure enough in his company to suggest they be married on st valentines day after easter adam and his fiona would be quietly wed though all the family knew that wedding would be a mere formality they were already living together as husband and wife and fiona who had always run to the lean was growing as plump and sleek as a creamfed cat she almost purrs giggled ailis hay i only hope my jamies as good as the lasses say cousin patrick and adam are as good at what asked cat ailis large blue eyes opened wide then she giggled again oh cat yer such a tease i dinna know what ye are talking about ailis ye hope jamies as good as patrick and adam in what in bed you goose said ailis exasperated they say the glenkirk men drive the lasses mad wi delight i canna wait till im wed in june god ailis yer as big a whore as fiona ailis eyes filled with tears and her blond curls quivered with outrage i am she said with great dignity as virgin as ye are catriona hay but there the similarity ends i look forward to my nights in the marriage bed and i shall do my best to please jamie yer as cold as ice and if ye dinna change yer ways the earl will seek solace in a warmer bed who would blame him cat stalked away from her cousin since the family had arrived for christmas glenkirks behavior had been quite correct there had been no repeat of that night before the fire when hed unleashed emotions in her she had never felt before and still wasnt sure she could handle she wanted to feel those feelings again that night clad only in a soft linen shift she crept from her apartments and hid in an alcove by the earls rooms it was cold and he didnt come till quite late she slipped from her hiding place and followed him into his room he turned why cat sweet what is it she shivered and he quickly dropped his furlined cloak over her shoulders now love what is so important that ye come to my rooms in the middle of the night shyness overcame her he picked her up in his arms and cradling her sat down in the chair by the fire tell me my sweet her voice was low i wanti want ye to make love to me nay hinny if i believed that i should have ye stripped and in my bed in an instant please patrick i really do oh my lord i am so woefully ignorant my mother has tried to remedy this but she makes love sound so lofty and spiritual then ailis chortles and giggles about the reputation of the glenkirk men and fiona is sleeping openly wi adam and looks so damned superior and content thats not at all spiritual so i dinna know what to expect please teach me even a little very well he said and there was a hint of laughter in his voice but if ye become frightened or want me to stop dinna be afraid to ask me all right patrick the room grew very quiet the crackling of the fire the only sound his one arm cradled her the other was free slowly he pushed one side of her shift down exposing a lovely globeshaped ivory breast its nipple colored deep rose for a moment he gazed at the perfection of it his hand cupped it tenderly and squeezed he felt her quiver ever so slightly and his thumb reached out to rub the tantalizing pink point into hardness he heard her gasp softly and a smile spread across his lips he bent to kiss her and heard his cloak fall to the floor as she wound her arms about his neck carefully he pulled the shift off her lovely body and dropped it on the cloak he stroked her satiny skin though she trembled she murmured contentedly and clung to him suddenly he stopped and she protested please my lord more i am not afraid but the earl was afraid for his own desires were fast mounting he knew he would soon have to stop or he would take her there and then cat sweetheart listen to me i am beginning to want you very much if i dinna send ye away now i may not be able to deny myself the pleasure of yer sweet body please my lord i want ye too take me now had she been anyone else he would have eagerly complied but this was cat his innocent betrothed who was just awakening to the joys of love nay hinny in the light of morning things will look different if i stole yer virginity now yed hate me for it later on sighing he slipped the shift back over her head he carried her back to her own bed and tenderly tucked her in good night love he whispered as he closed the door behind him cat hay lay still in the warmth of her bed and listened to the winter night the fire burned with soft sounds an owl hooted and was answered by a wolf she now understood what her mother meant but she also understood ailis and had more sympathy for cousin fiona she let her mind wander back over the last halfhour her breasts grew taut and she flushed for the rest of the night cat hay alternated between restless sleep and restless wakefulness he young body ached for patricks touch when they met to ride in the morning he greeted her in his accustomed manner she followed his example until they were safely away from the castle then turning slowly to him she said i regret nothing of last night he smiled at her intensity there is nothing to regret cat we but kissed and fondled the innocent pastime of lovers since time began i will come to ye again she said he chuckled you will stay in yer own bed like a good girl he commanded or ill nae be responsible for my actions she pouted at him i willna stay away he stared at her and realized to his utter amazement that she meant it my god he thought shes a tigress he said sternly if ye disobey me i shall take a hazel switch and beat your pretty bottom i mean it she appeared in his room again that night handing him a hazel switch she shrugged her cloak off she was naked he threw the switch in the fire and catching her to him kissed her deeply he allowed his fingers to stray between her legs she moaned softly and did not stop him the twelfth night festivities ended and the cousins departed for their own homes the earl insisted that catriona return to greyhaven for a few weeks before coming back to glenkirk for their wedding cat had not wanted to go but she had been coming to patricks room each night and he felt that if he didnt get some respite from the torture she was inflicting on him he would do something they would both be sorry for two weeks before the wedding she returned bringing her dowry of clothing jewels linens and furnishings to patricks dismay she was moved into the apartments of the earl and countess of glenkirk of which his bedroom was a part there had never been a lock on the door between the bedrooms for him to put one on now would cause much talk the first night of her return he stayed up late talking with adam hoping she would be asleep when he retired finally he bid his brother good night and went to his room the door between the rooms stood open he listened but there was no sound quickly and quietly he stripped his clothing off patrick her voice was sweet he turned to find her standing in the door between the rooms she was as naked as he was she held out a hand to him and he groaned come love my bed is already warm he couldnt take his eyes off her lovely generous breasts and sensuous long legs her honeycolored hair fell heavy and thick to below her tiny waist her eyes glittered as hed never seen them do if i get into yer bed tonight cat theres no turning back ill play no more games wi ye if i come to yer bed this night sweetheart ill take yer virginity make no mistake about it what i start ill finish come patrick she walked back into her bedroom he followed her are ye certain hinny she turned and put her hand on his chest sending a wave of shock through him i canna wait longer my lord please dinna make me beg ye she climbed into the big bed and held out her arms quickly he joined her and catching her to him kissed her strongly he felt her tremble against him and shifted to look down at her yer sure aye my lord she quivered like a captive wild creature as his lips began to explore her body his kisses burned deeply into her fair skin and when his mouth closed over a hard little nipple she felt a delicious mixture of pleasure and fear his hand explored the moist secret place between her legsteasing stroking caressing gently he moved a finger into her and she arched to meet it she was tight and her virgin shield intact he would have to be very gentle in order to cause her the least possible pain there was time though he had the whole night before him he wanted her excited to a peak she was not his first virgin and he had found that a maiden excited to her limit felt less pain than one who was tense he took her hand and placed it on his swelling organ she didnt pull her hand away but shyly and gently caressed him and suddenly bent and kissed its throbbing head a great shudder tore through him forcing her back beneath him he kissed her deeply their tongues were spears of fire exploring scorching her body began to writhe beneath him and patrick smiled bending over her he let his mouth travel to the tiny mole that perched at the top of the cleft between her legs then he ran his tongue down that appealing little cleft she gasped in shock now he was atop her lovingly but insistently moving her thighs apart gently he pushed into her and was delighted when once again she rose to meet him it took all his selfcontrol not to press too hard he stopped and looked down at her a fine damp sheen covered her body and he could tell she was a little frightened easy love easy sweetheart be crooned and caressed her trembling body it hurts patrick it hurts only a moment longer love one bad pain then it will quickly get better he promised and before she could protest further he drew back and thrust quickly through the barrier her eyes widened and she screamed once in paina cry he halfstifled with his kisses but he had not lied the pain began to subside at once he moved softly within her and slipping into a brilliant new world cat moved her body in time with his waves of pleasure washed over her and as the intensity increased she felt herself drawn down into a whirling golden vortex she heard a girls voice cry out and did not know the voice was her own then as suddenly as it had begun it ended she found herself cradled in patricks arms weeping he was stricken with remorse and selfloathing covering her wet face with kisses he pleaded with her to forgive him for being such a terrible brute cat caught him in midsentence laughing through her tears you great fool she said giving him a weak chuckle what am i to forgive ye for making me a woman two weeks before our wedding she took his face in her hands i love ye hinny do ye hear me i am mad for ye my lord i couldna bear not having all of ye for i am a willful wench patrick glenkirk looked down into her face and suddenly smiled ill beat ye if you ever defy me brat i love ye wi all my heart but ill be the master of my own house as long as im yer only mistress mlord she shot back he laughed what a minx you are madame and he tumbled her back amid the pillows go to sleep or come morning everyone in the castle will know what weve been about she cocked an eyebrow at him he chuckled no more tonight my greedy little lass yer too newly opened if ye would walk in the morning once is enough for this night but come other nights ill love ye wiout stopping the whole night long no man with any fire in him could ever get enough of you my bride in the morning ellen saw the bloodstains on cats bedsheets but she kept silent for twas no ones business that the bride and groom had celebrated their wedding night before they celebrated their wedding she had been worried that perhaps her young mistress was marrying a man she did not love now she knew all was well cat would not have surrendered herself to glenkirk unless she loved him unfortunately fiona knew too no one had confided in her but with alleycat instinct she knew three days before the wedding she found catriona alone and with deliberate intention said so ye finally let him stick it in ye cousin and before the wedding too she said wickedly my but yer brave cat blushed at having her secret discovered but she was unwilling to let fiona get the upper hand jealous coz fiona laughed listen my wee cat ive been fucking since i was thirteen theres never been a man i couldnt have if i wanted him and that includes yer precious glenkirk liar spat catriona nay smiled fiona sweetly ive had both patrick and adam ill stick wi my adam however so theres no mistake about it and fiona proceeded to describe patricks bedroom in detail cat left her cousin without a word going to her apartments she put on a pair of warm doeskin riding breeches a silk shirt furlined boots and a heavy furlined cloak she had sent a confused ellen ahead to the stables to have bana saddled but where are ye going at this time o day she protested i dinna know said cat mounting bana but when the great earl of glenkirk returns from forbes manor tell him that id sooner marry the devil himself yanking banas head about she kicked the mare and cantered across the drawbridge into the darkening winter afternoon chapter ellen picked up her skirts and ran stumbling back into the castle to seek the master of greyhaven finding him she gasped out shes gone lord hay mistress cat has gone greyhaven did not quickly comprehend but his wife did what happened she demanded of ellen i dinna know my lady shes been so happy to be back at glenkirk and looking forward to her wedding i wonder said heather thoughtfully if it has all been a pretense nay nay my lady shes in love wi the earl tis plain theyve been ellen stopped horrorstruck and clapped her hand over her mouth but heather understood how long oh my lady how long ellen the first night we were back i found the stains the next morning but something had been going on at christmastime he dinna force her of that im sure my lady are ye saying that glenkirks been lying wi my lass said james hay indignantly oh greyhaven snapped heather be quiet its nae important that theyve been sleeping together theyre being married in three days time ellenwhat did cat do this afternoon where did she go she slept for an hour after the meal as she always does then she went to the family hall wi her embroidery the earl hasna been here all day so they canna have had a fight checking they found several people who had talked to catriona that afternoon but meg leslie her daughters ailis hay and two of the servants all remembered that she was happy and excited what can have frightened her wondered meg she wasna frightened my lady corrected ellen she was in a blazing temper there was a clatter of horses in the courtyard and the barking of dogs as the earl and his brothers returned from forbes manor the four of them had just concluded the betrothal agreement for isabella forbes laughing and joking they entered the family hall then stopped at the scene that greeted them what is it demanded the earl its cat spoke his mother unthinkingly patrick went white nay shes all right said heather quickly then what is it shes gone off in a temper nephew probably a fit of bridal nerves replied heather intending to soothe when about an hour ago she spent the afternoon in here then suddenly she went to her room put on her riding clothes and rode off who spoke wi her how do you know when she went heather told him and then turned to ellen to tell her story she came storming into her bedroom my lord ellie she shouts go to the stable and tell them to saddle bana my lady i says to her tis late and the sun is close to setting do as ye are bid she says to me oh my lord ive raised her since she was a baby and never has she spoken to me thus she was in her old riding clothes when she mounted the horse ellie she says tell the great earl of glenkirk that id as soon marry the devil himself then she rode off i came right to my lady hay and told her patrick leslies mouth was tight and white around the lips his eyes narrowed someone must have upset her upset whom asked fiona coming into the hall what on earth is going on patrick kept his voice level did ye see cat this afternoon aye she was embroidering here the earl looked to his brother adam took his wifetobe firmly by the arm and escorted her into the library frightened fiona faced the two brothers what did ye say to cat dear cousin his voice was icy nothing patrick i said nothing i swear it we talked of girlish things reaching out adam caught his betrothed and flinging her across a chair laid his riding crop across her back she screamed in pain and tried to escape him but patrick held her down by her slender white neck now cousin he said through gritted teeth love ye or not adam will on my order beat you to death if necessary what did ye say to catriona i told her that ye slept wi me fiona sobbed out the entire conversation you bitch swore patrick it took me weeks to win cats confidence and ye hae destroyed it in three minutes he slammed out of the room adam looked down at fiona i warned ye my love that if ye caused trouble i would punish you his arm rose and she heard the whistle of the crop a second before it touched her back again no adam she cried out but he was merciless he beat her until she fainted a few moments later glenkirk was organizing as quickly as he could his favorite stallion was winded so he ordered his second favorite dearg to be saddled he would allow only ellens brother conall moreleslie to accompany him before he left he spoke with his mother his aunt heather and adam god knows where shes gone it may even take me weeks to trace her she knows the countryside as well as any man its too late to stop the wedding so adam ye and fiona are to wed in our place he looked closely at his brother do ye still want the bitch aye brother shes a naughty puss but i think shell behave now good tell the guests that the bride caught the measles and gave them to the groom that should stop a scandal patrick my son be gentle wi catriona begged meg shes young and innocent and fiona has hurt her terribly wi her wicked lies madame said patrick coldly catriona has been sharing my bed for almost two weeks now i have treated her wi gentleness and never forced her she wouldna even face me wi her accusations but assumed me guilty and fled i will nae forgie her lack of trust i shall find her and bring her back and wed wi her as planned but before i do that i shall take a leaf from adams book and beat her bottom so she may not sit for a week several minutes later he galloped across the drawbridge with moreleslie it was a cold night but the moon lit their way they rode first to greyhaven for patrick suspected that cat had fled home she was not there they turned their horses to sithean but there too they met with disappointment they stayed the night and the following morning began to comb the district but cat had apparently vanished from the earth no one had seen her st valentines day came and adam leslie wed his widowed cousin lady stewart the guests chuckled when they heard the earl and his bridetobe were suffering from the measles wasnt it lucky they laughed that the leslies had another betrothed couple ready and waiting so the festivities would not go to waste it was a wonderful party but the new lady leslie looked tired and subdued fiona looking out at her guests from the head table wondered what they would think if she told them the reason for her pallor for the last three nights she had been tied to a chair and forced to watch adam making love to a very pretty and obviously insatiable peasant wench she had tried closing her eyes but the sounds from the bed were too tantalizing she watched fascinated as adams enormous cock plunged in and out of the writhing girl as her own desire grew she suffered severe pain of both a mental and physical nature and by last night she thought she would go mad this morning however he had told her that her punishment was over fiona swore never to cause her cousin hurt again and promised that when cat was found she would apologize and tell her the truth adam smiled satisfied he knew how to handle his wench but cat couldnt be found february gave way to march and march to april before word came ellen home in crannog to see her parents discovered her mistress living with them cat fleeing glenkirk had gone directly to ruth and hugh moreleslie ruth now in her sixties had immediately agreed to hide the girl hugh retired and in his seventies hadnt been sure but ruth convinced him that her long dead mistress would have approved ellen was amazed surely the neighbors are suspicious she said why should they be said ruth they never see her she rides her bana an hour each night for exercise but other than that she never leaves the house she canna stay here forever mother did she tell ye why she ran away aye that wicked fiona i knew when she was a child she would grow up bad she did mother very bad so bad that she sent mistress cat off in this rage what fiona said however was a lie and mistress cat was wrong to run off before asking my lord of glenkirk to defend himself he is hurt that she thought so little of him yet he loves her and still wants to make her his wife well said ruth with the wisdom of her late mistress then we must arrange for him to find her but not here theres acuil mother her grandmother jean gordon had it as part of her dowry and now it belongs to mistress cat it is small and secluded set in the hills above loch sithean how big and in what condition stone wi a slate roof and put back into shape because of the wedding theres a kitchen and a parlor downstairs and a bedroom on the second floor theres also a small stable wi two loft rooms thats about all there is to acuil itll do said ruth how long a ride a good hour up into the hills replied ellen ruth smiled i shall convince mistress cat to go there and then i will go to glenkirk and tell the earl in a quiet place away from the rest of the family theyll settle their differences ruth was as good as her word persuading cat that she would be happier if she could get outdoors more now that summer was coming and assuring her that acuil was a good distance from glenkirk she sent the girl off ellen had been sent on to air the house and bring in food supplies she had begged her young mistress to allow her to accompany her lonely cat had agreed acuil was set high in a pine forest on a cliff that gave a view of glenkirk sithean and greyhaven far below it was hidden and quiet for several days cat prowled restless through the woods around her at night she slept deeply in the big bedroom ellen in the trundle slept by her side they had been there ten days and cat was beginning to feel safe with a bad storm about them that night they retired to the bedroom building up the fire they ate a supper of toasted bread and cheese and drank slightly hardened cider neither minded the lightning that crackled ominously about them or the rolling peals of thunder suddenly the door flew open ellen gave a shriek of terror the earl strode in yer brothers in the kitchen ellen is there a place ye both can sleep the lofts over the stable mlord run along then no dinna leave me wi him ellen ellen looked helplessly at her young mistress gently the earl took the serving woman by the arm and escorted her to the door dinna come near this room unless i call you do ye understand aye my lord the door closed firmly behind her and she heard the bolt slam home padding down the stairs she found her brother and led him off to the loft rooms in the stable is he very angry wi her conall aye said her brother calmly hes going to beat her never gasped ellen hes mad for her still replied conall hes going to beat her and a good thing too shes a wayward lass to have run from him like that if hes nae the master in his own house from the first hell always have trouble wi her thats no marriage for a man if mother and i had known that hed hurt her wed nae have let him find her sister said conall patiently as if explaining to a child hes not going to hurt her hes just going to gie her a wee beating to help her mend her manners ellen shook her head she knew cat hay better than all of them after all shed raised her the earl was about to find out that beating his bride would never tame her chapter cat hay angrily faced the earl of glenkirk carefully he spread his wet cloak over the back of the fireplace chair and removed his damp linen shirt he sat down my boots cat they were the first words hed spoken to her go to hell she spat at him my boots his greengold eyes narrowed and glittered dangerously her heart pounding wildly she knelt and drew his boots off im not afraid of him she thought but why was her heart beating so quickly standing up he caught her by her long hair wrapping it around his hand he drew her face to his grasping the top of her shift with his other hand he ripped it from neck to hem and pulled it off her i warned ye once that if ye ever defied me id beat ye and before she could protest hed pushed her onto the bed and brought his riding crop down cruelly on her buttocks she screamed her pain and outrage at him and tried to escape but holding her down he raised several angry red wheals on her bottom before stopping tossing the crop away he raged at her yeve led me a fine chase these last months madame had adam not been willing to wed immediately we would hae been embarrassed before every family in the district does it please ye to know that fiona held the place of honor at our wedding turning over she gingerly sat up and faced him with a defiant tearstained face you bastard she shrieked at him what ye put between my legs ye put between hers also ill nae forgie ye that never little bitch he shouted back how could ye believe her never did i lie wi fiona once she waited in my room but adam was wi me hed been hot for her for years so i slept in his room that night while he took his pleasure of her never have i slept wi that shedevil why should i believe you yer bastards are scattered from one end of the district to the other fiona said she could have any man she wanted and then proceeded to describe your bedroom accurately what was i to think why did ye believe her over me he demanded how could ye lie wi me and not believe that i love ye and would do nothing to harm ye liar i hate ye get out of my house yer house yers nay cat this house is part of the dowry your father gave me along wi ye it belongs to me now as ye belong to me he pushed her back onto the pillows and bent over her yer my possession cat as is glenkirk as are my horses and my dogs ye are something for my pleasure a thing on which to breed my sons do ye understand me she raised her arm catching a glitter patrick twisted aside as the arm moved down he wrenched the little knife from her hand and slapped her face a whores trick sweetheart is that what ye want to be treated like a whore id be a whore before id be yer wife glenkirk no man owns me no man he laughed brave words lass however since yeve expressed an interest ill teach ye some whores tricks yeve not begun to be facile in bed yet not enough practice but ill remedy that in the next few weeks what do ye mean her heart was pounding uncontrollably why my dear until i put my bairn in yer belly yell nae go home to glenkirk i obviously canna trust ye to wed me till then when ye ripen wi my son yell hae no other choice will you standing he swiftly pulled his trunk hose off and then flung himself back on top of her he found her angry mouth and kissed her cruelly sliding down between her legs he pulled them over his shoulders and buried his head between her legs her cries of terror quickly became sounds of shamed desire as his velvet tongue stroked and probed her patrick patrick she cried no please oh my god no desperately she tried to escape the demanding mouth that sucked her the insistent tongue that tortured her his big hands held her round hips in an iron grip while he pleasured himself by sending waves of fire and pain through her sobbing she tried to deny him the victory of her climax but he forced her twice then laughing he mounted her and pushed deep within her to find his own release she felt herself writhing eagerly beneath him finished he rolled off her and said coldly that my dear was lesson number one crawling into a corner of the bed she wept silently her shoulders shaking with great sobs he wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her but patrick leslie was certain that the least sign of softening on his part would ruin everything he didnt want to break her spirit but he would be master of his own home for her part cat was too inexperienced to understand the subtle ways in which a woman can control her men without them knowing it patrick would have been surprised to know that her tears were not for what he had done to her but for the fact that he had bested her he pulled her into his arms again and began to play with her breasts no she protested he paid no attention to her but instead crushed the softness in his hand god he murmured against her god but yeve got the sweetest little tits ive ever known his lips caressed her fluttering belly but when he went to move farther down she cried out no not again laughing softly he raised himself on one elbow and looked down at her his hand forced itself between her legs and his fingers played didnt ye like lesson one sweetheart she tried to squirm away when i tell my father how yeve raped me hell kill ye nay hinny he gave me his blessing to do wi ye as i pleased he knows that in the end i will honor our betrothal agreement and wed wi ye thats all he wants cat knew patrick was right and it infuriated her he pulled her under him and kissed her bruised mouth until she cried with hurt his lips turned soft the touch of his swollen penis against her thighs spread them as her hips arched hungrily to meet his downward thrust patrick leslie laughed softly by god cat yer a hungry little bitch i wonder if fionas as hot as ye are her fists beat against his smooth chest he laughed again and then slowly went about the task of reducing her resistance to compliance at last he fell into a deep sleep since there was no way she could escape him at that point she fell into a sleep of her own in the early hours of the morning he woke her and took her again her young body ached from the unaccustomed activity understanding this he lugged a tall oakandiron tub into the bedroom and placed it before the fire while she watched astonished he carried up caldrons of hot water until the tub was full from somewhere he produced a cake of sweetscented soap picking her up he put her into the water ye smell like a brothel he commented then ye should be right at home she shot back he stripped the bed threw the sheets out into the hallway and remade the bed with fresh lavenderscented linens then he disappeared and returned a few minutes later bearing a goblet she was out of the tub sitting before the fire wrapped in a towel drink this what is it sweet red wine a beaten egg and some herbs it was delicious taking the damp towel from her he picked her up carried her to the bed and tucked her naked body into the cool sheets and down coverlet go to sleep hinny its been a long night for ye he bent and dropped a kiss on her forehead where are ye going she asked before he could answer she was asleep patrick leslie gazed down at the sleeping girl and thought how much he loved her and how frightened he had beenimagining all sorts of terrible things happening to herwhen she fled him he wasnt going to give her another chance to run and he certainly would not tell her of his feelings towards her women were better off unsure too he couldnt bear it again if she said she hated him he bathed dressed himself and went down to the kitchen conall rose from the trestle sit down man commanded the earl ellen love gie me a bowl of that oatmeal your brothers enjoying so she placed one before him conall i want ye to ride down toglenkirk today and fetch some clothes for mistress cat and myself well be staying here for several weeks ellen yell tell me what she needs and ill write it down i can both read and write my lord said ellen frostily if ye dinna

house ellen only ten only ten he replied she deserved more but i am a merciful man aye agreed ellen she did deserve more when she was a child however beating her did no good she was always twice as defiant afterwards ellen hoped he was paying attention shes nae changed he chuckled ellen wrote her message to lady hay and asked that she send several changes of undergarments two soft linen shirts half a dozen gossamer silk night garments from cats trousseau a velvet dressing gown slippers and some cakes of sweet soap cat fleeing glenkirk had thought to bring her comb and brush and the brush for cleaning teeth that her greatgrandmother had taught them to use she gave the list to the earl its not a great deal but ill be here to wash for her this is easy to carry and will nae weigh conall down good girl he said and turned to conall take bana back to glenkirk and yer sisters mare also the only horses i want here are our two oh my lord pleaded ellen dinna take bana from her she loves so

wasnt until early afternoon that cat woke conall had just returned from his errand and cat opened her eyes to see ellen kneeling by the little clothes chest what are ye doing she asked sleepily putting away yer clean clothes luv conall has just brought them up from glenkirk cat was suddenly wide awake where is patrick hes been gone since dawn hunting a deer for us he said gie me a clean

gods foot ellie has he won ye over then ellen said nothing else but handed cat a pale turquoisecolored silk nightgown ill get ye something to eat she said and left the room cat let the gown slide down over her lush form picking up her brush she sat back down on the bed and slowly brushed the tangles from her honeycolored hair so he thought that by taking her horse and clothes away from her he would keep her a prisoner well perhaps for a while he would she would bide her time but eventually a way would open and then shed run from him again it no longer mattered that he had or had not slept with fionathough cat was glad he had not what mattered was that she could not and would not allow him possession of catriona hay nobody owned her until patrick leslie understood that she was a person not an extension of him she would fight him with all the strength in her ellen came back into the room bearing a tray fresh bread new from the oven half a broiled rabbit a honeycomb and some brown ale cat found she was hungry yer all right if ye can eat like that observed ellen only a moonstruck idiot stops eating in a bad situation said cat if im going to think of a way to escape his high lordship ive got to keep up my strength mistress cat i dinna know why the earl puts up wi ye except he loves ye he loves me nonsense ellie he thinks he owns me and it pleases him to show his superiority over me by abusing my body ellen shrugged she didnt understand catriona when she spoke like that taking up the empty tray she left the room shaking her head cat began to prowl the room until last night it had simply been a place to sleep now she looked on it as her prison it could be entered only by a door from the stairway there was a small fireplace on the door wall and to the left was a bank of casement windows there was one small round window to the right it was not a large room and held only four pieces of furniturea large canopied and curtained bed opposite the door a low clothes chest at its foot a small table on the singlewindowed wall and a chair by the fireplace a pier glass hung on the bit of wall to the left of the door she stood by the windows looking out from her vantage point she could see part of the valley below and into the forest that surrounded the house she saw patrick coming out of the woods now he was riding dearg and a buck was flung across his saddle conall ran to meet him and taking the buck across his shoulders went off in the direction of the stables the earl followed opening the bedroom door cat called down to ellen prepare a tub in the kitchen for the earl ellie hes just brought in a buck and he and conall have gone to butcher it ill nae have him dripping blood all over my bedroom when he entered the bedroom an hour later clad only in a rough towel she couldnt help but laugh he grinned back at her you see madame ive done as ive been told come now and gie me a kiss shyly she walked to him and putting her arms about his neck kissed him jesu yer sweet he muttered running his big hands over her silksheathed body and burying his face for a moment in her neck please patrick she whispered please patrick what he demanded thickly he drew her over in front of the pier glass and standing behind her gently slid her gown off his big hands cupped her lovely breasts and instantly the nipples sprang erect look at yerself cat i hae but to touch ye and yer hungry for me no no she protested closing her eyes tightly he laughed softly and turning her to him began to kiss her throat her lips her eyelids with tiny soft little kisses his mouth began to move downward to her breasts he knelt and holding her firm but gently by the waist kissed her shrinking belly his kisses becoming more intense as they traveled lower his lips found the tiny mole and kissed it tenderly cat began to weep softly dont sweetheart he said gently theres nae shame in being a woman and enjoying it ye knew aye he said drawing her down on the floor in front of the cracking fire i knew ive made love to enough women in my life to know when one is enjoying it even when she struggles like a demon and vows she hates me i do hate ye she insisted he chuckled then in the next few weeks ill gie ye cause each day to hate me more swiftly he slid between her legs and thrust his aching manhood into her softness she tried to squirm away nay hinny i told ye last night that ye belong to me and what i hold my sweet cat i keep chapter the spring sped by and midsummer eve came and went still the earl of glenkirk held his beautiful betrothed a prisoner at acuil often he rode the almost two hours down to glenkirk so he might attend to his estates business many days he hunted to provide game for his small household but never did he spend a night away from cat though she would never have told him so cat now looked forward to the nights she spent in patricks arms she was young and healthy and more than half in love with her handsome husbandtobe as for the earl he was passionately in love with her and would have killed any man who dared to look upon her with even the slightest interest as the days grew warmer and longer he took her upon his horse and rode with her through the forest and the high meadows several times they made love beneath the sun in fields of new heather she was as warm as wine and as sweet as honey patrick marveled that he who had never been faithful to one woman for more than a week or two at a time dreaded the thought of returning to glenkirk and sharing her with even his family the return would be soon cat had not yet connected her loss of a show of blood with impending motherhood ellen had and she sought a way to bring the matter to her young mistresss attention one morning opportunity presented itself the earl had risen early and gone to glenkirk ellen cheerfully entered the bedchamber bearing a tray that held a small pigeon pie fresh from the oven yer favorite she chortled doesnt it smell wonderful she enthused waving the tray beneath her ladys nose cat went white scrambling from the bed she grabbed the basin from the table and retched into it och sympathized ellen putting down the tray and wiping the girls damp forehead with the linen chamber cloth back into bed wi you my dearie she tucked cat in the naughty laddie to make his mama so sick she said coyly cat stared at her tiring woman as if she had lost her mind what are ye babbling about ellie and take that damned pie away or ill be sick again get me some brown ale to drink and some oat cakes ellen removed the offending pie and returned a few minutes later with the requested meal she watched as cat cautiously sipped the ale and then apparently satisfied wolfed down the oat cakes how do ye feel now she asked better i canna think what made me so sick its the third time its happened in the last week do ye think that perhaps something has gone rotten in the larder mistress cat ellen was exasperated beyond all ye be wi child hes put his bairn in yer belly and now we can go home cats leafgreen eyes widened no she whispered no no no aye yer ripening theres no doubt about it the earl will be so happy catriona turned angrily on ellen if ye dare to tell him ill cut yer tongue out do ye understand me my lady cat closed her eyes for a moment opening them again she spoke calmly and quietly i will tell my lord of my condition ellie but not yet the moment he knows hell rush me down to glenkirk i dinna want to leave acuil yet please i canna be very far along there is time ellen was softhearted by nature the thought that her young mistress wanted a little more time alone with the earl appealed to her sense of romance when was yer last show she asked cat thought a moment early may she said ah sweeting yer a good three months along said ellen but we can wait a week or so before his lordship must know the wee laddie will be a winter child no hints ellie no arch looks i would surprise the earl and she might have told him and gone meekly home to glenkirk had not patrick himself spoiled it kept at glenkirk for three days and nights by a foolish problem he arrived back at acuil as randy as a young stallion in first heat cat had decided to tell him and she ran joyfully to greet him only to have him sweep her up in his arms and carry her to their bedroom swiftly without preliminaries he tore his clothing off shoved her down on the bed pushed her nightgown up and thrust into her cat was outraged satisfied for the moment he sat up against the pillows and pulled her back against him he had always loved her breasts and now he fondled them hungrily beginning to swell with her pregnancy they were sore and his touch irritated her he further annoyed her by chuckling i think these sweet little titties of mine are growing bigger cat he squeezed them playfully a mans loving care can work wonders eh love he should have been warned by the ominous silence but his mind was on other things and his body was hungry for her again he took her once more then pushing her from their bed he patted her buttock and asked for his dinner she descended to the kitchen ellen was long since in her bed so cat loaded a tray with half a roasted bird a small cold game pie from the larder bread butter a honeycomb and a foaming pitcher of brown ale to which she added a pinch of dried herbs the earl was going to have an excellent nights sleep she served him sweetly and almost felt guilty when he said you are going to be the most beautiful countess glenkirks ever had lord sweetheart how i love you the drugged ale was beginning to work on him climbing into their bed he fell asleep from childhood cat hay had been able to wake herself on command it was still dark when she rose and dressed herself in riding pants and a linen shirt she packed a small bundle and picking up glenkirks warm cloak slipped out of the room and down the stairs it was fully three hours till dawn cat crept softly into the stable above in the loft ellen was snoring conall she knew was sleeping with his mistress of the moment about half a mile away quietly she saddled dearg putting a lead rein on conalls fyne she led both horses from the stable she walked them a good quartermile from the house then mounting dearg and leading fyne she galloped off in the direction of greyhaven she planned to get there before even the servants were awake once in the house she would gather a few more clothes her jewelry and some gold from her fathers cache achieving her objective she headed for the high road but not before first releasing fyne with a swat on his rump hed go straight to his stables at glenkirk munching oatcakes she rode along chuckling to herself she had outwitted patrick he had been so kind and loving in the last weeks that she had almost believed he accepted her as an equal last night however had told her the truth of the matter it was as he had said she was his possession something for him to breed sons on well she would soon teach him the folly of taking her for granted she was nobodys slave she kicked dearg into a gallop had patrick really believed that by taking bana from her she couldnt escape if he had taken the time to learn as much about catriona hay the woman as he had taken learning about catriona hays body he would have known that there wasnt a horse bred she couldnt ride it would have given her great pleasure to know that at that very moment patrick leslie was learning just that he had awakened with a headache and a funny taste in his mouth reaching out he discovered that cat was gone a frantic knocking on the door tortured his head come in damnit he shouted both ellen and conall tumbled into the room talking at once silence he roared one of ye at a time ellen you first shes gone my lord mistress catriona has gone shes taken both horses and run away when sometime in the night i am sorry my lord i sleep like the dead till six each morning i never heard a thing where were ye said the earl turning to conall nay dinna tell me ye were off sticking it in yer little shepherdess jesu he swore when i catch her this time shell not sit down for a month ellen rounded on him yell nae lay a hand on her my little lambie shes more than three months gone wi yer bairn she planned to tell ye when ye returned from glenkirk what did ye do to her to make her flee ye my poor cat ye must hae done something patrick flushed so pounced ellen ye did do something i only made love to her patrick protested id been wiout her for three days if only you leslie men thought more wi yer heads and less wi yer cocks so ye made love to her i can see it now her scornful glance swept the room having come home and wiout so much as a byyerleave ye fucked her was it once or was it twice then ill wager ye demanded yer dinner the earl looked shamefaced and ellen snorted god mon wheres yer sense if yed been an englishman or a frenchie id expect stupidity but a scotsman knows that a scotswoman is the most independent of creatures well shes got a good start on ye now and yell nae find her easily this time she canna have gone far said patrick shes run home to her mother mark my words on it ellen shook her head sadly at him nay my lord if shes run home to greyhaven twill only be to get her jewels and perhaps steal some gold from her father but where shell go to hide my lord i dinna know shes never traveled out of the district before i thought her jewels were at glenkirk nay my lord when mistress cat fled ye in february i brought them back to greyhaven and she knew it for a second patrick leslie looked stricken then swinging his legs over the bed he stood up without another word ellen handed him his breeches and left the room he spoke to conall the nearest horses in the valley gavin shaw has the nearest farm get going said the earl ill meet ye there conall nodded and left patrick finished dressing and went down to the kitchen ellen handed him a large sandwich of bread and ham ye can eat as ye walk she said he nodded his thanks pack everything up here for for me ellie ill send someone up for ye by afternoon at the latest will ye stay at glenkirk until i find her shes going to need ye more than ever now ill stay her apartments have never been properly refurbished and theres the nursery to prepare flashing her a smile he left acuil and began his walk down to the shaw farm several hours later patrick leslie knew that ellen had been right cat was not at greyhaven and a check revealed that her jewelry and a generous portion of her fathers household gold was missing he rode to sithean and stopped at ruths house in crannog cat was not in either place at glenkirk his lovely mother berated him for a fool and demanded in a voice he had never heard her use before that he find cat and her expected grandson james she said can run the estate for ye while yer gone adam and fiona are unfortunately in edinburgh they are going to france to visit our cousins mother i dinna even know where to look for cat she looked at him pityingly ye hae a bit less than six months to find her my son else the next rightful glenkirk will be born a bastard groaning with despair he left the room cat hay would have been terribly happy to see the desperate look on the earls face chapter fiona leslie pulled her hood over her beautiful face looking around to be sure she wasnt followed she slipped into the rose and thistle inn i seek mistress abernethy she told the landlord up the stairs to the right came the answer fiona mounted the stairs she had no idea who this abernethy woman was but when the urchin had shoved the note into her hand curiosity had overcome good sense she knocked on the door hearing a voice bid her enter she did the woman by the window turned cat she gasped shut the door fiona and come sit down fiona settled her black velvet skirts and looked at her beautiful cousin i thought glenkirk held ye captive at acuil what do ye here i escaped him again and i want yer help fiona gods toenail yer a fool cat she sighed i promised adam that when we met again i would tell ye the truth i never slept wi glenkirk though until his brother took me i was hot to she grinned ruefully as a matter of fact he wouldna have me there i laymothernaked on his bedand he wouldna have me all he wanted was ye and thats the truth cat smiled thank you fiona thank ye for telling me patrick already told me he had not slept wi ye and though i was inclined to believe him i really do now then what are ye doing here in edinburgh ill wager poor glenkirk doesna know where ye are nay he doesnt hes probably looking for me now but ill nae go back to him nae until he acknowledges me as a human being and nae a brood mare help me fiona i know weve nae been close cousin but i hoped yed understand ellen said that ye and adam leave for france soon let me stay in yer house no one has to know not even adam im safer there than anywhere else patrick will nae think to look for me in edinburgh let alone in yer house fiona chewed on her lip for a moment cat would soon be the countess of glenkirk and a good friend to have still if adam learned she was helping cat in her feud with his brother he would punish her again in that terrible way hed twice used on her forcing her to watch him love another woman was the worst hell she had ever known and she didnt owe her cousin a damned thing now that she had told her the truth cat stood up and held her hands out pleading please fiona fionas glance caught a little swell of belly that cat had certainly never had before comprehension dawned my god coz yer carrying his bairn aye said cat bitterly do ye know what he said to me fiona that i was a thing to get his sons on i hate him fiona didnt think cat really hated patrick but she understood how she felt these leslie men were so damned proud all cat wanted from glenkirk was acknowledgment of her status as a person in a few months time hed be frantic and willing to agree to anything just so his son would be born legitimate fiona felt the wait would do them both good besides she thought i really do owe my dear brotherinlaw for slighting me she turned to cat and said the house is yers sweeting but ive already let the servants go i need no one dinna be foolish chuck ye need someone ill send a note to mrs kerr she usually keeps an eye on the house for me when i am not here ill tell her my poor widowed cousin mistress kate abernethy is coming to stay and would she please look after her have ye enough money i think so and ive my jewels too if ye run short or need to pawn something go to the house of kira in goldsmiths lane and cat go at once to see dr robert ramsey hes but a few doors from my house around the corner on high street remember tis the heir to glenkirk ye carry in yer belly thank you fiona said cat softly suddenly she leaned over and kissed her cousins cheek we leave tomorrow morning said fiona gruffly come in the afternoon mrs kerr will let ye in and gie you the key she stood up pulling the hood over her face she said make peace wi patrick soon cat the leslies may be arrogant but by god theyre men late the following day cat moved from the rose and thistle inn to fionas house the house had originally belonged to cats and fionas grandmother fiona abernethy wife to the first earl of sithean the cousins mutual greatgrandmother the legendary janet leslie had felt it fitting that the house go to fiona abernethys namesake and so fiona leslie had inherited it it was not a large house built about seventy years before it was a mellowed red brick well covered with ivy on three sides the basement held a good kitchen a pantry a still room and a wash room with several large tubs for doing laundry the main floor held a charming dining room a formal parlor a small family parlor that opened into the garden and a full library on the second floor were four bedrooms each with its own dressing room and in the attic were rooms for the maids the house had a small stable where cat housed dearg and the garden was filled with flowers herbs and fruit trees set off fashionable high street it was quiet and little traffic passed by mrs kerr a cozy plump widow of middle years was sympathetic she had she confided to cat once been in the same position her husband had been killed in a border skirmish with the english when she was six months pregnant she had raised her boy alone and a fine lad hed turned out to be too he was apprenticed to a butcher now did my cousin lady leslie tell ye how my husband died asked cat mrs kerr shook her head a border skirmish also said cat sadly in the cheviot only two months ago aye said the other woman nodding in sympathy i remember it but they lost more lads than we did alone once again cat chuckled to herself kate abernethy would soon be established she had recognized mrs kerr as a gossipa kindly soul but a gossip the following day she took fionas advice and visited dr ramsey he examined her and then advised unless theres an emergency yell not likely need me my dear thats a fine healthy laddie yer growing there and yer mrs kerr should be able to deliver him with no trouble but if ye should need me dinna hesitate to send around settled into fionas house now cat found she was enjoying herself she was no longer sick in the mornings and her appetite was picking up never in her life had she been so far from home no mother no father no glenkirk no ellen no one to answer to except herself mrs kerr came each morning to tidy the house and see that she was properly fed but she left before dark each evening as autumn advanced cat walked the more respectable streets of edinburgh exploring the town her dress was simple though expensive her pregnancy obvious and her manner modest no one bothered her as the days grew colder she confined her walks to the garden or to short trips to market with mrs kerr these outings fascinated her at greyhaven food had simply been there in accompanying her housekeeper a whole world opened up to cat mrs kerr expanded this new world when she took cat shopping for cloth to make garments for the baby it was not long before cat was saying mrs kerr i must go to the ribbon shop i seem to be out of that lovely blue silk for the babys bonnets do we need anything at the butcher since ill pass it on my way mrs kerr did not think it strange at all that her young mistress was so innocent of everyday matters cat had explained to the good woman that she had been orphaned early and raised in a country convent it was a common story as the days grew shorter mrs kerr decided that young mistress abernethy should not be alone in the evenings her niece sally was brought into the house to look after cat sally was twenty and as plump and cheerful as her aunt her presence made the evenings less lonely for cat the two young women sewed or cat read to them before the fire cat liked her enough to ask her if she would stay on and help look after the baby sally was delighted fiona and adam celebrated christmas in paris with their leslie cousins the new year brought greetings from glenkirk adam shook his head hes not yet found her its as if the wench had disappeared off the face of the earth he looked at his wife would ye ever do that to me love nay said fiona glancing quickly away adam looked at her more closely my god he shouted ye know where she is ye do dont ye the look in his eyes was terrible and fiona panicked shes in our house in edinburgh she made me promise not to tell i thought she would be home and safely wed wi him by now then fiona laughed shes got courage has cat good for her ye know said adam ominously how im going to punish you fiona dont ye fionas temper snapped if patrick could be brought to heel then so could adam it wouldnt hurt to try ye do leslie she shouted back at him and ill spread my legs for the first man that comes through that door ill nae be treated like a naughty child any longer for a moment they glowered at each other and then adam laughed i dinna think ye and cat were friends we werent but we are now we must both contend with leslie arrogance your asseared brother called her a thing on which to breed his sons do ye blame her for fleeing him i dont ive got to tell him fiona else the innocent bairn will be born on the wrong side of the blanket iknow she agreed the glenkirk courier is still here send your message back wi him and adamtell patrick to use cat gently she does love him you know but she wants him to love her for herself and not just for the children she can gie him he must treat her wi respect this was all his own fault i think he said teasingly that being married to me is good for ye sweetheart yer gaining in wisdom he ducked as a pillow flew by his head write yer letter leslie and come to bed she answered him cousin louise showed me some fascinating pictures today and im dying to see if we can do the same things she looked provocatively over her shoulder at him adam leslie gazed back at his lovely wife i shall be your most willing and eager pupil madame he said raising a rakish eyebrow chapter the leslie courier had no difficulty in reaching the french coast from paris but once there he was forced to cool his heels a nasty winter storm was brewing and no captain was willing to set off across the north sea it wasnt that the fellow minded holing up in the cozy little french inn he enjoyed the hearty food and excellent wine but he knew the news he carried was of great importance to the earl lord adam had given him a gold piece and told him the earl would give him another finally one windy but sunny morning the courier stood in the center of the taproom holding the gold piece high he announced this to the man who gets me safely to aberdeen and another from my master the earl of glenkirk when we get there the coin was plucked from his hand by a blackbearded man if this wind holds laddie he said ill hae ye there in no time the courier reached glenkirk on the morning of february not only did the earl replace the gold piece hed been forced to spend he gave his messenger two more the seacaptain was rewarded as had been promised patrick leslie left glenkirk on the afternoon of february he stopped at the abbey and asked cats uncle abbot charles leslie to accompany him to edinburgh well have to ride hard uncle ellen says shes nae due for at least two more weeks but ye canna tell wi a first bairn charles leslie nodded went to his apartments and returned a few minutes later the monks robe was gone abbot charles had become a tall hard man of fortyfive booted and ready to ride ill do better in edinburgh he said if i dinna look like a priest in that heretic town several days later they stood in front of fionas house in edinburgh sally opened the door her eyes widened in approval of the two imposing figures is yer mistress at home asked the earl shes sleeping my lord sally wasnt sure who this handsome stranger was but there was no doubt in her mind that he was a lord we will wait then said charles leslie moving into the house i am her uncle sally put them in the formal parlor and went to get mrs kerr the housekeeper arrived a few moments later bearing a tray with wine and biscuits i am mrs kerr might i know the nature of your business gentlemen my mistress is in a very delicate condition at this time shes nae had the bairn patricks voice was anxious no sir not yet but within the next few days for sure tell me mrs kerr asked the abbot are ye of the new kirk or the old kirk years of religious feuding had made the townspeople wary but for some reason mrs kerr trusted this man looking quickly around she answered without hesitation the old kirk sir i am the abbot of glenkirk abbey the older man said this is my nephew the earl of glenkirk mrs kerr bobbed a curtsy and continued the abbot the young woman who calls herself mistress abernethy is in fact the lady catriona hay the earls betrothed wife for reasons ill nae go into my wayward niece has twice fled her marriage now however the time for foolishness is over within a few days time the earls son will be born he must of course be legitimate if ye would be so good as to show me to my nieces bedchamber we will see her now mrs kerr said not a word but moved quickly out of the formal parlor and up the stairs the earl and the abbot following her on the second floor she pointed to a door that is my ladys room let me waken her my lord a few minutes later she stuck her head through the door and beckoned the men inside then she turned and hurried back down the stairs to tell sally this extraordinary turn of events cat hay wearing a darkgreen velvet dressing gown stood with her back to the blazing fireplace well uncle what brings ye here she asked calmly for the briefest moment charles leslie was reminded of his grandmother janet ive come to hear ye exchange yer wedding vows wi patrick he said such a long ride for nothing she said niece yer time is very near ye carry wiin yer belly the next rightful heir of glenkirk would ye deny him his birthright save yer breath uncle i will nae wed wi patrick he does not want a wife he wants a brood marea thing on which to breed his sons he believes he owns me he told me so himself patrick winced please cat i love ye hinny ive been crazy wi worry over ye and the bairn please sweetheart tis my son you carry nay my lord not yer son yer bastard the earl staggered as if shed struck him and for a moment charles leslie felt sorry for his nephew it was going to be no easy task getting cat to speak her vows but he had not risen to the office of abbot by meekness leave us nephew when patrick had left and the door closed behind him charles leslie turned to his niece all right catriona let us talk i want the whole story a year ago ye were willing to marry patrick what happened to cause this breach between ye sighing she eased herself into a chair at first it was but a misunderstanding fiona claimed to be sleeping wi him and i was furious and why not he claimed to love me and yet appeared to be sleeping wi another woman you might have asked him child said the abbot uncle his reputation preceded him and i was a very young girl when he found me at my house acuil he beat and raped me uncle he said i was a thing on which to breed his sons and id nae go home till i was carrying his child because then i would have to wed him i would hae no other choice the abbot silently thanked god that he had chosen the religious life women particularly those born into his family could be such damned nuisances cat continued he called me his possession i am no mans possession when patrick acknowledges me as an individual and not as a part of himself then i will consider the matter of marriage charles leslie sighed it was worse than he had thought however and he chuckled at the realization his niece was a remarkable strategist she had the earl of glenkirk by the throat if he wanted his son the abbot never considered that the baby might be a daughterthen he must agree to her demands the abbot decided to appeal to cats maternal instinct have ye no feeling for the bairn niece no she answered should i charles leslie exploded gods nightshirt girl ye are the most unnatural mother i hae ever known to have no feeling for yer child cat laughed dinna be silly uncle why should i hae any feeling for my child yet i dinna know him i hae never seen him what is there for me to get soft about a dream foolishness if i dream the lad a blueeyed redhead and he arrives wi brown eyes and black hair she stopped a moment and then said in a solemn voice or worse yet a blond lassie why uncle i should be very disappointed then and thats overlooking the fact that the bairns father and i are not exactly on the best of terms charles leslie pursed his lips ye are being deliberately difficult he said aye she rejoined sweetly it comes from being tired i bear a heavy load uncle ye and patrick are welcome to stay the night if yell send mrs kerr to me on yer way out ill gie her instructions for yer comfort he retreated as gracefully as he could to the library on the main floor patrick was waiting the abbot shook his head its going to take time lad shes got the upper hand and is in no mood to settle easily wi you she must nay lad be careful now thats where ye made yer first mistake ye assume ye can bring cat to heel and ye cannot she is proud and has a wide streak of independence that ive seen before my grandmother janet leslie was very much like that but she had wisdom to go with her willfulness i wonder if she had it when she was cats age mused patrick she must have to have survived all she did replied the abbot however nephew our problem is catriona she is very angry with you because of the things ye have said and done to her she feels yer interest in her is not for herself but for her breeding ability ye must humor her women about to gie birth have strange notions i dinna understand what she wants complained the earl i love her isnt that enough nay nephew tis not you are considering only yerself i am not sure i understand entirely what it is she wants but i think she wants ye to take an interest in her as a person to talk wi her to consult wi her on matters affecting yer life togethernot simply to make demands catriona is after all a wellbred and an educated young woman i think patrick that yer problem stems from consorting wi so many low women that ye dinna know how to treat a wellborn one catriona is nae a plaything and until ye realize that she willna hae ye the earl flushed but before he could defend himself mrs kerr was at the door asking them to dinner will yer mistress be joining us the abbot inquired no my lord shell sleep till late afternoon they ate in silence the abbot noted with pleasure that cat kept a good table there was a hearty soup filled with carrots barley and thick chunks of mutton next came large bowls of freshcaught oysters a joint of rare beef a fat capon artichokes in vinegar and some pastries of rabbit and of venison there was bread hot from the oven and sweet butter a tart of pears apples nuts and spices and a fine cheese finished off the meal their goblets had been filled repeatedly with a good red wine belching delicately the abbot commented yell nae go hungry wi catriona in yer house nephew she sets a good table provided i can get her into my house to start with the earl said ruefully the afternoon was long and the abbot retired to his room to sleep and to make his devotions restless patrick found his cloak and went out into the city the gray february cold was bitter and he could smell on the wind the snow that would begin falling by evening he walked without thinking he walked to calm the feelings that raged through him suddenly he caught sight of a small jewelry shop and went inside the owner recognizing wealth when he saw it came forward do ye hae any rings for sale yes my lord if my lord would be seated he signaled an apprentice who hurried forward with a chair patrick sat down a ladys ring he clarified ahhhh smiled the jeweler his lordship wishes something for a good friend he snapped his fingers at a second apprentice who came forward with a tray patrick scornfully eyed the contents lord mon is this the best ye can do im buying a ring for my wife not for my whore a second tray was presented patrick smiled this is more like it mon four rings nestled on the paleblue velvet a diamond teardrop a ruby heart a round sapphire and a squarecut emerald each was set in heavy gold carefully he examined each asking its price at last picking up the heartshaped ruby ring he said ill take this one but only on one condition and that is my lord send one of yer apprentices to the kiras in goldsmiths lane tell them the earl of glenkirk wishes an appraisal immediately the jeweler bowed and bade one of his lads go his prices were honest and for that he thanked god getting a customer like the earl of glenkirk was a feather in his cap if the earl took the ring the jeweler thought his wife could have the new cloak shed been hounding him for all winter and his mistress would get the lace cap she wanted the apprentice reappeared soon bringing a man with him benjamin the earl stood and grasped the newcomers hand warmly my lord it is good to see you when did you arrive in edinburgh just today my uncle charles has accompanied me we stay at my brothers house off high street yes said benjamin kira i know the house i spoke with lord adam and his wife before they left for france he smiled at the earl so youre buying jewelry for my lady catriona ahh said benjamin kira he knew most of the story but was far too polite to sayso the ring master jeweler slipping a small loop on his eye he held up the ruby ahhhhh yes hummm yes good very good he handed the ring to patrick and turned to the merchant well master adie its a beautiful stone well cut nicely set your price the jeweler named it very fair pronounced benjamin kira in fact youre getting a bargain my lord let me see the other rings you showed the earl he turned back to the jeweler he examined the diamond the sapphire and the emerald and then asked the price of each too low master adie he told the surprised jeweler raise the price on the emerald by twenty percent and on the diamond and sapphire by ten percent patrick directed benjamin kira to see that the jeweler was paid thanking him for his appraisal the earl bid him and the jeweler good day a bluegray dusk lit the city and snow was beginning to drift down in large fat sticky flakes briskly he walked back to his brothers house sally opened the door for him and taking his cloak and cap shooed him down the hall into the family parlor theres a good fire going mlord and ill bring ye some hot spiced wine he found his uncle and cat engrossed in a game of chess before the fire he said nothing but sat down sally came in and set the goblet by his hand he drank slowly savoring the sweetness of the wine the pungency of the spices and the lovely warmth that began to seep through his chilled body check and mate he heard his uncle say yer far too skilled a chess player for an abbot cat complained i generally win what i set out to win came the reply there speaks the leslie in ye cat laughed i believe yer trying to tell me something uncle yes my child i am whatever your misunderstanding wi patrick the bairn is the innocent party dinna let him be born nameless oh he wont be nameless i intend calling him james after the king i saw the lad out riding one day such a solemn boy but verra bonnie glenkirk bit his lip to keep from laughing the minx was deliberately baiting the abbot and she had succeeded admirably charles leslie exploded in a rash of very unabbotlike gaelic oaths cat stood up and curtsied good night uncle i find i am once again fatigued she said leaving the room she had never even once acknowledged patricks presence someone ought to beat the wench on her backside growled the abbot i already have replied the earl it did no good the abbot snorted tomorrow i will speak wi her again now i am for my bed ill need a good nights rest if im to contend with catriona hay patrick stood by the window watching the snow it was falling quite thickly now and the deserted street outside was already well covered the parlor door opened to admit sally carrying a tray mistress thought ye might be hungry after yer walk mlord she and yer uncle ate earlier she put the tray on the table by the fireplace ill come back in a bit sir ye eat up now the tray contained a steaming bowl of boiled shrimp a plate with two thick slices of cold ham a small hot loaf of bread a dish of sweet butter and a pitcher of brown ale patrick devoured it all when sally returned she brought a plate of warm shortbread and a bowl of highly polished red apples he ate all the shortbread and two of the apples sally clearing away the tray smiled warmly at him it does me good to see you eat mlord its like watching me brother ian now sir if youll look in the cabinet there she pointed across the room youll find some good whisky will there be anything else before i go to bed nay lass thank ye kindly run along now alone again he poured himself a whisky and drank it slowly enjoying its smoky bite trust cat to find a man with a good still he thought cat ah sweetheart ive hurt ye and now i am going to have the devils own time wi ye my uncle may do all the diplomacy he chooses tomorrow but i must talk wi ye tonight he put down his glass and exited the family parlor sally had left him a nightstick burning on the table by the stairwell slowly he climbed the stairs dreading the moment hed have to face her standing in front of her door he knocked for a moment he hoped she was asleep then the door opened and there she was in her green velvet dressing gown her heavy honeycolored hair loose about her shoulders he stared tonguetied feeling like a fool patrick her voice was soft either come in or go away she turned and walked back into the room he followed her closing the door behind him a fire burned in the grate lighting the room she had been in bed paying him no heed she climbed back into the warmth of her quilts two huge pillows propped her up he drew a chair up next to the bed and sat down well my lord she said folding her hands over her enormous belly i think i am safe in assuming yeve nae come to rape me this night what is it then ye want i want to talk well leave the diplomacy and tact to our uncle the abbot ye and i can speak the truth to each other i am a fool cat aye she agreed i love ye lass what is done is done if ye canna forgie me can ye at least forget my boorishness ill do anything to win ye back can ye change the way ye think patrick because that is my price i will nae be yer possession yers or anyone elses i canna be just glenkirks wife i must be catriona hay leslie and only if ye think of me in that way and treat me in that way will others follow she smiled gently at him ah hinny i dinna think ye really understand do ye perhaps ye canna i am trying to cat would it help if i set aside a certain portion of yer dowry for you alone thats not quite what i mean patrick but if yer willing ill tell ye exactly what i want from a financial point of view the investments that grandmam left me were included in my dowry they should not have been they are mine alone and i want them back acuil also belongs to me it was my paternal grandmothers and grandmam saw that it was put in my name as this house is in fionas name lord patrick ye knew grandmam better than i did and ye know how strongly she felt about a woman having something of her own of course ye may have acuil back he said but as to the investments love ye dinna know finance and i canno allow ye to waste what grandmam left ye just to satisfy a whim then we canna proceed any further in our discussions patrick good night she turned away from him she would not tell him that for two years now she had been handling the investments grandmam left her she had the brilliant guidance of benjamin kira of all janet leslies greatgrandchildren catriona hays investments were the richest because she listened and learned from the kiras that family whose help had meant so much to janet leslie cat had a flair for investment banking and an almost psychic sense about decisions but she would not tell patrick these things the decision to return to her what was rightfully hers must be his decision she did not care what his reasons would be for she didnt really expect him to understand how she felt however he must act without knowledge of her financial talent or it would be no good she heard the door close quietly rolling over onto her back her eyes swept the room he was gone she felt the tearshot and saltypouring down her face despite her calm demeanor she was frightened the babe she carried was the next glenkirk and she wanted him born with both his names but shed not give in to patrick before he met her conditions the child in her womb kicked and she protectively placed her hands on her belly dinna fret jamie yer father will see it our way soon she whispered and it would have to be very soon she knew for her son should be making his appearance any time now she wondered if patrick was as restless as she was and whether he was lying awake in his bed now as she lay awake in hers chapter the snow fell all through the night and edinburgh woke to a sparkling silverwhite city cat rose relieved herself in the chamberpot and climbed back into the warm bed a few minutes later sally arrived to start a fresh fire she brought hot ilk with a beaten egg and spices and a plate of hot scones dripping butter and strawberry jam bless you said cat sitting forward as sally plumped her pillows im ravenous this morning is there any bacon there could be my lady smiled sally start wi what ye have and ill tell mrs kerr cat sipped her milk and greedily ate the scones you look like something ten years old instead of a woman about to gie birth laughed patrick entering the room theres jam all over yer face yer bacon madame he gracefully swept the plate under her nose and set it down in front of her thank you my lord she grabbed a piece of the bacon and chewed it with relish may i breakfast wi you cat if ye wish sally lass bring it in cat waited until sally had departed before speaking rather sure of yerself arent ye patrick damnit cat is this the way its going to be always sniping until ye gie me back what is mine it is not going to be at all she took another bite of scone and the butter ran down her little chin yer going to call my bluff arent ye cat he could barely keep the amusement out of his voice aye she drawled looking straight at him would ye like to wager ill win too what stakes madame acuil against a house in edinburgh but i get to choose it if ye win sweetheart i will she said swooping up the last piece of bacon he laughed enjoying her outrageous confidence it was a side of her he hadnt seen before and he liked it if he said i can find a conveyance of some sort will ye come out wi me today yes my size has hindered me and ive been indoors all the last few weeks benjamin kira owned a sleigh imported from norway it was red with a blackandgold design and pulled by two black horses the earl settled cat comfortably tucking several fur robes about her took the reins and set off through the city catriona hay was a beautiful woman there were enough admiring glances directed at the sleigh to annoy patrick considerably but his glowering looks were enough to discourage any gallants cat was wrapped in a brown velvet cloak the hood trimmed in a wide band of soft dark sable framed beautifully her creamy heartshaped face several tendrils of honeycolored hair escaped from beneath the hood their rich dark gold lying in delicious contrast to the dark fur patrick cursed to himself he was going to have to give in to her demands it wasnt merely the question of his sons name he loved this headstrong vixen and if he allowed her to escape him again hed never get her back im hungry glenkirk she announced breaking in on his thoughts theres an excellent tavern on the edge of town sweetheart i thought wed stop there he drove the sleigh smartly into the courtyard of the royal scot and leaping down tossed the reins to a young fellow cat flung back the fur robes and allowed patrick to lift her out because of the snow he carried her into the inn before setting her on her feet a private room sir asked the landlord nay mon the common room will do us fine if it isna too crowded they were seated at a window table by the large fireplace patrick took her cloak beneath it she wore a deceptively modest loose brown velvet gown with a creamy lace ruff collar and cuffs a heavy gold and topaz chain relieved the severity of the gown her hair was loose the landlord brought them goblets of hot spiced wine without waiting to be asked well eat said the earl bring us yer best they had drunk two goblets of the wine before the waiter arrived staggering beneath his tray the first course consisted of a bowl of shrimp prawns and oysters boiled in a delicate herb sauce there was fresh bread and butter a dish of artichokes in vinegar and oil and a salad of cabbage next came roast duck crisp and brown with a sweetandsour lemon sauce three standing ribs of rare beef thin pink slices of lamb on a shallow platter with red wine and rosemary a whole broiled trout and flaky little pastries filled with minced venison rabbit and fruit the third course was a large bowl of stewed pears and apples in clotted cream sprinkled with colored sugar this was accompanied by jellies sugared nuts and a large cheese lastly came wafers and little glasses of hippocras cat who had never been shy at the table ate with a particular gusto that amused the earl at last she said im sleepy glenkirk take me home he paid the bill and complimented the landlord on the excellence of the food and the service having tipped everyone he tucked cat again into the sleigh and drove home when he had returned the sleigh to benjamin kira and come back sally informed him that her mistress had retired to her room he climbed the stairs and knocked she bade him enter she had exchanged the brown velvet dress for a pale blue silk chamber robe she lay on her bed i am feeling very fat and full she told him i intend sleeping the whole afternoon away she reached up drawing him down to the bed thank ye patrick i did enjoy our outing so so did i love he answered he bent and kissed her gently she took his hand and placed it on her swollen belly a look of incredulous delight lit up his face as he felt the child in her belly kick she laughed aye hinny my jamies a strong and healthy bairn she had said my not our patrick was hurt but he tried hiding it and instead said lightly our jamie cat hes my son too nay my lord of glenkirk i told ye yesterday the bairn is my son your bastard patrick stood ill let ye sleep he said quietly and left the room he was close to giving in cat knew and she was using every trick to weaken him she knew he wanted her and not just for the child she didnt mind his desiring her body for she also desired his but until he gave her back her rightful property and saw the error of his ways there could be no living with him she fell asleep wondering how long it would be before he conceded defeat while she slept patrick was learning a very interesting fact from his uncle the abbot had spent the morning in the library awaiting the return of his niece and nephew he was feeling quite pleased with himself he thought his talks with catriona had begun to bear fruit when patrick entered the library he asked well nephew when do i perform the wedding not yet uncle shes still not ready to have me gods foot mon what does she want do ye understand her for i am nae sure i do patrick laughed i think i am beginning to understand her quite well she does nae wish to be treated as a chattel nonsense snapped the abbot of course women are chattel why even the protestant heretics agree wi that nevertheless continued patrick she wants to be treated as an equal and she says that both acuil and the investments that grandmam left her should not have been included in her dowry she wants them legally returned to her she says shell nae wed wi me until she gets them the abbot thought a minute then spoke mam believed that women needed a little something of their own and she did see that all of her granddaughters and the greatgranddaughters born before she died had both a bit of property and some financial investments a mad idea no judge would uphold such nonsense if greyhaven included acuil and the investments in cats dowry then they are of course yours hearing his uncles reasoning patrick suddenly saw the unfairness of it all in a flash he understood cats anger i have promised he said to return acuil to her has she ever done anything wi her investments other than collect the dividends greyhaven mentioned something about it to me once but im nae sure what he was talking about you would have to ask the kir as i hae full intention of doing so replied patrick but uncle if ye wish my son born legitimate say nothing to cat of this conversation i am going to see benjamin kira if she asks for me when she wakes say ive gone out walking but when cat hay awoke she wasnt thinking of patrick she was thinking of the pains sweeping over her she struggled to gain her feet but no sooner had she done so than a flood of water poured down her legs she screamed within seconds both mrs kerr and sally burst into the room it took but a moment for mrs kerr to sum up the situation she put a comforting arm about cat dinna fret my lady tis just the laddie deciding its his time to be born sally lass get some towels are ye in pain my lady a little the pains come and go rightly so said mrs kerr sally go tell the abbot well need his help wi the table now my lady back into bed for the moment she helped cat back into the big bed sally hurried downstairs to the library where charles leslie dozed peacefully before the fire gently she shook his shoulder sir sir charles sleepily opened his eyes mistress has gone into labor sir mrs kerr and i will need yer help in carrying the birthing table the abbot was wide awake now has the earl returned no sir damnation swore the abbot ill hae to run and fetch him sally put a hand on his arm my lord my little brothers in the kitchen hell go fetch the earl there is plenty of time first babies are always slow in coming gie the lad this said charles handing sally a copper theres a silver piece when he returns thank ye mlord if yell wait here ill send the boy now she ran to the kitchen where her tenyearold brother sat spooning lamb stew into his mouth here robbie run to banker kiras house in goldsmiths lane ask for the earl of glenkirk and speak to no one else tell him his son is about to be born if they dinna want to disturb the earl tell them tis life and death she gave him the copper and theres silver when ye come back clutching the copper the boy grabbed his cloak and ran at benjamin kiras home the earl of glenkirk sat sipping turkish coffee and listening with growing amazement as the current head of the edinburgh kira family told him of catriona hays financial acumen shes almost tripled her investment in the last two years said benjamin kira surely ye tell her what to do said patrick not for the last two years my lord when she was twelve she wrote and asked if i would instruct her in financial matters i began simply for i was not sure either that she was serious or that she had the intellect for it the more i taught her the more she wanted to know she absorbed all i told her and comprehended everything two years ago she began handling her own affairs for about six months she would consult me before she made a move but since then she has taken full charge shes clever my lord very clever i dont mind telling you in confidence that i have been following her lead myself and a pretty penny i have made patrick leslie swallowed hard are ye telling me benjamin that when lady catriona has instructed ye regarding her investments ye hae followed her advice regarding yer own yes my lord did ye know that the master of greyhaven turned over lady catrionas investments to me last year when the wedding date was set i did not know my lord we were not notified here in edinburgh lady hay has been continuing to handle her own funds especially since she has been here in town and she will continue to do so benjamin your brother abner is a lawyer is he not yes my lord if he is here i want to immediately draw up a paper legally returning lady hays possessions to her and benjamin she is never to know that i questioned you about her handling of the funds i will be frank wi ye my friend lady hay will shortly bear my child and she refuses to wed wi me as was arranged years ago unless i return her property naturally id nae hae the next glenkirk born a bastard but she is a stubborn lass and neither my uncle the abbot nor i can move her ill send for my brother and his clerk immediately my lord you may trust my discretion women at best are unpredictable women about to give birth however are downright dangerous it is best to just give in gracefully while they waited for the lawyer young robbie was shown into the room this boy said the servant claims he must see the earl on a matter of life and death well lad said the earl kindly im robbie kerr sallys brother her ladyship is having the bairn now jesu swore patrick is it born yet nay sir said the boy calmly shes just begun her labor yer remarkably well informed for a lad of nine ten the earl was amused ten sir and i should be well informed theres six after me your mothers to be commended young robbie said benjamin kira nay sir me mum died birthin me tis my stepmother who had the six after me the earl paled and noting it benjamin kira said to him ill send my wife back with the boy shes a mother three times shell find out how far along your lady is dont worry my lord these first births are always long you have plenty of time as abner kira and his clerk entered the room benjamin and the boy went to find benjamins wife husband and wife conferred in a language unfamiliar to robbie it sounded a bit like the gaelic hed heard spoken occasionally mistress kira turned her lovely brown eyes on robbie well laddie come along and lead me to his lordships house she said sally let them in for robbie took mistress kira to the front door i am master benjamin kiras wife his lordship sent me to see how his lady does sally curtsied if youll pray be seated maam ill go fetch my aunt she is wi her ladyship now when mrs kerr came down the stairs she fussed och sally has left you in the hallway come into the back parlor and have a glass of cordial thank you mrs kerr smiled anna kira but i must hurry back his lordship like most firsttime fathers is frantic how does his lady he need not worry everything is proceeding normally shell nae deliver for hours yet i think hell be home long before said mistress kira gently the two women looked at each other their faces registering their understanding of the ways of men they laughed retorting quickly to her own home anna kira reassured the earl that cat was fine by this time abner kira had composed the document which made catriona mairi hay leslie countess of glenkirk sole owner in her own right of acuil and of the investments left to her by janet leslie the document written in duplicate was signed by patrick leslie earl of glenkirk and witnessed by both benjamin and abner kira one copy was to be kept permanently in the kira vaults the earl took the other with him he hurried through the snowy twilight the document clutched beneath his cloak she would wed him now she had to not yet smiled sally as she let him in and took his cloak my uncle in the library sir he moved swiftly down the hall and into the library come uncle charles get what ever ye need to marry us ive done what cat asked and im going up to her now he was out the door before the abbot could speak he ran up the stairs two at a time and burst into cats bedroom a long table slanted to one end stood before the fireplace it was covered in muslin sheets cat sat upon it propped up with pillows the earl looked around astounded birthing is a bloody business my lord i dinna believe in ruining a perfectly good mattress and feather bed said mrs kerr patrick walked over to cat and stood before her without a word he handed her the rolled parchment she broke the seal unrolled it and read it through her eyes closed for a moment as pain swept through her then raising tearfilled eyes to him she said softly thank ye patrick catriona hay weve been pledged for over twelve years our child is being born at this very minute say yell wed me now he stopped and grinned besides this document is made out to catriona mairi hay leslie the countess of glenkirk ye must wed me to get yer property back patrick she asked ye hae returned my property tis true but has yer attitude changed how do ye see me it was a tricky question and he knew that their fates and that of their child depended on his careful answer i see ye he said slowly first as cat haya competent and lovely woman i hope to see ye also as my wife as my mistress as my friend and as the mother of our children ye are nae one woman sweetheart yer many some of whom ive yet to meet patrick she smiled at him through her pain i do believe ye are beginning to understand me it canna hae been easy for ye thank ye she was going to accept he was sure of it and felt relief sweeping over him yes my lord my love my dear friend and dearer enemy she squeezed his hand i will honor the contract between us and wed wi ye on cue the abbot bustled in carrying his portable altar well niece no more foolishness if yell nae speak yer vows yerself ill be forced to speak them for ye i should hae thought of that months ago i dinna suppose ye can stand at this point there is no need to threaten me uncle i will marry patrick but not for another five minutes if yell both leave i wish to dress for my wedding she winced and said to sally the rubyred velvet dressing gown ohhhh jesu the men left quickly sally was worried the pains are much closer now my lady i dinna think ye can stand just for a few minutes i will not be married lying down on a birthing table another spasm shot through her sally helped cat out of her chamber robe and into the heavy velvet dressing gown as mrs kerr slipped out into the hall say the words quickly my lord abbot her labor has increased suddenly the next glenkirk will be born in a very short time charles nodded sally stuck her head out the door and called mistress wants the ceremony in the parlor by the fireplace while mrs kerr and the abbot blustered disapproval patrick strode back into the bedroom cat stood shakily in her rubyred velvet dressing gown her long heavy hair was plaited and pinned up held fast with gold and pearl pins he did not miss the pain in her eyes his arms were around her neither said a word picking cat up he walked into the hall and carefully down the stairs to the main parlor the abbot mrs kerr and sally followed charles leslie opened his prayer book and began patrick and cat stood before him cat holding glenkirks hand very tightly he knew each time she experienced a contraction for her grip tightened he marveled at her strength the abbot having noted his nieces pallor went quickly through the ceremony the ring he hissed at patrick patrick handed him the ruby charles leslie blessed it returned it to the earl and watched him slip it on cats finger her eyes widened appreciatively at the heartshaped stone and she smiled up at him he smiled reassuringly at her after a few more words charles leslie pronounced his niece and nephew husband and wife patrick didnt wait for congratulations he lifted cat and carried her quickly back upstairs to the bedroom sally ran ahead opening the door as mrs kerr followed close behind the two women helped cat out of the heavy gown and onto the birthing table when he was sure she was as comfortably settled as she could be patrick drew up a chair and sat by her side my lord this is no place for a man remonstrated mrs kerr unless my wife objects i will remain to see my son bora he looked at cat she held out her hand to him stay my lord she smiled at him yeve already missed so much the pains were coming faster and harder her entire body was bathed in perspiration she gritted her teeth and breathed deeply dont hold back my lady said mrs kerr you must cry out or it will go the worse for you i dinna want my son entering the world to the sound of his mothers pain she insisted nonsense snapped back mrs kerr hell nae remember it so busy hell be with his own howling her eyes twinkled why dont you swearin the gaelicfor hell nae understand that the abbot of glenkirk waiting outside in the hallway listened in amazement to the stream of colorful gaelic issuing from his nieces chamber it was followed some ten minutes later by a triumphant shout from glenkirk and the outraged howl of an infant unable to restrain himself any longer charles leslie rushed into the bedroom mrs kerr was tending cat while sally wiped the birthing blood from the wailing child ive a son uncle a son the fifth earl of glenkirk shouted patrick james patrick charles adam leslie aye uncle spoke up a tired but amused voice he has a son the fourth earl has given birth to the fifth earl and just fancy he did it all by himself i couldna hae done it wiout ye sweetheart grinned patrick no ye couldnt have she laughed weakly when do i get to see the marvel i hae produced twill be a minute dearie said mrs kerr yer all cleaned up and she slipped a clean sweetly scented nightgown of soft palelavender wool over her ladys headready to be put back into your bed my lord would you be so kind as to carry the countess to her bed gently patrick lifted cat and placed her between the warmed sheets then he drew the down coverlet over her sally placed the sleeping swaddled infant in cats arms gods nightshirt hes so tiny ive seen bigger christmas capons but there was pride in her voice hes got your hair patrick she said noting the damp tuft of black that sally had brushed into a curl mrs kerr took the baby back and handed him to sally shell put him in his cradle and sit wi him until he wakes do ye still wish to nurse him or shall i hire a wet nurse ill nurse him myself mrs kerr at least for now i do think however that sallys sister lucy should come and be her assistant in the nursery sally cannot watch the child all day and all night yes my lady but now you must get some sleep in a few minutes mrs kerr youll see that his lordship and my uncle are well taken care of at supper of course madam smiled mrs kerr ill see to it at once she turned to go mrs kerr yes my lady thank ye mrs kerr for everything the housekeeper bridled with pleasure twas an honor my lady to deliver the future glenkirk she turned to the abbot come sir ill wager all this excitement has raised an appetite in you together they left the room patrick came and sat gingerly on the edge of his wifes bed taking her hand he raised it to his lips yer overproud cat leslie and stubborn beyond belief but by god i love you i am proud and lucky to hae ye for my wife and my friend she lifted her leafgreen eyes to him and they twinkled mischievously ye owe me a house in town glenkirk and as soon as i am able i intend to get it patrick leslies deep laughter sounded throughout the entire house chapter james patrick charles adam leslie had appeared on the twentyfourth of february four weeks after his birth adam and fiona leslie arrived home from france the earl had sent his messenger with news of his sons birth and the younger leslies returned in haste so as to be godparents to the child charles leslie performed the ceremony without delay he had been away from his abbey for about two months now hiring a swift coastal cutter he sailed north to peterhead he would be able to continue overland easily from there and looked forward to spending his first night back on dry land enjoying the hospitality of deer abbey fiona was amused to find cat enjoying her maternity i didna think ye were the googa type she chuckled cat grinned back neither did i it creeps up on ye wiout yer knowing it however i dinna intend to hae another for several years if glenkirks the rutting stallion leslie is yell hae no choice ill be careful said cat meaningfully why cousin remarked fiona raising an elegantly plucked eyebrow how different ye are from a year ago its been a rather busy year fiona and it got busier for cat she was looking for a house for with adam and fiona back home the little edinburgh dwelling was too crowded adam had promised his wife they would travel but that had changed now the second glenkirk son james was married to ailis hay and ailis hays only brother francis had died of a winter flux gilbert hay had no other legitimate sons and therefore james leslie had become his fatherinlaws heir james and ailis were moving to hay house to learn the management of a small estate michael leslie would be marrying isabella forbes in less than two years and taking over her estate it was therefore up to adam leslie to learn the management of glenkirk in the event that patrick died before his son james reached his majority spend a year at glenkirk and ye can hae a year to travel promised patrick seeing fionas disappointment cat meanwhile had found a house to suit her like leslie house it was on a quiet side street but her choice was off canongate which ran towards the palace of holyrood rather than towards high street built of brick it contained a large and sunny kitchen a pantry a washroom a still room a storage room a servants hall a comfortable room off the garden for the cook and several cubicles for the kitchen help the main floor held a wide reception hall a bright formal parlor a library a dining room a family dining room and family parlor the second floor was made up almost entirely of one great hall off it were several private anterooms on the third floor were six bedrooms each with its own dressing room and indoor sanitary facilities on the fourth floor was the nursery and on the fifth the servants quarters the property had a flower garden kitchen garden and orchard it also had a fine large stable when the earl complained of the size of the house he was reminded of the size of their families glenkirk house would serve for all the leslies when they visited edinburgh and would be useful later on when the little king came into his own and held court cat had hired mrs kerr on a permanent basis to run her new house she wanted to stay in edinburgh at least till the end of june so she might attend to the ordering of the furnishings glenkirk gave her till midmay why cant you and adam go home alone she protested fiona and i will stay in town to finish this business and then join ye later patrick laughed madame he said looking down at her i hae no intention of letting ye out of my sight ever again yer an impossible wench to catch up with my dear well return to glenkirk together in midmay yell hae to have yer business finished by then besides what difference does it make if the house is finished now or not because my lord i hae no intention of spending the entire winter snowed in at glenkirk after christmas or before if it be possible we will return to town for the winter the earl was amused so she had plans to come to town each winter he chuckled to himself what a handful she was going to be best to keep her little belly filled with his children a full nursery would keep her busy during the next few weeks cat spoke with numerous craftsmen and approving hundreds of sketches ordered the furnishings she arranged with benjamin kira that the craftsmen be paid upon mrs kerrs approval after delivery had been made she did not tell patrick about this the earl might have forgotten but glenkirk house belonged to cat before they left edinburgh they were visited by george leslie the earl of rothes who was the head of the leslie clan both patrick and adam were pleased by the honor done their minor branch of the family cat however was not impressed were richer she said he has decided to keep on good terms wi us in case he has to borrow money though the men were shocked at this lack of respect fiona laughed ye really are a bitch cat but i happen to agree wi you besides george leslie is of the new kirk and his family was implicated in the murder of cardinal beaton years ago i dinna trust him they left edinburgh for glenkirk in midmay the earl his countess adam and fiona all rode sally lucy and the baby were comfortably settled in a wagon a troop of glenkirk soldiers under conall moreleslie escorted the party for the roads were not safe many small merchants hearing they planned to travel by way of aberdeen asked leave to travel with them the larger the group the safer everyone was they reached glenkirk two weeks later fiona chuckled wickedly at the reception awaiting them lined up were the dowager countess margaret leslie cats parents and brothers fionas parents and brothers all the leslies of glenkirk and the moreleslies of crannog jesu swore cat under her breath theyve dragged the whole clan out the only one missing seems to be our uncle the abbot no hes there he just stooped to pick up aunt megs glove fiona sounded as if she were going to laugh christs toenail its nae us cattis his next earlship of glenkirk theyve come to welcome returned fiona as the mob descended upon them she was right poor jamie was snatched from sally and passed howling his outrage among the delighted relations cat angrily retrieved her son soothed him and quelled the protest from the group ellen called ill take him my lady ye most certainly will not snapped cat yer far too good a maid and i have missed ye she told the crestfallen woman who immediately brightened sally called cat take yer wet master she endured the welcoming banquet arranged by patricks mother before being allowed to escape to her apartments her mother cornered her long enough to ask whether all was well between her daughter and the earl assured that everything was fine heather breathed a sigh of relief and returned to her husband as evening drew in cat yawned hugely meg leslie smothered a laugh i think she whispered to her daughterinlaw that it would be perfectly permissible for ye to end this banquet cat leaned over to patrick glenkirk must i fall asleep in the jellies before yell end the evening all right sweetheart but ill stay awhile let us stand up now and put the others who also wish to retire out of their misery they stood giving the signal for those who wanted to leave cat politely bid her guests good night and hurried to the nursery jamie his eyes bright lay on his stomach sucking his tiny fist hes such a good bairn said the doting lucy cat picked up her son and cradled him for a moment his tiny nose twitched och crowed sally proudly the smart laddie smells the milk jamie began to cry lucy took the baby from cat while sally hurried to help her mistress remove her bodice cat sat down taking her son again she gave him her breast when the child had sated himself and lay drowsily in her lap she smiled down on him hes growing so big she noted her voice soft aye madame answered sally and bright he is too our little lad cat lay her son back in the cradle on his stomach and drew the coverlet over him when i see him so helpless so tiny she said its hard to believe hell be a great impossible man like his father some day the two nursemaids giggled and the countess rising buttoned her bodice and bid them good night she hurried to her own apartments where ellen had a steaming tub waiting stripping her clothes off cat climbed in and luxuriated in the warm fragrant water she who was used to bathing daily had not had a bath since leaving edinburgh two weeks before ellen tell the earls man angus to hae a bath ready for his lordship i wont hae him climb stinking into my bed this night and while ellen was gone cat lathered up her hair rinsed it lathered it and rinsed it again she climbed from the tub and sat naked before the fire while ellen rubbed her hair dry and then brushed it till it gleamed finally cat stood and held her hair up while ellen powered her body perfection you are pure perfection her husband stood in the doorway angus has prepared you a bath my lord she told him lazily his eyes traveled the length of her body she boldly returned his glance ye smell like sunshine love and you stink of horses and two weeks on the dusty road he laughed ill nae be long good night ellen ellen chuckled which nightgown my lady dinna bother ellie just gie me a shawl cat got into the big bed and sitting up drew a lacy wool shawl about her shoulders good night ellie good night madame cat sat in her bed listening with amusement to the sounds coming from patricks bedroom he splashed he sang offkey he made noises like a duck and she laughed a few minutes later he came naked through the doorway connecting the two rooms and made straight for the bed for a moment they just looked at each other then he enfolded her in a bear hug and she snuggled contentedly into his arms are ye glad to be home cat for now but i meant it patrick when i said i wanted to spend part of each year in edinburgh soon the little king will come into his own hell marry and there will be a real court again i dinna want to be a stranger in edinburgh when that happens nay hinny well be no part of james court grandmam always said the key to survival was to stay out of politics and out of court were but a minor branch of our clan but we are the richest we have always avoided trouble by not allowing ourselves to be noticed we will continue to do so he shifted his position and slowly began stroking her lovely round breasts then why she demanded did ye buy me a house in town the nipples on her breasts were pinkly pointed and she was furious at her bodys quick response to him because i always pay my debts madame he bent and nibbled teasingly on the tip of her breast angrily she pulled away i have furnished that house wi my own money am i not even to spend part of each year there of course ye may well go to town each year i promise you you can shop see plays and visit our friends but there will be no getting involved with any stewart court stewarts are always notoriously short of funds and one can hardly refuse the king a loan one can also not ask a king to return a loan wed be impoverished in a year he pulled her underneath him and bent over her ill talk no more of this tonight madame countess of glenkirk his greengold eyes glittered dangerously are ye ready to be an obedient and dutiful wife you impossible minx her slender fingers wound into his dark hair and pulling his head down she kissed him slowly and expertly her ripe body moving subtly beneath him by god he swore when she released him i never taught you that didnt ye my lord her voice was honeyed no her soft laughter teased him you little bitch he said his hand wrapped itself around her heavy hair if i thought that any other man even considered sampling your ample charms she laughed again but her eyes and mouth were defiant suddenly with a savagery that left her gasping he took her ill never possess all of you cat for yer quicksilver but by god my dear ill spoil you for any other man she began to struggle but he laughed and began kissing tiny kisses over her face throat and breasts he could feel her heart beating wildly beneath his lips his big hands began caressing her hips and thighs slowly stroking the silken flesh patrick patrick her voice was frantic please patrick she could feel her control going and couldnt understand why she still fought him perhaps it was because she instinctively understood that at these times she and he both lost individual identity it frightened her yet nay sweetheart dinna fear whats happening go along wi it hinny go along wi it it was easier to surrender and she did allowing herself to be swept away into the whirling rainbow vortex that always gave such pleasure she lost track of everything except the wave upon wave of exquisite sensation that followed one upon the other until the final rending climax later that night she awoke to find the moon shining through the window and across the bed patrick lay sprawled on his back snoring gently carefully she pulled her leg from underneath his turning on her side she leaned on an elbow and gazed down at him she took pride in his good looks as he took pride in hers his fair skin was tanned in places from their twoweek ride thick dark lashes spread fanlike on his high cheekbones his straight nose broadened at the nostrils and his mouth was wide and generous her eyes wandered to his broad hairless chest she blushed furiously as her eyes caressed the tangled mat of black hair between his long muscular legs he was a strange man on the one hand he treated her as an equal and truly seemed to understand the conflicting feelings that raged through her on the other hand he treated her like a slave he was tender thoughtful wise cruel and didactic he was hardly the average man she knew but then she was hardly the average woman in her early teens she had resented grandmam for forcing a match on her when she was too young to understand the importance of it however and she chuckled softly to herself somehow that incredibly beautiful whitehaired old lady had known we are well suited my lord and i thought cat we are damnably well suited satisfied she turned over on her stomach and fell into a deep contented sleep chapter the picture was a charming domestic one the dowager countess of glenkirk sat at her tapestry frame embroidering the wings on an angel her twoyearold grandson jamie played before the fire under the watchful eye of sally kerr her son adam sat going over the estate accounts the earl was engaged in deep conversation with master benjamin kira his banker up from edinburgh her two daughters twentyyearold janet who was married to the sithean heir and seventeenyearold mary who would soon be wed to greyhavens eldest boy sat sewing clothes for janets expected baby their men charles leslie and james hay were all dicing in the corner missing was the young countess of glenkirk and her cousin fiona they were meg knew in cats apartment trying on the latest fashions fiona had brought back from paris the younger leslies had recently returned from a year of travel they had been in italy visiting rome and to the courts of florence and to naples they had been to spain to king henri ills court in paris and had spent a few weeks in england fiona could not stop talking about it all and the more she talked the more discontent grew in cat fiona having seen all manner of wonderful things couldnt resist bragging a bit and too cat had been penned at glenkirk for over two years now with only a months stay in edinburgh late last winter meg would not have told her son but she knew that her beautiful daughterinlaw was using a method of birth control passed down from mam cat wanted to see some of the world before she devoted herself to the raising of leslies having raised six herself meg could not help but admire cat cat caressed the exquisitely scented lilac leather gloves fiona had brought her from italy her leafgreen eyes were narrow as she watched her husband get ready for bed i want to make a trip she said yes love he replied absently well go to town again this winter if i can find the time he looked up startled as the gloves whizzed by his head i do not want to go to edinburgh patrick fiona has had a real trip to italy to spain to paris to england she the wife of a mere third son i am the countess of glenkirk and ive never been farther south than edinburgh i wouldnt have gotten even that far but for my own initiative there is no need for ye to travel there is every need i want to i want sons madame so far yeve given me but one child ill bear no more bairns until ye gie me a trip she raged at him that decision is not in yer hands my dear he said smugly isnt it she countered ask yer mother patrick ask and see curious he spoke to meg who laughed softly and said so shes declared war on ye eh patrick she canna stop the babes coming can she his voice was anxious she can and she has my son thats witchcraft meg laughed again oh patrick dinna be such a fool there isnt a woman in this family who doesnt know certain secrets of beauty and health brought back from the east by mam i dinna blame catriona i was wed to yer fathermay god keep himwhen i was fifteen you were born a year later james and adam at threeyear intervals michael a year after adam and janet the next year i would never tell her and you must not either but your youngest sister mary was an accident i intended no more bairns after janie do ye know that in the twentynine years ive been at glenkirk ive never left it except to go to sithean or to greyhaven how i would have loved to have a trip somewhere anywhere it gave him pause his own mother who had so lovingly raised them was discontented maryan accident and cat was able to prevent children if she chose he thought further the little king was fourteen and despite all the nonsense about a match between englands queen elizabeth and the french kings brother patrick was sure there would be no such marriage even if there were a woman of fortysix was hardly apt to deliver a healthy child in all likelihood their own little king would one day rule both england and scotland he wondered how long it would be before the two countries were one when it happened the capital would be in london and edinburgh would be left behinda secondclass city in the realm of the royal stewarts who were notoriously short of memory it might even be necessary to five part of each year in england if his family and their businesses were to survive he had talked that very evening to benjamin kira about the wisdom of moving some of their ships and a warehouse or two into london perhaps he would go to london to check it out he could take cat and his mother before patrick had come home to marry he had paid a visit to elizabeths court and met the queen she was a handsome female but beneath the playful exterior was a cold determined woman she would have no man in her bed for she would not share her power with anyone still having made this choice she resented women who threw themselves into their lovers arms though he kept his feelings to himself and would never allow his family to involve themselves he resented the imprisonment of mary stewart he had twice visited the court in edinburgh while mary reigned she had been some years his senior he had fallen in love at ten with the glorious mary once she had spoken to him acknowledging their distant cousinship through his mother she was a charming and educated woman and her choice of darnley for a husband had been ludicrous though lord bothwell had been marys downfall and glenkirk didnt particularly like him he would have been a far more suitable mate that elizabeth envied mary was obvious the imprisonment of the scots queen was cruel and had been done patrick believed on a whim therefore he would only visit the english court he could never live there for he could not respect the tudor queen he would put enough of his wealth in england so that when the time came that a stewart king ruled the whole great land from lands end to the highlands he would be financially established then his family might go wherever they wished he said nothing to his wife or his mother but closeted himself the next morning in his library with benjamin kira and planned the purchase of two warehouses in london to house goods from half a dozen of his ships it wouldnt be a great deal but would be a start benjamins london cousin eli kira would arrange everything then he made arrangements with the kiras for a trip to england he debated the route and finally decided that the sea route was both quicker and safer at this time of year a rider was dispatched immediately to leith to arrange for the flagship of his fleet to sit off peterhead awaiting them another rider was dispatched to edinburgh to master kiras bank with instructions that a letter of unlimited credit be sent to their london branch for the earl conall moreleslie and a troop of fifty menatarms were sent into england and headed south to london to await their lord eli kira rented a house for the earl in the most fashionable part of the city adam leslie was put in charge of both the glenkirk estate and the glenkirk heir patrick had no intention of exposing his only child to the dangers of travel the boy would be safer with his doting nursemaids in familiar surroundings his arrangements completed the earl announced one night at supper to his wife and his mother that they were going to england cats silver goblet crashed to the table what oh my dear lord are we really going when gods nightshirt ive nothing to wear meg leslie smiled at her daughterinlaw and turned to her son thank you my dear but i am much too old to travel she said nay madame we want ye wi us yes yes bellemere begged cat ye must come yer hardly past forty and thats nae too old to travel please say yell come i hae always wanted to see london mused meg then come cat caught megs hands and kneeling down looked up into her motherinlaws hazel eyes come oh what fun well have the globe theatre the bear gardens masques at court she turned anxiously to her husband we will go to court patrick yes my dear i imagine i still hae a few friends there and though i doubt her majesty will be wildly delighted to see two beautiful women arrive on her doorstep the gentlemen of the court should be enchanted patrick cat looked thoughtful what of jamie we must leave him behind sweetheart ill nae have him endangered her face fell i canna leave my bairn behind patrick he stays behind cat travel is dangerous he looked at her and jamie is our only child sally and lucy are here to care for him and adam and fiona will act as parents for us well be gone but a few months it was too irresistible jamie stays i go she said she flung her arms about him thank ye patrick despite her claims of a poor wardrobe her trunks would have filled a wagon patrick put his foot down one trunk apiece well buy what ye need in london a new wardrobe for each of you cat and meg looked gleefully at each other they reached peterhead on an unusually balmy day the gallant james rode jauntily offshore they were rowed out to the ship even being swung aboard in a boatswains chair didnt faze cat though meg was not delighted the journey south was surprisingly swift and smooth and they suffered no seasickness they didnt even encounter another vessel until they were about to enter the thames and sail upriver to london there they were hailed by another ship with a distinctly piratical look about it upon its quarterdeck stood a handsome young man with a beautifully kept mustache and beard patrick laughed excited raleigh he shouted raleigh you pirate the elegant on the quarterdeck peered across the small gulf separating their ships gods foot can it be glenkirk is it you aye you rebel come across and have a glass of wine wi me a few minutes later the englishman stood on the deck of the gallant james wringing patricks hand have ye been to court yet asked the earl nay ive not the money for it ive been doing a bit of swashbuckling the french ships are easy pickings ill be on my way to ireland soon then perhaps when ive some gold in my pocket and some decent accomplishments to my credit i can present myself to the queen im a simple west country boy patrick my only claim to fame thus far is to be the greatnephew of the queens old governess kate ashley and the greatnephew also of lady denny its not really much to recommend one patrick grinned come on you ambitious devil i want you to meet my wife and my mother he led the way to the great cabin in the stern of the ship knocking first they walked into a beautifully furnished room with large windows looking out over the sea meg came forward mother this is master walter raleigh his eyes twinkled mischievously lady dennys greatnephew raleigh shot him a black look then smiled brightly at meg and bowed over her hand your servant maam and continued patrick bringing cat forward this is my wife catriona the countess of glenkirk raleigh dropped megs hand and stared christ man he exploded no ones wife looks like that a mistress perhaps but only if youre a king and very lucky but never a wife the leslies laughed and cat without so much as a blush replied alas i must disillusion ye master raleigh i am indeed the countess of glenkirk a wife and a mother also lingering over her hand raleigh sighed having seen perfection and being unable to attain it i shall be forced to remain a bachelor madame raleigh yer a most charming rogue i fear for the virtue of all the lasses in yer west country she gently freed her hand both cat and meg listened eagerly to all raleigh said although he had not yet been to court he was full of its gossip passed on to him by friends he was able to fill them in on the latest fashions for raleigh was a bit of a fop and quite vain after a pleasant interval the captain advised that the tide would be turning shortly unless they got into the river now they would be forced to ride at anchor for twelve hours raleigh immediately stood up kissing the ladies hands he bid them all adieu the earl escorted him onto the deck he said he hoped to see him at court before they returned to scotland soon with the help of a good wind the gallant james slipped into the river thames and headed upstream chapter that elizabeth tudor had observed her fortyseventh birthday was confirmed by her mirror still she was queen and although it was an open secret that she had no intention of marrying suitors continued to arrive she was perpetually surrounded by gallants whose clever tongues spun lovely compliments this is partly what made the scots earl of glenkirk so enticing he was handsome beyond decency most of her courtiers were mustached and bearded and scented the earl was smoothshaven leaving bare his elegant jawline and there was about him a clean masculine scent that bespoke regular washing he was tall topping most men by several inches well proportioned with good skin and dark wavy hair those greengold eyes were fascinating above all he was well educated the queen detested ignorance and he did not curry favor as the others did he would never become one of her favorites but his courteous coldness fascinated her she had never forgotten him though several years had passed since he had been to court he had been only lord patrick then but now he was back a full earl he knelt and took the hand she graciously extended but the greengold eyes with a hint of amusement deep within them never left her face majesty he murmured he rose to his feet elizabeth was grateful she was seated on a raised dais but even so they were almost at equal eye level it was a distinct disadvantage to the queen who preferred gazing down from lofty heights upon her adoring court her amber eyes narrowed and she spoke so scots rogue you have finally returned yes yer majesty and what naughty things have you been doing while you were away from us elizabeth smiled archly i hae gotten married and fathered a son madame several of the younger courtiers snickered assuming the earl had ruined himself and how long have you been married my lord two years yer majesty and how old is your son two years yer majesty elizabeths eyes widened and the corners of her mouth twitched gods foot glenkirk dont tell me you were caught by an outraged father no madame i had been betrothed to my wife since she was a child there was a story here thought elizabeth but not for the ears of her gossipy court let them wonder she stood up come along glenkirk i want to hear about this in private leaving the assembled court the queen led the way into a small anteroom no ceremony man sit down she seated herself and poured out two glasses of wine now glenkirk she said handing him one of the glasses explain cat was four and i thirteen when the match was made we were betrothed for eleven years cat said the queen patrick smiled catriona yer majesty tis the gaelic for katherine so said elizabeth impatiently but how is it that both your son and your marriage are two years of age there was a misunderstanding and she ran away three days before the wedding the queens eyes widened again they began to twinkle you have yourself a headstrong wench eh my lord aye madame i do it took me almost a year to pin her down you must have pinned her down sometime before that glenkirk if she was carrying your babe patrick laughed she hid first wi some devoted pensioned servants then up in the hills at a small house that had been her grandmothers i found her there and all might have been well but the queen cut in you committed some great blunder ill wager aye he admitted and she was off again she fled to edinburgh where my brother and his wife were about to set off to france she cajoled fiona into letting her stay in their house unknown to adam fiona agreed thinking cat would think things out and return shortly to me when at new years she discovered cat was still hiding in edinburgh and the bairn was less than two months away she informed me my uncle and i went immediately to edinburgh after some discussion cat and i were reconciled and married by my uncle the abbot of glenkirk abbey ill wager she made it hard for you glenkirk the queen chuckled she did he said and when was your son born approximately an hour after the wedding ceremony elizabeth sipping her wine began to laugh she laughed until the tears ran gasping she choked on the wine and began to cough without thinking glenkirk stood up leaned over and clapped her on the back when the queen had finally caught her breath she said i hope you have brought your wild wench with you my lord for i should like to meet her i have brought her yer majesty and ive also brought my mother lady margaret stewart leslie i hope yell receive them both i will glenkirk bring them anytime tell me is your wife beautiful aye madame she is as beautiful as i am said the queen coyly one can hardly compare the beauty of a child with that of a mature woman yer majesty elizabeth chuckled gods foot glenkirk i do believe theres hope for you thats the first real compliment i have ever heard you utter at my court two days later patrick brought his wife to court as cat advanced towards the queen the younger women thought how plain her gown was and the more experienced ones envied her her cleverness the queen of england stood in a stiffly brocaded beribboned bejeweled red velvet gown that glittered and gleamed beneath a huge gold lace ruff the countess of glenkirk wore a fullskirted black velvet gown the wide sleeves were edged in lace and slashed to reveal white silk scattered with goldembroidered stars the neckline was low and framed in a high wellstarched sheer lace collar around her neck were four long ropes of magnificent palepink pearls she woreonly one ring a large heartshaped ruby her hair uncrimped was parted in the center and drawn over her ears into a knot at the nape of her neck a delicate little lace cap sat on the back of her head and two fat pink pearls bobbed from her ears the maids of honor thought the countess raiment too simple but leicester leaned over to lettice knollys his wife and whispered what a beauty to which lettice whispered back aye i hope shell not stay long at court the handsome couple had reached the queen gracefully sweeping off his cap glenkirk bowed low his countess dropped into a graceful curtsy they rose and faced the english queen proudly for just a moment elizabeth tudor wondered what she had missed by not following her heart you are welcome at court countess i am most grateful for yer majestys welcome replied cat carefully the queen turned to patrick your child is indeed most beautiful glenkirk she said dryly next time bring your mother with you i should also enjoy meeting her she turned back to cat i hope your stay here will be a pleasant one dismissed cat curtsied prettily thanking the queen she backed off later she asked her husband what the queen had meant when she called her a child he told her and cat laughed a few days later they took meg to court and the queen received her politely though not without pursing her lips and saying i dont suppose your sisters are illfavored either glenkirk megs warmth however won elizabeth over eli kira had rented the leslies a magnificent house on the strand it had a large garden ending in a terrace overlooking the river and its own waterman to row them they also had a house some fifteen miles from london in case they wanted to get away from the city cat was in her glory she cajoled patrick into escorting her and meg to one of master shakespeares plays at the globe theatre afterwards she said she thought the young boys who played the female roles were quite sweet but she really didnt see why they wouldnt allow women to act womens roles they went to a bearbaiting for she had wanted to see one but the sight of a halfstarved motheaten bear being attacked by a dozen or more halfstarved and brutalized dogs revolted her they entertained heavily both in london and at their country house near waltham abbey they were quite popular the queen had put her stamp of approval upon them at their third visit to court elizabeth scornful of decorative frivolous women had remarked to the young countess i understand you have been educated yes yer majesty my greatgrandmother believed women should be all her female descendants are offered a chance at learning it takes wi some wi others it doesnt i have not however had yer majestys great advantages do you know mathematics some majesty music cat nodded languages aye madame what languages french gaelic and latin well some flemish italian german spanish and greek the queen nodded and suddenly phrased a question in flemish switching to latin in midsentence cat replied in french switched to greek and then to spanish the queen laughed delightedly and pinched cats cheek the glenkirks popularity was assured you are a pert minx my dear said elizabeth i dont know why but i like you cat made one good friend in england the first she had ever had outside her own family lettice knollys the beautiful countess of leicester older than cat had secretly married the queens precious robin two years prior six months later their secret was discovered and lettice elizabeths cousin was just now being permitted back at court she had been in deep disgrace for all that time even now she trod very carefully the leslies townhouse was one of the few places lettice and her husband could meet without offending the queen cat generously gave them a suite of rooms for privacy the queen in jealous spite had offered them none there was a delay in patricks business as there were no warehouses for sale along the waterfront there was however a fine piece of property along the river that eli kira bought for them bidding was opened to the builders of london for the construction of two warehouses and adjoining docks to serve them it became necessary for patrick to remain in london and see the plans completed meg chose to return home to glenkirk she had seen enough of london patrick delegated half of his menatarms under the faithful conall to take his mother home cat wanted them to bring jamie back with them it would be summer before she and patrick could go home patrick overruled her and said she might return home with his mother if she chose and leave ye to play the honeybee among all these english roses i think not my lord jealous sweetheart he inquired infuriatingly of yer admirers she replied sweetly i am no more jealous of yer admirers my lord than ye are of mine her lovely eyes and mouth mocked him and patrick thought how lucky he was to have her he caught her in his arms and kissed her deeply molding herself to him she returned the kiss with equal passion thinking that if she ever caught him loving another woman she would kill him if he had known her thoughts he would have been flattered he hated the court gallants who looked at her with lust well just a few more months and they would be on their way home but it was not to be that way after christmas cat miscarried the baby she had so recently conceived devastated by this tragedy she fell into a decline she wept continuously ate almost nothing and slept fitfully she saw no one even lettice was not received finally ellen approached patrick there is only one thing for it ye must bring jamie to her christ woman exploded the earl its midjanuary and the snow will be heavy in the north conalls just back send conall alone hell get there faster without the others and hell bring sally and the child back safely lord mon sally was raised on the borders she can ride like a trooper even wi the bairn send a messenger today ahead of conall hugh can bring sally and the child as far south as edinburgh he didnt like it but patrick did as ellen suggested once conall was on his way he told his wife of the mission cat brightened immediately she began to eat when her son arrived threeandahalf weeks later she was almost her old self she covered the surprised little boy with kisses until he squirmed away protesting mama no more then the winter suddenly became harsh and snow followed upon snow work was halted on the warehouses and docks until the spring thaw then in early summer the plague visited london and the leslies and their household fled to the country by the time it was safe to return to the city it was autumn again and they were forced to spend another winter in england with the spring of cat knew she was pregnant they remained in england until the child was born on september elizabeth leslie named for the queen had managed to be born on her majestys fortyninth birthday the queen insisted on serving as the babys godmother when she was christened four days later the frightened roman catholic priest dared not say no to the queen the baby received from her godmother a dozen silver goblets encrusted with aquamarines and engraved with the leslie coat of arms little bess had been born in the country house a month later without ever seeing london she set off home to scotland with her parents and her fourandahalfyearold brother who rode north on his own pony they crossed the border in a month it was early november but the day was mild and lovely cat and patrick rode on ahead of their train stopping on the crest of a hill the birches seemed more golden and the pines greener than anywhere else on earth below them the valley shimmered in the faint purple haze of late afternoon to the west was hermitage home to the earls of bothwell ahead of them lay jedburgh where they would shelter tonight my god said patrick is it my imagination or does even the air smell sweeter cat nodded and smiled up at him she had enjoyed the trip but her face radiated joy at coming home to scotland almost home sweetheart he said if the weather holds well be in glenkirk in another ten days he held out a hand she smiled again and took it my god he thought how she has changed i took a girl to england and i brought back a womana beautiful woman will ye be sorry to be away from london and court he asked her nay patrick im too glad to be home glenkirk will nae be as exciting after london but patrick theres edinburgh and the king will be seventeen next year and surely be coming into his own soon once he weds well hae our own court madame he roared i hae told ye well nae involve ourselves wi the stewarts they are nae to be trusted and forever in debt we dinna need them yell not wheedle me in this matter her lovely month was turning up at the corners in a very mischievous smile when the king comes into his own patrick i am going to court whether ye come wi me or not is yer concern i will remind ye my dearest lord that glenkirk house belongs to me i have nae furnished it at great personal expense to visit it for a month once every year or two as pleases you nor did i furnish it for our relations to use while i sit home at glenkirk adam has promised fiona that shell go to jamies court and ye can do no less for me so saying she kicked bana and cantered down into the purple valley the earl of glenkirk kicked his own horse and galloped off after his beautiful wayward wife part ii the king the king the king chapter james stewart sixth of his name and king of scotland lounged on his throne watching the dancers he followed one lady in particular catriona leslie countess of glenkirk she was partnered by the kings distant cousin patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk catriona leslie was the most beautiful woman at james court she was also reputed to be the most virtuous this was unfortunate because the king lusted for her and what james stewart wanted he got one way or another james stewart had not known his mother having been left behind when she fled to england he had been raised by a series of warring protestant nobles who used him as a pawn to further their own ambitions they believed they had taught him to hate his mother but here they had been outwitted by his old nurse nanny had adored mary stewart and when james tutor spoke vitriol against the unfortunate captive queen nanny had countered with her own version of the truth for the childs peace of mind it was fortunate that her stories had been more plausible than his tutors the little boy asked the old lady about the references to his mothers affairs and was told only that women were weak when it came to men he did not understand that until he was fourteen though he had long outgrown nanny she remained with him and saw to his comfort james guardians discovered it was cheaper to keep the old nurse than employ a bevy of housemaids nanny saw the young boys affections moving in a dangerous direction with the arrival of esmé stewart sieur daubigney from france fortunately esmé stewart was merely ambitious and nanny saw her laddie safely embarked upon his sexual career by introducing him to a pretty skilled diseasefree young whore the whores name was betty and she was honored to initiate her young king in the arts of lovemaking he proved an excellent pupil betty was a member of the old kirk and it amused her to outwit the pious hypocrites of the stem cold new kirk these men preached about the sins of the flesh on sunday morning and came masked to her door on sunday afternoon james too enjoyed outwitting bis guardians james was a stewart on both his dead parents sides and stewarts were quite sensual he discovered a world of delights and understood nannys comment about women being weak over men james liked women james stewart was twentythree and king tomorrow he would be married by proxy to a beautiful blond blueeyed danish princess named anna it would however be some weeks before he saw his sixteenyearold bride and consummated that marriage if he was to be married by proxy james reasoned then he must have his wedding night by proxy also the idea pleased him but no whore could substitute for his royal virgin bride it would not be fitting nor would it be kind to begin an affair with an impressionable young girl his gaze strayed again to catriona leslie who was laughing up at her husband yes the most virtuous woman at court would be a fitting proxy there were problems however he had twice approached catriona the first time she had thought him joking and teasingly reminded him that she was older than he was the second time she realized his serious intent and gently reminded him of her marriage vows she would not she told him firmly break them she loved her husband and would bring no shame to his name another man might have bowed and withdrawn gracefully but james stewart was not such a man he knew of course that he could go to patrick leslie and tell him he wanted his wife his cousin head of the smallest yet wealthiest branch of the leslies could be counted upon to do the correct thing and turn a blind eye while the king dallied with his wife james however liked his older cousin and saw no reason to hurt him the earl of glenkirk was a fiercely proud man if the king wanted his wife he would have to acquiese but he would never really be happy with cat again but if patrick leslie were out of the way then catriona could be made to comply it would be done secretly so as not to harm the ladys reputation or her husbands ego but it would be done james wanted a taste of that which had held patrick leslies unwavering interest for nine years he was going to have it the dancing ended and the courtiers hot with their efforts drank eagerly from the goblets of chilled wine passed by the servants james moved easily among them talking and laughing eventually he came to the leslies cousins he kissed cat on both cheeks so jamie tomorrow ye take a wife said the earl of glenkirk aye patrick though i do wish she were here rather than in denmark patience lad she will be here before ye know it and then will come times yell wish her back in denmark they all laughed and james said will ye and cat be my guests and stay here during the festivities i know yeve a house in town but id like to hae my family about me even bothwell is back in my good graces why thank ye jamie smiled patrick wed be honored wouldnt we sweetheart aye sire said cat we are most honored by yer kindness james moved on secretly exulting now he had her under his roof i the following day the kings marriage to princess anna of denmark was celebrated with much joy that night the earl of glenkirk left for melrose abbey on urgent business his countess after a delightful evening of feasting and dancing retired to her rooms ellen helped her undress and she then stepped into a small tub where the woman sponged her down with warm scented water dried and powdered she held up her arms so ellen could slip a seagreen silk nightgown over her climbing into bed she ordered ellen to bank the fire and bid her good night cat lay back on the plump pillows it was a big bed made bigger by glenkirks absence they had rarely been apart in the nine years of their marriage and she did not like being separated suddenly as she began to doze she heard a creaking noise she sat up just in time to see a hidden door by the fireplace swing open james stewart walked through it what are ye doing here she hissed at him i should think my dear that the answer to that would be obvious ill scream the castle down no my dear ye wont the scandal wouldna touch me i am the king ye nonetheless are a different proposition yer family would suffer badly if ye publicly refuse me i told ye i would nae be yer mistress jamie she strove to hide her fright she had not expected such persistence from him i dinna accept yer decision madame besides it is nae yers to make today i was wed by proxy tonight i intend consummating my marriage the same way and i have chosen ye to be my bride never ill never yield to ye ye hae no choice my dear he said triumphantly and stripped off his robe stand up and come here to me he commanded her no and if ye force me ill tell glenkirk her eyes were bright with unshed tears and her lovely mouth sulky in defiance she was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and her anger with him excited him more than any other woman ever had tell glenkirk he was amused if ye want cat ill tell him myself but remember one thing my dear patrick will forgie me i am his king hell nae forgie ye now come here to me the truth of his words horrified her if her proud lord knew that another man had lain with her hed cast her off the king had trapped her as neatly as a rabbit you bastard she swore at him laughing james replied nay love that rumor was settled before my birth he held out his hand forced she came to him her leafgreen eyes were blazing furiously james laughed softly again oh now she was going to fight him with her stubborn mind her body however would yield eventually there was plenty of time and he intended to go easily with her tonight remove the gown he said quietly and was pleased when she obeyed him without question standing back he viewed her with pleasure she had a wide wellpadded chest that moved downward into the most beautiful breasts he had ever seen lovely ivory globes with large darkpink nipples her waist was slender and long her full hips nicely rounded her legs long and shapely her tawny hair fell to her hips he could feel desire beginning to pound gods bones cousin yer beautiful to his surprise she blushed pink and james was frankly delighted it was true then she really had never known another man except patrick she really was the most virtuous woman at court he would see she was rewarded by making her a lady of his wifes bedchamber she would be an excellent influence taking her hand again he led her across the room to their bed picking her up he placed her on it the tempting triangle between her legs was plucked and pink as befitted a lady and at the top of the cleft sat a little black mole the mark of venus he murmured touching it he bent over and kissed the mole a great shudder ran through her and james smiled to himself he was going to take her quickly for once the deed was done her foolish resistance would crumble gently but firmly he parted her trembling thighs her eyes widened and she gasped in surprise when he gently pushed into her like most male stewarts james was overly endowed the suddenness of his attack made it impossible for cat to struggle so she decided to lie quietly while he satisfied his lust james however was too skilled a lover to allow passivity from his partner teasingly voluptuously he moved within her deliberately rousing cats passion and making it nearly impossible for her to resist him only a supreme effort on cats part helped her to lie still beneath him her hands were balled into fists by her sides by concentrating on the sharpness of her nails digging into her palms she could blot out enough of what he was doing to her to remain a nonparticipant discovering this the king said oh no my love and laughing drew her arms up over her head he held them there with one hand now his sensuous mouth found her fragrant but unresponsive lips his insistent tongue forced first those lips and then her teeth apart thrusting with skill she sobbed and another shudder shook her she was close to yielding for he had breached her defenses her lovely body used to regular lovemaking was simply not conditioned to resist pleasure he increased the tempo of his movement yield to me love he whispered insistently never but her voice was shaking the deed is done my love yield and take yer pleasure of me as i take my pleasure of ye she would not answer him but he could feel her fighting down the movement in her hips then it occurred to him what he must do loosing his hold on her hands he said put yer arms around me my love and he looked down into her leafgreen eyes they were glistening with tears if patrick walked into this room right now cat and found me planted in ye hed nae stop to ask if ye were resisting me or enjoying me dinna fight me any longer my love yer beautiful body aches for me nothing can change the fact that i already possess ye yield she still said nothing to him but her eyes closed and hot tears rolled silently down the sides of her face then her arms tightened around him and her hips arched to meet his every thrust victorious james stewart lost himself in the deliciousness of her surrender afterwards propped on one elbow he looked down on her but she closed her eyes and would not look back at him this is how ive always imagined ye he said to her his voice low yer eyelids purple wi exhaustion the lashes wet on yer cheeks yer body weak from love and yer mouth bruised wi my kisses he bent and kissed the nipples of her breasts her eyes flew open ill nae forgie ye this jamie stewart he smiled charmingly at her why of course ye will my sweet love of course ye will cradling her in the curve of one arm he began to fondle her soft breasts she tried to squirm away please sire yeve had yer pleasure wi me now find yer own bed why cat sweet his voice held genuine surprise surely ye dinna think that one taste was all i wanted nay my darling we hae the whole night ahead of us oh no jamie please no she began to struggle against him he held her fast and said regretfully my dear i had hoped ye would see reason now that our preliminary bout is over it will make no difference to patrick whether i hae ye once or a dozen times the simple fact that ive fucked ye will be enough i know yer no wanton my love but ye canna deny yer body responds to mine why do ye insist on fighting me i am gentle wi ye and i know i am a good lover why do ye continue to resist oh jamie she said softly i really believe ye dinna understand i hae never known any man but patrick before we were wed i resisted him but i loved him of course my body responds to ye he taught it to respond but now ye come and claim the droit du seigneur of me in bed my mind and body have always worked as one because i lay wi the man i love but i dinna love ye my lord i cannot help but resist ye yer very fortunate my lovely cousin said james stewart i hae never loved anyone i dinna ken what it really means i was raised by those who fed clothed disciplined and educated me i canna remember a kind word or a caress when i was a child the only person who ever showed me any tenderness was my old nurse then im truely sorry for ye jamie for to really love is to live life to its fullest yer problem is that yeve never had anyone of yer own when the little queen comes home to scotland she will be yers alone and when the bairns comewhy jamie before ye know it yell hae a whole big family to love and be loved by thank ye cat ye gie me hope he smiled at her ye really do belong at court my love ye know what to say to yer king i do look forward to the arrival of my queen but now gently he pushed cat back against the pillows and finding her mouth kissed her with a practiced skill her first reaction was to struggle from his clutches then suddenly she realized the king was right if patrick arrived home now his reaction to her predicament whether she resisted or cooperated would be the same anger at her her body was in real pain from resisting i dinna love this man she thought but i can stand no more of this he stopped kissing her and was looking down at her her eyes met his ill never love ye jamie and i am ashamed of what ye are making me do but i yield to ye my liege until the queen comes he countered quickly my lord yell destroy my marriage ye canna hide from patrick the fact that yer laying wi me i can if he isna here no man in his right mind could taste of yer sweetness and stay but one night i will send patrick to denmark wi a group of nobles to escort the queen home our liaison will be kept secret from the court yer reputation will remain intact yer husbands pride willna suffer she knew she must be satisfied with that she could argue no more with him thank ye my lord she whispered in answer the king bent his head and began kissing her quivering body starting with the pounding pulse in her slender throat he moved his lips to her chest her taut breasts with their sharp pointed tips her rounded belly the mole at the top of her cleft suddenly he turned her over and took her in a way that patrick leslie never had she gasped in shock and heard the king mutter thickly heres one place glenkirks nae been before me his hands cruelly crushed her breasts to her amazement he brought them to a quick climax they lay quietly side by side as their breathing returned to normal i hope said james stewart that the queen does nae arrive too quickly my love ye are magnificent no wonder patrick hasna strayed all these years her voice was trembling patrick never did what ye just did tome i know he said ye were a virgin there but ye liked it didnt ye cat no he laughed aye ye did glenkirks used ye gently my love ill teach ye many things including how to please me he rose and poured them each a goblet of wine and added more wood to the fire soon yer patrick should return from melrose abbey within the week hell be on his way with some others to meet my bride and escort her home dinna look so sad my love we hae a lovely month or two ahead of us chapter the countess of glenkirk sat quietly before her mirror while ellen brushed her thick honeycolored hair she wore only her white silk petticoat and a lownecked underblouse cat leslie was frightened and she did not know what to do patrick was she knew within the palace giving his report to the king when he finally came to their apartment would he notice anything different she prayed he wouldnt since the twentieth of augusta week agojames stewart had been sleeping with her god knew she hadnt encouraged him in fact after the first night she had fled the palace for her townhouse he had quietly but firmly ordered her return desperate she had confided in her favorite brotherinlaw adam leslie listened shaking his head he said theres no help for it cat what the king wants he takes and he happens to want ye if i went home to glenkirk adam surely he wouldnt pursue me there adam leslie was truly sorry for cat she was willful and stubborn but she loved patrick the agony she was enduring was unfair nevertheless there was no help for it ye canna leave court wiout jamies permission cat ye know that for a brief moment she looked defiant and adam spoke cruelly ye canna endanger the leslies cat because it doesna suit ye to be the kings mistress hes chosen ye and hes even been kind enough to agree to keep yer liaison secret if ye defy him hell ruin us god woman yer no virgin bargaining a good price for yer maidenhead what jamie wants has already been well used by glenkirk briefly cat hated adam yell not tell patrick nay cat dinna fear he said more kindly he hesitated cat thank ye for confiding in me im truly sorry lass that i canna help ye but im here should ye need to talk again she nodded does anyone else know only ellen she answered him faithful ellen vacillated between her mistresss agony and her own pride that cat was exquisite enough to attract the king if ye dinna put a smile on yer face he will wonder whats wrong the woman said sharply cat jumped oh god ellie i feel so dirty ellen put down the brush kneeling before her lady she looked up and spoke what is done is done madame stop being so selfish yer thinking only of yerself think of the earl instead my baby think of the family of yer own bairns if ye want peace in yer life this episode must be secret and unless ye pull yerself together it wont be two tears slipped down the countess face ellen reached up and brushed them away the king may touch yer body my lady but he can nae touch yer soul she said quietly how did ye get so wise cat asked but before ellen could answer the door burst open and patrick leslie entered cat leaped to her feet and flung herself into his arms ellen discreetly withdrew as the earl found his wifes mouth kissing her deeply his arms tightened about her until she cried out patrick i canna breathe he swept her up and deposited her on the bed she watched as he drew off his boots and outer clothing and then stretched out next to her on their bed he pulled her into his arms pushed her blouse down and kissed her lovely breasts i missed ye terribly sweetheart he murmured from the warmth of her she cradled him against her grateful he was back and hoping he might save her from the further attentions of the king he raised his head up what were ye dressing for he asked another damned masque in honor of the danish match she answered i think considering ive been away that jamie might not miss us he pushed her petticoats up past her thighs a smile lit her face and she held out her arms to him but james stewart did miss them i dinna see glenkirk and his wife he said casually to his cousin the earl of bothwell he came back from melrose today im nae surprised jamie said bothwell i imagine that glenkirk has taken his wife to bed if she were mine and i had been away from her a week thats what i would do he grinned wickedly at the king the most virtuous woman at court a pity eh majesty considering the morals of most of the women at this court said the king sharply i think lady leslie is refreshing i intend making her a lady of my wifes bedchamber oh ho thought bothwell cousin jamie is interested in our beautiful countess but he hides his lust nicely ill wager that only i who know him so well have spotted it the earl chuckled to himself because james was affectionate with those about him and these were mostly males he was thought to be homosexual the plain truth of the matter was that the king having been surrounded by men since his infancy gave his affections where he could stewarts were loving creatures until recently there had been no suitable women for the king to fix his attentions on james had in a burst of romanticism willed himself half in love with his blond bride but bothwell knew that the king needed someone right now if that someone was the countess of glenkirk then well and good she was neither ambitious nor a schemer however the earl did not think the king stood a chance the lady seemed quite content with her dull but loving lord a pity really cat leslie was a gorgeous creature obviously made for love bothwell couldnt help but wonder if glenkirk had awakened her completely james endured the evening when he could leave without causing undue comment he did so and suffered himself to be put ceremoniously to bed he then called his chamberboy to him the lad was invaluable being mute but not deaf his name was barra and he was privy to all the kings secrets ill be in the secret passageway said the king i am locking the bedroom door from my side have ye yer key barra held his up good said the king dinna let anyone disturb me if theres an emergency you come after me alone the boy nodded wisely and left the room to keep watch outside james door locking the door from inside james walked to the fireplace and touched a small carving on its side he took a lighted candle from the mantel sconce counted off six paces pushed the wall and walked through the opening into the passage he waited until the door had swung shut behind him and then moved quickly through the secret passageway until he came to his destination he placed his candle in a holder high on the wall lifting a small flap he peered into the room beyond patrick leslie stood naked by the table pouring out two goblets of wine god thought james he is handsome and well hung toothough not quite as well as i am the king watched as the earl moved back to the rumpled bed cat lay naked lazily she reached up for the goblet patrick sprawled next to her jesu sweetheart i hate being away from ye the earl said then lets go home patrick ye were right when ye said we should nae involve ourselves wi the stewarts why hinny i thought ye were enjoying yerself i was but these people who live at court and feed off it frighten me i want to go home wi ye now we canna sweetheart i didna tell ye because i didna want our reunion spoiled but jamie has asked me to go to denmark wi a group of nobles to escort the little queen home i could nae refuse him and we leave in a week cat swore she knew the king had planned to send her husband off but she had not expected him to act so quickly and had hoped she could foil the royal plans yer sending me home patrick arent ye i wanted to hinny but the king has asked that ye remain at court he wants ye to be a lady of his wifes bedchamber he has a high regard for ye sweetheart trapped she was again trapped by james stewart the earl put down his goblet and pulling cat under him kissed her hungrily i hae only a few days madame he said before i must leave ye it will be two months or more before we see each other again his big hands caressed her breasts her hips her thighs cat needed no encouragement she yielded eagerly to her husband unaware that the king himself was watching them james could not tear his eyes away from the scene below him when the figures reached their simultaneous climax james felt the hardness in his own groin break and the sticky fluid spurt down his leg ill nae put up wi this for a week he thought the delegation to denmark will leave as soon as i can arrange it using the pose of an eager bridegroom james waved his nobles off three days later cat knew why her husband had been torn from her early and was furious the eral of bothwell suspected and laughed to himself over the kings eagerness suspecting that she would be angry with him james stayed away from his reluctant mistress for two days on the third day however barra shyly pressed a rose on the countess tiring woman it was the signal for james to come that night ellen told her mistress ill nae receive him shouted cat furiously be silent ellen snapped do ye want the whole world to know cat began to weep uncontrollably and ellen sensing disaster sent a leslie servant running to fetch adam by the time he arrived ellen had already poured several drams of whisky into her mistress to calm her down i am going to kill myself the countess announced dramatically fine said adam leslie twill be far less of a scandal than if ye openly refuse the kings attentions yed let me do it wouldnt ye adam have ye no feelings for patrick who loves ye tis because i love my brother ive come how do ye think hed feel to return from denmark to discover all he possesses forfeit to the crown including the wife he adores christ cat the kings already had ye why this sudden attack of nerves i dinna want to be any mans whore she saidtis my body and i should hae some rights over it well ye dont said adam angrily slamming his hand against the side of the chair ye belong to the leslies and it is up to ye to do what is best for the family dammit cat i am nae wiout feeling i hate the thought of jamie stewart lying wi my brothers wife but ye know that if the king had gone straight to patrick and asked for ye patrick would hae said yea this way at least he need not know do yer duty by the leslies cat he did not understand at all the whisky had calmed cat somewhat and she knew she had no choice the king would use her as he wished im all right now adam she reassured him i dinna know what came over me i suppose it is because i miss patrick weve never been separated ye know he nodded relieved then ill be on my way home he smiled at her thank god she wasnt going to cause any further fuss gie my love to fiona cat said softly then unable to resist she added and best ye keep from court adam lest jamie decides to change his luck yer wife would have to do her duty by the family ye know adam hastily left his sisterinlaw her mocking laughter ringing in his ears chapter the whisky had made her slightly drunk what time is it she asked ellen past one came the reply i shall sleep till just before the evening meal wake me then ill be back here at ten have a bath ready for me put fresh linens on the bed and be sure there is plenty of wood for the fire i want wine both red and white and fruit and cheese in the cabinet and marchpane the king is mad for marchpane at eleven that evening the king entered the countess of glenkirks bedroom through the secret passage she rose from the bed and walked slowly across the room to him stand still she stopped and james feasted his eyes on his unwilling mistress her nightgown was exquisite and had obviously been designed with seduction in mind of palegreen silk it had long flowing sleeves and a deep v neckline the bodice appeared to have been painted on molding her glorious breasts and tiny waist the skirt rippled with hundreds of tiny pleats and he could see the pearly sheen of her hips and legs shiering through the silk her tawny hair was piled at the top of her head and secured with several small gilt and pearl pins she stared back at him proudly she was so beautiful that he was almost afraid to touch her but then desire overcame awe and he drew cat into his arms his amber eyes never left her leafgreen ones and when his arms closed tightly around her he could feel her trembling slightly and was pleased by what he believed was her awe of him he held her thus imprisoned for what seemed a lifetime and then he bent and his mouth captured hers reaching up he pulled the gilt pins from her hair and it tumbled down over her shoulders in a perfumed cloud he pulled at the thin silk ribbon at her waist and the gown opened easily he watched as it slid to the floor she turned without speaking walked to the bed and got into it james forced himself to disrobe slowly but once in bed with her he did not think he could wait she knew it yet she held him off i am nae a whore to be quickly fucked jamie so ye can talk i thought ye were angry wi me i am twas nae kind of ye to send patrick away so quickly my dear cat for three nights i stood in that damned passage and watched ye and yer husband make love i could stand it no longer would ye rather i came through the door and asked yer husband to move over stunned she could not answer that anyone else had partaken of her private moments with patrick infuriated her i hae a large score to settle wi ye james stewart and i intend to settle it one day she thought bitterly the kings mouth closed over the nipple of her breast and sucked hungrily his hand was between her legs seeking her soft sensitive secret flesh with exquisite expertise he caressed her his fingers teasing with unbearable gentleness within minutes he had reduced her to a writhing passion she had wanted to punish with coldness but as her own desire grew she suddenly realized that the greatest harm she could inflict on james was to be the most voluptuous female he would ever encounter she would ruin him for other women she knew that once young anna of denmark arrived in scotland james would devote himself to her above all he wanted a wife who belonged to him alone and he wanted a family he was the kind of man who couldnt jeopardize all that however a teenaged virgin would hardly compare favorably with a woman as experienced as cat was she was no wanton but patrick had taught her well and cat was by nature a sensuous woman she would now use her experience to revenge herself on james stewart shifting her lovely body she slid under the king and wound her arms about his neck jamie she whispered huskily love me jamie hinny he could scarcely believe his ears but when he looked down at her he saw shining eyes and an inviting mouth the king didnt question his good fortune he took possession of the lips offered him they were soft and yielding and they drove him to a frenzy her thighs opened and she arched her body to meet his downward thrust her legs wrapped tightly about him and each time he drove within her her little tongue darted within his mouth his excitement was fierce and he was unable to control himself yet within minutes as she moved voluptuously beneath him he grew hard again with lust for her she whispered his name over and over again like a litany he was mad with passion for her but this time he held himself in check until she could find her heaven too exhausted they lay panting on the bed finally he spoke ye frighten me cat ye canna be human for no woman can love like ye have just loved me but i can my lord did i not please ye aye love ye pleased me verra much did ye use witchcraft cat remembered that james was terribly superstitious she bit back her laughter nay my lord i used only the sorcery of my body standing she stretched tall and then walked over to the cabinet red or white my lord red he said and she poured out two crystal goblets of the ruby wine carrying them back to the bed she handed him one sipping it thoughtfully he asked her did patrick teach ye to make love like that aye she answered him quietly yeve never known any other men have ye nay jamie none i am by birth a hay of greyhaven our home is quite isolated and other than my brothers and my hay and leslie cousins i had no contact with the world i came to patrick a virgin is yer family large i hae four brothersone older three youngerand my parents are both living yer fortunate my sweet sighed the king they are but part of my family she reminded him dinna forget i have a husband and six children she looked directly at james when the queen arrives from denmark your majesty i am going home to glenkirk and to my children ye may be the king but ill nae allow ye to destroy my marriage i love patrick leslie and i love our bairns if i did not i would hae sooner killed myself than submit to another mans lust he caught a handful of her hair and pulled her down to him yet madame ye respond to my lovemaking and ye will continue to respond as long as it pleases me i respond she answered defiantly because patrick taught my body to respond are all the leslies such paragons in bed he asked sarcastically according to their wives and the lasses in our district they are my cousin fiona was an extremely restless woman until she married my lords brother adam leslie since then she has nae strayed once fiona leslie mused the king aye sultry wi auburn hair gray eyes and skin like ivory satin ive seen the wench but i didna realize she was yer relative perhaps some evening i may entertain the two of ye am i not woman enough for ye jamie pushing him back onto the pillows she kissed him expertly and her hand slid between his legs he quickly grew hard in the silky warmth of her skilled caresses but before he could move to mount her she took the initiative and mounted him instead triumphantly she looked down into his surprised face and before he could stop her she began to ride him as one would ride a horse her round knees digging into him no woman had ever done this to james stewart shocked he struggled beneath her she laughed mocking him how do ye like being forced my lord king he could not escape the iron grip of the warm thighs that gripped him to his shame and horror he felt himself pouring his seed in furious spurts into her she collapsed on top of him angrily he rolled over forcing her underneath him her eyes were sparkling wickedly and her mouth was laughing slapping her several times he was amazed to feel his desire quickening again so he thrust brutally into her making her cry out in pain the knowledge that he was hurting her seemed to soothe him afterwards he spoke quietly to her yer the most exciting woman i hae ever lain wi catriona leslie but if ye ever do to me again what ye did this evening ill beat ye black and blue i am nae a maid to be used in such a fashion i ask yer majestys pardon she said softly but somehow he felt her voice wasnt contrite enough sometimes she continued patrick likes me to love in that fashion he says it excites him to play wi my breasts while we if i want to fuck ye and play wi yer tits i can love ye in the greek fashion he interrupted her in fact i hae a mind to do it now no jamie damn not that please i hate it noooo now it was the kings turn to laugh he wanted to punish her further and this was the way she would feel the shame he had felt forcing her over onto her stomach he took her quickly cruelly bruising the lovely breasts he was pleased as she wept and struggled to escape him she was much subdued when he had finished with her and james felt he had gained mastery over her again they slept for a few hours then roused by the sight of his naked tousled and sleepy mistress the king took her again this time he was gentle he smiled down at her afterwards and said ill be late this evening my pet closer to midnight after taking a piece of marchpane from the plate on the nightstand he put on his dressing gown and disappeared through the passage door cat fell back onto the pillows she was exhausted her body felt battered and bruised and she wasnt sure she would be able to walk butand she smiled as she fell asleepif she could keep up the pace james would soon have memories to burn his brain forever no other woman would ever satisfy him that was to be her revenge it did not occur to her that james simply might not let her go several hours later ellen looked in on her mistress what she saw decided her course of action the countess is unwell this morning she told the two undermaids here is a silver piece between ye theres a fair just outside the city ye may go but be back by early afternoon ellen locked the doors of the apartment and returning to cats bedroom sat down with her knitting cat awoke several hours after noon what time is it she demanded past two good god my lady what did he do to ye everything said cat wearily where are silis and una i sent them off when i saw the condition ye were in theyll be back soon i want a tub a hot hot tub ye canna go on like this each night scolded ellen cat laughed ruefully nay i cant dinna fear ellie last night the king and i were but gauging each other now he has my measure and i hae his an hour and a half later the countess of glenkirk was seen riding outside the city accompanied by six of her menatarms she was vastly admired by the common folk who knowing her reputation as the virtuous countess pointed her out to their daughters as an example throughout the late summer and early autumn catriona adorned james court there was not a nobleman young or old who did not desire her lady leslie did not succumb she remained warm charming gracious wittyand unobtainable adam leslie was frank in admiration no one he said to her no one would ever know yer sleeping wi the king patrick would be proud of ye i doubt it she answered him dryly by the way best to keep an eye on fiona jamie referred to her as a sultry wench i think he rather fancies her cat enjoyed adams discomfiture how long until the little queen arrives he asked cat grew serious she set out once but the storms hae been unusually fierce i understand her ship was forced into oslo and there she waits until the sea calms cat lowered her voice there is talk of witchcraft already several women hae been questioned jamie grows anxious i would nae be surprised to see him go to fetch her himself leave scotland asked adam incredulously why let him send the high admiral for her bothwell will nae go he says that all the fines jamie has imposed on him during their last quarrel hae impoverished him and he has nae the money for such an expedition adam laughed he has nerve the border lord to brave his royal cousins anger again do ye really think james will go aye after all he wants his wife not someone elses cat smiled she was responsible for the kings mood for ten weeks now he had been sharing her bed for the first time in his sad life his nights were filled with warmth and even a kind of security the woman who slept with him was kind and tender and generous his marriage bed would be just as delightful she assured him too there would be the pleasant duty of siring children the danish royal family was large and surely queen anna would prove fruitful why by this time next year james could be a father the more cat talked the more eager james stewart became to be with his bride when he could stand it no longer the king arranged his government to run smoothly in his absence leaving as regent his cousin francis stewarthepburn the earl of bothwell james departed leith for oslo on october luck was with him the breezes were fresh the skies bright blue and the seas easy he reached norway quickly with the king away there was no point in her staying at court so the countess of glenkirk made plans to go home james had however exacted a promise from her that she would return when he brought his queen home she had agreed believing she would be safe from his attentions with the queen in residence she longed for patrick and wondered if he were as lonely as she chapter when king james reached oslo in early november he was met by the nobles he had sent to accompany the queen home they escorted their impatient king to the house where the danish princess was staying a startled servant answered the thundering knocks and james stewart swept in demanding to see his bride directed to a secondfloor salon the king of scotland ran lightly up the stairs bursting in he cried out annie luv tis yer jamie gie us a kiss lass i hae coom to take ye hame to scotland the startled princess who had worked very hard to learn english could hardly understand the wild man before her a look of obvious distaste on her face she backed away then the earl of glenkirk stepped forward and in slow unaccented english said to her your royal highness may i have the honor to present his gracious majesty king james of scotland the princess curtsied prettily james stewart was immediately enchanted she was even prettier than her portrait anna of denmark was slightly shorter than the king with silky yellow hair skyblue eyes and a pinkandwhite complexion she had a little cleft in her chin and when she smiled two fetching dimples peeped out from either side of her rosebud mouth she was all youth and innocence and james instantly remembered all the things cat had promised him marriage would be his majesty would like to give you a kiss of welcome your highness continued the earl anna of denmark did not even look at the king instead she spoke directly to glenkirk please tell his majesty that danish ladies of good breeding do not kiss gentlemen before they are married to them curtsying again to the assembled group the princess signaled to her ladies and left the salon openmouthed the king watched her go then he swore jesu what manner of ice maiden hae i been contracted to wed his courtiers many of whom had already learned about the promiscuity of danish ladies dared not say a word finally patrick leslie spoke up shes really a nice little lass cousin but ye took her unawares i think she was probably embarrassed and maidenshy undoubtedly she wished to meet ye in fine array rather than the simple gown she was wearing as a married man of many years i can tell ye women put great store by their appearance especially at a first meeting the other courtiers murmured their agreement somewhat mollified james said cat sends ye her love patrick i hae given her permission to go home to glenkirk until we return to scotland james was escorted away by danish court officials to be housed in another building until after his wedding the earl of glenkirk meanwhile sought one of the princesss ladies and told her to dress her mistress elegantly for her next meeting with the king they had been married by proxy on august they were now formally and officially married by a presbyterian minister who had come with the king from scotland the wedding took place on november in a local church a feast was held for scots and danish nobles the new queen of scotland loved dancing and parties above all things the evening was gay and so were the queens ladies one of them a mistress christina anders had singled out the earl of glenkirk from the first she had seen of him in early september she had determined to have him that he was married made no difference to her so was she and to her third husband a boy of twelve christina anders was seventeen she was petite with silvergilt hair and dark sapphire eyes she was a sea goddess in miniature she had been married at ten to an old count who liked little girls widowed at thirteen she was wed to a middleaged man who enjoyed deflowering virgins christina was still a virgin when her second husband was murdered by an angry peasant christina quickly married herself to his heir an elevenyearold boy this left her free to pursue her own life financially secure she had left her husband alone on his estate with his tutor and come to copenhagen to renew her friendship with princess anna a childhood playmate naturally when anna was betrothed to the king of scotland she asked her old friend to be one of her ladies it would have been unthinkable for christina to refuse though several men had sought christina as a mistress she refused any permanent liaison she enjoyed her freedom then too her sexual preferences were sophisticated the earl of glenkirk was not unaware of mistress anders interest since his marriage he had not strayed from his lovely wifes bed now however he faced a long cold winter without her patrick leslie loved his wife but he was no saint and the woman who was so obviously offering herself was very tempting christina had gone out of her way to look charming at the royal wedding she wore midnightblue velvet so her hair looked as silver as possible and her skin its whitest the more she danced the pinker her cheeks became she pointedly ignored the earl of glenkirk much to his amusement he might have played a harder game with her but he had decided to bed her that night if she proved a disappointment he could easily dismiss her without any hard feelings blaming the wedding excitement for his lapse on the other hand it could be the beginning of a delightful affair calculating carefully he moved into the figure and when the dance stopped several minutes later christina anders found herself opposite patrick leslie clamping an arm about her waist he looked down and asked wine madame she nodded and he brought it tonight he asked bluntly caught unawares she nodded mutely what time eleven she said softly smiling he bowed and walked away christina sat sipping her wine it had been so easy she was sorry that she had no rooms of her own in which to entertain him the queens maids of honor slept dormitoryfashion near their mistress once the queen had been put to bed she would be free to go to him her heart beat faster his manner told her that he would be a masterful lover margaret olson approached her the scots stallion grows impatient to mount his mare she said softly its time to put the queen to bed christina laughed you are such a bitch mag all right but lets hurry i have a rendezvous with lord leslie tonight she smiled proudly hes a big handsome thing said margaret i cannot decide who to sleep with both lord home and lord grey have asked me try one this week and the other next soon theyll all be going back to scotland and well be left to return home i wont said margaret olson i am going with the queen she asked me a few minutes ago and she is going to ask you too be nice to your lover if you want to keep him when we go to scotland he has a wife there margaret i know i have heard the men speak of her they say she is beautiful and headstrong they call her the virtuous countess that information should be of some help to you my dear giggling the two maids of honor hurried to their mistresss side with a flurry of flying skirts queen anna and her ladies fled the hall pursued by a group of shouting young men gaining the safety of the royal apartments they collapsed laughing madly countess olafson who was at twentyfour the oldest of the queens ladies tried to bring about some order ladies ladies his majesty will soon be here and there is much to do karen you keep watch outside the door and tell us when the king is coming inge and olga see to the bed margaret and christina you two help me undress her majesty they hurried to prepare the room and the young queen for her eager bridegroom the scented sheets were warmed the queen undressed and wrapped in a lovely white silk nightgown embroidered in silver and gold thread while margaret and christina put the queens wedding gown away countess olafson sat the girl down and brushed her long yellowblond hair suddenly mistress karen burst into the room theyre coming your majesty the king and his men are coming the queen was hurried into the bed she sat plump pillows at her back her blond hair unbound looking flushed and a bit afraid the door flew open and the king was halfshoved halfcarried into the room by the boisterous scots and danish noblemen yer majesty his majesty said drunk lord grey look gentlemen said james stewart triumphantly my sweet annie awaits me in our bed as a good wife should does this not portend a happy marriage for us the queens ladies giggled and the kings gentlemen gently hustled him behind a screen where they undressed him and put a silk nightshirt on him they helped him into the bed and he sat next to his young queen while a servant passed wine to the assembled and health was drunk to their majesties from silver goblets at last with much goodnatured joking and laughing the courtiers left james and anna to their pleasure in the silence that followed the king turned to his wife and said now madame i should like that kiss i asked ye for three and a half weeks ago shyly anna lifted her chaste lips to her husband touching them with his own he gradually increased the pressure forcing her back onto the pillows he opened her nightgown and gazed with pleasure at the fresh virgin body that belonged to him alone she murmured a faint protest as he kissed and caressed her as his desire mounted anna lay quietly acquiescent her blue eyes closed actually she liked what james was doing to her and she liked the delicious tingly feelings that were racing up and down her spine and fluttering inside her she wondered if there was something she could do that would make james feel as good as she felt she would ask him later on when she knew him better sitting her up he pulled her nightgown over head and tossed it on the floor he stood and yanked his own nightshirt off annas eyes widened in shock between her husbands legs was a mass of reddish fur and sticking out from the middle of that fur a great live tiling that bobbed up and down and pointed straight at her shrieking she shrank back covering her eyes with her hands james looked surprised ive nae stuck it in ye yet annie luv stick it in me she quavered why james looked faintly annoyed did no one speak to ye about a wifes duties annie i was told i must submit to my lord in all things she whispered he looked relieved thats right luv ye must submit to me in all things now this he said grasping his maleness is my manroot and between yer legs is a sweet little hole where i shall put it yell like it annie i promise twill feel so good the king had never had a virgin but his lust was hot and he had no intention of allowing this foolish girl to deny him will it hurt me she asked him for somewhere in the dim recesses of her mind she remembered her older sisters talking and there was something she couldnt quite put her finger on now aye he answered her matteroffactly but only the first time luvie no she said i dont like to hurt and i dont want you to stick me with that ugly thing she pointed at him and shuddered james was stymied tis a husbands right he protested her rosebud mouth pouted no she repeated firmly james stewarts eyes grew crafty very well my sweet he said getting back into the bed well just kiss and cuddle a bit then yes i like that the little queen answered him happily james drew his wife into his arms kissing her deeply he began to caress her expertly until she was squirming with uncontrolled excitement before she realized what was happening he mounted her and guiding himself pushed into her gasping she struggled beneath him bucking her body so as to throw him off she succeeded only in driving him further into her suddenly he drew back and plunged deep anna screamed in genuine pain but james covered her mouth with his and kept up the rhythmic movement ignoring the warm trickle that flowed down the insides of her thighs as the pain eased anna felt herself begin to enjoy what was happening to her she was still angry with her husband for deceiving her then suddenly the body laboring over her stiffened jerked several times and collapsed anna felt strangely unhappy in the silence that followed the clock on the mantel struck eleven at the other end of the house in the apartments of the earl of glenkirk there were fires in both the anteroom and the bedroom patrick leslie stood before the anteroom fireplace wondering if he had done the right thing in encouraging mistress anders guiltily he realized that a good whore would have served his purposes but when he heard the door open behind him and turned to see her he was glad he had asked her come in mistress anders she was wearing the same dress she had worn earlier and she was even lovelier by firelight will ye join me in a goblet of wine my dear i hae a lovely whitedelicate and sweet his eyes caressed her warmly thank you my lord she said in a soft voice and stood by his chair looking into the fire he poured the wine handing the goblet to her he watched as she drained it the earl sat down in his chair and reaching up pulled christina into his lap and kissed her dinna be shy wi me little cairi he said what is it you call me my lord she asked him cairi the gaelic for christina is cairistiona cairi simply means wee christina and yer a wee bit of a thing she snuggled into his lap how old are ye he asked her seventeen my lord jesu i am thirtyseven i could be yer father but you are not patrick she said pressing herself against him pulling his head down she kissed him passionately i came to have you make love to me standing up she slowly undid her dark velvet dress next came her snowy petticoats silk underblouse and beribboned busk she stepped out of them wearing only dark silk stockings upon which were embroidered tiny gold butterflies she was unbelievably exciting smiling slowly he stood up and followed her lead until he stood tall and naked above her she looked up at him and ordered take off my stockings kneeling he slowly rolled them down one at a time and then slipped each one off its small slim foot the perfume of her body drove him nearly mad she had anticipated this when earlier she had stroked musk on her freshly washed skin still kneeling he pulled her down to the floor in front of the fireplace christina spread her legs wide and held out her arms to receive him she was warm and sweet and experienced and he was immensely pleased the woman beneath him moved smoothly and he allowed her release twice before taking his own he rolled off her and they lay relaxed before the fire you think i am overbold she said quietly in her low husky voice but i wanted you patrick leslie i have never been any mans mistress but i want to be yours why me he was flattered but he was also no fool because i want you and because for once in my life i should like to have a normal relationship with a man my first husband was an old man who could not perform in a normal manner my second husband having deflowered me was no longer interested my third is a child and i am free to do as i choose i choose to become your mistress only while i am here said the earl when i return home my dear yell cease to exist for me i may sleep wi ye now but make no mistake little cairi i love my wife i agree to those terms patrick and now as it is damnably cold on this floor may we please get into bed he stood and scooping her up walked into the bedroom and put her into the bed i feared a long cold winter cairi now though it will still be long it will nae be cold he said he climbed into bed with her chapter for the first time in her married life catriona leslie was really on her own she closed her edinburgh house telling mrs kerr that she would return when the court reconvened to the horror of glenkirks captainatarms she planned on riding home immediately without a proper escort well all be murdered on the road sure as hell grumbled conall moreleslie five gold pieces we make it safely she laughed jesu madame the earl will skin me if anything happens to ye leave her be snapped his sister ellen she needs to go home for whether or not she realizes it she gains strength from glenkirk there is little likelihood of the earl returning before spring and she will be less lonely among her bairns they did not however travel poorly escorted learning of her plans francis stewarthepburn the earl of bothwell offered to escort her himself she could hardly turn down james stewarts favorite cousin and regent of scotland francis stewarthepburn was a tall handsome man with dark auburn hair an elegantly barbered short beard and piercing blue eyes he was an educated man unfortunately born in advance of his proper time his amazing fund of knowledge and his many scientific experiments terrified the superstitiouseducated and uneducated alike though he alternated between new and old kirk he was not a particularly religious man too sad women trying to bring excitement into their lives by playing at witchcraft had sometimes named lord bothwell as their leader francis hepburn was therefore whispered to be a warlock he was not but rumors often persist cat knew the rumor to be nonsense but it amused francis hepburns macabre sense of humor not to deny it besides it terrified his cousin james who alternated between love and hate for francis for some reason the king brought out the devil in bothwell although francis was fond of his cousin as one might be fond of a clumsy hunting dog there were times when he simply could not resist playing on the kings absurd fears james admired francis and would have given anything to be like his tall assured cousin consequently in an attempt to impress the earl of bothwell james had told him of his affair with the countess of glenkirk though he congratulated his cousin on his good fortune francis was shocked he himself had loved many women married and unmarried but he had never forced one as the king was forcing glenkirks wife that she was being forced he knew instinctively for he was sensitive to people and though she tried to appear her old self he saw the faint darkness beneath her eyes and heard the hollow tone in her laughter gallantly he set out to become her friend and confidant and he did but something else happened that francis hepburn had not planned on he fell in love with the countess of glenkirk a state he was forced to hide from her and from his jealous royal cousin as well cat had never had a man for a friend but she enjoyed francis hepburns companionship greatly he was a font of knowledge and cat rarely found anyone learned to talk with since everyone assumed their relations were chaste the court thought the relationship eccentric all laughed to see the greatest rake at court and the most beautiful woman enjoying intellectual discussions the earl of bothwells lineage was an interesting one his father had been john stewart prior of coldingham an illegitimate son of james vwhose daughter mary queen of scots began spelling her surname stuart a spelling that eventually prevailed in the royal line francis and james stewart shared the same grandfather the earls mother had been lady janet hepburn only sister to the last earl of bothwell james hepburn who was mary stewarts third husband james hepburn left no legitimate issue and his title and estates had gone to his nephew francis who added his uncles last name to his own as a gesture of respect francis hepburns father had died when he was scarcely more than a baby francis had only an illegitimate brother and sister his mother remarried and he was ignored in early childhood and then shipped off to be educated in france and italy he had returned home to scotland in his teens an elegant selfassured educated man he was quickly married to lady margaret douglas daughter of the powerful earl of angus lady margaret was a widow with a son and slightly older than francis stewarthepburn she did not like her second husband and he did not like her theirs was a marriage of convenience and they dutifully sired children to maintain the line but between them there was not a bit of warmth margaret douglas was relieved that her sensuous oversexed husband sought other beds she did not want him in hers the earl of bothwell with a troop of fifty wild borderers escorted the countess of glerikirk home conall was not sure he approved but his ladys safe journey was what mattered cat insisted that bothwell stay at glenkirk a few days and though he meant to stay but three or four he ended up staying through twelfth night since the dowager countess had been a cousin to his father he was considered a cousin himself and treated as a member of the family the glenkirk children called him uncle francis the boys following at his heels like admiring puppies and the little girls flirting outrageously with him bothwell adored it his own children had been taught by their mother to give their loyalty and obedience to her alone and he felt no kinship with them even glenkirks younger brothers treated him with a rough camaraderie and called him cousin the men hunted wenched diced and drank with him it was the closest thing he had ever had to a real family and he loved it when he finally left on the day after colin leslies sixth birthday it was with great regret but he had been left in charge of scotland and the time for selfindulgence was over bothwell was above all things a disciplined man he left with cat a small damascussteel sword with an exquisite openwork handle of florentine gold scattered with tiny semiprecious stones for your eldest boys birthday next month he said oh francis its marvelous jamie will love it though i know hed rather ye were here i wish i could be but ive indulged myself long enough cat cheer up my darling the winter will go quickly and patrick will soon be home james has insisted that i come back to court when he brings the queen home she said frowning i told glenkirk i would hae no more bairns but francis i swear i am going to do my damnedest to get wi child when my lord comes home the only way ill escape james stewarts attentions is to be safe at glenkirk but ill nae get permission unless i am big in the belly francis hepburn kissed her lightly and rode away to a long and lonely winter and it was a snowy gray cold depressing winter had cat not loved her children she would have gone mad but she did and their company saved her james leslie celebrated his twelfth birthday and if he was disappointed that his father seemed to have forgotten him francis hepburns gift made up for it they had had no word from patrick in months and though cat knew he was safe she missed him terribly the nights were the worst it was now seven months since she had seen him alone in their big bed she wept bitterly and swore to herself that when he came home she would obey him and not ever return to court he had been right not to want to involve them with the royal stewarts what had it gained them separation and shame spring came a lovely early warm spring the hawthorn and pussy willow were in bloom the hillsides around glenkirk sprouted in yellow and white and easter sunday was sunny the glenkirk courier who had been with the earl in denmark arrived bearing a pouchful of messages there was even one with the royal seal that opened revealed her official appointment as a lady of the queens bedchamber a small personally scrawled note enclosed with it from james himself stated that he expected to see her back at court when he got there she tossed it aside impatiently and reached for the letter from her husband it was short almost impersonal and she was disappointed beloved he wrote by the time this reaches ye we should be under sail and on our way home it has been a long hard winter here and i have missed ye the kings wedding was performed in oslo but we returned to denmark for christmas and have been here ever since tell jamie that i am bringing him a surprise for the birthday i missed i send my love to ye and to all our bairns your devoted husband patrick leslie it was not the letter of a man hungry for his woman and cat was furious the bastard she thought angrily and wondered if he had taken a mistress or was simply tumbling an occasional doxy if he did have a mistress then she must be part of the court would she be left behind or would she be coming with them ill soon find out she muttered aloud damn here was a fine situation she wanted to get pregnant to escape the attentions of the king yet if she did she would have to return home to glenkirk leaving patrick at court to entertain his mistress there was only one thing to do she would have to get rid of the whore on may james and his queen arrived at leith in the lead ship of a convoy of thirteen the road to the capital was lined with a cheering populace their pretty young queen sat comfortably ensconced in a gilded chariot drawn by eight white horses each dressed in red velvet blankets embroidered in gold and silver thread in edinburgh the nobility were assembled to greet anna catriona leslie stood with francis stewarthepburn as the royal progress arrived at holyrood house she immediately spotted patrick lifting a petite woman down from her horse the woman had silvery hair and was dressed in palepink velvet trimmed with some kind of gray fur probably rabbit ye were in leith francis who is the wench glenkirk is lifting down francis hepburn smiled wolfishly and wondered how cat had found out so quickly she is mistress christina anders he said a childhood friend of the queens and a lady of the bedchamber whos bedchamber snapped cat shes at least four months gone wi child damn glenkirk ill roast him for this bothwell chuckled i am sure yell find a way to get even wi him i will she replied grimly then oh francis i missed him so much its been months since i last laid eyes on him how could he the earl of bothwell put a comforting arm about cat probably because he was lonely and needed ye so he took a woman to cheer him tis no great thing i was lonely too francis i burned for him every night he was awayeven when the king was wi me dinna feel sorry for yerself my darling said lord bothwell she may have had the fire to keep patrick warm this winter but she doesna hae the fire to keep him permanently see how his eyes are scanning the crowd hes looking for ye i am sure he is she answered looking to see if ive caught him wi his whore god bothwell look how she clings to his arm ill scratch her face to ribbons francis hepburn chuckled deep in his throat if ye make a scene in public all the sympathy will be to poor mistress anders however if ye greet glenkirk in good wifely fashion the sympathy will lie wi ye my wife always plays that game when she ventures out of crichton everyone knows yer called the virtuous countess because of yer faithfulness and devotion to yer lord if ye really want to get even wi him play the part to the hilt bothwell i adore ye yer so wonderfully diabolic said cat gleefully how do i look his blue eyes swept over her with obvious approval she was dressed on this cool spring day in a very simple mulberry velvet gown it had long fitted sleeves with ecru lace cuffs and a small stiff ecru lace collar she wore her famous pink pearls though she had four ropes of them she wore only two she had removed her matching cape which was trimmed in sable her dark honeycolored hair was caught up in a gold mesh net and held with pearl and gilt pins dinna bat yer wicked green eyes at me my darling said bothwell in a low voice i need no encouragement to ravish ye if patrick doesnt rush ye home to bed hes a bigger fool than i think they had reached the reception room francis hepburn squeezed cats hand and then gave her a little shove toward the door giving her skirts a small shake and her hair a final pat she nodded at the majordomo she walked through the door and down the center of the room to the foot of the two thrones her head was high and she could hear the faint whispers around her gracefully she sank into a curtsy her head bowing for just a second welcome home my lord king and to ye dearest madame a gracious welcome to scotland from all the leslies of glenkirk james stewart beamed on her cat yer as lovely as ever annie luv this is glenkirks wife cat leslie i hae made her a lady of yer bedchamber so shell be serving ye now anna stewart looked down at the countess and felt sorry for her friend christina not only was the countess beautiful but her expression was sweet and kind thank you for your welcome lady leslie said the queen i will do my best to serve ye well my queen said cat then before she could be dismissed she turned again to the king a boon cousin name it my dear it has been almost nine months since i have seen my husband sire now that ye are so happy in yer own marriage perhaps ye can understand how i feel i hae not yet even seen my husband except from a distance may i please take him to glenkirk house for just this night she cocked her head appealingly and smiled sweetly oh james said the queen say yes i give lady leslie my permission please give her yours glenkirk where are ye roared the king the earl stepped forward and as he did cat saw the little hand that tried to hold him back for a brief moment they looked at each other then cat flung herself into his arms and kissed him passionately unable to help himself he kissed her back gods foot glenkirk take her home to bed chortled the king they turned and bowing to their majesties of scotland walked from the chamber just before exiting cat turned her head ever so slightly and looked directly at christina anders passing francis hepburn she winked why asked the queen of her husband do they call lady leslie the virtuous countess i thought it was because she was cold and only did her duty by her husband the king laughed lord no my innocent annie cat leslie is deeply in love wi her husband and always has been she is called the virtuous countess because unlike so many women at this court she will nae sleep wi any other man she is a most faithful wife they hae six bairns the reason i chose her to serve ye is that i thought she would be a good influence on ye oh said the queen feeling even sorrier for christina anders francis stewarthepburn the earl of bothwell called out the majordomo the queen turned to greet the new arrival chapter safely in their coach the earl of glenkirk turned to his wife i have never seen ye gie a better performance cat would ya rather i had caused a scene and attacked yer mistress in public she asked him quietly i am sorry hinny i dinna mean to hurt ye who told ye ye did the letter ye sent me was hardly that of a man longing for his wife ye hae put more warmth into yer correspondence wi the kiras one letter in all that time was she selling her wares on the dock when yer ship came into port that ye couldna find time to write to me jamie was devastated ye forgot his birthday if francis hadna left the sword francis bothwell she said he escorted us home to glenkirk after the king left edinburgh last year his father and yer mother are cousins so that makes him our cousin he stayed till just after twelfth night the children she said with malice adore him and yer brothers had a fine time wi him hes a good friend patrick i like him perhaps madame i should inquire what ye were doing while i was away on kings business francis hepburn is a notorious rake dinna try to cloud the issue patrick francis is my friend nothing more and ye should not even have to ask besides he is married can ye tell me that mistress anders is naught but a friend to ye and the child she carries is nae yer bairn he had the grace to flush and she laughed patrick patrick only the leslie women know the secret of preventing conception yer so used to me that ye got careless wi yer whore realizing that she wasnt too angry with him was a great relief he would not tell her that christina anders had tricked him hoping to have a greater hold on him he had been tiring of the danish girl and knowing it she had become pregnant he had tried to make her stay behind in denmark but she refused to give up her post as lady of the royal bedchamber and threatened to cause a scandal if he told the queen these things however patrick leslie would not tell his wife do ye love this girl asked cat god no he burst out damn cat i am no courtier and there i was alone in norway and denmark wi the stewart court do ye know what they do all day they dice they drink they play at games they change clothes aye clothes are very important to them they wench it is still a source of amazement to me how frequently they change partners they are the most useless people alive had i not found a kira in copenhagen i would hae gone mad a kira aye sweetheart theyve a bank in copenhagen and i was able to keep track of our business through them it gave me something to do picturing poor christina anders waiting patiently while patrick kept track of his ships and cargoes made the countess of glenkirk laugh then she asked ye are sure the bairn is yers aye cairi is many things but shes nae a wanton the child is mine what will ye do about it glenkirk i will acknowledge it and see to its support and its mother what will ye do about her i told her from the first that i love my wife and that our liaison was only a temporary thing i meant it then and i mean it now they had reached glenkirk house which was located just off the cannongate near holyrood house cat swept in and up the stairs bidding mrs kerr a good day the earl remained below while the servants fussed over him ellen was waiting for her mistress is it true she asked has the earl come home wi another woman well ye certainly need not feel so guilty now cat whirled around if ye ever even hint at that again yell end yer days alone at crannog do ye understand me ellie the bond of love between mistress and servant was strong realizing how deep the hurt done cat really was ellen apologized i must be getting old and foolish my baby the countess caught her tiring womans hand and squeezed it then her eyes twinkled yer gossip is partly correct ye nosy old woman his danish mistress is part of the queens entourage and quite an embarrassment to poor glenkirk she went and got herself wi child to try and hold him poor patrick hes been married to me for so long hes forgotten how treacherous women can be will ye forgie him of course hes come home to me and hes quite ashamed at having been caught as long as he discards her i will be content now ellie see to my bath i think that wicked new black silk nightgown will do glenkirks about to receive a welcome hell nae forget ellen laughed the danish girl may deliver three sons to the earl and shed still nae have a chance wi against ye my lady when patrick leslie entered his own apartments a short while later he found that his valet had prepared a steaming oak tub in front of the blazing fireplace stripping off his clothing he said burn them angus and then climbed into the tub the water was faintly perfumed and slightly oily his winterdry skin soaked it up he sniffed appreciatively oil of musk cat said and he looked up to see her standing in the doorway that connected their bedroom she walked across the room and flinging off her black silk robe mounted the steps and joined him in his tub putting her arms about his neck she molded herself to him and kissed hungrily as her little tongue darted back and forth exploring his mouth her hands fondled him beneath the warm water he had needed little encouragement the mere sight of her had roused him loosening his grip on her he reached down and cupping her buttocks in his hands raised her as her slim legs tightened about his waist he thrust deep within her he heard her catch her breath damn ye patrick did ye have to be away so long much later they lay in their big bed happy and content with each other cat slept naked safe within the curve of patricks arm he lay awake wondering what had ever possessed him to get involved with christina anders when a clean whore would have served his purposes and given him no trouble at holyrood house christina anders cursed the fact that it was too late to get rid of the bastard growing within her to try at this stage of the game might kill her one look at the countess of glenkirk had told her the battle was lost and the fantastic act that the countess had put on for just her benefit how she had known so quickly was a mystery to christina but that she had known was patently obvious the danish girl sighed and wondered what would happen to her and to the child she carried she did not have long to wonder the following day the countess of glenkirk reported for duty as a lady of the queens bedchamber anna took immediately to catriona leslie as to a charming and warm older cousin no help there thought christina her aid however came from the most unexpected quarter at the first opportunity the countess of glenkirk separated mistress anders from the others they walked in the park surrounding holyrood house how far gone are ye asked cat with her usual directness christina was frightened but she stopped and looked up at the tall beautiful woman madame i do not know what you mean cat took the girls arm listen my dear i hae been wed to patrick leslie for twelve years we hae six children and what i guessed at patrick has confirmed now when is the bairn due christinas composure crumbled autumn she whispered dinna fret my dear she heard the countess say to her leslies take care of their own and yer bairn is a leslie the child is a bastard my lady pish said cat impatiently patricks greatgrandfather the second earl fathered a bastard son the first of the moreleslies they have always served us since then the moreleslies are respected and respectable your child will be taken care of and ye need not worry yer lucky in that respect good god girl why did ye nae pick an unmarried man who would possibly have married ye yer of good family i am married madame to my third husband a boy of twelve even if my lover had been free to wed me it would have taken too long to get an annulment and i can scarcely claim a boy not yet potent as this childs father i appreciate and will accept your aid but my child will not be raised as a servant he is of good blood on both sides even if he is not legitimate cat smiled christina anders had given the countess the weapon she needed in order to control the situation ye will be a good mother my dear and the leslies will see yer bairn is raised as befits a noble bastard however if ye attempt to ensnare my husband again i will see ye sent back to denmark in disgrace and yer child will be sold east into slavery so saying the countess of glenkirk patted the girls arm kindly and walked away christina shuddered she had no doubt that catriona leslie meant exactly what she said and could do exactly what she threatened christina did not love patrick leslie he had merely been a refreshing change she was not about to get into a fight with his countess over just as long as the baby was taken care of she would be satisfied the earl may have confessed his infidelity to his wife but christina would wager he had not confessed to all the presents he had lavished on her she chuckled she had done quite well that evening cat managed a few minutes alone in their rooms with her husband i have had a talk wi mistress anders she said calmly the earl looked uncomfortable i told her continued his wife that the leslies take care of their own so we will see the child is taken care of but shes nae to see ye again cat ye had no right to tell her that she flew at him damn ye patrick i have been patient wi ye and kind to yer highborn doxy but ive nae intention of sharing ye wi yer whore she turned her back to him putting an arm about her he pulled her back against him and pushing her tawny hair aside kissed the nape of her neck ive never intended spreading myself between two women he said gently and i hae no thought to involve myself wi cairi again but she is bearing my child tis a lonely time for her sweetheart dinna be unkind tis nae like ye i was alone when i carried jamie she answered him aye but ye were safe in fionas house wi mrs kerr and sally ye were in yer own land and anytime ye chose ye could have called on half a dozen people for aid cairi has none of these advantages she is alone in a strange land and in imminent danger of disgrace should her condition become known i only mean to offer the hand of friendship should she need it nothing more he kissed the fetching little nape of his wifes neck again and one hand gently fondled a soft round breast damn ye glenkirk she said through gritted teeth but she turned and raised her face to him his mouth found hers and she felt her legs weaken bending he scooped her up and deposited her on their bed no she sighed reluctantly at him we canna now i am due back wi the queen it was his turn to mutter damn and she couldnt resist a giggle struggling to her feet she smoothed her skirts down and smiling wickedly at him over her shoulder left him to cool off patrick leslie chuckled deeply to himself what a wench she was she had kept him ensnared for twelve years though she was stubborn independent willful and perhaps too intelligent for a woman she had never bored him she was still the most fascinating woman he had ever known it never occurred to patrick that the very qualities in her that distressed him were the ones that made her so interesting thinking over the last few days he realized how lucky he was cairi anders had been a lovely diversion though he was sorry she was pregnant at least she had made no scenes and he was grateful to her for that as to his wife he sighed with relief she could have made it very difficult for him but she had not she had been unbelievably generous while patrick leslie thought about his wife cat was in the queens anteroom fending off the king struggling furiously the countess of glenkirk yanked james stewarts hand out of her bodice damnit jamie behave yerself tis hardly a warm welcome home ye gie me cat luv protested james cat swept him a curtsy welcome home yer majesty she said coolly now please allow me to pass sire i am already late for the queen when may i see ye publicly at any time sire privately never i would remind yer majesty that ye are a married man now and i have always been a married woman annie does nae pleasure me as ye do he said her majesty is still hardly more than a maid jamie it is up to ye to teach her what pleases ye i am no schoolmaster he replied sulkily nowmadame let us fix a time that we may be together catriona leslie looked steadily at her king and her eyes were green ice in yer mothers day the word of a stewart was good she said cruelly before he could reply the door to the queens bedroom opened and countess olafson called ah lady leslie there you are the queen has been asking for you cat again curtsied to the king but as she swept by she heard him say softly yell pay dearly for that remark madame chapter the countess of glenkirk had no time to ponder the kings threatening remark she was far too busy the queen was to be crowned almost immediately her coronation robes requiring many tiresome fittings were all to be scotsmade and then too anna had to be taught the ceremony unfortunately anna of denmark was not very bright beautiful innocent charming and generous she was but she was also extravagant emptyheaded silly and hottempered fortunately catriona leslie had the patience needed to drill the queen she also had wisdom enough to make a game of it so anna would not become bored if the young queen told cat i had had a schoolmistress like you perhaps i should have been more inclined to learn cat laughed nonsense madame ye dinna fool me a bit ye know that ye will not only look magnificent at the coronation but by knowing yer part well yell truly be magnificent yer subjects will be enchanted it was a clever compliment and the teenaged queen preening herself before the mirror thought again how much she liked the lovely countess of glenkirk such an agreeable lady anna of denmark was crowned queen of scotland at scone on may she played her part with a charming youthful dignity that touched the hearts of the crustiest old highland lairds assembled to see the next mother of the stewart line the evening was spent in the merriest of revels with a magnificent feast that featured roast boars red deer sheep and sides of beef all basted by redfaced and perspiring kitchen boys there were fowls of every kindswans larded ducks capons in sweet lemonginger sauce stuffed roast geese partridges grouse quail and pigeons there were great bowls of raw oysters and boiled shrimp mussels and clams with herbs broiled sea trout and flounders were served whole on great gold platters there were also flaky pastries of minced meat rabbit fruits and nuts smoked hams eels and potted hare were also offered young spring lettuces scallions and artichokes in vinegar filled silver bowls great crocks of butter were placed at intervals on the tables along with large trenchers of fresh breads for the last course the guests were offered custards jellies of every color and shape oranges from spain early cherries from the south of france and fruit tarts made with the dried fruits of last years harvest silver bowls of sugared almonds and filberts were passed with the cheeses the wafers and the tiny goblets of spiced hippocras wines and ales had flowed generously and the entertainment had been continuous there were minstrels of course and jugglers dancing dogs and acrobats pipers had traversed the dining hall several times cat who had eaten sparingly was brewing a headache when her husband came to claim her for the dancing take me for some air instead she begged him they walked about the gardens in the cool may night i never get to see ye hinny now that yer a lady of the queens bedchamber the earl complained to his wife i know she sighed back patrick i want to go home ye were right we should nae have involved ourselves with the court suddenly she was clinging to him please take me home my love now he held her close and smelled the seductive sweetness of the scent she always wore he stroked her lovely hair and wondered about this passionate almost desperate outburst then he smiled to himself though he had been back less than a month it was possible that she was breeding she had of course threatened him after morags birth that there would be no more children but women were apt to change their minds he hugged her indulgently ye know we canna just go home sweetheart we are part of the court now and must get permission from their majesties to do that we need a good excuse i dinna have one do ye no she replied sadly yer sure he asked her searchingly ye could be wi child its too soon for even me to tell patrick arms around his neck she gazed up at him shall i gie ye another son my lord are six bairns not enough to assure yer immortality only three of them are sons he teased her besides we hae such fun making them he bent and kissed her eager lips damn me cat i am tired of sharing ye wi the stewarts lets make another bairn and go home to glenkirk finding her mouth he kissed her again and would have gone on doing so had not an insolent voice drawled shocking and wi yer own wife too glenkirk startled the leslies pulled apart to face the amused gaze of the earl of bothwell who the hell began patrick but cat had already launched herself at bothwell francis you beast how could ye catching her angry little fists he laughed down at her i wish a woman would kiss me like that turning to patrick francis hepburn held out his hand glenkirk im bothwell were distant cousins of a sort and not only do i envy ye yer beautiful wife sir yeve a fine brood of bairns also patrick leslie shook the hand offered him so yer the wizard earl im pleased to meet ye man i owe ye my thanks for escorting cat home last autumn twas my pleasure replied bothwell but ive disturbed yer tryst for a reason the queen seeks ye cat best to hurry my darling some farradiddle over a torn hem or such and only lady leslie can make it right sighing cat quickly kissed her husband impudently thumbing her nose at bothwell she gathered up her skirts and ran off both men laughed and then francis hepburn said seriously to the earl of glenkirk if she were my wife leslie i would get her away from the stewarts and their damned court she is too much of a temptation aye said patrick and she wants to go last year i couldnt force her home but suddenly she must go i dinna understand it bothwell but i am glad then take her home man as soon as possible glenkirk had no time to think about francis words for the court was on the move again two days after the queens coronation anna of denmark officially entered her edinburgh capital to be greeted by the nine muses and the four virtues the royal procession moved along high street stopping at st giles church where the queen and her court listened to a long dull sermon that evening the court faced another gargantuan feast and to annas delight there was a masque extolling spring the ladies of the court were each assigned parts they were flowers birds trees animals elements and all things pertaining to the season of spring the only man in the entire production was the earl of bothwell magnificently attired in silver and white who played a very amused north wind educated in europe and having spent a good deal of time at both the french and english courts bothwell was quite used to these masques and saw nothing unmanly in them as the north wind it was his delightful duty to attempt to chase off springtime played by the queen herself wearing flowing robes of pink and pale green springtimes coterie of tender creatures followed their majesty this lead to much scampering about and giggling north wind was finally vanquished by south wind who wore diaphanous robes of pale blue and silver and who was portrayed by the countess of glenkirk the king was bored to tears by the entertainment though he did remark that the south wind had the prettiest pair of tits hed ever seen james thought these amusements silly the queen however was enchanted and extremely pleased by the success of her own efforts the younger members of the nobility were happy to see an end to the dull psalmsinging court of the kings regency and bachelorhood that night cat and patrick slept together in their own apartments they worked happily at conceiving another child but did not do so as the weeks went by cat became more distraught it was obvious to her as the newness of young love wore off that the serious young king and his featherheaded wife had nothing in common other than a passion for hunting increasingly cat caught james stewarts eyes upon her and was frightened she might hate him but she could not refuse him he was king then patrick announced that the king had delegated him to go to hermitage castle with francis hepburn its master and make arrangements for twelfth night revels the queen had expressed a desire to see bothwells famous border home hearing her husbands news cat hurried to her mistress mayi go wi them yer majesty she pleaded prettily what do men know of womens comforts as lady bothwell never leaves crichton she will be no help the queen laughed it is a scandal how much you love your husband my dear cat yes yes go along with the handsome glenkirk i do not blame you for wanting to be with him now that christina is well again i can get along without you for a few days thank ye madame said cat kissing the queens hand thank you for taking such good care of my childhood friend in her illness said the queen meaningfully cat curtsied and exited safe outside she chuckled to herself mistress anders predicament had been kept a discreet scandal the danish noblewoman had been delivered of a daughter in october the child anne fitzleslie was being boarded with a healthy young farming family near the city the queen repaid the countess of glenkirks generosity by letting her go with her husband on kings business catriona and patrick rode with francis hepburn at the head of bothwells borderers the evening was clear and cold with a heaven full of stars and a bright moon they had left in late afternoon and they rode the entire night breaking their journey several times to warm themselves with dreams of potent smoky whisky in nameless inns wherever they stopped the welcome was always a warm one for the earl of bothwell and his men back at holyrood james stewart hummed a little tune to himself as he slipped through the secret passageway that connected his bedroom with cat leslies the queen would be unavailable to him for a few days her womanly time being upon her he had sent patrick leslie off with bothwell and now the king looked forward to rediscovering the countess of glenkirk opening the door at the end of the passage he stepped into the room and was confronted by a startled ellen who curtsied low where is your mistress demanded james gone to hermitage your majesty stammered ellen i dinna gie her permission to leave court shell be punished for this disobedience the queen sent her sire said ellen desperately what the queen sent my lady to hermitage wi my lord of glenkirk and my lord of bothwell repeated ellen her majesty felt a womans touch would be needed in the preparations for twelfth night james managed to master the anger growing within him reaching into the pocket of his dressing gown he grudgingly drew out a gold piece handing it to ellen he said quietly tell yer beautiful mistress that i will nae gie her up then he reentered the secret passage which closed behind him ellen sat down on the bed with a relieved sigh now she understood cats hasty departure ellen disliked the kings hypocrisy intensely he played the moral man and the devoted husband while lusting after another woman if only they could go home it was not however to be so simple like a cat at a mousehole the king watched and waited for his opportunity it made no difference to james that what he had already done to cat was wrong according to the laws of the very church he was sworn to uphold there was one thing which all the dour churchmen who had raised him couldnt erase from the royal stewarts mind and that was the absolute fact of the divine right of kings like the five jameses before him this james upheld the laws of the land and the church only after his own wants had been satisfied in attempting to punish the king by being the most exciting woman he would ever encounter cat had unwittingly infected him with a sexual hunger that only she could now satisfy her coldness enraged him he would have her if he had to ask her husband for her that he might destroy her marriage and perhaps even her whole life made no difference to the king the countess of glenkirk was his subject she belonged to him she would obey him like the good hunter he was the king stalked his prey and smelled its fear while the court stayed at hermitage castle he did manage for a few minutes to separate her from the rest of the crowd finding herself alone with the king cat looked frantically around james laughed would i could take ye here in just the few minutes we have my dear but alas i canna she said nothing twas neatly done madame the king continued but why did ye run away from me catriona i sent patrick away before i came to ye and what did i find yer tiring woman packing yer clothes and a cold empty bed cats heart was pounding violently and she was icy with a mixture of fear and anger gathering her courage she looked up at him and spoke jamie i can say it no plainer i dinna want to be yer mistress please sire ye promised me that when ye brought the queen home ye would free me i love my husband and he is nae a man to share his wife wi anothereven his king why do ye do this to me jamie yer wife is a fresh and lovely girl open to yer instruction in the arts of love why must ye hae me he didnt answer her question instead he said quietly when we return to edinburgh i expect ye to receive me madame without any further argument if ye will not i will be forced to ask patricks permission which ye know he will gie me if however ye come freely we will continue to keep our liaison secret from the rest of the worldincluding yer husband her lovely eyes shone with tears why sire why because madame i wish it and i am the king he said coldly and walked away from her for several minutes she stood very still gazing with unseeing eyes out of the window at the cheviot hills then sensing she was no longer alone she whirled about to see the earl of bothwell standing there wordlessly they looked at each other and then francis hepburn held out his arms to her flinging herself into them she wept against his velvetcovered chest a spasm crossed bothwells face as his arms tenderly held her when she had regained her control he loosed her tipping her heartshaped face up he asked what happened wi cousin jamie i yield or he asks patrick she answered softly the little bastard snarled bothwell what a pity the queen dinna miscarry of him francis hush she covered his mouth with her hand to even think such a thing is treason he tore her hand away and swore softly i wish to god i was the warlock they accuse me of being id like to send cousin jamie to the seven devils ah my darling i canna help ye and i hae never felt so helpless in my whole life he took her by the shoulders and looked down at her if i can ever help ye come to me ye will remember that then he took a large silk square from his doublet and wiped the tears from her face her slender hand reached up and gently touched his face bothwell she said softly yer the best friend fve ever had then she turned and left him standing in the little windowed alcove francis hepburn gazed out at the familiar cheviot and sighed for the first time in his life he had found a woman he could love and not only was he married but she was also married to add a further complication she was lusted after by the king the irony of the situation struck him and he laughed sharply once again life had dealt him a bad hand chapter the court had settled comfortably back into edinburgh it was dull january the leslies two oldest sons were also at court having joined the household of andrew leslie the earl of rothes head of clan leslie it was a relief to cat to be able to see at least two of her children at this time patrick leslie decided to go home to check on his estates and to see his other children unlike his wife he had no official duties to keep him at court cat could not however be spared from service with the queen desperately she tried to forestall her husbands departure but he laughed indulgently at her and teased two years ago ye would hae rather died than go home to glenkirk in winter now i believe ye would walk home kissing her goodbye he reassured her ill be back in a few weeks hinny would it cheer ye if i brought bess wi me nay my lord this court is no place for a young girl she looked up at him astride dubh go carefully patrick and come quickly back to me there was something in her eyes that for a moment made him wonder if he should leave her then laughing at himself for being a fool he bent kissed her again and rode off it was not her night to serve the queen so gaining permission she went to glenkirk house the king would not dare chance seeking her out when the queen was available she slept safe in her own home for the next few days soon it was her turn to sleep in the royal antechamber on call in the event anna required something and she was again safe from the king at the end of her duty period the queen took her aside i would prefer my dear cat that you not leave the palace at night when you are not on duty are your apartments not comfortable aye madame they are most comfortable i go home so that my sons may see me easily when their duties allow the queen smiled indulgently you are a good mother cat but you are also a lady of my bedchamber we will arrange for you to see your sons but please remain near me at night i awoke once with a terrible pain in my temple and you were not there to rub it away as your majesty wishes replied cat curtsying she knew full well where the idea that she remain in the palace had really come from several days later the queens monthly indisposition occurred and that same evening the king appeared in the countess of glenkirks bedchamber first she tried to hold him off with reason but he refused to listen he came at her and she fought him physically her little fists beating at him it amused him to master her and he did so cruelly ravaging her body she recoiled from his touch and hated him with a frustrated fury she could not satisfy she was forced to endure his attentions for the next four nights every morning and every evening cat prayed for her husbands speedy return not a day went by that the king didnt steal a few minutes to be alone with her that she detested him seemed to add to his pleasure one night as she undressed after the evenings entertainment he appeared through the secret door she wore only her white silk petticoats and stood before her pier glass brushing her long darkgold hair slipping up behind her james slid an arm around her waist and with his other hand cupped a globeshaped breast cat closed her eyes wearily patiently enduring his unwelcome attentions she had learned by now that to struggle was useless as the king buried his lips in the soft flesh of her neck a faint sound caught cats ear opening her eyes she saw her husband reflected in the pier glass his face stiff with shock and hurt she would never remember in later years if she spoke his name aloud or merely mouthed it silently it was enough however to rouse him and his voice was icy i beg yer pardon madame i had nae idea ye were entertaining patrick she cried patrick please she tore herself from the kings grasp and took several steps toward him behind her james stewart looked at the earl of glenkirk i find yer wife charming cousin and i have been doing so for some time now do ye object aye sire replied the earl i do object though little good it would do me especially since the lady is so acquiescent he turned to his wife i hope my dear ye have gotten a good price for yer virtue come cousin soothed the king dinna be angry wi cat she has done her duty by the crown admirably he smiled winningly at the earl and taking him by the arm led him into the antechamber let us hae a wee drink patrick yer wife keeps some remarkably fine whisky numbly cat continued the business of getting ready for bed she was grateful she had dismissed ellie for the evening the tiring woman would only have tried to help her and made matters worse kicking her petticoats off she pulled a silk nightgown over her head and lay down on top of her bed she could hear the low murmur of voices in the next room as well as the clink of crystal glasses she didnt remember falling asleep but suddenly she felt a slap on her hip and patricks voiceslurred with drinksaid wake up madame whore heres two customers for ye angrily she scrambled to her feet yer drunk both of ye get out of my bedroom i canna stand the sight of either of ye not so drunk we canna fuck right cousin jamiegrasping the bodice of her nightgown patrick ripped it to the hem tore the two pieces off her and flung them across the room get into bed my dear virtuous wife and open yer legs for the king yeve done it before and very well according to our royal cousin he pushed her back onto the bed and before she could protest the king was on top of her driving into her unwilling body she was neither ready nor willing for the assault and its effect was that of forcible rape she struggled wildly beneath james which merely increased his desire he came quickly rolling off her he said yer turn patrick and before a shocked cat realized what was happening her husband had mounted her and pushed deep within her she could hear her own screaming her thighs were sticky with another mans seed and yet he took her outraged she fought him violently and was slapped into unconsciousness for her pains throughout the night they took turns raping her and drinking her whisky until at last in that darkest part of the night before dawn a drunken james stewart returned to his room via the secret passage and the very drunk earl of glenkirk fell into a deep sleep fearful at first of awaking him cat lay quietly then sure he was really asleep she crawled slowly from the bed moving quietly and painfully across the room to the fireplace she stirred up the fire and added some kindling then heated the hanging kettle over it pouring some water into a small ewer she took a cake of soap and a rough linen cloth and scrubbed herself until her skin was raw next she went to the trunk at the foot of the bed and lifting out her woolen trunk hose silk riding shirt and plaid doublet put them on she pulled on her boots picked up her furlined cloak and silently left the apartment it was not yet dawn when she entered the stables the boy on duty was fast asleep halfburied in a pile of straw quickly cat saddled iolaire she dared not take bana as she would have been spotted easily on the white mare leading the gelding from the stable stealthily she mounted it and muffling herself in her cloak rode boldly up to the main exit of the palace messenger for leslie of glenkirk she croaked in a husky voice pass said the soldier thinking how glad he was not to have to ride out at this early hour she rode south and slightly east keeping away from the main roads she was aware of neither the bitter cold nor approaching daylight she felt neither hunger nor thirst several times she stopped to water and rest her horse and when evening came she sought her bearings finding them she headed for a small religious house where she begged a nights shelter up at first light she left a gold piece with the startled nun who kept the gate mounting iolaire she continued on her journey at midday she was spotted by two riders cat put her horse into a gallop but unsure of the countryside was quickly run down she found herself facing two bearded young borderers who grinned delightedly at her i dinna know which is better said the taller of the two the horse or the woman the horse is yers man answered his companion ill take the woman touch me at yer peril she snarled at them i am for hermitage and lord bothwell yell nae find the earl at hermitage said the tall borderer hes at his lodge in the cheviot how far from here two hours ride sweetheart but if yeve a mind to bed a hepburn my father was one and id be happy to oblige cat drew herself up tall and looking levelly at the two men said coldly take me to lord bothwell or suffer the consequences when he finds out yeve not only detained me but refused me aid as well something in her voice told them she was not bluffing follow us said the tall man whirling their horses around they galloped off two hours later as promised they arrived at a small lodge well hidden within the hills at the sound of hoofbeats the door opened and the earl of bothwell himself stepped out the taller fellow spoke out we found this lady some two hours from here my lord riding for hermitage when she told us she sought ye we brought her here i hope we did the right thing bothwell walked over to iolaire and reaching up pushed away the hood of the allconcealing cape cat he breathed two large tears rolled down her cheeks help me francis she begged holding out her arms to him please help me then she crumbled out of the saddle into his arms fainting cradling her tenderly he turned to the two startled men ye did right to bring this lady to me but remember lads ye hae never seen her when i can be of help to ye i will be he walked swiftly back into the house with his precious burden part iii the uncrowned king chapter francis hepburn had been alone at his hunting lodge he occasionally shunned the company of his fellow humans and fled to some isolated spot renewing himself spiritually and physically it was his way of retaining sanity in a world that alternately admired and feared him he liked the winter months and he had been enjoying himself alone for several weeks now his peace had been broken and in a most disturbing way he carried the unconscious catriona leslie into his house upstairs to his bedroom and gently laid her on his bed he drew off her boots and wrapping her cloak around her pulled up a blanket and tucked it around her stirring up the fire he put a brick in the ashes to warm then he drew the draperies shut on all the windows and lit a small moorish oil lamp so she could see where she was when she regained consciousness taking the brick from the ashes with a pair of tongs he wrapped it in a flannel and put it at her feet then pouring a dram of potent whisky made in his own still he sat on the edge of the bed and began to rub her wrists shortly she stirred and he gently raised her up and put the dram to her lips sip it slowly my darling he said she did as he bid her and the color began to seep back into her cheeks dinna tell patrick i am here she begged him i wont he promised now my darling yer fair exhausted and chilled to the bone i want ye to close yer eyes and go to sleep ill be downstairs and there are no servants to worry about he was talking to himself for she was already fast asleep dropping a kiss on her forehead he left her and descended the stairs the lower level of his house was a large open room with a huge stone fireplace it was furnished in a rough manner with animal skins hangings and heavy oldfashioned furniture pulling a chair up by the fireplace he poured himself a glass from a decanter of wine before sitting down he wondered what had driven the countess of glenkirk out of edinburgh she was suffering from shock having learned some medicine from a moorish physician bothwell understood her symptoms poor lass he said softly what in hell happened to ye when catriona awoke several hours later it took her a moment or two to realize where she was she climbed from the big bed and padded downstairs in her stockinged feet francis are ye awake aye lass come over by the fire and sit wi me she settled into his lap for a time neither of them spoke he held her lightly yet protectively and she nestled against him breathing the leather and tobacco scent of him his heart was pounding wildly he had always treated her casually teasingly in an effort to hide his feelings and it had been fairly easy because he had never gotten too close now francis hepburn fought down his feelings lest he frighten her further finally in desperation he asked are ye hungry when did ye last eat two nights ago i stopped at a nunnery last night but i could not eat then or this morning ye should be hungry by now my darling he tipped her out of his lap gently can ye set a table cat leslie the word is countess my lord bothwell not helpless of course i can set a table well eat by the fire he said cheerfully the cloths in that chest and yell find dishes and utensils in the larder over there she was surprised to see him bring out from the pantry a few minutes later a steaming tureen and a basket of hot bread sit down he commanded her eat it while its hot she was going to refuse him but the soup smelled so good it was a thick lamb broth with barley onions and carrots she discovered it was flavored with peppercorns and white wine he shoved a thick crusty slice of hot bread dripping with butter in front of her and watched amused as she devoured it when she had spooned up all the soup he took her bowl and returned to the pantrykitchen soon he came back bearing two plates i caught a salmon this morning before ye arrived and i found some early cress he announced proudly she ate the thinsliced fish more slowly than she had eaten the soup he was worried by her silence and by the fact that she had already consumed three goblets of burgundy sated at last she sat back where did ye learn to cook she asked him my uncle james believed a man needed knowledge of that kind she smiled a halfsmile at him and lapsed into silence again what happened cat can ye tell me my darling after a time she looked up the pain in her eyes stunned him rising he moved around the table and knelt at her side dinna tell me if its too painful if i tell ye now francis ill nae have to speak of it again and maybe i can forget in time she began to weep softly damn james stewart oh francis he has deliberately destroyed my life i would kill him if i could patrick went home to glenkirk and i was alone there was no one i could turn to at all i tried to keep out of the kings way but the lecherous hypocrite stalked me like a rabbit patrick came back from glenkirk to find jamie wi his hands all over me the king could have saved me if he had wanted to do so but instead he told patrick what a marvelous mistress i was and made it sound worse than it was he dinna tell patrick i was unwilling then the two of them got quite companionably drunk on my whisky and raped me oh god francis the king and my own husband not once but time and time againall night long they wouldnt let me go and they made me do things she shuddered oh francis yer my friend please let me stay wi ye for now he was stunned by what she had told him stunned and horrified that james stewart could have been that vengeful he fully believed but that patrick leslie an educated and enlightened man like himself could have brutalized his own blameless wife astounded him my poor darling he said gently ye can stay wi me forever standing he drew her from the chair who saw ye go cat no one though they will connect the rider who left the palace for glenkirk wi me the nuns who sheltered me last night live in an outoftheway place in any event only the gatekeeper and the mistress of travelers saw me and not for long there were no other visitors at the convent patrick will think i hae gone to acuil he put his arms about her ah my darling i am so sorry so very sorry dinna fear yer safe wi me the men who brought ye in will nae admit to having ever seen ye she stood quietly within the comforting circle of his arms and then slowly she lifted her face to him make love to me francis her voice was urgent here now make love to me wordlessly he shook his head at her he understood the reasons behind her outburst she needed reassurance needed to be the one to do the choosing but he was not sure if compliance with her desperate request would make matters better or worse he loved her and he wanted her but dear god not like this angrily she pulled away from him come on bothwell yer reputed to be the best lover in scotland she tore her shirt open and off her beautiful breasts tumbled out in all their glory pushing her riding breeches down and off she moved seductively towards him she was naked as the creator had made her and he fought down his rising desire come on bothwell she taunted him love me or are ye not man enough if im worthy of a king then im good enough for ye her eyes glistened with angry unshed tears if she had been a man he would have hit her but he understood like a child fallen from its pony who must immediately ride again cat leslie needed to make love with a man who would not abuse her if not him who francis hepburn didnt wait to find another answer scooping the woman before him up into his arms he carried her up to his bedroom and deposited her on his bed swiftly he stripped his own clothing off and joined her he was in her before she realized it taking her with a gentleness she had never dreamed any man could tenderly he kissed and caressed her striving to bring her the greatest pleasure no man had ever loved her in such a fashion finally he could hold back his desire no longer and released his boiling passion she began to weep great gulping sobs i feel nothing dear god francis i feel nothing what hae they done to me that i feel nothing and she began to tremble uncontrollably bothwell gathered her into his arms and held her tightly the hurt done her was even deeper than he had feared it was going to take time to bring her back but he would do it dinna cry my precious darling he said softly dinna cry they hae hurt ye terribly and twill take time for ye to recover go to sleep now my sweet love go to sleep yer safe wi me my love within minutes she slept deeply breathing lightly and evenly but francis hepburn lay awake his anger growing with each minute once again he wished the role of warlock often attributed to him were true had it been he would cheerfully have disposed of both his cousins however he knew that the woman sleeping within his arms was even now still emotionally bound to her husband and he would not grieve her further by hurting glenkirk james was a different matter though and francis hepburn was going to think long and hard on the vengeance hed wreak on his cousin in the meantime he would offer his house and his heart to the beautiful countess of glenkirk in the weeks that followed cat stayed hidden within bothwells lodge there were no servants to gossip about them and they were content to do for themselves sometimes francis hepburn would go on a border raid with bis men leaving her alone for a day or more she never minded enjoying the solitude of the late winter and needing the time to heal he had not used her physically since that first night and she had not asked him to but each night he was with her she slept content in the safety of his arms the earl of bothwell was deeply in love for the first time in his life though he realized this love might come to an end he intended enjoying whatever time they shared he adored her beauty but had catriona leslie been the ugliest woman alive he would still have loved her she was an educated woman who unlike his estranged wife could converse with a man on a great many subjects more important she was a good listener and had the charming knack of letting a man believe that whatever he saidno matter how banalwas interesting she was warm and she had an outrageous sense of humor that matched his her beauty was merely a bonus in early spring bothwell returned from a raid into england bringing with him a long delicately worked gold chain set with tiny topazes ranging from palest gold to deepest taupe he slipped it over her head now yer a true border wench he said softly yer man has brought ye back some booty she smiled teasingly up at him whose pretty neck did ye take it from he grinned back at her if ye must know i liberated it from an overstocked jeweler who made the mistake of getting caught in our raid he looked down at her and suddenly unable to help himself caught her to him and kissed her hungrily she trembled but grasped bis head and kissed him strongly in return francis hepburns blue eyes looked gravely into cats leafgreen ones she stood barefooted on tiptoe her arms about his neck his hands moved gently to undo her dressing gown unwinding her arms and sliding the robe off to reveal her nakedness taking her face in his hands he bent and kissed her deeply then his mouth gently touched her eyelids her face her throat his slim hands tangled in her honeycolored hair and then moved down to her shoulders his mouth moved to her chest and then to her soft breasts he slid to his knees and his lips traveled to her navel and then to the tiny mole cats whole body was quivering and as her legs gave way she slipped to her knees too and their lips met bothwell was deeply shaken tell me yea or tell me nay my darling but tell me now he whispered hoarsely for ill tell ye true my sweet cat i want ye as i have never wanted any woman but tis you i want not a shadow bothwell she whispered softly and he saw her face was radiant bothwell i feel i feel oh my lord i want ye very much he drew her down to the fur rug the crackling fire cast shadows over them as he stood tall above her to pull off his clothing she smiled reassuringly up at him he was the first man she had chosen in her whole life her husband had been picked for her by her greatgrandmother and the king had forced her but she had chosen francis hepburn and desired him very much kneeling he gently turned her over and kissed the nape of her neck his lips moved down across her shoulders and traveled the length of her spine he was gentle beyond belief and she shivered deliciously placing her on her back he caressed her lovely breasts they grew taut beneath his delicate touch the rosy nipples becoming hard and pointed he buried his face in the valley between them his lips burning into her skin she moaned softly he smiled with relief her head was thrown back her eyes closed her breath came in quick little gasps in his travels francis hepburn had made love a great deal and had learned from many women he now used his skill on the only woman he had ever truly loved his desire being to prolong her pleasure kissing the soft flesh of her breasts he felt her heart pound wildly beneath his lips he caught a tantalizing nipple in his teeth and bit it gently she moaned again and her hips began to move with the rhythm of love his lips began to wander francis she cried out dear god francis yell drive me mad do ye really want me to stop my darling his eyes were laughing silence was his answer he gauged how far he might drive her he opened her legs and drawing them over his shoulders gently pulled her nether lips apart and tenderly kissed the soft coral flesh she shuddered violently once but forbade him not his tongue caressed and probed and she cried out in pleasure her body arching her response fired him and when he could bear it no longer he pulled himself up and over her and drove his throbbing manroot deep into her softness she received him joyfully wrapping her long legs and her arms about him once within her he was able again to restrain himself their bodies moved in rhythm together seeking to pleasure each other then she whispered urgently to him francis i can hold back no longer but he forced her to ease off and then increased her desire to a higher peak she was buffeted by the force of his passion and frankly amazed that anyone could give such pleasure she had never been loved like this and when he at last allowed her release she cried out in delighted wonder to feel him coming too still coupled they lay breathing deeply damp with their exertion then suddenly she cried out with genuine surprise my god francis yer growing hard again wiin me oh yes my lover yes yes yes and it began again he was himself amazed at his bodys response for he could not seem to get enough of her cat was insatiable tonight she matched him passion for passion until they were both so exhausted that they slept where they lay unaware that the fire had gone out and the room had grown chill he awoke to find her dropping a blanket over him he pulled her down and kissed her good morning my darling the radiance of her smile reassured him good morning my lover she answered him her mind was clear she felt no shame she gently disentangled herself from his grasp im fair frozen francis let me go and ill light the fire he watched her with a mixture of affection and admiration as she rekindled the fire within minutes the flames were leaping and she turned her back to the fire he sighed ah my darling to be the flames that warm yer pretty bottom oh bothwell she laughed coloring becomingly yer a wicked man aye my darling i am he cocked an eyebrow at her come warm me my pet tis chill and lonely beneath this blanket she slid underneath the plaid wool and drew him into her arms and against her body warmer now my lord his eyes sparkled with amusement ye could bring heat into a stone statue and ye know it my sweet love tenderly he kissed her where were ye cat where were ye all these years he fell silent then thinking of the night just past i love ye catriona main he said and she was startled that he knew her baptismal name i hae never said that to a woman and meant it he continued but as god is my witness i love ye her eyes were bright with tears bothwell oh bothwell dinna love me how can ye love me a woman who lay wi the king and then ran away from her husbands honest wrath into the arms of yet another man how can ye love me ye didna lay willingly wi jamie cat there is no refusing the king i could kill him for forcing ye and patrick she asked what of my husband i would kill him too if i didna know it would grieve ye he had the right to be angry but not wi ye and to do to ye what he did what would ye hae done to me if i had been yer wife francis if ye had been my wife jamie would nae have dared to force ye but he continued seeing her urgency if he had dared i would hae killed him wiout a second thought ye i would hae beaten for being so lovely poor patrick she said softly the look on his face when he saw jamie fondling me god francis he was so terribly hurt bothwells lip curled so he eased his hurt by getting drunk wi jamie and taking turns wi the king in raping his own wife the earl exploded be quit of them both cat i have been meaning to divorce margaret for some time now ill do it and ye must divorce glenkirk and marry me i love ye i want ye and by god ill keep ye safe from the royal stewart stunned she could only stare at him my children she finally managed ill gie ye all the bairns ye want and if ye must hae yer wee leslies ill take them gladly i think patrick might hae something to say about that she said wryly bothwells blue eyes looked into her green eyes i dinna want to talk about patrick he said softly and his mouth found hers she yielded easily though her conscience troubled her slightly her feelings for francis hepburn were deeper even than she knew his mouth gently touched her forehead her closed eyelids the tip of her little nose she murmured contentedly and he laughed in spite of himself a fine thing he teased i seek to rouse yer deepest passions and instead ye make contented noises like a wellfed bairn she giggled but ye make me feel content my lord good he said because i intend keeping ye here all day theres never been a woman yet madame that ive wanted to keep in bed all day but were not in bed she pointed out were on the floor under a plaid and if one of yer great borderers should come clumping in she paused and her eyes twinkled mischievouslywell my lord yer already grand reputation will become legendary roaring with laughter francis hepburn stood up and pulling her after him carried her upstairs where he unceremoniously dumped her on the bed ill build the fire this time he said bending to light the kindling will ye indeed my lord she asked provocatively francis hepburn turning to look at the beautiful countess of glenkirk knew that if the night just past had been sweet the day would be sweeter yet chapter patrick leslie had awakened late the morning after his return to holyrood palace with an ache in his head and a mouth that tasted of old flannel reaching for cat brought back with tremendous shock the events of the previous evening for a moment he lay perfectly still unable to absorb the memories tumbling in on him james and catriona then he and the king and cat oh my god he whispered stumbling to his feet he crossed the room to the fireplace wall touched a piece of carving on the mantel and watched miserably as the secret door swung open shutting it again he returned to the bed and felt the place where she had lain the sheets were icy and he knew she had been gone for hours he checked the trunk at the foot of the bed and found her riding clothes gone the mantel clock chimed ten dressing quickly patrick leslie sought the captain of the guard i want to speak wi all the men on duty last night when was the guard last changed at six this morning my lord and before that midnight sir those are the men i want captain the ones who took duty at midnight how many were on gate duty six men two at the main gate two at the back gate and two at the servants postern patrick thought a moment the average person would have gone out through the back or the servants gate send me the men who were on the main gate he said despite the violent emotions tearing through him he could not help but chuckle wryly at discovering that he was right a messenger for glenkirk had passed through the main gate a few minutes before five that morning he sought his interview with the king through barra the chamberboy he made it very clear that if james would not grant him immediate audience he would go to the queen within the hour barra was guiding him through the secret passage the king was still abed having awakened with as big a hangover as glenkirks patrick wasted no time ye remember what we did last night the king flushed i was drunk he muttered so was i replied his cousin but tis still no excuse for rape shes gone ye knowon horseback out the main gate before five this morning i intend making her excuses to the queen and then i am going after her when i find her i shall get down on my knees and beg her forgiveness i only pray she will gie it me though i am not at all sure she will do so remembering what we did to her i couldna blame her if she refused we shall remain at home at glenkirk from now on cousin james ever loyal to the stewarts but absent from this cesspool ye call a court james stewart nodded ye hae my permission he said the earl of glenkirk returned him a look that plainly said he didnt care whether the king gave him permission or not then he found the question torn from him was she willing jamie was my wife wg to whore for ye there was a long silence and then the king lowered his eyes and whispered nay you bastard said patrick leslie softly if ye were anyone else id kill ye turning he reentered the secert passageway and closed it behind him dashing into his own bedroom he found ellen startled by his abrupt entrance from the passage pack everything that belongs to us were returning to glenkirk and well nae be back my lady began ellen left early this morning he said now hurry i want to be out of here by afternoon he went next to the queen and told her that he had returned late last night to fetch his wife their eldest daughter was seriously ill cat had left early this morning begging him to make her excuses since it might be some months until she could return the earl of glenkirk offered to sell his wifes position to whichever lady the queen chose he would then buy the position for that lady thus enriching the queens private coffers anna always needed money it was a very generous offer and though she regretted losing the lovely countess of glenkirk anna stewart had been worried lately that there were so many lovely ladies about her it wasnt her husband who concerned her for she thought smugly he was quite unaffected by other beautiful women but beautiful young girls attracted too many men and invariably complications arose she decided to give the open position to the widowed daughter of old lord kerr the lady was a good woman past thirty and not particularly pretty protocol satisfied patrick leslie gave orders to his people to return to glenkirk immediately then he set out alone for his castle cat already had a sevenhour start on him and when he caught up with her he wanted to settle their differences away from prying eyes as he rode he relived the previous night seeing clearly now all the things his injured pride had refused to acknowledge then cat had begged him to take her from court but he had begun to enjoy it himself and had put her off ashamed of being forced into an intimate relationship with the king yet equally fearful of his discovering that relationship she had been helplessly caught in a trap when he had walked into their bedroom to find the king fondling his wifes naked breasts his reaction had been shock followed by fury at his wife how could he have misjudged her so in all these years she had never given him reason to doubt her now looking back he saw again her frightened white face staring out at him from the pier glass later when they were taking turns raping her he saw her leafgreen eyes mirroring shock anguish disbelief and finally a blankness that was the most terrible of all patrick leslie rode steadily north and east and as he rode he prayed that his wife would be waiting at glenkirk another problem facing him was what to tell his mother and the children they were all old enough to know something was wrong he was grateful that his two oldest boys were in service the younger children were easy but he did not want to face his eldest son and heir thirteenyearold jamie leslie adored his beautiful mother and between them existed a special closeness cat loved all her children but jamie had always been her bairn when the towers of glenkirk came into sight several days later the earl kicked dubh into a gallop and the great black stallion scenting home responded eagerly patrick quickly sought out his mother margaret the dowager countess of glenkirk was still one of the most beautiful women in scotland rising to her feet at the sight of her eldest son she held out her arms my darling i didnt expect ye back so soon is aught amiss he entered the security of that embrace and then leading her over to the privacy of a windowseat sat down with her i hae done a terrible thing mother a terrible thing to cat and i hae probably lost her kneeling he put his head into her lap and wept the sound he made was terriblegreat tearing sobs wrenched up from deep within him his broad shoulders shook and meg leslie stunned touched his head gently and said tell me patrick tell me what ye hae done to catriona mastering his emotions he slowly and carefully told his mother what had happened meg closed her eyes when he reached the part about the rape she must still have some feeling for ye patrick said his mother for had it been me i would hae stuck a knife into ye before i fled and to answer yer unasked questionno she is not here what made ye think she would be where else could she go mother greyhaven acuil nay heather was here yesterday and said nothing ye may be sure that if cat had gone home to greyhaven her mother would have been all atwitter with worry and told me and she is not at acuil cats brothers have been up there hunting wolves and came yesterday with heather to bring me some skins then where is she he asked christ in his heaven where has she hidden herself ye want her back said meg why patrick so ye may punish her further for not killing herself at james stewarts first advance would ye hae preferred a dead and pure wife to a live albeit slightly used one gods toenail my idiot son its nae as if james took the droit du seigneur of yer virgin bride and why in heavens name did ye assume her the guilty party undoubtedly because she is but a weak woman fool has she ever given ye cause for doubt never she has been a loving wife since the day she married ye though now i think perhaps she must have had a premonition of disaster when she tried to escape yer marriage shes been a good wife and a good mother to yer six bairns meg stood up and paced furiously back and forth ye dinna deserve her patrick now get the hell out of my sight my lord earl i detest fools and ye are a great fool ye disgust me pulling her skirts back so as not to touch him the dowager countess swept angrily from the room he stood where she had left him thinking that he also disgusted himself so ye found out came his brother adams voice the earl turned i didna know ye were here he said dully just arrived i was on yer trail the whole way ellen came to see me before she left edinburgh how did ye find out i came back to holyrood to find the kings hands all over my wifes naked tits did ye know and ellen too am i the only one at court who didnt know that the king was fucking my wife no one knew patrick except ellen because she is cats tiring woman and me because when james first delivered his ultimatum to cat she came to me for help i told no one not even fiona my wife came to ye for help and ye sent her into the kings bed was that yer idea of helping us leaping the distance between them patrick leslie hit his younger brother square on the jaw adam staggered back his hand came up to rub his injured chin the earl advanced on him ill kill ye for this brother the younger leslies hand went to his dirk and whipping it out he held it before him for gods sake patrick listen to me for a minute the earl stopped james threatened to confiscate our estates and put us to the horn he was all ready wi trumpedup charges for he was determined to have cat and knew she would protect her family at whatever cost to herself she was terrified she didna want to lie wi the king but neither did she want everything lost that was yers or ours it is not permitted for a woman to refuse the king ye know that and even if she had refused jamie would have taken everything then what would have happened to all of us to mother and the bairns yes i told cat to yield there was no other way if ye had been in my position what would ye have done patricks hands fell to his side do ye know what i did to her adam when i found her wi jamie i got drunk wi the king and then we took turns wi her all night brother drink and fuck drink and fuck shes run away from me brother i would gie my life to find her and beg her forgiveness christ man said adam leslie in shocked disbelief what a fool ye are i dinna think shell ever forgie ye for that but ill help ye to find her god knows ye dinna deserve her where hae ye looked our house in edinburgh here mother tells me shes nae at greyhaven or at acuil shes obviously not in yer house or yed hae told me could she hae gone to sithean ill ride over said adam ostensibly to bring fionas greetings to her parents if theres been any word our sister janet will know and tell us but they soon knew that cat was not at sithean nor was she hiding in crannog village with old ruth they had exhausted all the logical possibilities and in the days that followed they checked back in edinburgh with the kiras cat had not withdrawn any of her vast funds either in person or through an intermediary the earl of glenkirk was becoming genuinely frightened his wife has disappeared over a month ago without a trace and without funds to sustain her there were only two answers either someone was hiding catand they could think of no one with whom she was that friendly or else she was dead chapter francis hepburn awoke at first light and lay quietly for a few minutes enjoying the silence before the birdsong turning carefully he looked at cat she lay curled into a tight ball like a small child in sleep she looked so innocent suddenly she awoke opened her green eyes and stretched good morrow my lord she smiled up at him he smiled back thinking how very much he wanted to make love to her now i hae a surprise for ye today cat im taking ye riding a frightened look come into her eyes patrick she said patrick will eventually find ye my darling but twill be a long time before word gets to him and then i promise to protect ye only someone who knows ye could tell him anyhow and my people are loyal to me they could see ye ride naked the length of the shire and would nae admit to it she laughed all right my lover but i will need fresh clothes mine are worn and id nae shame ye look in the trunk by the door cat i brought some things back from my last raid she admired the silk underclothes several pairs of green trunk hose in finely spun sheer wool and a halfdozen creamcolored silk shirts with pearl buttons there was a soft brown leather jerkin with small buttons of polished staghorn banded in silver and a wide brown leather belt with a silverandtopaz buckle it didnt take cat more than a minute to realize that he had had the clothes made for her she rose from the trunk and turned yer so good to me bothwell she said softly thank ye he got up from the bed ill get ye some water to bathe he answered gruffly she blocked his way standing on tiptoe she wrapped her arms about his neck and kissed him his hands stroked her long back and her soft silken buttocks christ you witch dinna tempt me now but he was already hard hungry for her sweeping her up he lay her back on their bed his lips found hers again and his body gently possessed her body she sighed happily and francis hepburn laughed low little witch why can i never get enough of ye or i of you my lover she murmured afterwards they fell asleep and it was not until the sun was well up that they awoke again he brought water and they washed going to the little trunk she chose a set of lacetrimmed underwear a shirt trunk hose the jerkin and belt when she had finished dressing she found he wore a matching costume cat bound her hair back with a green velvet ribbon and with a smile bothwell placed a small bonnet of hepburn plaid on her golden head yell need new boots lass he dug deep into her trunk and pulled out a pair they were as soft as butter yell find some silk and lace nightgowns in there too how did ye do it francis how she pulled the boots on im the wizard earl remember laughing they descended the stairs and left the lodge cats bay gelding iolaire and bothwells great darkred stallion valentine awaited them they spent the day riding the northumbrian hills that separated scotland from england when hunger overtook them they stopped at a small cottage the welcome was warm for bothwell and his lady dark bread warm from the oven with fresh sweet butter a broiled rabbit and brown october ale satisfied them ye eat well here on the borders cat remarked to the woman of the house she had a disturbingly familiar look my father was the last earl james hepburn laughed the woman whom bothwell called maggie cousin francis sees were well taken care of dont ye lovey the earl smiled at maggie i do though keeping up wi uncle james obligations is a mighty task made greater she shot back at him by yer desire to better his record they laughed francis kissed maggies cheek then he helped cat into her saddle and mounting valentine led the way back over the hills he did not however take her back to the lodge i want to go to hermitage he said quietly tis my home and i want ye there will ye come wi me yes she answered him i am nae ashamed to be yer woman francis i dinna think of ye as my woman cat i think of ye as my wife perhaps not in the eyes of your church or the kirk or even in the eyes of our fellow men but as god created us he meant us to be together i intend that we shall be my darling they rode proudly into hermitage together and cat discovered that he had prepared for her hoping she would come with him the rooms of the countess of bothwell with its bedroom adjoining the earls awaited her they were newly refurbished with deepblue velvet draperies and bed hangings and a bedspread embroidered with the hepburn lions in gpld these rooms hae nae been used since the earls mother lady janet died said the little maid and continued the girl before that queen mary stayed here what a todo the earl created my lady to get these rooms ready for ye he told the housekeeper he was nae sure if yed even come but if ye did he wanted the rooms fresh and inviting it took a dozen women ten days to sew the bedspread alone what of lady margaret asked cat does she not stay here when she is at hermitage nay replied nell her ladyship doesna come to hermitage at all she doesna like it it frightens her being so close to the border her first husband was scott of buccleuch from near here she was caught in several raids and it terrified her she told the earl when they married that shed nae come here ever she loves crichton best then embarrassed by her talkativeness she said hurriedly yell be wanting a bath after yer long ride ill have it brought right up bustling out she left the countess of glenkirk to look about her bedroom in amazement it was a square paneled room with two great leaded windows to her left each with a builtin window seat each seat held a tufted paleblue velvet cushion directly in front of her was a large stone fireplace with a carved marble mantel behind her was the door from the antechamber to her right was the door to francis bedroom the polished oak floors were covered in thick turkish carpets mostly blues and golds with a touch of rose the furniture was sparse as was usual in a scots house on the wall near the antechamber door was a tall wardrobe on the wall facing the windows was the huge bed and a nightstand between the windows a round highly polished table held a large ovalshaped silver bowl filled with coralpink winter roses by the fireplace was a settle and a large comfortable chair scattered about the room were other simple chairs burying her face in the roses she inhaled their heady fragrance from my greenhouses he said proudly she turned to face him her eyes were wet the darkgold lashes separated i am always saying thank you to ye francis somehow it doesna ever seem enough ye hae brought me the first real happiness i have ever known my precious love he gathered her into his arms and she felt the depth of his love in the heart beating wildly beneath her cheek no longer could catriona leslie deny her emotions they swept over her in a great tide looking up into the rugged handsome face of francis hepburn she said i love ye bothwell may god hae mercy on us both but i love ye and i would sooner die than be parted from ye my lord a great sigh of relief escaped the big earl and bending he took possession of the sweet mouth offered him cat oh cat he murmured against her lips his arms tightened about her at that moment the maid returned with a coterie of servants they carried a tall oak tub and several caldrons of hot water bothwell released cat i thought we might eat by the fire in the antechamber until then madame her eyes followed him as he returned to his own room ordering the other servants away nell went about the business of preparing the countess bath climbing the steps to the tub she poured a thin stream of clear liquid into the steaming water almost immediately the room was scented with the smell of lilacs she left cat to soak while she chose a simple gown from cats wardrobe it was pale lavender silk with long flowing sleeves and a deep v neckline having done this she returned to cat washed her lovely hair and scrubbed her back wrapping cat in a large towel she sat her by the fire and dried the long hair using first a rough towel then a hairbrush and finally a piece of silk to give it shine last nell pared cats fingernails and toenails and plucked her free of extraneous body hair cat remained silent through all of this she loved bothwell and he loved her what would happen to them she did not know there were so many other lives involved but for now it was all right nell helped her into the silk gown fastened the pearl buttons beneath her full breasts and slid a pair of kid slippers on her feet where are my riding clothes she asked the servant ive sent yer shirt and hose to the laundress madame everything else is in the wardrobe and will has gone to the lodge for yer trunk thank ye nell ye may go now ill nae need ye again this evening thank ye my lady but let me see to the removal of the tub before i go and ill take the spread from the bed also cat smiled her thanks at the girl and then went into the antechamber to await her lover a decanter and two goblets sat on a silver tray on a table and she poured herself some pale gold wine to still her pounding heart there were so many problems but she did not want to think of them tonight all she wanted now was him his strong arms about her and his mouth on hers she wanted his laughter and sharp wit two hefty servants lugged the tub from her bedroom and then returned for the tub from the earls bedroom nell left bidding cat good night the earls man albert finished up and left cat waited expectantly he came through the door wearing dark trunk hose a white silk shirt buttoned up to the neck a wide leather belt with a goldandruby buckle and soft leather slippers she flew to him holding her away from him he asked is it true what ye said to me before a smile lit her face i love ye bothwell i love ye i love ye now my lord do ye believe me aye i believe ye my darling i was only afraid that in my passion i had fooled myself into imagining you said those words he drew her against him and gently kissed the tip of her nose the gown becomes ye as i knew it would another something ye picked up on one of yer raids she teased him tis a surprisingly good fit he chuckled and lightly brushed his fingers across her chest it lacks one thing turn around she turned and he clasped a necklace of pale golden pearls about her neck moving her around again he put a matching pearl teardrop on each of her ears there he said quietly perfection made better if possible these belong to ye come what may patrick hepburn the first earl of bothwell gave them to his bride he gazed at her with open admiration christ ye hae flawless skin cat ive never seen pearls look so beautiful servants entered bearing silver trays of food the earl led cat to the table and seated her he had ordered an excellent supper in superb taste they began with cold raw oysters which cat adored and finished with a flaky tart of early strawberries from the hermitage greenhouses cat ate with gusto amused he encouraged her handing over to her the last piece of tart when she had finished and bathed her hands he spoke in a mockserious voice now madame ye must pay for yer meal leading her over to the settle by the fireplace he sat her down i want to sketch ye my love perhaps ill do a wax model later and then sculpt ye my god she laughed ye sculpt thats what that waximage nonsense was about thats why they say ye practice the black arts oh the fools the ignorant fools bothwell grimaced oh yes he said my enemies would have poor gullible cousin jamie believe that i make wax images of him to stick pins into he picked up a lap easel and fastening a piece of paper on it began cat sat perfectly still thinking how lucky she was to be with him she had never known such happiness existed and if he had asked her to accompany him into the fires of hell she would have gone without question her eyes caressed him she blushed thinking she would rather be in bed with him than sitting here posing at last he put down his work his eyes caught hers ye are reading my thoughts she exclaimed he smiled lazily it isna hard to read yer thoughts when ye blush like that besides mine are similar come my sweet love let us to bed he stood and offered her his hand she rose why francis for thirteen years i lived a contented healthy life wi patrick but wi ye she paused seeking the right words wi ye tis differenttis complete did ye always love patrick he asked he was the only man i ever knew greyhaven is very isolated my greatgrandmother betrothed me to patrick when i was just four he is nine years my senior we were wed when i was sixteen i wasna sure i even wanted to marry him then he had a reputation as a terrible rake and he was so arrogant bothwell chuckled to himself imagining his stubborn cat coming up against an equally stubborn glenkirk still continued cat we dealt well together he is a kind man and i love our bairns but ye do not really love him said francis hepburn yet yer lot has been better than mine yer a healthy woman cat who enjoys her bedsport wiout being lewd my dear countess detests the physical aspects of marriage had she been able to get her hands on my fortune by means other than bearing me children she would have done so but yer bairns surely ye love them francis in a way but margaret has raised them to be cold and correct they dinna have the hepburn or the stewart charm they tolerate me it doesna make for a warm relationship i am so sorry my love she said why he smiled down at her for the first time in my life i am in love i am in love wi ye my precious cat god help me how i love ye and ye my darling ye too are in love for the first time in yer life and i am the fortunate man oh bothwell she whispered what are we to do i dinna know cat i hae no easy answers but i will find a solution to our dilemma i promise ye that putting an arm about her shoulders he led the way into her bedroom gently he removed her pearls and placed them on the table next he opened the lavender gown took it from her and placed it over a chair she pulled the pins from her hair and it tumbled down her back he caught his breath in delight at the perfection of her lovely breasts glowing golden in the candlelight having kicked her slippers off she walked barefooted over to him and her slender fingers tremblingly unbuttoned his shirt and removed it then turning she walked over to the bed while he finished undressing and got into it trembling she awaited him and then he was with her beneath the feather coverlet he drew her lush body against his slender length and held her close they stayed that way for what seemed an eternity allowing the warmth of their bodies to mingle cat wondered if francis felt the same desperate hunger that she did she could not call it lust the feelings she had ran too deep even the supreme act of possession did not entirely satisfy her he entered her pushing deep within her pulsing warmth and straining to go further he cried out ah god tis not enough cat wept with joy at the knowledge that his love for her was as deep as hers for him chapter winter deepened into early spring the traditional time for raiding the borders bothwell had not gone along on many of these ventures preferring to stay with cat his men missed him greatly and finally bothwells bastard halfbrother hercules stewart spoke to the countess about the problem could i go too hercules she asked him he grinned at her to be sure my lady if francis will permit ye can ye use a sword or a pistol bothwell asked when he was confronted by his halfbrother and cat well enough she replied my eldest brother taught me he tested her and satisfied said yell do but he instructed hercules not to leave cats side so she rode out with bothwell and his borderers first at night and then on daylight raids unafraid she fought the english with a gusto that delighted the earls men yet she was kind to those of her own sex and tender with the children soon stories began to filter out of the borders stories about the beautiful lady who rode with bothwell and his men south from edinburgh rode bothwells sometime friend lord home he was curious about these stories and wanted to see for himself home rode alone he wanted no gossiping servants along it was late afternoon as he neared hermitage stopping for a minute to gaze at the great castle in the distance hearing hoofbeats behind him he drew into a strand of trees and waited he recognized bothwells stallion valentine but the sleek golden bay beside was unfamiliar the two horses raced straight towards him then pulled up in the grass just short of his hiding place he could see bothwells face easily and heard exclaim i win madamel pay yer forfeit the laughter that greeted bothwells words was soft and home leaned eagerly forward but the woman turned and he could not see her face clearly name your forfeit my lord she called in a clear voice bothwell cocked a wicked eyebrow reaching up he lifted the woman down from her horse oh francis the woman laughed again hepburns arms closed about her lord home could see only her profile which told him little home was struck by the look of tenderness and love on his friends face aftergazing rapturously at his love for some time bothwell said christ my darling how much i love ye come let us go home will ye race me again he lifted her back onto her horse again home was frustrated in his attempt to see the womans face for her back was to him if i win francis i shall claim a larger forfeit than one kiss her meaning was obvious and home almost choked jesu what a wench this woman was bothwell laughed low and replied if ye beat me madame smacking the golden bay on the rump to give cat a head start he mounted valentine and galloped off after her lord home remained hidden for some minutes what he had just witnessed had shaken him somewhat he had known francis hepburn for many years at one time they had even been enemies but youthful vanities soothed they later became friends home had never seen bothwell look so relaxed or so peaceful he had wenched enough with the man to know that hepburn never took any woman seriously not even his cold correct countess yet home was sure the lord of hermitage took this woman absolutely seriously mounting his own horse home headed down the hills to the great castle his curiosity was truly aroused now in the courtyard he was met by hercules stewart who offered greetings and took his horse ill go get francis hes just ridden in and will be glad to see ye lord home waited in an antechamber grinning to himself wondering who had won the horse race suddenly the door burst open and bothwell strode in he grasped homes hand warmly by god sandy tis good to see ye what brings ye to hermitage the big earl busied himself with a decanter and two heavy glasses curiosity francis curiosity is what brings me there are stories in edinburgh that ye ride the borders wi a beautiful woman by yer side the court is fascinated shall i go back and tell them that lord bothwell has mocked them again tis but a lad in a wig is it not bothwell handed alexander home a glass of his smoky whisky and smiled lazily do ye want to meet her sandy do ye want to meet my lady i have by the way asked margaret for a divorce homes eyebrows shot up i have told margaret that i will sign over to the children everything except hermitage bothwell continued what is yer news sandy alexander home thoughtfully sniffed his whisky and then sipped at it am i to understand that francis stewarthepburn the man who is called the uncrowned king of scotland has finally fallen in love bothwell did not answer him directly he pulled the bellcord and said to the servant answering it ask my lady if she will join us the two men sat in companionable silence for the next few minutes until the door opened bothwell leaped forward putting a protective arm about the beautiful young woman sandy may i present catriona lady leslie cat this is my old friend sandy home lord home bowed over the slender hand offered him and then looked up into the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen his mind reeled over the announcement of her identity she smiled and gently disengaged her hand from his grasp yes lord home i am the same catriona leslie who is the countess of glenkirk and yes lord home i am she who is called the virtuous countess he flushed madame i he fought for the words she helped him out yer surprised to see me here my lord francis is free to tell ye the truth of the matter if he so chooses now i must go speak to the housekeeper about seeing to yer comfort she turned to bothwell ill have dinner served in the small dining room will ye join us cat aye she smiled again at lord home then turned and left good lord bothwell swore alexander home catriona leslie does glenkirk know where she is he explained that she went home to nurse a sickly bairn and he sold her position at court good said bothwell ill nae allow her back at court and to answer yer question sandyno glenkirk doesna know where she is she has written to her uncle the abbot of glenkirk abbey asking him to arrange for a divorce how did this start asked home glenkirk and his wife were considered happy damn me francis yeve fooled them again all that time ye claimed not to be sleeping wi her how they laughed at court atyer claims of friendship hepburns met his match they said for she will nae spread her legs for him or for any man other than her husband and all that time ye were sleeping wi her home slapped his thigh and roared then he heard bothwell say quietly no sandy that is nae the way it began fill yer glass again man and ill tell ye the truth of the matter lord home needed no encouragement for francis hepburn made the best whisky on the border possibly even in all of scotland settling himself back in his chair he listened first with amazement then with growing horror and finally with outrage god help me finished the earl fve loved her from the first but i nae expected to win her away from glenkirk the damned fool to throw away anything so precious even if ye both gain yer freedom said lord home quietly james stewart will never let ye wed damn me francis ye grew up a bit wi the royal bairn ye know how vindictive he can be and ye can hardly keep it a secret that yer divorcing angus daughter and what of glenkirk when he learns his wife seeks her freedom and where she is hell come roaring out of the north like a storm he may hae lost his head in a moment of anger but ill wager he still loves his wife and wants her back shell nae go said bothwell firmly and id nae let her look sandy ye know they call me the uncrowned king of scotland i dinna seek my cousins throne but ye canna convince jamie of that when cat and i are safely wed we intend spending most of our time in italy i will only retain hermitage for the son she will someday gie me that is the price cat and i will pay to the king for our happinessexile from our beloved land as to the earl of glenkirk hell cooperate or cat will threaten to tell the whole story jamie will nae allow that he has his position as king and as head of the kirk ah sandy ive waited all my life for happiness and at last i have it i never thought it possible lord home shook his head it was all too simple much much too simple he hoped for francis sake that it could be made to work bothwell had always been restless a great mind educated far beyond his time he was constantly defending his actions to lesser men love had calmed him he was quieter less formidable alexander home did not know catriona leslie beyond court gossip but any woman who could exert such a strong emotional influence over the earl of bothwell had to be quite a woman he chuckled and damned if hepburn dinna have all the luck she was a beauty to boot home decided to stay at hermitage and learn more about the countess of glenkirk he remained during the late part of the springa rare spring of unparalleled good weather continuing into the summer he rode with them on border raids and felt the same pride in the lovely highland countess as did bothwell and his men home was touched by the charming ritual the lovers performed before each venture bothwell would turn to cat and say a bothwell to which she would reply softly a leslie they dared not utter clan warcries aloud on the english side of the border returning safely over the border to their own land francis hepburn would more often than not take cat from the back of her own horse and place her in front of him on valentine one strong hand holding the reins and the other arm wrapped about his mistresss slim waist they rode together talking intimately lord homes boyhood nanny had spoken of true love but as he had grown and matured home had learned that in matters between men and women of rank there were only two paths there was the dynastic path in which marriages were arranged to the best possible advantage of both families with no real consideration for the people involved and there was lust neither of these cases explained what had happened between the earl of bothwell and the countess of glenkirk alexander home realized that he was witnessing true love at first hand satisfied that cat leslie was no adventuress out to take advantage of his friend sandy home finally took his leave of the couple and returned to his home at hirsel chapter david douglas the earl of angus was a quiet man he avoided trouble he disliked scenes he was at present in his daughters house at crichton and had just finished reading the letter sent her by her estranged husband well father what shall i do david douglas winced slightly margarets voice was harsh it annoyed him andlalways had what do ye wish to do my dear i dinna believe ye hae not already made up yer mind do ye love him margaret nay she answered then what is it he has asked ye for a divorce offering ye everything he owns except hermitage do ye want hermitage too nay i hate the place then gie him what he wants daughter but why does he ask me for a divorce now hes always been happy enough living apart from me divorce was not mentioned before surely yeve heard the rumors margaret tis said a woman rides wi him now when he raids into england it may be he wishes to wed this mysterious amazon a fit mate for him sneered margaret come daughter said angus be quit of bothwell sooner or later he will clash openly wi the king he and james have always rubbed against each other i dinna want ye and yer bairns caught in that fight ye are right father said the countess of bothwell and it is better that i take all i can get now will ye see to the arrangements of course my dear david douglas patted her hand he was pleased he could always count on margaret to be cool and sensible at glenkirk abbey abbot charles leslie pondered a letter from his niece the countess of glenkirk in which she requested that he obtain her a divorce from patrick leslie divorce was not unusual in scotland among the nobility of either church but charles was shocked that catriona wanted her release that it should come to this after all the fuss to wed them and they had seemed so happy all these years he knew his nephew was in residence at the castle and he sent one of the monks to fetch him the first thing charles leslie noticed when his nephew arrived was that glenkirk looked tired and worn something was very wrong and charles leslie wondered why he had not been told sooner without saying a word he handed the earl the letter and while pretending to busy himself pouring the elderberry wine he covertly watched patricks face intense pain and sorrow creased glenkirks face she has not told ye why she seeks to divorce me she is justified in her actions ye know but god help me uncle i dinna want to lose her come come patrick said the abbot further startled to see this breakdown in his usually assured nephew it canna be so bad is it that little danish girl ye lay wi surely cat doesna hold that against ye nay uncle she forgave me that and that is why what i did to cat is doubly terrible charles leslie demanded an explanation upon hearing it he roared a string of oaths at his nephew tool stupid arrogant fool how could ye tell me no more ill nae let my sisters only daughter return to ye the earl protested nervously i will nae gie my consent until i have spoken wi her who delivered the letter a kira servant then i shall go to edinburgh to see the kiras said patrick leslie and i shall find cat if after she has spoken wi me she would still divorce me then ill gie my consent the earl of glenkirk rode secretly into edinburgh he did not want the king to learn of his visit james had been very wary of the leslies of glenkirk since that fatal night in february the earl explained to his edinburgh housekeeper that his visit must not be public knowledge used to dealing with the eccentricities of the leslies mrs kerr smiled cheerfully and nodded patricks next stop was the house of the kiras in goldsmiths lane both brothers greeted him and he could tell from the wary look of sympathy in benjamins eyes that the elder kira guessed the reason for his visit the amenities over and abner kira gone benjamin and the earl sat before the fire well benjamin asked glenkirk where has she hidden herself now my lord replied kira my house has served yours since the days of your greatgrandmother but i cannot divulge that information i cannot even tell you if i know where her ladyship is i could no more break faith with her than i would with you patrick had expected such an answer then can ye get a message to her ladyship benjamin i think so my lord shall i have parchment and ink brought thank ye my friend the writing materials were brought and benjamin kira left the earl alone patrick sat thinking for several minutes finally he composed the following message cati will nae gie ye yer freedom until ye hae spoken wi me face to face if ye still wish to divorce me afterwards i will nae stand in yer way i hae wronged ye but i beg of ye to hear me out i still love ye glenkirk he sanded the parchment rolled it dripped wax on it and sealed it with his signet leaving the room he handed the roll to the waiting servant gie it to yer master lad hell know what to do wi it tell him i will be at my house here in town a few minutes later benjamin kira handed the parchment to a messenger take this to lady leslie at hermitage castle he said and be sure you are not followed cat did not want to see her husband but bothwell insisted ye carina be certain in yer own mind that ye no longer love him unless ye can look him in the eye and tell him so ye can meet him at kiras house stay wi yer cousin fiona i shall go to edinburgh too i hae been meaning to do something about these stupid charges that i practice witchcraft against the king now is a good time too since margaret has agreed to gie me a divorce there must be papers to sign do ye think jamie knows about us she asked him nay no one does except home we will ride to town secretly hercules can go wi us and when we reach edinburgh he will escort ye as far as yer cousins house what if i need ye francis ill know if ye do my darling dinna fear we will complete our separate business quickly and be safe back at hermitage before ye know it so they rode to edinburgh and parted fiona leslie was delighted to see her cousin and consumed with curiosity promise me said cat promise me fiona that yell nae tell patrick i am here he stays at glenkirk house and i hae nowhere else to go if ye will not shelter me i would promise ye cat but adam is sure to tell him when her brotherinlaw arrived home cat confronted him if ye tell patrick i am here ill tell him ye advised me to sleep wi the king she threatened i hae already told him said adam rubbing his jaw in remembrance and did ye tell him ye offered me to jamie when jamie actually sought yer own wife thats nae true roared adam no tis not but i will tell glenkirk that it is and fiona will back me up wont ye cousin aye said fiona blandly her smokygray eyes twinkling at her husband adam leslie flung up his hands all right ye two bitches ye win ye hae yer refuge cat when glenkirk hears i likely as not will receive another crack on my jaw cat put her hand on her brotherinlaws arm sit down adam ye too fiona i would speak seriously wi ye both they sat looking at fiona cat said by now adam has probably told ye that james forced me into his bed for a time fiona nodded and cat continued when glenkirk found the king wi me he was furious what he did to me i will never speak of again i hae now asked him for a divorce and he will nae gie his consent unless i speak wi him face to face i hae come to edinburgh to do just that where hae ye been these last months asked fiona cat smiled ill nae tell ye that cousin adam leslie grunted and got up to pour himself some wine if she wouldnt tell she wouldnt tell but fiona had understood the softness in her cousins voice and thought with amazement my god shes in love she is in love wi another man fiona was desperate to learn the identity of cats lover but she could think of no man that cat had ever been friendly with outside the family she was determined to find out somehow however seeing fionas grim look cat laughed ill tell ye eventually fiona but not now caught fiona laughed back ye always were the deep one she returned on the following day a messenger was sent to the kiras the countess of glenkirk would arrive at their house to meet with her husband at one oclock in the afternoon if the kiras would send word to the earl informing him of the meeting glenkirk arrived promptly he was anxious to see cat sure that when he explained and apologized their estrangement would be over he had taken great pains with his appearance a young maidservant ushered him into the room where cat waited and then left closing the door behind her the countess of glenkirk wore a highnecked deepblue silk dress with ecrucolored lace cuffs her darkhoneycolored hair was braided and twisted into a severe knot on the nape of her neck it was cat and yet somehow she looked different patrick her voice was cool and there was no welcome in it he rushed forward stopping suddenly at the sight of the jeweled dirk in her hand touch me and i use it she said on you sweetheart please he pleaded yer my wife and i love ye this was not going right she laughed bitterly ye didna feel so strongly two and a half months ago when ye and the king spent the night raping me my god glenkirk i was yer good and faithful wife for thirteen years i never once gave ye cause for doubt yet the moment ye found me in the kings arms ye assumed me the guilty one simply because i was a woman are men never the guilty ones his voice shaking he slipped to his knees and caught at the hem of her dress cat cat will ye ever forgie me when i awoke the next morning and remembered all that had pastchrist ye couldna have hated me any more than i hated myself can ye nae forgive me hinny no patrick i will never forgie ye for what ye did to me do ye know what it was like for me do ye know what it was like having to allow another man possession of my body for a man lovemaking is a physical thing he hungers for a woman but once he has had her the feeling dies but for a woman lovemaking is an emotional experience her passion for a man is alive before during and even after the act of love james made me feel like a whore he used my body and it responded because ye had taught me to respond but i felt nothing for him but hate every time he pushed himself into me i hated him and i prayed ye would never know my shame for i couldna bear to hurt ye if only ye had felt the same tenderness for me patrick i could forgie ye now but when ye caught me wi the king ye punished me when ye should have defended me no my lord of glenkirk i will nae forgie ye he stood and looked down on her what of the children i want my girls she said jamie and colin are already wi rothes and robbie will go next year ye may keep the children until the divorce is settled after thati want them ye may see them at any time ye want they are all leslies of glenkirk and i would nae have them forget it nor would i have them hate their father patrick what has happened between us is not the concern of our bairns ye are generous madame he said sardonically and now that we hae settled that perhaps ye would satisfy my curiosity and tell me where ye hae been hiding all this time nay i will not tell ye patrick ye forfeited yer right to any control of my life on that night in february reaching for the bellpull on the wall she yanked it and told the little maid please see my horse is brought around cat turned once again to patrick leslie farewell my lord she nodded coldly and left him he was stunned he could hardly believe what had taken place he had lost her there had been no love at all in the beautiful leafgreen eyes that had always lit with joy at the sight of him he had willfully destroyed that catriona leslie and the woman who bad risen phoenixlike from the wreckage was not his woman nor was she ever likely to be sitting down he put his head in his hands and wept several minutes later he left the kira household and spent the rest of the day and the night that followed it getting very drunk chapter when francis stewart hepburn surrendered himself to his cousin james panicked quickly he imprisoned the earl in edinburgh castle the king an overly superstitious man was terribly frightened of witchcraft chancellor maitland knew this and in an attempt to break the back of scotlands nobility had fabricated the charges against bothwell breaking the border lord he thought would crush all resistance to james unfortunately the earls fellow nobles were most irritated by maitlands attempt to destroy their power they refused to meet to try hepburn until they did justice was at a standstill because no one else could try him cat was terrified by the news that bothwell was locked in edinburgh castle there was nothing she could do she could not even communicate with her lover for fear of the king and she had no idea how to reach hercules so she remained quietly with fiona awaiting word she would not leave edinburgh without francis it was not long before she received a message from the loyal hercules she was to come masked to the oak and thistle tavern the following afternoon and ask for mr prior cat was in a fever of impatience at two the next afternoon she slipped from the house and walked quickly through the june afternoon it was raining slightly which was to the good as few people were on the streets to see her entering the tavern she inquired for mr prior and was shown a private parlor in the back of the building on the ground floor there was hercules she barely allowed time for the maidservants exit before asking francis enormously comfortable in a large wellfurnished tworoom apartment said bothwells halfbrother eating and drinking the best that money can buy a favorite with his captors but beginning to be bored by jamies shillyshallying what do ye want me to do she cried francis has decided that too much more of the kings hospitality could kill him chuckled hercules so hell be leaving edinburgh shortly can ye hide him for a few hours a day at most aye at my cousin fionas ye know the house my brotherinlaw adam leaves tomorrow for glenkirk hell be gone about two weeks but no more can francis escape within that time hercules stewart nodded within the week my lady ill be ready is there some signal ye can gie me so ill know when a boy will deliver a bunch of wild red roses and white heather to ye twill be that night he poured out some red wine and handed her a goblet drink it madame ye look worn she smiled at him and accepted the wine i hae been so worried she admitted i knew nothing but what the gossips in the marketplace said and i didna dare inquire too closely hercules looked at her how did that rogue of a brother of mine do it how did he get the loveliest and bravest woman in this wild land to fall in love wi him he gave her a grin so like bothwells that her heart turned over hes always been lucky the devil she couldnt help but laugh i am the one whos lucky hercules he is a great man my francis she picked up her cloak from the settle i had best go now ill be waiting for yer signal the following day adam leslie left edinburgh leaving his wife and cat alone in the house almost immediately fiona was at her younger cousin demanding to know the name of cats lover cat laughed not yet ona but in a few days ye will not only know his name but yell meet him fiona gnashed her teeth in frustration two afternoons later an urchin knocked at the door of fionas house handing the maid a bouquet of white heather and wild red roses he said fer the lady o glenkirk exclaiming her delight the little maid put the bouquet in a silver bowl and brought it to the countess fiona raised an elegant eyebrow charming she said does this mean i am to meet the gentleman soon tonight replied cat can ye get rid of the servants its been done darling cat tis midsummer eve and everyone will be celebrating damn swore cat i should hae guessed fiona tell yer servants that they may hae tomorrow off as well please do this for me my lord will nae wish to be seen by other than you and me fiona agreed theyll all be suffering the effects of too much ale wine and lovemaking and be no use to me anyway oh cousin i am fascinated who is this man bothwell said cat softly but hes in prison said fiona and then her smokygray eyes widened and she clapped her hands over her mouth cat had to laugh but fiona recovered quickly ye really are the deep one are ye telling me that francis hepburn is the man ye hae been wi him since ye ran away from glenkirk he is yer lover cat nodded damn me said fiona ye really hae all the luck first glenkirk and then the border lord himself her eyes glittered what is he like she begged is he really a warlock does he make love like mortal men cat choked back a fit of giggles for she could see that fiona was quite serious nay cousin francis is no warlock or wizard and he makes love very nicely thank ye how did ye meet him cat at court he was my friend then not my lover he has a wife cat he is divorcing her as i am divorcing glenkirk well be wed by years end fiona does glenkirk know about bothwell does the king nay neither of them does say nothing fiona i would rather no one know until francis and i are safely wed what should we do to prepare asked fiona food cousin francis eats ravenously when hes elated and outfoxing both jamie and maitland will make him jubilant that evening the servants gone catriona leslie and her cousin fiona waited cat assumed that bothwell would not escape until late when festivities were well underway she was right it was close to midnight when there came a knock at the kitchen door cat flew to open it and two muffled figures slipped quickly into the room flinging his cloak off francis hepburn grinned impudently at cat good evening my darling he said tears glistened in her eyes as cat stepped forward oh bothwell suddenly she stopped christ in heaven what is that stink he grinned sheepishly im afraid my mode of conveyance from the castle was not at all elegant what was it she demanded he hesitated a dung cart she stared at him a dung cart it had a false bottom he explained i hid there while above me rested the contents of the entire castle stables cat looked directly at hercules stewart theres a tub in the closet there she said please get it out and fill it with hot water for his lordship she instructed the wideeyed fiona get some of adams clothes and put them in my room bring a dressing gown here hercules pulled out the hip bath while cat began to heat water when the tub was filled she took bothwells clothes from him and flung them into the fire before she would allow him to climb into his bath she led him naked into the scullery and sluiced him down once he was in the tub she scrubbed him down with a stiff brush and washed his hair thank god no lice was her only comment bothwell chuckled as he climbed from the tub at last and wrapped himself in a large towel she sat him by the fire to dry his hair fiona re turned with a long soft robe of lightweight wool which bothwell quickly slipped on then he caught fionas hand and brought it to his lips lady leslie he spoke in a low intimate voice that brought a blush to her cheek and caused her heart to beat fast i thank ye for yer hospitality i hope ill not inconvenience ye in any way ttis an honor to hae ye in my house stammered fiona when yer ready weve a supper in the small dining room yell join us of course said bothwell offering his arm to fiona they had set on the sideboard a small meal of boiled shrimp ham ribs of nearly raw beef roasted capon a salad of cress and dandelion greens hot bread sweet butter and fresh fruit there were brown ale red and white wines and whisky cat watched indulgently barely nibbling as the earl stuffed himself sated at last he sat back and sipped a glass of whisky she had sat next to him so she might serve him fiona was at the opposite end of the table with hercules pushing back his chair bothwell said softly to her come sit on my lap my darling cat settled herself comfortably did ye miss me he asked gently aye she whispered i was so frightened his mouth found her eager one and he kissed her passionately feeling her lovely body come alive beneath his caresses christ ive missed ye he muttered into her neck i had the money for whores but i took nae a single one i stayed true to ye my darling and i have nae done that before for any woman her hands caught his and pressed them against her taut breasts he felt the little nipples hard against his palms he rose cradling her in his arms i am sorry my darling but i canna wait tonight he said neither can i bothwell she answered him softly take me to bed i burn for ye he complied willingly walking from the room with his beautiful burden fiona had watched the entire scene fascinated she could not hear what they said but the open desire between her cousin and francis hepburn was stunning her own breath quickened her lovely breasts became swollen her full lips were moist guiltily she looked up to see hercules smiling a slow lazy smile at her she blushed to the roots of her auburn hair thinking hes going to seduce me and dear heaven i am going to let him she tried to think of adam and found to her horror that she could not even recall his face fiona stood up quickly and fled to the windows that opened on her gardens she could smell the heady perfume of the damask roses and silently cursed the fact that everything in the world seemed to be conspiring against her own sensuality the air was charged with the passion created by bothwell and cat fiona was terrified by her mood but at the same time she was elated hercules was behind her now putting an arm about her waist and drawing her back against him he kissed her soft bare shoulder and then his fingers began to undo the bodice of her gown turning her about to face him he pushed the gown from her shoulders and bent to kiss her lush red mouth forcing her lips apart his tongue ravished her mouth for all her experience fiona nearly swooned she made a token resistance freeing herself to look up at him sir she protested weakly i hae never been unfaithful to leslie before how very admirable of ye madame he drawled where is yer bedchamber upstairs to the left fiona realized suddenly that the time for protest was long past he picked her up as if she were a child and carried her to her bed as they moved up the stairs she suppressed a giggle why thought fiona leslie why do i always end up wi the brother in the gray halflight of midsummer eve francis hepburn made passionate love to catriona leslie until they fell asleep exhausted she woke at dawn to find him awake watching her reaching up she drew his head down to her breasts and cradled it there yell incinerate me wi that look my love she whispered i did not sleep well away from ye cat i need ye my darling ill nae leave ye again he murmured contentedly raising himself up slightly he leaned over her and looked down into her face it was wet with silent tears gently he touched her cheek dinna weep my sweetest love we are safe together for how long bothwell for how long i am afraid they will nae let us be happy dont love dont i am taking ye home to hermitage today here ye are too close to james stewart i think it frightens ye she clung to him pressing her slender body against him until his desire for her overcame everything else he saw that she hungered for him as strongly as he hungered for her her green eyes glittered her soft round breasts hardened he could feel the trembling in her thighs his laughter was soft dear christ yer my wench there is no mistaking it i never met a woman before who could keep up wi mebut ye do she pulled his head down to hers come into me my lover she begged him and then his mouth captured hers he was deep in the warm softness of her straining to go further feeling her strain beneath him as he released his boiling seed within her as alwaysand it had never been this way with any other womanhe grew hard again inside her he strove to pleasure this woman whom he knew loved him and whom he loved above all others his own delight was greatest when she cried out in joy later he cradled her in his arms murmuring soft words and placing little kisses on her face her hair her throat he had missed her terribly he had discovered that he needed her as he had never needed anyone before he had always been a lone wolf but now he had found a mate and he was going to have to fight the king himself in order to keep her with the coming of the beautiful june dawn sounded the frantic tolling of the alarm bell at edinburgh castle bothwell sat up instantly awake it took them long enough to discover me missing he chuckled ah this is going to spoil jamies day he gently swatted cats pretty backside come on cat wake up if were riding home to hermitage i want a good breakfast first i am nae awake yet she murmured curling into a tight little ball he pulled the coverlet from her and began kissing her body she stood it for a few minutes then protested damn ye bothwell ye could raise a corpse with those lips of yers and she climbed from their bed he watched with pleasure as she washed and then pulled on her riding clothes it pleased him to note that she wore the goldandtopaz chain he had given her well eat in the kitchen my lord shall i wake hercules or will ye do it ill wager a gold piece hes in fionas bed i know for a fact that shes been faithful to adam all their married life but if she could resist that brother of yers and his passionate looks last night ill make a pilgrimage to iona bothwells laughter rang loudly no wager cat if hes not in her bed ill go to iona wi ye hercules is a winning rascal they opened their bedroom door and walked quietly across the hallway to the opposite room they heard nothing cat gently opened the door and peered into the chamber hercules awoke at once and grinned wickedly at them fiona was curled naked in a corner of the bed sleeping soundly and looking very tousled closing the door again cats mouth twitched with silent laughter ill be in the kitchen she whispered and ran lightly down the stairs the earl went back to their bedroom where he shaved and bathed as best he could using the china basin finished he went downstairs and discovered that cat had ready a tempting breakfast of oatmeal cold ham and bread hercules was already seated at the trestle eating heartily and washing it all down with brown october ale bothwell joined his halfbrother after cat had served the men she sat down with them and ate with her usual enthusiasm when he had finished the earl pushed back his chair hercules i want ye to take cat to the edge of the city by the lion tavern wait there for me where are ye going demanded cat i hae a wee bit of unfinished business dinna fret my darling ye should nae allow yerself to be seen francis ye deliberately bait jamie no one will harm me my love he drew his brother from the kitchen cat could hear only the murmur of their voices and then laughter sighing she collected the dishes from the night before and this morning and washed them all in the scullery there must be nothing misplaced nothing to give servants cause for gossip when she returned to the kitchen bothwell was putting on his cloak come kiss me my darling he said ye promise me yell be safe aye wench ill be safe now ye must leave wi hercules in ten minutes be sure fiona knows to keep silent cat laughed fiona will nae admit to even having met ye let alone sheltering ye adam would beat her black and blue ill wager he knows yer brothers reputation bothwell grinned at her ill be wi ye soon my love and in a second he was out the back door into the stableyard where hercules was holding a prancing valentine cat left the kitchen and hurried up the two flights of stairs to fionas bedroom carrying a tray with wine bread and a small honeycomb wake up sleepyhead she called to her cousin fiona mumbled and snuggled down into the feather bed im leaving fiona bothwell and i must go home to hermitage this morning she put the tray on the bedside table fiona sat up my god said cat ye look like a castle surrendered after a great battle i feel like it answered fiona hercules lives up to his name suddenly she blushed christ cat dinna tell leslie ive nae been unfaithful to him ever before i dinna know what came over me i do returned cat laughing ill nae tell on ye cousin if yell nae tell on me she bent down and hugged fiona be good and if ye need to get in touch wi me the landlord at the oak and thistle can get a message to bothwell god go wi ye cat fiona said bothwell meantime was riding through the city making sure he was plainly seen by the populace a crowd began to follow him he heard their excited voices behind him tis bothwell tis the border lord himself francis hepburn hes escaped the king did jamie really think he could hold bothwell bless me mary hes as bonnie as they say the earl rode to nether bow where he brought his horse to a stop the crowd kept a respectful distance wary of valentines sharp hooves a good morrow good people of edinburgh his deep voice boomed the crowd shifted the spectators punching at each other genially and grinning is there a man here said bothwell who would earn an honest gold crown a crown to him wholl fetch chancellor john maitland here to me if hell but come to get me i will willingly return to prison this instant the crowd broke into delighted guffaws and several men ran off in the direction of the chancellors house to return a few minutes later saying that the chancellors servants claimed he was not at home the crowd hooted with derision then francis hepburn flung a purse of crowns to them when they had quieted bothwell said tell maitland ill be waiting for him if hes brave enough to come after me ill be in the borders and to my cousin jamie the king i send my deepest loyalty valentine reared up on his back legs as hepburn shouted a bothwell a bothwell and galloped unmolested from the nether bow the approval of the crowd reverberating in his ears chapter while bothwell and his party galloped off to the borders john maitland set to work to undermine him further with the king maitland was a brilliant statesman like other statesmen of his time he was by necessity ruthless he wanted only one power in scotlandthe monarchyfor then he maitiand could rule through the king for years the royal stewarts had been plagued by their earls they ruled only by the cooperation of their nobility they scattered their bastards generously among the daughters of the upper class and then married those valuable bastards to the best families in hopes of joining themselves solidly to the powerful clans they needed their great lords support in order to rule unchallenged maitland intended putting a stop to all this he would break the power of these troublemakers beginning first with bothwell on the borders he would proceed to huntley the cock of the north if only he sighed to himself the great chiefs could be more like some of the smaller clan branches he thought in particular of the earl of glenkirk and his cousin of sithean a minor branch of clan leslie who had built up great wealth they sought no political power kept the peace on their lands and rallied to the stewarts in time of war the chancellor called for his coach and hurried off to holyrood palace to see the king he found james in a panic and the queen trying to calm him how did he escape shrieked the king how how how edinburgh castle is impregnable someone had to help him i want to know who sire sire calm yourself said maitland though no one saw lord bothwell leave there is i am sure a logical explanation for his escape no one saw him go whispered the king witchcraft again he resorts to witchcraft the chancellor hid a smile pleased that his subtle inference had not escaped the king but he had not reckoned with the queen nonsense she snapped i am sure the chancellor means nothing of the sort do ye sir la james do ye think francis really flew out of his cell on a broomstick more likely as not he bribed the watch men will do anything for money his men wont said the king sourly ive tried to buy information from them well allowed the queen smiling francis is a rather special person is he asked maitland hardly surprised to find the queen in bothwells camp women were quite susceptible to the mans charm maitland did not understand it yes answered anna of denmark looking straight at the chancellor francis hepburn could charm a duck out of water i want him found yelled the king i want him found and brought back it will be done your majesty it will not be easy but it will be done if ye had gone to the nether bow this morning ye could have had him back in prison already said the queen blandly her ladies giggled and maitland shot the queen a venomous look which she chose not to see whats this demanded the king lord bothwell rode to the nether bow earlier this morning james and offered to return to prison if our chancellor would but come and fetch him the servants claimed he was not at home but i understand he was at home cowering in a cabinet the king began to chuckle and the chuckle grew to laughter he outfoxed ye maitland chortled the king trust francis hes a good fisherman and he played ye like a salmon he knew damned well yed nae dare venture out of yer house after him hes made ye look a fool his behavior is an affront to the crown snapped maitland it undermines your majestys dignity he should be severely punished it undermines yer dignity maitland said the king but the chancellors words had stung him how would ye punish him he asked forfeiture said john maitland promptly his offices his estates no no cried the queen francis is our cousin james i know he is reckless and at times arrogant but he is the kindest man i knowand he has always been your majestys good friend he has never conspired against ye or lied to ye as others have there are the charges of witchcraft annie ridiculous charges that no one believes your own peers are so offended by these charges that they will not even meet to try him please my dear husband do not be harsh with francis he is our friend and we have so few we must make an example of this rogue thundered maitland sir said the queen angrily drawing herself up you quite overstep yourself she turned to the king i should be very unhappy sire if ye punished our cousin severely tis midsummer and if i know francis he has but run off to go swimming she made it sound so unimportant james put an arm about his pretty wife let me think on it lovey he said soothingly and bent to kiss her the queen turned and walking slowly to her bedchamber door opened it tis still early jamie dismiss master maitland and come back to bed her blue eyes were innocent enough but the look she gave him was very provocative and the king felt a stirring in his loins maitland was forced to retire for the moment he was not one to give up easily the queen had won this round by using her sex a practice maitland abhorred he realized he needed something he could use against hepburn which would anger the king and keep him angered long enough to allow for forfeiture proceedings suddenly memory pounced conveniently on the rumor about a woman who had ridden with bothwell this spring no one know who she was but she was said to be very beautiful too his spies had told him that when bothwell had left for the border today he had ridden with his bastard halfbrother and a beautiful woman maitland didnt know whether knowledge of the lady would help him but he felt he should have it he sent for one of his most trustworthy men go to hermitage castle ordered the chancellor and find out who bothwells woman is i do not care how you get your information but i must have it within a week several days later the man returned and said to the anxious chancellor lady catriona leslie the countess of glenkirk you are sure asked the amazed chancellor i got it from her personal maid the informant did not explain that he had lured the girl from the castle tortured the name from her and then cut her throat maitlands memory leaped once again the kings chamberboy had come into his pay and he sent for the fellow what do you know of catriona leslie barra wrote his answer on the pad hanging from his waist she was the kings secret mistress but she ran away from him he still desires her he tore the paper from the pad and handed it to the chancellor john maitland read smiling he handed barra a small bag of gold he was jubilant here was just the weapon he needed to destroy francis hepburn but he had to be careful that his spies were absolutely correct discreet inquiries over the period of a few days netted him the astounding information that lady bothwell had just been granted a divorce by the kirk a further probe told him that the countess of glenkirk had applied for a divorce through her uncle the abbot of glenkirk abbey the abbot was presenting her petition to the scots prelate unable to contain his excitement john maitland hurried to holyrood by the time his coach had pulled into the courtyard he had managed to calm himself somewhat the king must not suspect that his chancellor knew his most intimate secret he waited almost the entire day until he was able to see the king alone i have he said discovered an amusing sidelight to francis hepburns life i know the identity of the woman whos his latest mistressthe one whos been riding with on raids james loved gossip tell me maitland he said impatiently who is she tis the most amazing thing sire of all the noblewomen in scotland i would have said this lady was the least likely candidate for bothwells bed he plans to marry her and lady bothwell has just been granted a divorce by the kirk the lady i speak of is in the process of gaining her own freedom yes maitland very interesting but who is she why tis the countess of glenkirk sire lady catriona leslie that lovely creature they call the virtuous countess here at court for the briefest moment james stewart thought his heart had stopped who maitland who did ye say lady leslie sire glenkirks wife the king looked sick so maitland chose that moment to ask permission to withdraw but as he went he heard the command dinna leave the palace tonight the chancellor departed smiling to himself bothwell was as good as destroyed maitland hadnt missed the look of anguish in the kings face james paced his bedroom angrily francis stewarthepburn was his nemesis and always had been four years older than the king he had always been bigger stronger brighter they were both handsome but francis was handsomeralmost godlike with rugged good looks james studied hard to acquire learning but francis sopped up knowledge like a sponge easily and without strain women flocked to bothwell he was charming james was quite uncomfortable with women having been brought up in a male society where women were rarely included in short francis was everything his cousin james longed to be bothwell had gone too far when he had taken cat leslie from the king and james would not forgive him that after all the rest in bitter frustration the king overlooked the circumstances under which cat had fled him all james chose to know at this point was that cat had apparently offered bothwell what she had refused the king she had given francis her heart he would stop the lovers cat would not get her divorce lames would instruct chancellor maitland to speak to the cardinal about it he also intended declaring his popular cousin an outlaw his estates and title would be forfeit cat could hardly remain with an outlaw james was angry with catriona leslie he had honored this insignificant highland countess by making her a lady of his wifes bedchamber she had disappointed him badly she was no better than any of the other women at court who spread their legs for a man with such ease john maitland came later on as bidden hoping he did not appear too eager his face was a study in impassivity as the king ordered that francis stewarthepburn fifth earl of bothwell be put to the horn and his estates confiscated the following morning a royal herald publicly announced the kings decision to the people of edinburgh he was pelted with garbage by the outraged citizens they hated having their hero brought down the king was feeling putupon the queen was not speaking to him and she had locked the doors to her apartments lady margaret douglas had forced her way into his presence insisting furiously that the crown had no right to confiscate anything other than hermitage she waved a paper which she claimed proved that bothwell had signed over all of his estates except hermitage to their eldest son the earls legitimate heir james turned on her while francis was in my good graces madame his estates were his to do with as he pleased since he is no longer in my good graces his property is being confiscated by the crown ye cannot expect me to leave crichton snapped margaret douglas tis my home and that of my children where are we to go go to yer father or go to the devil replied the king i care not margaret but stay out of my presence yer forbidden at court margaret douglas retired defeated she would be back for she didnt intend seeing her eldest son robbed of his inheritance but she needed time to marshal her forces by the following day francis hepburn knew that the king had declared war on him he did not know precisely why breaking out of his prison in edinburgh castle had probably not prompted this he knows said cat with the certainty of a womans intuition he knows we are lovers nonsense returned bothwell even jamie could not be that petty but she knew she was right and when lord home arrived several days later his conversation with francis confirmed her suspicions sandy home caught her hand and raised it to his lips the most beautiful and the costliest hand in scotland he whispered he loosed her hand and turned to bothwell ive been charged by the king to take ye he chuckled however if yer not of a mind to return to edinburgh in the summers heat ill understand and i think ill join ye here on the border whats put cousin jamie in such a temper asked bothwell maitland he suggested forfeiture two weeks ago but the queen defended ye reminding the royal ingrate of yer loyalty and yer service to the crown home looked serious i believe all would hae been well but i think the king has found out that cat is here when he charged me to come to hermitage and make ye a prisoner of the crown he kept harping on yer lustfulness wi a certain lady of the court i dared not question him francis but i am sure he meant cat how in hell could he have found out the girl who has been my maid since i came to hermitage was found murdered in the woods near here said gat she had been cruelly tortured aye added bothwell the soles of her feet were burned black and her throat was cut poor lass we pried this out of her hand do ye recognize it he dug into his pouch and held up a silver button home took it and nodded one of maitlands men the badge on the button is the chancellors he probably sought knowledge of the woman wi ye the bastard hes found the weapon he sought to destroy ye hell nae destroy me sandy but tell me what of margaret and the children with angus james made her leave crichton and she went gods bones i dinna believe it margaret always loved lord home laughed she sought the king francis said only hermitage belonged to ye as ye had turned everything else over to yer eldest boy james sent her and the children back to angus bothwell choked back his laughter poor margaret of course she must regain the estates for my heir however i am sure angus will see to that in fact i imagine hes already anxious to get margaret out of his house and what of hermitage francis if james wants hermitage he must come himself and take it there are two things i hold dear in this world said bothwell my home and catriona ill nae gie him either but cat was frightened let us leave scotland francis she begged him jamie has taken everything ye own and he will take me too if we do not flee him but he would not entertain the idea of running even when a messenger arrived from the kiras with word from the abbot of glenkirk the cardinal had denied cats petition for divorce charles leslie dissatisfied with the answer had personally gone to st andrews and explained the situation to the cardinal it was then that the cardinal explained to charles leslie that he had been informed by chancellor maitlands confidential secretary that the king would be highly offended if the divorce were approved considering the precarious situation the old kirk faced in scotland today the cardinal would do nothing to jeopardize it further unless james changed his mind cat leslie could not have her freedom nor could she marry francis hepburn again she begged him take me away francis in france the church will nae have to answer to the king of scotland and i can obtain my freedom for a price my darling i am a very wealthy woman francis i can bribe any cleric living damnit what is my money for if i canna have what i want francis hepburn laughed and put an arm about cat my dearest spoilt darling he said tenderly even if i must leave scotland to satisfy james i would still make my peace wi him before i go and i must retain hermitage for the son ye will gie me one day oh bothwell ye great fool jamie does nae intend to let us be together please take me away now i care not if we can ever wed if only we are together but francis thought they could manage francis hepburn was a man of honor he did not really understand yet that the boy cousin he had done some of his growing up with intended to be the king of scotland in every way and he did not fully appreciate how much his royal cousin desired catriona leslie the king wanted cat back and if he could not have her then neither could francis hepburn during that summer of bothwell rode the borders with his lovely mistress and lord home they raided into england but in general the peace between england and scotland was kept during that summer james made his royal progress from holyrood palace in edinburgh to linlithgow where his mother was born to stirling to falklands and then across the firth of forth and back again to edinburgh chapter the earl of glenkirk stood nervously before the king it was the first time patrick had seen him since that terrible morning eight months prior james looked up at patrick leslie why have ye pursued this divorce glenkirk i informed the cardinal that it would be displeasing to me if ye and cat were divorced sire cat wishes her freedom i saw her in june and shell nae return to me shes a different woman do ye know where she is cousin patrick no sire she would nae tell me i know where she is said the king softly leaning across his oak desk she ran from ye so she might be bothwells whore and cousin francis is so besotted by her that he has divorced angus daughter in order to wed cat but hell nae wed her she will nae get her divorce patrick leslie was stunned he could hardly believe what the king was saying and then in a clear and blinding flash he remembered her saying so many times francis is my friend nothing more i am continued the king arranging to lure bothwell into leith in a few days time the chances are favorable that cat will be with him i want ye there to take her home if she repents her folly she may return to us at court sire cat no longer wants or loves me the king looked coldly at the earl of glenkirk i dinna care whether she loves ye or not i want ye to take her back and i want ye to make sure she stays wi ye ye may leave me cousin i hae work to do patrick leslie returned to his townhouse making himself comfortable in the library with a cheerful fire and a decanter of whisky he sat down to think she had fled to bothwell yet he was sure that she was not francis hepburns mistress when she left him that had obviously happened later and now bothwell was in love with herenough in love to have divorced margaret douglas but unless the cardinal gave her a divorce cat could not wed anyone else patrick didnt know whether to be happy or sad he was expected to go to leith on the kings command and kidnap his wife after that lord bothwell would undoubtedly come north with his men to retrieve her damn these stewarts he said out loud he was caught between them and all because of his beautiful wife oh cat he thought wistfully three men want ye but only one can have ye and tis nae the one ye want he wondered why she had not fled with her lover when she learned that her divorce petition was denied but then he remembered what he knew about bothwell he was an honest man and that would surely lead to his downfall the king had little of honor or honesty the following day patrick was summoned by maitlands confidential secretary who told him that bothwell was expected in leith in two days he always quartered himself at the golden anchor tavern on the waterfront lady leslie would be with him two days later on the th of october the earl of glenkirk waited in a private room at the golden anchor tavern for the earl of bothwells arrival he had told the landlord that he was bothwells cousin and had come to meet with him since the landlord believed the border lords visit a secret he assumed that anyone who knew of it must have been so informed by bothwell himself the earl of glenkirk waited alone he had no intention of forcing his wife to return to him he knew he was deliberately disobeying the king but he had his pride in the quiet of the misty dawn he heard suddenly the arrival of a party of horsemen in the yard below there were footsteps on the stairs and the door to the private parlor flew open good morning cousin francis he drawled come in and join me for breakfast francis hepburn was surprised but then a slow smile crossed his face cousin patrick a good morrow to ye he answered and accepted the tankard of ale handed him the two men sat facing one another is cat wi ye nay i left her at hermitage something didna smell right about this meeting aye returned patrick leslie tis a trap but yeve time yet what are ye doing here glenkirk cousin jamie sent me to reclaim my wife ill nae gie her back said bothwell softly and his blue eyes glittered dangerously the two men looked at one another for a moment then patrick said quietly i still love her francis but i know ive lost her for gods sake man lake her away and be happy before james destroys ye both i must make my peace wi the king patrick i want cat for my wife and i want hermitage for our children take her away francis once ye gave me that same advice and i heeded ye not then when i found the king wi his hands all over my wife i lost first my temper and then cat dinna make the same mistake i did i would never do to cat what ye did i know what she went through she relived it in her sleep for weeks christ man why didnt ye just kill her if i had cousin ye would not have known the happiness ye know now he replied angrily touché said bothwell he stood up gie maitland my regrets patrick tell him a pressing engagement francis hepburn swung a leg over the window sill and grinned ill go the back way for safetys sake take my horse valentine home wi ye i know yell keep him safe then he was gone when maitland and the kings soldiers arrived a short time afterwards they found the earl of glenkirk finishing up a large breakfast where is he demanded the chancellor a pressing engagement called him away said patrick leslie a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth your wife she was not with him maitland yer information was incorrect bothwell knew it was a trap and left her safe at hermitage ye dinna seem to mind that your wife plays bothwells whore said maitland venomously glenkirk was at his throat before the words had died in the chancellors mouth one big hand held the chancellor tightly at the neck the other held a dirk to his plump belly ye are close to death master maitland the chancellors eyes bugged terrified did yer mother never teach ye master maitland not to talk ill of yer betters whatever the problems between my wife and myself they stem from the king as ye well know master maitland glenkirk stressed the chancellors lack of a title which he knew was a sore point with the man dinna think the earl continued i dinna know that ye seek to complicate those problems in yer desire to destroy lord bothwell and his influence master maitland well i dinna gie a damn for yer politics my only interest is in seeing catriona kept safe he gave the chancellor a shake yer a fine statesman ive no doubt master maitland but ye know nothing of human nature ye took cousin jamies lust for my wife and used it to fan the fires of his envy of bothwell had ye kept silent francis and cat would hae been married and gone from scotland maitlands eyes widened in surprise aye said glenkirk they were willing to accept exile now ye fool ye hae cornered them and christ man how bothwell is going to fight james to keep her how many lives and how much money will be spent in this war between the crowned and the uncrowned king he loosed the chancellor and pushed him away maitland rubbed his throat then spoke ye love her still my lord i do not have to be a student of human nature to see that how can ye let her go dont ye want her back aye i want her back but she doesnt want me and that master maitland is my fault she loves francis hepburn and if that makes her happy then i want her to have him he smiled sadly at the chancellor ye dinna understand that kind of thing do ye master maitland ah well ill nae try to explain the earl picked up his cloak by the way bothwells horse is below im taking it home wi me home to glenkirk and my bairns yell gie my regrets to the king and he walked from the room his footsteps echoing in the stairwell as he descended francis hepburn rode with all haste back to hermitage castle and catriona leslie he was torn if he could just get to his cousin the king if james would only restore his lands to his eldest son if only the king would allow the cardinal to give cat her divorce he would promise to take her and leave scotland if james understood their love surely he would cooperate if if if but first the chancellor must be gotten out of the way his was the dangerous influence but the autumn was too beautiful for much worrying the days were deliciously warm and faintly hazed in purple bothwell rode a new stalliona great darkgray brute called sian which means storm in the gaelic tongue cat and her lover rode alone much as they had in the early spring sandy home had gone to his own estates they enjoyed being alone together the servants at hermitage sensed this and behaved with exquisite tact in the cold clear evenings when the stars seemed brighter and nearer the earth than ever before the lovers sat before the fire sometimes they were silent sometimes they talked of what they would do when the king relented and allowed them to wed sometimes they sang together while he accompanied them on a lute his voice was a deep baritone hers a lilting soprano the sounds of their happiness spread throughout the castle causing the servants to smile indulgently never had they seen francis hepburn so calm so happy and why not lady leslie was a sweet gentle lady who loved their earl with all her heart just before christmas francis hepburn gave to his beloved the best of all possible gifts on a cold bright middecember afternoon a coach rumbled up the drive to hermitage as catriona and the earl stood waiting the coach lurched to a stop the door opened and four passengers jumped out cat gasped and then flew down the steps to meet her four oldest children who were running up the steps towards her kneeling she opened her arms and gathered them to her oh my bairns my beautiful beautiful bairns she said it over and over again and her face was wet with her tears standing her arms still around the four children she looked to bothwell he knew he had done the right thing he moved slowly down the steps welcome to hermitage he said to the four young leslies thank ye my lord earl the fourteenyearold heir to glenkirk spoke for them all we are grateful for the chance to see our mother again the last time i saw ye jamie ye called me uncle francis will ye do so again or perhaps as ye are nearly a man ye would prefer to call me just francis the boy looked from the earl to his mother he was confused is my mother yer mistress he finally burst out jamie nay my darling scold not the lad he turned to young james leslie yes lad yer mother is my mistress she would be my wife but for the king who is angry wi me and withholds permission for her divorce if she had the divorce we would have wed do ye no longer love our father asked nineyearold bess i love lord bothwell bess your father and i will however remain friendly come now my bairnstis cold out here let us go inside the hall they brought the children into a comfortable chamber with a good fire and the servants served watered wine and sweet cakes let me look at all of ye she said happily oh jamie how ye have grown ye were nae taller than i when i saw ye last ill be going to the university at aberdeen next autumn he answered her proudly i will leave our cousin of rothes in spring when robert goes to be a page i am so proud of ye she told him and he forgot his dignity long enough to hug her her gaze lingered on her two younger sons colin seven and robbie six colin was already in service with the earl of rothes and had begun to acquire the polish of a little courtier his younger brother still at glenkirk was yet a rough little highlander why did not amanda and morag come cat asked they are too young answered robbie with great superiority bess shot him a quelling look that was so reminiscent of her grandmother meg that cat had to laugh lord my dear how much like meg ye look yer going to be quite lovely in a few years time bess blushed most becomingly and said grandmother meg said she couldna bear christmas wi all of us gone and she knew ye would understand if she kept manda and morag i do understand lovey and i am so glad to see ye four how long can ye stay colie and i must be back at rothes edinburgh house no later than the week after twelfth night said jamie bess and robbie may stay all winter bothwell ye wretch why did ye nae tell me we must hire a tutor bess and robbie canna miss a whole winter of lessons he laughed if i had told ye twould not hae been a surprise as to a tutor ill instruct the bairns myself this winter francis hepburn adored having cats children at hermitage and a whole new side of his character was revealed he loved children and he was good with them after the initial discomfort over their parents marital situation the young leslies of glenkirk relaxed and enjoyed both hermitage and the earl how sad thought cat that margaret douglas had estranged his own children from their father and in the dark of night when he lay deep within her he cried out oh my sweetest love gie me sons and daughters like glenkirks loving bairns of our own to raise in this new century that is coming she wanted to oh god how she longed to have his child in her belly had she thought the king would relent if she became pregnant she would have done so but knowing james viciousness too well she waited the king was now using her against bothwell but if she and the earl became parents their child would be the kings most valuable pawn she was careful not to give him that pawn but her heart ached for she wanted francis hepburns child desperately chapter on christmas day as the hermitage residents sat at dinner two messengers arrived wearing the badge of the duke of lennox bothwell left the festive board and closeted himself with the men for close to an hour when he returned he said softly to cat i must go to edinburgh early in the morning dinna tell the bairns i would nae spoil their day he finished his meal and then called to the leslie boys come on lads i promised wed go curling cat love please see to lennoxs men bess will ye come and cheer us on to great victories cat saw to it that the dukes men were well fed and were given warm beds for the night and that their horses were taken care of then gathering up her cloak she went to the little pond in the woods by the castle where the earl and her sons were playing at curls even little bess had a broom and was dashing wildly about the ice her darkbrown curls flying her cheeks rosy her hazel eyes sparkling catriona leslie didnt know who was enjoying the day more bothwell or the children he was very handsome in his kilts teamed with bess against the three boys cat cheered them all on her heart bursting with happiness this was what she had wanted above allher children and francis hepburn for this brief moment she had it after they had seen the children safely to bed that night they sat together in her bedchamber in a large chair before the fire for a long time they said nothing he absently stroked her lovely hair and finally said lennox says that maitland seeks to have james put a price on my head maitland is spending christmas at holyrood wi their majesties the turd he tries to climb high does master maitland i must go to edinburgh tomorrow and settle this thing once and for all if i can see our royal cousin perhaps i can convince him to change his stubborn mind see him when the queen is also present francis he dare not let her guess the real reason why he refuses us she is young and she is softhearted she will plead our cause because she likes us both if ye can but get the kings signature on the divorce petition my uncle charles says that a representative of the cardinal waits in edinburgh to finish the transaction one moment of weakness on jamies part and we will be free to wed quickly before he can change his mind bothwell chuckled are ye sure ye leslies are nae cousins to the medici yer great schemers his hands began to wander and she sighed contentedly will ye be back in time for new years she asked his mouth found the soft curve between her shoulder and her neck and he kissed it i dont know cat if i canna get here the childrens gifts are in my wardrobe and your gift he stopped nay ill not tell ye for i want to gie ye yer present myself he turned her so she faced him kissed her and then stood her up lets go to bed my darling pushing the little ribbon straps from her shoulders she allowed her nightgown to slide to the floor will ye be gone very long bothwell she slipped into the featherbed taking his own robe off he joined her and pulled her close to him im nae sure how long ill be gone he said thickly as his desire for her rose tears sprang to her eyes but he kissed them away and after their lovemaking she wept stormily in his arms what is it ye do to me francis why is it ye can touch me as no one ever has before do ye want to weep and shout all at once he asked i do i think it has something to do wi loving each other he kissed her tenderly damn i dinna want to leave ye even for a few days but he did riding out before the sun was even up she stood alone in the window of her bedchamber in the cold december dark clutching her shawl to her breasts and watched go she could still feel the hardness of his mouth on hers while she watched riding away she prayed that the king would relent james could not be so stubborn as to believe she would leave francis hepburn under any circumstances perhaps james had grown weary of fighting on the evening of december francis hepburn alexander home about forty border chiefs and their followers slipped through the duke of lennoxs stables and gained entrance to holyrood palace their first objective was john maitland but as they rounded the corner of a badly lit passage they startled a pageboy who cried out in fright maitland hearing the shout and the tramp of many feet withdrew into his inner chamber lennox gave orders for the door to be broken but the earl of bothwell lord home and hercules with most of their men passed on trying to gain entry to the royal apartments maitland lowered one of his servants out of a window and gave him orders to toll the common bell when it rang the citizens of edinburgh came running from their houses and hurried towards the palace lord home pulled at francis hepburns arm come on man the games up but bothwell was desperate no i must get to jamie damn sandy i promised cat hercules used his giant size to yank his brother around listen ye besotted fool what will happen to her if i haul ye home on a slab come on now man well try again another time he dragged the protesting earl down the passage cat was so delighted to have him safely back that her disappointment was less than bothwell had expected bothwell however was angry i wanted to start the new year knowing we could set a wedding date he complained dinna fret my love by this time next year twill surely all be settled she soothed him pulling his head down she kissed him passionately they canna separate us now she whispered fiercely we belong to each other on new years day the earl of bothwell handed out gifts to his staff tenants and retainers in the afternoon he was able to be alone with cat and the children though they did their best to hide it the young leslies were as excited by the prospect of gifts as children anywhere jamie could hardly believe that the young red stallion prancing in the courtyard was really his hes a son of my valentine smiled the earl i call him cupid for cats daughter bess there was a beautiful cloak of burgundy velvet trimmed in soft pale gray rabbit fur with a little gold clasp studded in rubies colin leslie the budding courtier received a round gold clan badge for wearing with his plaid the griffin on it had sapphire eyes robert leslie was given a puppy born ten weeks earlier to bothwells favorite skye terrier bitch the children were ecstatic bess put on her cloak colin pinned his badge to his shoulder robert found a lead for his puppy and they all ran down to the courtyard to see jamie try out his new horse bothwell and cat watched indulgently for a few moments and then turned away from the windows he wordlessly handed her a flat box which she opened eagerly cat gasped on a bed of white satin lay a heavy gold chain which held a round gold pendant upon the pendant was a great lion rampant within a royal tressure debruised by a diamondstubbed ribbon the lion had emeralds for eyes and diamonds studded his waving mane do ye mind that i mark ye wi my beast he asked her i am proud to wear the hepburn lion she answered him lifting it from its box she handed it to him fasten it on for me my lord when he had done so she preened before the pier glass then walked over to the table and picked up the one remaining box she handed it to him in it was a large round emerald ring set in gold and into which his seal had been cut emeralds are for constancy she said in a low voice but wait my lord i hae one other thing for ye and reaching into the purse that hung from her waist she drew out a plain gold band he laughed softly reaching into his own pouch he drew out a similar ring which he gave to her her eyes closed and two tears slipped out damn bothwell i did want to be wed to ye soon damn james stewart i hate him so he held her close poor love he said tis harder for ye than it is for me i am sorry our raid failed if james werent so stinking stingy the passageway would hae been lit better and that bloody boy would nae hae cried out she began to laugh the thought that the kings cheeseparing ways were responsible for her misery was ludicrous quickly picking up her thoughts francis laughed with her neither of them however laughed for very long early on the morning of the th of january an exhausted messenger galloped into hermitage the king had personally penned a proclamation offering a reward to any man who would kill the earl of bothwell they were shocked for they could not believe james would do such a thing maitland had according to the messenger frightened the king badly after the raid of december and had convinced james that his cousin wished to kill him and rule in his place after all did they not call bothwell the uncrowned king if the king were prudent he would kill bothwell before bothwell killed him francis hepburn got on his horse and rode directly to the capital he wished to try to settle the matter with his cousin in person he was forced to retreat to hermitage when the king rode out after him with a large troup of soldiers james forced his horse into a bog in pursuit of bothwell and then nearly drowned this didnt help matters again there was talk of witchcraft the next three months saw a forced peace between the king and his cousin brought on by the advent of severe winter weather the roads were closed by heavy snows throughout scotland cat could not have been more pleased though jamie and colin had returned to rothes bess and robbie remained cat could pretend during those precious months that they were a normal family bess her fathers pet was more reserved with francis than cat would have wished but bothwell understood and treated the little girl with grave respect well hae a wee lass of our own someday he whispered softly to his mistress the young robbie adored francis hepburn the fourth of cats children with two girls after him he was truly a middle child no one had ever had a great deal of time for robbie but that winter the great earl of bothwell found the time in this sixandahalfyearold boy he found a quick inquiring mind and an ability to recall the smallest fact delighted bothwell taught him a great deal bess frequently joined them particularly when they studied languages bothwell and catriona had been together a year now and he could not believe that in twelve short months his life had changed so much for the better though he was involved in a lifeanddeath struggle with the king bothwell was sure that if he could see james and talk to him he would be able to make him understand when the warm weather came he would try again to get to the king in early april the roads opened again and the earl and cat escorted bess and robbie leslie to dundee where conall moreleslie waited to return them to glenkirk will ye never return to glenkirk mother asked bess cat put an arm around her eldest daughter now bess ye know that as soon as my divorce petition is granted i will marry wi lord bothwell and live at hermitage ye like hermitage dont ye the girl nodded slowly adding quickly but i love glenkirk best of all if ye marry uncle francis who will be my father catriona leslie saw once again how her divorce from glenkirk would affect their children still she thought i hae been a good mother and i will be a better one wed wi the man i love she bent and kissed the top of besss dark head tis a silly question ye ask bess patrick leslie is yer father he always will be naught can change that francis will be yer stepfather will we live wi ye aye lovely and who will live wi father lord bess yer grandmother is at glenkirk and yer uncle adam and aunt fiona come often then too yer father might find another wife someday i think i would prefer to stay wi father said bess quietly he will be lonely wiout bairns about him jamie and colin are already gone and robbie goes in a short time if ye take manda and morag from glenkirk father will hae no one unless i stay cat gritted her teeth bess showed leslie traits at the damnedest times let us talk about it another time lovey she said bess looked levelly at her mother and said as ye wish madame and cat had the feeling she had lost the battle conall met them on time and was surly almost to the point of rudeness she spoke sharply to him dinna choose sides in a battle ye know naught about conall he reddened how is ellie well enough she misses ye my lady tell her when this business is settled i would like her to come to hermitage wi me i miss her too ill tell her my lady go carefully wi my bairns she said to him turning slowly she rode back to where bothwell awaited her conall had to admit that the border lord on his gray stallion and lady leslie on her goldenbay gelding made a handsome couple he felt a kind of sadness as they raised their hands to the bairns in a gesture of farewell and then turned and rode off chapter when the king learned that bothwell was in the north he left edinburgh for dundee but by the time he arrived the earl had already returned south to the borders with cat francis hepburn hoped that by remaining quiet and unassuming he could calm his nervous royal cousin james however egged on by maitland and constandy waylaid by either the earl of angus or his daughterboth lobbying for the return of bothwells possessions to the earls heirfelt he was constantly assailed by francis hepburn when the parliament met on may the king denounced the earl of bothwell claiming he aspired to the throne and stating that he had no right to that throne they might both be grandsons of james v but bothwells line was the bastard one then the king proceeded to have his parliament ratify the sentence of forfeiture against his cousin francis hepburn was honestly astounded he and jamie had always rubbed each other but he had tried hard to avoid an open confrontation with the king that james could accuse him of wanting the throne was laughable of all the things he wanted in the world the kingship of any land was the last on his list however he understood what his cousin was really up to james was asking for support without doing so in plain words had the nobility known that the king simply wanted their support they might have given it to him but they saw john maitland behind everything james did and the nobility of scotland hated maitland consequently they all but shouted their support of francis hepburn and their defiance of the king he wants to destroy ye said cat is there no kindness in him all we ask is to wed and live in peace wi him maitland wants to make an example of me cat and the fact that jamie wants ye back in his bed doesna help matters would it help ye if i returned to him i would sooner die than hae him touch me again but if he would restore to ye yer possessions i would do it for ye my love roughly he pulled her to him i would strangle ye lass before i would ever let any man touch ye ill nae let ye go christ my darling the very thought of my royal cousin wi ye infuriates me but i dinna want to be responsible for hurting ye francis oh my love take me away please take me away before it is too late gie me a bit more time my love let me try to make my peace wi jamie frightened she clung to him and like a cornered animal she felt a net closing about them then she quickly shook it off he needed strength now not a weak and weeping woman word came that the king was at his palace of falklands bothwell and his supporters rode forth and catriona leslie rode with them between the hours of one and two am on the morning of june they surrounded falklands unfortunately james had been warned in time by the watch and he retired with the queen to a fortified tower by seven am the local country people were streaming to falklands to see what the matter was bothwell and his company were forced to retire they did so to the cheers of the locals who had recognized the border lord on july a proclamation was issued for the raising of a levy to pursue the earl of bothwell the proclamation was pointedly ignored by one and all james retired to dalkeith for the remainder of the summer on august the lairds of logie and burley smuggled bothwell into the palace in hopes of getting him into the kings presence so he might publicly ask for royal pardon it had been decided that the queens antechamber would be the ideal place for the earl to catch the king james must pass through it on his way to his wifes bedroom francis hepburn knelt before his queen he took her extended hand kissed it and then turned it over and kissed the palm rogue laughed the queen snatching her hand away but her face was flushed and her heart beat quicker bothwell grinned up at her and rose to his feet thank ye madame for letting me wait for jamie here i must make peace wi him and too he must allow the cardinal to gie my lass her divorce so we may wed catriona has always been a loyal servant of yer majestyand it hurts her too when jamie punishes me you love her very much dont you francis madame i hae never known such happiness or such peace since cat came into my life if only i were reconciled wi james all we ask yer majesty is to live quiedy at hermitage we would even live abroad if it were the kings pleasure i ask only to retain hermitage for any bairns cat will gie me our children must nae forget that they are scots and loyal subjects of james stewartas cat and i are the queen was obviously touched by this speech i will plead your case cousin james is not thinking clearly at all master maitland confuses him she sat down and patted the space to her left he sat next to her beatrice she said to lady ruthven please watch for the king and see we have plenty of warning she looked to her other ladies the rest of you may make yourselves useful with your embroidery or music i wish to talk to the earl privately the ladies of the queens bedchamber settled themselves across the room from the windowseat where the queen and bothwell sat conversing now tell me cousin francis how did this great romance with the countess of glenkirk begin i thought she truly loved her husband carefully he told her the story he had concocted when anticipating her question cat and i became friends before yer majesty came to scotland glenkirk and i are distant cousins did ye know his mother is a stewart i have always liked cat she is an educated woman and i enjoyed being wi her never did anything improper occur between us in those early days but as time went on yer grace i found that i was falling in love wi her i fought my feelings for i knew that she was no loose woman imagine my surprise to discover she was fighting the same feelings finally we could fight our emotions no longer we love each other he finished simply the queens eyes were bright with unshed tears what of poor glenkirk he loves her too but is resigned to letting her go perhaps said the queen looking towards christina anders the earl might remarry mistress anders husband has recently expired from measles and she is widowed again bothwell did not think patrick leslie would marry christina anders but he needed the queens support so he nodded affably and said very possibly but first he must be free and the king will nae allow the cardinal of st andrews permission to sign the petition of divorce i will help you francis said the queen at this point lady ruthven returned whitefaced your grace his majesty is in the corridor outside he asks me to tell ye that he has learned the earl of bothwell is somewhere in the palace he says he will punish anyone who tries to introduce the earl into his presence francis hepburn stood up damn he said and then turning to the queen he asked is there another way i can leave the queen led the way into her bedroom and opening a small unobtrusive door revealed a narrow staircase my tiring women use this follow it all the way to the bottom it exits in the servants courtyard he kissed her hand again in farewell thank ye madame and god bless ye for yer help she smiled prettily at him i wont forget francis go with god the queen closed the door and returned to her antechamber she picked up her embroidery beatrice go and ask the king if he intends standing in the corridor all night the queens ladies giggled and anna bit her lip to keep from laughing as james entered her rooms with his guards they rushed into her bedchamber poking under the bed and behind the draperies with their pikes come sire what is the meaning of this demanded the queen bothwell is in the palace annie the young queen drew herself up well sire he is certainly not in my bedchamber or is this some new slander of master maitlands first he alleges that the bonnie earl of moray is my lover does he now say tis bothwell she turned to her attendants fling open the wardrobes ladies so the king may see we hide no earls she turned back to the king when ye have finished with this foolishness please take your men and leave me all this uproar has given me a terrible headache disappointed the king retired to his empty bed equally disappointed bothwell returned to hermitage he again set himself to living quietly in hope of allaying the kings fears and calming his anger in october the king mounted a small expedition into the borders bothwell and cat immediately left hermitage for their secret and wellhidden hunting lodge hermitage castle stood open to the king who could not under these circumstances complain of his cousins disobedience the king returned to edinburgh only to be waylaid again by lady margaret douglas she had chosen to catch him publicly in front of the gates of edinburgh castle crying for mercy upon her and her children in gods name she begged the return of bothwells property for her innocent children james was furious at having been placed in such an embarrassing position and in public he forbade the lady to enter his presence again i dinna know how francis stood her as long as he did said the king to his wife she doesna care for himjust his estates this was the opening that anna had been waiting for they were not happy jamie she inquired innocently twas a political thing hes well rid of her in that case my love why will ye not allow the cardinal to give lady leslie her divorce bothwell is deeply in love with her the king was startled he had not been aware that his frivolous little queen knew of bothwells involvement with catriona leslie he wondered nervously what else she knew and decided to move cautiously lady leslie is nae a girl annie she is the mother of six bairns she is behaving like an infatuated maid and must be brought to her senses but jamie glenkirk is willing to let her go and now that my dearest christina is widowedoh jamie twould be so wonderful if christina could be glenkirks wife then my little goddaughter anne fitzleslie could be brought up properly my dear annie the leslies hae been wed for fourteen years i canna allow them to dissolve their marriage on a whim twould set a bad example for the court there must be more morality in our court if i allow the leslies to divorce then every man who becomes infatuated wi another woman will want to divorce his wife and every mans mistress will expect her lover to wed wi her the queen thought that the king was making a great deal more of the matter than was warranted and she felt that if he wished to reform the court he might do better by way of example than refuse a divorce for a couple who wished to marry these people did not want to sin however she could argue no further with him at this time she was disappointed for she liked francis and would have enjoyed helping him on new years day the earl of bothwell appealed to the kirk for aid begging them not to despise on account of the kings anger he needed their help but the kirk ignored him the old queen of england however did not she saw to it that the border lord was financially comfortable england offered money and sanctuary if he should need it elizabeth tudor did not like james stewart he was her logical heir though she had not named him officially yet but she thought him a mealymouthed hypocrite he was shifty saying one thing and doing another she could not understand this sudden relentless pursuit of francis stewarthepburn to the best of her knowledge the earl of bothwell had always been loyal to the scots crown elizabeth chuckled bothwell had visited her court some years back he had been young but damn he was a brilliant and elegant rogue even then there was more to this than met the eye yet her spies could come up with no explanation so because it pleased her to be perverse and to thwart james and because she had always had a weakness for charming rogues she lent her support to the border lord again the winter closed in around them and cat was relieved they kept twelfth night revels at hermitage for the neighboring gentry though she was not bothwells wife she was treated as such by the local lairds and their ladies they had no patience with the kings unkindness towards their hero and his lady cat had not seen her oldest children in almost a year it was simply too dangerous for them to come now she barely knew the two youngest ones and sadly wondered if they remembered her at all bothwell missed the children too catriona leslie had the knack for making family life a warm and happy thing bothwell found it restful and until they could marry they dared not have a child of their own as the winter deepened cat became increasingly eager to go to france and finally he agreed that if by the end of the year he had not settled things with his cousin they would leave scotland chapter when james stewart learned that his cousin the queen of england was financing his cousin the earl of bothwell he sent word to sir robert melville his ambassador in england to persuade elizabeth to cease publicly exposed she had no choice but to agree francis hepburn was now in danger on both sides of the border but worse was to come on july sentence of forfeiture was again passed against francis stewarthepburn the fifth earl of bothwell but this time his arms were riven asunder at the mercat cross in edinburgh shocked the duke of lennox and other noblemen determined to help bothwell if maitland could turn the king against his own blood what could happen to them bothwell accompanied only by his halfbrother rode for the capital his borderers slipped into the city by twos and threes until edinburgh had discreetly swelled with them catriona leslie had been left behind at hermitage what will happen she had begged him i dinna know if i can get to james i must convince him to restore my lands which i hae given to my heir and i will force him if necessary to allow the cardinal to grant yer petition of divorce then love well be safe and if ye canna reach him francis then my darling were for france let angus fight the battle for his grandchildren she clung to him her mouth inviting his kisses her body soft and yielding accepting the invitation he made passionate love to her then slept for several hours cradling her in his arms when she awoke he was gone and she was frightened early on the morning of july james stewart awoke to the faint gray light of early dawn the air felt damp and he wondered if it were raining he heard a faint noise a chair scraping the floor barra laddie is it you he called there was no answer the kings heart began to pound violently against his ribs and his nightshirt became soaked in cold sweat ever so slowly he turned and peered out of the bed curtains good morning jamie drawled francis stewarthepburn the king screamed scrambling to the other side of the bed he leaped out and quickly turned the handle of the queens bedroom door it would not give james turned to face his antagonist pressing his back to the queens door as though he could press himself through it for a moment the cousins stared at each otherthe one disheveled and frightened in a damp silk nightshirt the other calm and assured in his red plaid kilt his sword drawn slowly bothwell closed the space between them the king was shaking francis hepburns blue eyes narrowed catching his cousins face between his thumb and his forefinger he growled lo now my fine bairn ye that hae said i sought yer life look how i hold it in my hand the king swayed as if he would faint christ jamie im nae here to kill ye said bothwell impatiently pull yerself together james eyes rolled in his head and he looked wildly at the earl yell nae get my soul francis kill me if ye will but yell nae get my soul jesu exploded bothwell what in gods name would i want wi yer soul jamie ive but come to straighten this matter out between us i dinna want yer life yer soul yer crown or yer bloody kingdom jamie i simply want my lands back for my heir and i want cat leslie for my wife gie me those things and yer quit bothwell forever if ye choose maitland says ye want to kill me said the king maitland is a puddock stool replied bothwell the king laughed in spite of his fear the border lord reached out and picked up the kings robe put it on jamie ye look chilled drawing the king from the queens door he helped him into the warm garment then pouring a dram of whisky he made james drink color began to flow back into the kings face seeing this bothwell knelt before him and offered the hilt of his sword to his sovereign this simple act seemed to calm and even embarrass the king oh get up francis and put yer sword away the earl complied and rising threw some wood on the fire with the kings permission the two men sat facing one another i suppose said the king resignedly that my palace is full of yer men aye grinned bothwell ruefully and lennoxs men and angus men and homes and colvilles and logies and burleys and huntleys im nae a fool to come calling on ye cousin wiout a few friends they stand by ye as they hae never stood by me only because of maitland jamie maitland wants to take away their rights he is using me as a test and they know that if i fall they are all in danger of falling their loyalty is to themselves and where is yer loyalty francis like theirs first to myself and my own yer honest francis i hae always been honest wi ye jamie my bairn now tis time for ye to be honest wi me i know yell be fair about my lands they rightfully belong to margarets boy not yer boy also francis i fathered him jamie but hes never been mine none of them have theyre all margarets and theyre angus but nae mine thats why cat is so important she is mine and when we hae bairns theyll be ours no francis theyll be bastards for ill nae gie my permission for ye to wed wi catriona leslie for a few moments the room was very quiet then bothwell said why jamie ye hae been honest wi me cousin so i will be honest wi ye if i canna hae cat then ye canna hae cat my god james do ye hate me so much yeve taken everything i own and riven my arms at edinburgh crors i hae one thing left in this world a wench a greeneyed wench that i love above all things if i died tomorrow she would nae come back to ye what hae i done to deserve this unkindness from ye is this how ye repay my loyalty to ye she loves ye said the king quietly tis that i canna forgie her for francis i lay between her silken thighs but she gave me nothing of herself i fucked her and her lovely body responded as i have never known a woman to respond but she gave me nothing for her love and since her no woman has been able to satisfy me including that sweet little featherhead i am wed to but to ye cousin cat has shown her face of love she has defied convention and both kirks of scotland to be by yer side she who adored her bairns has nae seen them in several years for love of ye i outlawed ye and took all from ye yet she stayed wi ye i can forgie neither of ye yer love francis i cannot command her to love me but i can command her not to wed wi ye and i can see she obeys that command christ man hae ye no heart love said the king i dinna understand the word no one has ever loved me nor hae i ever loved anyone except cat at least i think that is the feeling i hae for her i am nae certain having had verra little experience with love the queen loves ye james and i thought ye loved her annie doesna love me francis lord man we hae nothing in common except perhaps we will soon she is pregnant and will deliver a child this winter however she does enjoy being queen the earl of bothwell looked carefully at his royal cousin in all the years we hae known each other jamie i hae asked ye for little now however and at this point bothwell knelt on both knees before the kingi beg ye cousin i beg ye to let me wed wi cat we will leave scotland and live quietly wherever ye say in christs name dinna take her from me for the first time in all his life james had the advantage of his cousin francis the border lord was at his mercy in was too delicious and the king could barely contain his excitement never had francis exhibited a weakness of any sort yet now he knelt and begged and for a woman a mere woman no not a mere woman an extraordinary woman but francis hepburn was an extraordinary man and they really did belong together it was most unfortunate that he james did not choose to allow it he looked down at his cousin get up bothwell the earl stood they call ye the uncrowned king of scotland francis and i know that cat is yer chosen mate unfortunately it is a rule of royalty that kings and queens are nae ever happy in love i see no reason why ye and cat should be if ye crawled from here to hell and back on yer hands and knees i should not change my mind i will see that yer lands and yer honors are returned they will remain yers to do with as ye please as long as ye remain at peace wi me but on september first i want catriona leslie here in edinburgh to return to her husband go to hell jamie said bothwell shell nae return to patrick leslie and ill nae let her she will return to him francis because if she does not i will have maitland find a way that will allow me to confiscate the lands and goods of not only the leslies of glenkirk but the leslies of sithean and even of cats own family the hays of greyhaven ye know that cat will nae allow three branches of her family to be destroyed and our good patrick will take her back for the same reason as for ye my reckless cousin if ye try to defy me the king let it dangle and bothwell for the first time in his life felt the bitter taste of defeat there francis said the king soothingly i hae given ye plenty of time to say yer goodbyes i could hae said she must be back wiin a week ye hae over a month he smiled in kindly fashion at his handsome cousin it should add spice to yer relationship to see how many times ye can fuck her in one month bothwell clenched his fists i will call the others to come in now if i dont i may give in to the urge to commit regicide yer a bastard james ye dinna know what love is and ye never will twill be a lonely life for ye cousin and in yer old agefor we stewarts are inclined to longevity if we avoid warsye will have no memories to warm ye in the dark nights i am sorry for ye jamie ye hae a mean spirit and ye will always have to live with yerself before the discomfited king could reply his chamber was filled with the great lords of the land seeing them all massed together james became nervous again bothwell offered to leave but the others would not allow it until the king had agreed to publicly pass an act of condonation and remission in bothwells favor the earl of angus was delighted his grandchildren would be well taken care of and margaret could leave his house now bothwell left for lord homes edinburgh house he was sick at heart he knew there was no way for him to win this battle home offered his friend a bed a bottle and a sympathetic ear there was nothing else he could do a short distance away at glenkirk house patrick leslie suffered a similar agony he had just returned from holyrood where the king had told him privately that his wife would be returned to him on september that she was being forced to return bothered james not at all but it bothered patrick leslie his wife whom he still loved was in love with another man she had lived with this man for two and a half years while trying desperately to divorce glenkirk he had resigned himself to losing her because he did not believe he deserved her any longer patrick leslie didnt know if his wife could take this forced reunion he wasnt sure he could he was tired and he was a mass of conflicting emotions he sat alone in his library and as the afternoon progressed he drank a great deal of whisky as evening drew in he fell asleep when at midevening he awoke it was to find the earl of bothwell sitting across from him glenkirk moved to rise easy cousin patrick said francis hepburn softly ive only come to talk glenkirk eyeing the elegant silver and motherofpearl pistol in bothwells hand sat back carefully i am riding back to hermitage tonight said the border lord i dinna know how i can tell cat of the kings order but first i must know that yell be kind to her christ man i love her too they sat in silence for a few minutes then bothwell spoke again it wasnt until ye and jamie had at her patrick ye know that dont ye even when the king forced her she was faithful to ye in her heart i know that now said patrick leslie but tell me francis why did she go to ye if there was nothing between ye bothwell smiled softly with remembrance we were friends patrick i know that is a hard thing to understand but when the first excitement of court wore off she found she was bored she really was the virtuous countess sexual games were not for her neither was gossip shes far too educated for a woman and for our times i understand that because i am also too educated for the times god how we talked and how she listened all the questions she asked so when she was hurt and frightened she wanted to go where no one would find her since i was her only friend she came to me again the silence and then patrick leslie asked quietly when did she become yer mistress francis not for a while bothwell answered in an equally quiet voice he did not think that patrick leslie was entitled to detail it happened cousin it simply happened christ what a coil he leaned forward and spoke urgently take her back to glenkirk as quickly as ye can she is nae going to be easy in this but perhaps being wi her bairns will help the two men sat in silence for some time patrick rose quietly and added wood to the fire going to the cabinet he took out another crystal glass and poured himself and bothwell a good dram each of the potent whisky the pistol now lay in hepburns lap leaning forward once more the whisky in his two hands francis said i love her patrick i want ye to understand that she wanted to go to france for her divorce and i promised her we would if i failed to see jamie this time now i wish to heaven i had not seen him i return cat to ye because i would nae have the destruction of yer family on my conscience but if i ever hear that ye hae been cruel to her ill come if it be from darkest hell ill come and take her back it was with great shock that patrick leslie saw the naked pain in the deepblue eyes of his cousin the earl of bothwell he the husband wanted to sympathize with his wifes lover but he intuitively understood that if he so much as touched his cousin the big man would lose control francis said glenkirk in a kindly voice i hae always loved her from the time we were betrothed when she was a wee lass of four i think she loved me because she was expected to love me and she nae knew any others i had known many women and i appreciated the jewel that mam had ordained would be mine had i not lost my temper two and a half years ago she would hae gone on loving me but i did and ye were wise enough to see her worth ye took what i so carelessly threw away james has ordained that we be unhappy because he is unhappy if he really loved cat he would want her happy wi ye as i do instead he forces her back on me i swear to ye man that i will cherish her this time she may never love me again but this time i will keep her safe bothwell closed his eyes for a moment as if forcing back tears when he spoke his voice was low and husky ye must make love to her patrick dinna be polite wi her and wait for her to recover her hurt if ye do yell never get her in yer bed again we are so tied together cat and ibut ye can ease her pain if ye love her a bit but for pitys sake man be gentle wi her she is nae a castle wall to be breached treat her tenderly and yell find she responds better glenkirk flushed but bothwell did not notice and stood up one more thing patrick before i leave scotland i will want to see her leave said glenkirk puzzled is jamie going to banish ye nay he is too subtle for that but we canna seem to live in the same country the kingly bairn and i besides he is not given to keeping his word before long he will start to haggle over the terms made today and our good john maitland will egg him on to new follies james is determined to be king patrick make no mistake about that the old way of life is done here in scotland lennox angus and the others use me to fight jamie dinna think i dont know that after the next round i will have to go and i know it tis only a matter of time for me but before i go i would bid my cat a final farewell if shell see me promise me yell forbid her not god francis ye ask a lot of me bothwells blue eyes became hard hear me patrick leslie i could leave this room now ride to hermitage tell cat i couldna see jamie and be on a ship for france by weeks end by the time any news got to her shed hae her divorce from the obliging french be safely wed to me and wed hae a bairn started yer family would lose everything who is asking a lot of whom glenkirk cocked an eyebrow if francis i actually thought yed do that id kill ye now he said pleasantly however like me yer a man of honor when ye go cat will see ye if she wishes he stood and held out his hand to his cousin bothwell grasped it for a moment their eyes locked then francis hepburn exited the room the same way he had entered it through the casement windows patrick leslie was inexplicably saddened chapter bothwell rode through the night and into the following morning arriving at hermitage towards midday one look at his face told cat the news was bad but she asked nothing of him instead she led him to their apartments pulled off his boots and put him to bed when bothwell awoke that evening she had a good supper ready for him it wasnt until he had eaten that he spoke to her the king has ordered yer return to glenkirk by september first she whirled to face him her eyes mirroring shock if ye do not he continued jamie will reclaim the lands and goods of the leslies of both glenkirk and sithean as well as the hays of greyhaven let him cat let him bothwell wiout ye i am a dead woman he held her tightly in his arms cat cat think lass think how many children hae ye six and among yer cousins how many bairns are there now at least thirty she said and ye hae twenty cousins and yer brothers and yer parents generation and the moreleslies my god cat close to a hundred people and then my darling we have my children to consider too all these innocent people destroyedthe children and the old people nay love neither ye nor i could build a life on the wreckage of both our families dinna send me away bothwell she whispered piteously i would sooner be dead if we run if we attempt to escape jamie in any manner he will destroy our people he was quite firm wi me he wants us punished and he has found the most exquiste torture to inflict upon us and on patrick leslie as well he still loves ye cat dinna be afraid to return to him she looked up at him how can ye talk to me like this francis because i must christ cat i canna bear it his voice was breaking yer my life lass they wept the border lord and his love clung to one another and wept until they could weep no more then they stood together holding onto each other until francis hepburn swept her up in his arms and carried catriona leslie to bed in the night she awoke to find him gone from their bed for a moment she was frightened until she saw him standing by the windows looking out on the moonlit landscape he turned and she could see his face was wet with tears she pretended sleep realizing it would only add to his agony if he knew she had seen him a dull pain throbbed in her chest and she stuffed her fist into her mouth to stifle the cry that rose in her throat for the next few days neither bothwell nor cat could bear to be out of each others sight for more than a few minutes knowing that only a month remained to them was as the king had anticipated a terrible torment it was finally cat who made the decision that was to ease them through their last weeks i want to go to the lodge she told him i came to ye there if i must leave ye twill be from there he had already told her that the king had forbidden him to come within ten miles of edinburgh and he was expressly forbidden to accompany the countess of glenkirk from the borders she would be escorted by lord home bothwell sent his servants up into the cheviot to clean freshen and stock the house they would live as they had lived in the beginningalone to themselves on the day they rode out from hermitage together for the last time they had three weeks left they had not bidden the servants goodbye for neither of them could have borne an emotional scene hercules would welcome lord home when he arrived to take charge of cat and would bring him to a meeting place it was late summer and already the evenings were cool they spent their days riding walking sitting silently on a hidden promontory that overlooked the border valleys watching the eagles soar off into the west wind their nights were spent in a rapture of lovemaking such as neither of them had ever known made bittersweet by the knowledge that they would soon be parted one morning she came downstairs to find him just entering the house look cat he said holding up a fish ive caught a salmon and ive found some late cress cat burst into tears remembering that on her first day in this house with him he had said almost the same words to her as the realization came to bothwell he swore and then he swore again for today was their last day managing to control herself at last she looked at him through wet lashes and i suppose that smell from the kitchen is lamb broth he nodded she couldnt help but laugh so doleful was his expression clean yer fish bothwell she said lightly but i dinna want to eat it till late what kind of a day is it warm found a field full of michaelmas daisies near the stream lets go swimming her green eyes sparkled and will ye make love to me in the daisies afterwards she teased aye he answered her slowly his own blue eyes quietly serious she flung herself onto his chest and clung to him oh bothwell bothwell i dinna think i can bear it his arms tightened about her for a moment go and get dressed lass ill clean this fish and get us some bread and cheese to take along today they rode slowly in the lateaugust sunshine the valleys glowed below them in faintly purpled haze they did swim in the icy waters of the stream and afterwards he did make love to her she kept laughing as fat bumblebees buzzed them while they lay amid the pungent flowers afterwards they ate the bread and cheese he had put into their saddlebags drank dry white wine from a flask and munched early apples too soon the sun began setting and they rode home as they rode she asked quietly what time tomorrow are we to meet lord home two hours past sunrise he answered her staring straight ahead and then he heard her whisper so soon the sun had sunk in a blaze of hot orange behind them as if to mock them venus glowed bright in the darkening sky above the horses easily found their path back to bothwells lodge and while the earl fed and watered the animals and bedded them down cat cooked their supper they ate in silence until she said we had burgundy our first night aye and ye got drunk i want to get drunk tonight he came around the table and pulled her up to face him no my darling i want ye to remember everything that has happened between usespecially tonight she began to cry softly i hurt francis my heart hurts so very much i hurt also my love but ill nae let jamie stewart know that hes killing me by taking away the one thing i hold dear our pain must be a private thing but catriona my sweet sweet love i dinna want to forget a moment of our love because i will need it to sustain me in the times to come yell be alone now francis who will look after ye hercules will my darling hardly a suitable replacement for the bonniest woman in scotland but he stopped and gently wiped the tears from her cheeks christ cat dinna weep my precious love i thank god jamie is at least returning ye to glenkirk patrick will look after ye aye she said bitterly if he looks after me as well as he did before twill be a short month afore im forced again to be the kings whore no love twill nae happen patrick has promised me she stared at him ye saw patrick when last month when jamie ordered me to return ye i had to be sure he would care for ye properly i had to know he wanted ye for if he hadnt i could nae have let ye go back he loves ye very much my darling even knowing ye belong to me he still loves ye dinna be afraid to go back to patrick leslie she shivered hell want to make love to me she said in a low voice id as soon go into a convent than hae another man touch me bothwell laughed softly nay cat ye were made for love wiout it that lovely body would shrivel and die dinna be ashamed of it and dinna deny it drawing her into the curve of his arm he slid a hand into her silk shirt and caressed the soft swell of her breasts she murmured contentedly her leafgreen eyes halfclosed he laughed again see my darling he gently teased her drawing his hand from her warmth beast she managed to say before his mouth took possession of hers he was gentle always so incredibly gentle with her he kissed her with a melting tenderness while he quickly undressed her then without losing her lips he lifted her into his arms and carried her upstairs to their bedroom when he lay her on the bed she drew him down to her and slid her hands into his shirt stroking his chest and broad back she pushed the shirt off pulling him back to her her soft bare breasts made contact with his smooth bare chest he gasped with pleasure at the familiar contact and felt the rising between his thighs she loosed her grasp and whispered urgently hurry love quickly he tore off his remaining clothes and mounting her thrust deep into her throbbing warmth his entry never failed to elicit a cry of pleasure from her she strained to receive him sobbing her frustration when he could go no further he began a delicious torture thrusting within her as deep as he could go then pulling completely out of her until she begged him to stop so painful had her own desire become but he would not he drove her to heights of passion she had not known existed prolonging their painful pleasure and when at last him own passion burst in a raging flood within her she halffainted from excitement her head was whirling her heart pounding her ears filled with the sound of a ragged weeping that she gradually understood was her own bothwell gathered her into his arms and rocked her back and forth his own senses were reeling he had in a terrible instant of clarity realized that in a few hours he would send this woman out of his life possibly forever slowly their breathing returned to normal she lay back against the pillows and drew him onto her breasts why did ye wait until tonight to do that to me francis he said nothing and she continued it is so easy for ye men ye live by a strict code of honor that leaves no room for emotion tomorrow ye will turn me over to sandy home who will turn me over to james stewart who will probably try to make love to me before turning me over to patrick leslie who will make love to me because i am his wife and it is his right ye will feel remorse at my loss sandy home will regret the part he must play in this drama jamie will feel lust mixed wi a bit of guilt but not enough to stop this terrible thing he is doing to us and patrick will feel apprehension at my return which he will try to hide from me by being masterful where am i in all of this i am alone again while ye all play at this game of honor i am forced to submit my honor to a man i dinna loveall the while hungering for ye bothwell ye are all so honorable so then why do i end up feeling like a whore i would rather be dead and even that is denied me dinna wish for death he whispered huskily the only thing that keeps me sane in all of this is knowing that yell be alive and well wi glenkirk sitting up he looked at her his blue eyes blazing angrily i care naught for honor and if i thought we could build a life for ourselves from the wreckage of our families i would take ye away tonight could ye be happy knowing that we had destroyed glenkirk sithean and greyhaven nay love i dinna believe ye could at least my children have angus and the douglases yer leslies hae been a law to themselves yeve taken an occasional outsider into yer group but yeve been so busy preserving yer wealth together that ye hae no powerful ties we needed none she said our wealth has been our power it isna now my darling it is yer weakness now james stewart uses yer wealth as a weapon against ye and against me i love ye cat i love ye wi all my heart i love ye as i hae never loved another woman and when ye are gone from me my life will be an empty shell i hae nothing left will we nae see each other again there will come a timesix months a year or two from nowwhen i will have to leave scotland before i go i will see ye if ye still wish to see me patrick has promised me that she began to weep softly again and he held her against him stroking her long hair there were no words left exhausted they finally slept waking several times before the dawn he had to arise but she caught him by the arm and begged softly once more my rightful husband so with exquisite delicacy he made love to her his mouth seeking the sweetness of her breasts her belly her thighs gently he entered her bringing them quickly to a mutual satisfaction then marveling as he always did he grew hard again within her this time he took his time enjoying her lovely body to its fullest and again they dozed when she awoke for the second time he was already up and a steaming tub stood before the fireplace without a word she arose and bathed downstairs he laid out a cold ham oatcakes and brown ale she tried nibbling on an oatcake but it tasted like ashes and she only managed to swallow it by gulping some of the bitter ale she felt as cold as ice finally he said if were to meet sandy on time we must leave now she looked up at him her lovely leafgreen eyes mirroring his pain catching her to him his mouth closed over hers stifling her cry for a moment he lost himself in the sweetness of her and as cats lips parted beneath his and her warm breath rushed into his mouth he groaned suddenly she tore herself away from and fleeing outside mounted her horse for a moment he could not move then he palled himself together and joined her the day was gray and threatening here and there the trees showed an early touch of color they were to meet outside the town of teviothead at the st cuthberts cross they rode in silence though there was so much she wanted to say to him she could not speak hercules lord home and bis men were waiting francis hepburn shook hands with his friend yell look after her sandy dinna let her do anything foolish his voice was almost pleading and alexander home nodded wordlessly bothwell dismounted he lifted cat off her horse they stood for one long moment looking at each other tenderly he cupped her face in his big hand yell take care of yerself aye and yell nae hold glenkirk responsible for this he would have had ye happy even at the cost of losing ye i know and dinna let jamie know hes won christ no she exploded i love ye catriona mairi whatever happens remember that remember the beloved leafgreen eyes burned into his i love ye bothwell and whatever happens i am always yers james can force me back to glenkirk but he can never change the way i feel i will never stop loving ye she pulled his head down kissed him passionately and then quickly remounted her horse and kicked it into a canter startled home looked at the earl of bothwell and then signaled his men to ride off after her for a moment francis hepburn looked after them then suddenly his big shoulders began to shake and hercules heard dry wracking sobs he stood helpless not knowing what to do he had never known francis to cry unable to think of anything else he threw an arm around bothwells shoulder come on francis lets go home francis hepburn turned to face his brother and the empty look in his eyes made hercules recoil i hae no home now hercules said bothwell she was my home and now she is gone part iv cat leslie chapter a drizzle fell without letup but cat insisted on riding straight through to edinburgh she refused to spend the night at an inn stopping twice instead so home and his men could refresh and relieve themselves she would take no food but drank a cup of wine which lord home instructed the innkeeper to lace with eggs and spices homes cousin riding in their party commented i hope ye get her to edinburgh alive wi bothwell behind ye and the king ahead of ye id hate to be in yer boots sandy if anything should happen to her shell get there answered lord home grimly if only to hae the pleasure of spitting in the kings face shes a brave lass is cat leslie in the cold dark hours before dawn they reached edinburgh lord home insisted on stopping at this point someone he told cat must go ahead to holyrood house and inform the king yer here he has insisted on seeing ye she did not argue so home sent his cousin quietly instructing him to go first to glenkirk house and inform the earl of his wifes arrival then he was to go to holyrood and inform the king home took cat to his own townhouse where his servants served them with a warm fire and a good breakfast ye must eat something cat luv urged home worriedly sandy i canna eat but get me some of that wine mixture and i want a hot tub im fair chilled and twill nae do for me to appear before the king smelling of the road have one of yer men bring my saddlebags inside ive a change of clothes her voice was calm her request reasonable but her eyes were feverbright having instructed his people he put an arm about her and asked are ye all right cat dinna be kind to me sandy she said softly if ye are ill break and i canna break until i hae seen cousin jamie they set a hip bath before the fire and screened it off the little maidservant took the cake of scented soap from her saddlebags and helped cat bathe when she came out from behind the screen home whistled low with both admiration and shock gods bones luv do ye mean to appear before james like that she wore a lownecked gown of black velvet with long tight sleeves edged in creamcolored lace across her swelling breasts was draped a hepburn plaid caught at the shoulder with a large gold pin an emerald in its center on her chest above a marvelous display of breasts rested the gold hepburn lion pendant that bothwell had given her do ye think the king will object if i show my loyalties she asked ye know damn well he will ye can gain nothing by defying him cat i can lose nothing either sandy hes already taken my life from me lord home shook his head he couldnt reasonably argue with her instead he handed her the goblet of wine drink it luv yer going to need yer strength for the battle ahead an hour later he was relieved of his burden when the kings chamberboy escorted the countess of glenkirkato the kings private closet james stewart wore a floorlength robe over his silk nightshirt she curtsied and rose to face him the hooded amber eyes swept over her and then he said coldly i dinna care for yer gown madame i am in mourning sire for whom myself she replied equally coldly i died yesterday dinna defy me madame ye should be severely punished for yer wanton behavior she laughed harshly instruct me yer majesty tis quite permissible for me to be yer mistress but tis not permissible for me to be bothwells mistress is that correct i loved ye he said quietly ye lusted after me nothing grander than that she shot back and even when that sweet girl became yer queen ye were nae content and wouldna behave decently ye had to once again force yer way into my bed though ye knew it would cause trouble i begged ye not to destroy my marriage to patrick leslie and when he caught ye wi yer dirty hands all over me ye made it all worse than it had to be but jamie i forgie ye that because in forcing me to flee yer cruelty i fled to francis hepburn and i fell in love hes worth a hundred of ye jamie and though yeve torn us apart even death will nae stop our love because it is greater than even the damned royal stewarts she turned from him he was stunned by her violence cat he softly used her name for the first time cat love dinna turn from me i hae hungered so for ye all these months he touched her shoulder and she shuddered for pitys sake jamie dinna touch me ye disgust me his hand reached up and caressed the shining darkgold hair she had bound loosely with a ribbon yer lovely hair he said yer lovely soft hair how i remember it tumbled on the pillows when i made love to ye or dropping like a shining curtain around us in bed it is so beautiful so very beautiful he murmured softly she turned to him then and as he watched fascinated and unbelieving she reached down to the gewgaws that hung from her waist and drew up a small pair of gold scissors before he could stop her she had cut through the thickly bound plait of hair just above the ribbon if ye like my hair so jamie ye should hae it for tis all yell ever get of cat leslie she flung the golden mass at him her face blazing contempt the king drew back horrified it was at this point that the earl of glenkirk entered the room for a moment james and patrick stood side by side seeing them together cats heart began to pound violently it was glenkirk who realized what was frightening her and leaping the space betwen them he caught her as she crumbled in a dead faint before she lost consciousness he heard her cry out piteously francis help me cradling his wife in his arms patrick leslie said quietly to the king ill bid ye good day jamie when cat is fit to travel i am taking her home to glenkirk if ye try to stop me i swear ill return her to bothwell myself and the devil take the consequences but james said nothing he stared at the silken rope of hair in his hands patrick leslie following the kings chamberboy carried his unconscious wife to his carriage and ordered the coachman to drive quickly back to glenkirk house mrs kerr clucking sympathetically helped put cat to bed patrick was relieved to see that she was now merely in a deep sleep that she was exhausted emotionally as well as physically he did not need to be told though lord home had talked with him as they left the palace the earl of glenkirk sat by his wifes bedside throughout the day watching over her he learned how deep her love for francis hepburn really was patrick leslie felt a great sadness come over him as he listened to his wife talking in her sleep he was not sure he could ever win her back but he realized once more that he still loved her towards late afternoon he saw signs that she would soon be awakening stepping into the upstairs hall he called to mrs kerr instructing her to bring a tray with capon bread and butter and a small decanter of sweet white wine when cat opened her eyes she saw patrick crossing the room with a tray in his hands good afternoon sweetheart he said gently how do ye feel how long have i been asleep she asked him about ten hours putting the tray down on the bedside table he fluffed the goosedown pillows and helped her to sit up mrs kerr fixed ye this tray he placed it on her lap take it away i canna eat patrick leslie drew a chair up next to the bed and sat down he held a capon wing under her nose lord home told me that ye did not eat during the whole trip from the borders when did ye have yer last meal two nights ago she said it so softly that he barely heard her eat he said quietly she raised her head up and looked at him her lovely eyes filled with tears that spilled down her cheeks in a torrent he quickly put down the poultry wing and tenderly gathered her into his arms he felt her stiffen but chose to ignore it cry he commanded damnit catriona cry at this the great sorrow that she had been forcing down welled up and spilled over she wept until her eyes were redrimmed and swollen until she could weep no more and all the while he held her protectively crooning softly to her when she was finally quiet he held her off from him a moment and with a silken handkerchief wiped her cheeks but when he put the silk to her nose she snatched it from him angrily im nae a child glenkirk no he answered quietly yer not christ she whispered at him fiercely how can ye want me back knowing that i love him i will always love him she snatched the decanter up and poured herself some wine the look she threw him was defiant and pure cat he laughed dinna get drunk until yeve eaten something he removed the decanter from the tray and put it on the bedside table going to the door he called again to mrs kerr to bring him a tray it soon appeared a distinct contrast to hers containing raw oysters several slices of ham artichokes in oil bread and butter apples a honeycomb and a pitcher of red wine warily she watched him wolf down his food while she forced herself to eat a slice of capon and some bread and butter knowing her sweet tooth he laid a piece of honeycomb on her plate and was encouraged when she ate it then having drunk up the little decanter of white wine she took his pitcher of red and filled her goblet he removed it from her hand yell be sick cat he said and there is nothing more unpleasant than sleeping wi a drunken woman her eyes widened ye dinna mean to sleep in this bed no no ye canna be that cruel patrick gie me some time it had come and patrick leslie steeled himself for what he must do he was shocked to discover that bothwell knew her a great deal better than he ever had yer my wife cat he said quietly whether ye want to be or whether ye love me is nae longer important by law ye belong to me and though ye may not love me i love ye very much i hae been wiout yer company now for over two years i hae no intention of denying myself the pleasure of yer lovely body any longer while he spoke he carefully undressed himself now he walked over to the bed and pulling back the coverlet climbed in beside her she tried to escape him by leaving the bed on the other side but he caught her easily slowly and deliberately he drew her fiercely struggling body to him forcing her back into the curve of his arm he bent and captured her mouth her lips were cold and pressed tightly together gently he forced them open plunging his tongue into her mouth while his free hand caressed the breasts he had skillfully freed from her bodice she gasped as a wave of desire shot through her desperately she renewed her struggle she did not want patrick leslie she wanted francis hepburn and she could hear his voice even now mocking her just two nights ago he had said ye were made for love ye canna deny that her body was betraying her again as it always had by responding to lovemaking when she did not want it to all the while her husband pleasured himself with her her heart cried out to bothwell glenkirk had never made love to her with such tenderness and this calmed her somewhat he moved rhythmically finally crying out his relief she found that though his lovemaking had excited her body she had not reached a climax emotionally he realized it too withdrawing from her he cradled her in his arms go to sleep he said gently for some reason she felt safe and obeyed they stayed in edinburgh for several days until he was sure she could travel safely each night he made love to her as if to reaffirm his position at last he took her home to glenkirk they arrived a week after bess leslies eleventh birthday bess seemed to be the only one not especially glad to see her mother jamie the leslie heir was now fifteen and on short leave from the university he stood as tall as his father and from the saucy looks the servant girls gave him cat knew that her eldest son was already being instructed in the arts of love the thought disturbed her a little for she was only thirtyone as she hugged him he touched the unfamiliar short gold curls what happened to yer hair mother i gave it to the king she answered jesu ye defied him aye he saw the pain in her eyes and saw as well that she tried to hide it putting his arms about her he said softly dinna grieve mother we love ye too and are very glad to hae ye home again colin and robbie were home from rothes they swarmed over her like young puppies in great contrast cats two youngest daughters amanda six and morag five were quite shy with the beautiful sad woman whom grandmother meg said was their mother within a few days however cat had won the two little girls over only bess remained aloof she is jealous of ye said meg with amusement soon she will be grown and shes been feeling her own femininity lately then ye come homeand lord catriona yer over thirty and absolutely beautiful tis very hard on poor bess she adores patrick and up until now has had a great deal of his attention now he spends most of his time wi ye the matter came to a head when it appeared that patricks nightly efforts had borne fruit and cat began to swell with another child the unhappy countess of glenkirk overheard her eldest daughter discussing the matter with her oldest brother i think it is disgusting raged the girl at her age and especially after what shes done to our father by whoring wi lord bothwell there was the sound of a slap and bess shrieked ye hit me jamie ye hit me aye jamie replied and mistress jealousy ill smack ye again if ye ever speak of mother like that we know naught of what happened between mother and father but i do know that mother loves francis hepburn she has come back because she loves us too and would nae allow the king to destroy us how do ye know that sneered bess because john leslie the rothes heir is at university wi me and he overheard his father telling his uncle that glenkirk only got his wife back because the king threatened to destroy our whole family unless she left bothwell good for the king gloated bess he is a godly man jamie laughed cruelly yer a fool little sister nay perhaps just a foolish little virgin the king lusts after mother and when she refused he forced her to leave bothwell by threatening us then why does she hae fathers child if she doesna love him to make peace between them i would think little sister she is a brave and bonnie lady our mother and if ye are not civil to her in future ill beat ye myself cat was amazed at how much her son knew and how wise he was at his age she could also see that she would have to keep an eye on bess the child was growing quickly and understood enough halftruths to be confused cat knew that her daughters angry opinions were not her own but were echoes of an adult voice suspecting the offenders identity cat took steps to remedy the situation when cat had fled to lord bothwell her faithful tiring woman had not known the reason for her mistress behavior returned to glenkirk ellen had taken care of bess from the busy sally and lucy kerr as the months went by with no word from cat ellens confusion turned to anger she unwisely expressed her anger to young and impressionable bess and now with her ladys return ellen deserted bess and resumed her duties with cat thus adding to poor bess bitterness cat could see that bess missed ellen and though ellen had always been valuable to her her oversolicitous attention had begun to get on cats nerves ellen seemed to think that cat had done a terrible thing and was fortunate that patrick forgave her rather than scold her old servant cat took her aside and spoke to her confidentially ellie i am going to need yer help wi bess she is getting to the age where she needs an experienced hand to guide her ye looked after her while i was away would ye mind taking charge of her again she is so fond of ye i will do whatever ye wish but who will take care of ye my chick especially in yer condition ellie yeve become a foolish old womantis not my first bairn i canna replace ye but i think yer niece susan would do nicely aye said ellen thoughtfully thinking of her plain and sensible niece susan is nae a flibbertigibbety girl she would do her job well and i will guide her but could she not be mistress bess woman rather than me i think that bess would be happier wi ye ellie and ye were so good wi me at that age however i will leave the decision to ye ellen decidedas cat knew she wouldthat bess would be a better mistress it was easy to boss a young and unsure girl and she no longer understood her lady catriona feeling important once again ellen took charge of bess and spoke well of cat to her daughter cat made certain to spend time with her three daughters amanda and morag had lost their shyness of their mother which gave cat joy bess though she remained wary was friendlier than she had been and even joined in games cat played with the little ones eight months after her return to patrick leslie cat leslie went into labor tis too soon worried the earl to his mother im surprised shes lasted this long observed meg dinna look so worried my son by nightfall there will be at least two more leslies in this house cat is carrying twins and multiple births always deliver early i know because my mothers last children were twins they run in our family the dowager countess was correct cat easily and quickly delivered a son and a daughter before the sun set on may of the boy was baptized ian the girl jane patrick was delighted that his wife had so thoughtfully named their children after his paternal grandparents cat cradled each child before she slept and then quietly announced that she would not be nursing these children wet nurses were quickly found for the twins in midjune patrick leslie was visited by benjamin kira and the result was a journey to london thinking she would enjoy the trip he asked cat to go with him she refused ill be gone from late summer till next spring sweetheart please come wi me weve been back together such a short time no patrick ye promised him that before he left scotland we might see each other if i am in england wi ye when he calls me i will never see him again dinna ask me to go away wi ye again he did not though it pained him to admit that he was saddened by her refusal he had hoped the birth of their twins would help her to forget the border lord on august patrick leslie left glenkirk bound for london on september the countess of glenkirk received an invitation from george gordon the powerful earl of huntley to visit him and his wife at huntley castle gossip had it that bothwell was in the north if he was then cat knew he would be with the gordons on september the countess of glenkirk left her castle for huntley chapter the truce between james stewart and francis stewarthepburn had not worked out though the king had signed an agreement on august to pardon his noble cousin and his equally noble supporters and to restore all their estates titles and honors he was soon tempted to go back on his word on september a convention of parliament was held at stirling and james attempted to modify the promises he had made in august on september the king forbade his cousin and his supporters to come within ten miles of him unless summoned by james himself should they disobey the charge against them would be high treason maitlands power had not waned the royal gauntlet thrown down it was picked up by bothwell and armed friends they assembled outside linlithgow in early october while the king was in residence on october bothwell was called before the high council to answer to the charge of high treason refusing to attend the proceedings he was denounced all was quiet for several months and then in the spring of james called twice for a levy of forces to bring his cousin to the kings justice suddenly bothwell appeared with a powerful force outside of leith he had come he said to fight the spaniards whose imminent landing was rumored his real purpose was to make a show of strength in hope of bringing his royal cousin to terms james advanced towards leith from edinburgh while bothwell retreated in leisure towards dalkeith as though he were not being pursued at all james was forced to go back to edinburgh having lost yet another encounter with his cousin the border lord then slipped over the border into england where he remained quietly until queen elizabeth was forced to acknowledge his presence and eject him francis hepburn now had two choices he could deliver himself up to james or he could join with the northern earls sensing that exile was near he went north so he could see cat before leaving his homeland there was no one else left he cared to see hercules had been caught and hanged in the previous bitter february margaret douglas and his children behaved as if he did not exist only cat leslie remained would she see no one had told cat so but she knew intuitively that he waited at huntley for her gathering her daughters about her she told them she would be gone for a while but ill be back my little loves she promised and then ill nae leave ye again when amanda and morag had run off to play bess now twelve asked quietly is lord bothwell at huntley mother cats first reaction was to tell her daughter it was none of her business but then she looked again at bess who hovered between childhood and womanhood and thought better of it the countess put an arm about her eldest daughter yes she said i believe that lord bothwell is at huntley dinna be angry bess yer father gave me his permission to see francis someday yell love a man perhaps then bess yell understand yer mother i shall neer love any man but my true wedded lord mother cat laughed softly and squeezed her daughter gently how wonderful to be so young and so positive my darling i hope that in my absence ye will help yer grandmother and watch over yer sisters and the twins bess leslie looked at her mother for a moment and then she clung to her yell nae go away wi lord bothwell ye will come home yell nae leave us forever no my child i will be back a lump rose in her throat i will come back to ye bessie luv dinna fear before cat left glenkirk margaret leslie took her daughterinlaw aside my son did a cruel and terrible thing to ye catriona gosay your final goodbyes to francis hepburn take whatever time ye need but when ye return to glenkirk ye must again be a good wife to patrick he has been punished enough now the beautiful countess of glenkirk rode eagerly across the hills that separated her home from huntley ellen had wanted to come with her saying that her niece had not the experience to accompany her mistress to a great house cat had cajoled her into staying with bess saying the young girl needed ellen more than she did the truth was that the countess did not want her old servant intruding on her reunion with lord bothwell susan was young and unsure enough to be discreet at last the towers of huntley castle came into view and cats heart began pounding conall rode up beside her i dinna suppose yell want us to stay he said disapprovingly no she answered him i dinna need leslie protection in the house of the gordons my grandmother was a gordon twas nae the gordons i was thinking ye needed protection from madame she smiled at him i dinna need any protection from my lord bothwell conall rather he may need it from me conall laughed despite himself he had long ago given up hope of understanding his nobles it only confused him to try they clattered into the courtyard of huntley where george gordon and his lovely french wife henriette awaited them having dismounted cat greeted them warmly but her eyes were restlessly sweeping the courtyard lord gordon laughed he got here about two hours ago cat and insisted on having a bath i doubt if he is ready to receive ye yet but suddenly she saw him at the top of the staircase for a moment they gazed at one another spellbound cat took a few steps forward but then her legs refused to cooperate further and began to give way beneath her he was at her side in seconds catching her up in his strong arms his deepblue eyes devouring her her arms went around his neck as he bent and found her mouth everythingthe courtyard the horses the servants the gordonsmelted away as they abandoned themselves to each other hungrily eagerly their lips demanded more and yet more it was henriette gordon who broke the spell by turning to her husband and saying but george you did not tell me that lady leslie and lord bothwell knew each other i have given them apartments at opposite ends of the castle francis hepburn broke away from cat and both of them burst into laughter oh george teased the countess of glenkirk how could ye hae overlooked even such a small detail huntley looked rueful bothwell gently put cat down on her feet can ye stand now my darling he asked aye francis tis all right now the border lord turned to his pretty hostess and taking her plump little hand smiled down at her which of the two apartments is the larger riette lady leslies i thoughtwith a womans clothes and thingsshe would need the large suite the countess of huntley was flustered by the turn of events will ye then said lord bothwell with grave courtesy please hae my things moved in with lady leslies we shall after all be needing only one bed he turned to his host george ye will excuse us now until the evening meal my lady and i hae been parted for over a year i know ye understand putting an arm about cats waist he led her up the stairs and into the castle henriette gordon faced her amused husband with outrage laughing he led her into their home and when he had told her the tragic story of bothwell and cat the pretty countess of huntley was on the verge of tears oh george les pauvres james stewart il est un cochon she cried indignantly and from that moment she was their ally bothwell waited patiently for an hour to be alone with cat there could be no privacy with servants traipsing in and out cat had ordered a hot bath to be set up for her by the fireplace she was enchanted by the floral decorated porcelain tub the hot water arrived and susan fussed until she found the hyacinthscented bath oil francis hepburn watched amused as the little maid shooed everyone out and tried to take him on as well laughing he caught her by the waist and looked down at her she blushed deep scarlet as his eyes boldly swept her yer nae ellen are ye yer too young nono sir she replied shyly i am susan her niece my aunt looks after young mistress bess now well susan said bothwell kindly yer to go to the servants hall and hae a good supper and if any of the lads get rough wi ye lass yer to tell them theyll answer to me but sir i must help my lady to bathe gently but firmly he propelled her out the door i will help yer lady to bathe susan twill nae be the first time and dinna come back until yer sent for lass he locked the door behind her then turned to find cat helpless with laughter ah bothwell ye rogue she will talk about this the rest of her life chuckled the countess of glenkirk take yer bath madame he commanded unbutton me she countered turning her back to him his fingers fumbled down the long row of tiny silver buttons she was amused by his trembling hands she shrugged the velvet riding gown off and stepped out of it beneath it she wore a lowcut silk underblouse beribboned busk three silk petticoats and lace stockings secured by garters she unbuttoned the blouse and removed it but it was he who unhooked the little busk naked to the waist she gazed up at him her eyes bright with desire bathe he repeated his voice thick sliding the petticoats over her hips she let them fall about her ankles stepping out of them she kicked the white silk mound away from her she was now completely naked except for the dark blue lace knit stockings and their pink garters groaning he turned away she smiled to herself and quickly rolled the stockings down and off her shapely legs when he turned back she was comfortably settled in her tub he sat down next to her ye could tempt a band of angels ye must hae been very true to me bothwell to be so quickly roused i am flattered he looked at her somberly the truths that i have lifted every skirt i could to try to bank the fire ye left in my heart i failed miserably because i have never stopped loving ye or needing ye i dinna expect i ever shall oh francis she cried i have ached for ye all these many months i have never stopped loving ye either yet he said almost bitterly ye gave yer husband another childnay twins she laughed and the sound was silvery in the quiet of the room oh bothwell ye great fool the bairns are yers the bairns are yers he was incredulous ye canna be sure cat but i can she said i can oh my sweet lord did ye not think it strange when ye had already fathered so many bairns and i was mother to six that we had no child of our own he nodded and she continued when mam returned from the east she brought wi her a secret for controlling conception all the women in our family know it until we were safely wed i could not let us have a child when the king forbade my divorce i knew i dared not gie jamie a weapon to use against us then he ordered us parted and i realized i couldna leave ye wiout something of ye to sustain me i was over a month pregnant when i left ye francis glenkirk waited not a moment before claiming his rights so he assumed the twins were his especially when his mother said that twins ran in her family and always came early what did ye call them ian and jane ye named them after my parents aye but patrick thinks they are named after his paternal grandparents what are they like my wee bairns what are they like cat the silvery laugh tinkled again francis theyre but bairns fivemonthold bairns seeing his crestfallen look she tried the lad is auburnhaired and blueeyed he is bright i can tell and very demanding his sister is a blueeyed reddishblonde of very much the same temperament the wet nurses and the nursery staff adore them for they both hae great charm it was what he had wanted to hear and his eyes misted she felt a catch in her throat and silently cursed once again their cousin the king to keep from crying she said to him hand me that cake of soap my love and proceeded to scrub herself down when she had finished she stood and stepped out of the tub francis wrapped her in a towel and began to rub her dry she stood quietly luxuriating in the delicious sensation of his hands on her once again she could tell by his touch that he was near to losing that perfect control he prided himself on and she wanted him as she had never wanted him before turning she slid her slender arms about his neck now francis she said quietly take me now i have waited over a year to be wi ye again and tis nae time to be standoffish pulling away from him she walked slowly across the room and climbed into the big lacetrimmed lavenderscented featherbed undressing he asked did glenkirk nae make love to ye enough that yer so eager my darling glenkirk took every opportunity to use me and though my body responds to him i hae never since we last made love been able to find the heaven i find wi ye francis aye my lord i am eager for ye she held out her arms to him and he waited no longer they cuddled together beneath the warmth of the coverlet he had her cradled within one arm while the other caressed her soft breast and then wandered boldly to stroke her rounded belly her firm trembling thighs and the soft hidden places of her body her breath was coming in short gasps but she suddenly squirmed free of and pushed him back on the pillows bending over him her lips began a tantalizing descent down his long body she was exciting him unbelievably her petalsoft lips gentle touching him here and then there moving lower and lower until she reached his swollen manroot tenderly she took it in her hand and kissed the pink throbbing head then taking it into her warm mouth she drew on it for just a moment his whole body jerked and he cried out as if in agony frightened she released him she looked into his face i only wanted to taste of ye my love she whispered he pulled her back under him and looked passionately down at her what do i taste of he demanded thickly ssalt she answered him suddenly feeling very shy he laughed softly quickly sliding down and between her slender legs he slipped his hands beneath her round buttocks and lifted her up so he might taste of her also she cried outhalf in joy half in shame she wanted him to take her this way even though she felt it was not quite right sweet sweet she heard him murmur christ yer sweet my love she could feel herself slipping away into that golden world of sweet fulfillment that she had been unable to attain since last being with him as the delicious ache began to spread through her lower belly his hardness thrust into her and she cried aloud her happiness afterwardsalmost immediatelythey both fell into deep contented sleep still joined their bodies intertwined when she awoke it was to find him awake too and watching her she smiled and touched his cheek gently he caught her hand and tenderly kissed the palm and the inner wrist their eyes met and she trembled so great was the depth of his emotion that two people could love as deeply as she and bothwell loved terrified her propping himself on one elbow he ruffled her darkgold curls what happened to yer lovely hair she told him the story of her meeting with the king and he shook his head wonderingly ye defied him for me christ how that must hae hurt jamie he put his arms about her yer my wench and have been from the start havent ye my god how am i going to survive wiout ye i have nae done well so far i dinna want to think about it francis not today not now when we are together again how long can ye stay wi me my darling as long as yer at huntley glenkirk is in england until the spring how damned convenient murmured bothwell however when he promised we might see each other again i dinna think he meant ye should live wi me for any length of time the border lords eyes were brimming with amusement i will do as i please bothwell if i thought the leslies could escape jamies wrath i would flee to france yi ye now both the king and my husband know that unfortunately i am bound to the leslies they hae all been at me since my return my uncle patrick the old earl of sithean died two years ago but his wife has nae stopped her whining that my shameless behavior endangers her precious earl charles who is married to glenkirks sister janet when i told my mother the truth of my estrangement from patrick she chided me for not making him understand the great honor done me by james stewart she who was a virgin till her wedding night and who has never known another man in her entire life but my father chortled about the honor of being the kings mistress they make me sick all of them and yeti am bound to them and i must sacrifice my happiness for their safety but my love my very lifei will nae sacrifice this time wi ye when ye leave scotland i shall never see ye again i know it i feel it we are surely doomed to be separated but i will hae this time wi ye his arms tightened about her i know i hae never done anything in this life to deserve love such as yers my sweet catriona mairi the clock on the mantel struck five and she said good lord were going to be late for dinner what will the gordons think reaching out she yanked the bellpull disengaging herself from his grasp she stood up he caught his breath at the perfection of her body without her long hair the beautiful line of her back was visible he had made love to many women but none could hold a candle to her he was not a man to take pride in his ownership of a woman but he was very proud that she loved him susan arrived and modestly set up a screen for her mistress to dress behind the gordon valet assigned to serve lord bothwell rushed to cover the earls private parts as he rose from the tumbled bed but susans flaming cheeks told that he had been too late unable to resist bothwell winked at the little maidservant she almost swooned damnit francis stop teasing susan yeve made her all thumbs no child the pendant bothwell had dressed in a kilt and cats gaze swept him damn me francis she said teasingly yeve the handsomest pair of legs ive ever seen in a kilt he grinned wickedly at her and ye madame hae the handsomest pair of he was stopped by her warning look and he laughed and said well ye do my darling she laughed helplessly yer a most impossible man take me down to supper they descended from their tower to the hall below where george and henriette gordon waited for them alone the earl of huntley had been sure that bothwell and cat would not welcome company so there was none george gordon called the cock of the north was related to the king cat had met him at court he had wisely kept his wife from court henriette gordon was petite with soft hair the color of a daffodil and enormous goldenbrown eyes she was elegant and educated and had charming gallic manners and a warm heart it did not take long for her to become friends with cat leslie knowing that bothwell would be with them through the winter she had asked cat to stay then she ascertained that though cats boys were no longer at home her daughters were and she invited them to huntley for christmas and twelfth night when cat demurred because she did not want to leave meg alone henriette said she would invite the dowager as well the end result was that bess amanda and morag were coming for the holidays but meg had been asked to forbes manor to stay with her youngest son michael and his wife isabelle she did not often get to see them and she felt that this was the perfect opportunity there was she wrote one complication the twins would have to go to huntley meg did not want them left alone at glenkirk with the servants bothwell was wild with excitement our bairns he said i shall get to see our bairns ye canna admit to their paternity she cautioned him the world has never doubted that patrick leslie is their father i will allow no oneeven yeto endanger them it was a new side of her that he sawthis fierce and protective mother he put an arm about her fate has nae dealt kindly wi us has it cat were together now bothwell she answered him the unspoken questionsfor how long until whenlay between them but neither cat nor francis could ask those questions so while the autumn deepened about them they accepted the gordons hospitality it allowed them a tranquil place to rest in their last months together for just a brief time they might forget the public controversy that raged about francis stewarthepburn and the private one that raged about them both when the future arrived they would face it courageously but for now they basked in their good fortune chapter green and gold september gave way to a rainbow october the trees about huntley were clothed in their traditional brilliant colors november was a grayandbrown month startling in contrast to the beauty of the previous month the first snow fell late on st thomas night and the leslie children arrived that day they had come bess riding a gentle brown mare the other children and their attendants in carriages escorted by conall and fifty menatarms twelveyearold bess leslie strove to appear grownup she wore an elegant riding habit of claretcolored velvet a matching cloak trimmed in sable and a small hat atop her dark neatly braided hair cat had never seen her eldest daughter with her hair up she is très chic murmured henriette and very young yet replied cat with a catch in her throat she does not approve of you laughed henriette behind her plump beringed white hand the young especially young virginsare so terribly intolerant aye smiled cat in agreement i was at her age poor bess she likes francis she canna help it but she loves her father and feels it is disloyal to him to be polite to bothwell she canna understand why i no longer care for her father and i dare not tell her the truth so i evade her questions which only hurts and confuses her more she would be more hurt my friend if she did know the truth come cat do not fret let us go and meet your children bess serious young face lit up the moment she saw her mother forgetting dignity she tumbled off her horse into cats arms mama cat hugged the girl to her then releasing her she admonished gently bess yer manners make yer curtsy to lord and lady gordon and lord bothwell blushing a rosy color the girl turned and curtsied beautifully to the other adults henriette gordon kissed the girl on both cheeks and welcomed her warmly and george gordon murmured an appropriate welcome but then bothwell stepped forward and taking the young girls hand raised it to his lips and kissed it i am delighted to see ye again lady elizabeth he said his blue eyes twinkled at her damn him thought bess i dinna want to like himbut i do and for the briefest moment bess caught a glimpse of the man that so fascinated her mother amanda and morag leslie descended the carriage to make pretty curtsies to their host and hostess cat kissed each of her daughters in turn at last the kerr sisters exited the second coach each clutching a twin ahhh said the countess of glenkirk look everyone my littlest bairns she drew back the cover from janes bunting revealing auburn curls peeping from a laceedged bonnet and dark lashes resting on pink cheeks the baby slept ian however was wide awake cat was startled by the familiar expression in his darkblue eyes art awake lovely she crooned at the boy and took him from sally now heres my wee laddie madame et monsieurs je presente le seigneur ian leslie she turned here bothwell ye take him while i get my jane from lucy she briskly handed him the child scolding him christ francis hes nae wet dinna drop him taking the baby girl from lucy she said lets go indoors tis too raw out here for the bairns francis hepburn looking nervous but pleased followed her he was admiring the clever way in which she had arranged for him to hold his son bothwell sat down by the fire in the great hall and held the child in a sitting position on his knee hello ian my small son he said softly the child looked back at him seriously and then reaching a fat fist up to the bending man grabbed a handful of hair and yanked owwwww roared the earl of bothwell but a small chortle from the baby turned his outrage to mirth yer a wee devil lad he chuckled but cat knew he was pleased with the boy best to gie ian to his nanny now francis she said quiedy he obeyed her what do ye think of his sister my lord bothwell looked at jane who was now awake and smiled down at the baby girl to his delight the child smiled shyly back she looks a bit like ye he said aye replied cat but shes got red hair meg says her coloring is stewart but the leslies have red hair too for just a moment longer bothwell gazed hungrily at the two children in his secret heart he cursed james stewart his son and his daughter would grow up leslies never knowing him or their true heritage he wanted these children desperately sadly he watched as the kerr sisters removed the twins to the gordon nurseries christmas day dawned cold and gray bothwell who had always moved back and forth between old and new kirk as politics dictated attended mass with the gordons catholic household as he knelt with his mistress on the cold stone floor of the estate church he wondered again why there was this battle over the way to worship did god if there was a god really care looking at cats face he revised his thinking aye there was a god the only trouble was that god seemed to be on the kings side though why god should approve of james was beyond him it showed a great want of taste in scotland new years and twelfth night were the gayest celebrations of the winter season on new years eve there was to be a great celebration with a feast that had kept the cooks busy for three days the st of december was bitterly cold but clear cat and francis had gone riding returning late in the afternoon they found the stableyard deserted everyone from the lord to the lowest retainer was out gathering wood for tonights midnight bonfire neither cat nor bothwell was stranger to the art of horse care they led their mounts into the stable unaware that bess watched from the loft above several hours after her mother left that morning bess had decided that perhaps she would like to ride after an hour the cold having forced her back she returned to find the grooms gone leading her mare into its stall bess unsaddled the animal rubbed it down and fed her then curious she climbed to the loft to see what she could see from the loft of the glenkirk stables you couldon a clear daysee all the way to the loch and to the towers of sithean from the loft of the huntley stables she could see nothing but hills and more hills disappointed she was about to climb down when she saw her mother and lord bothwell enter the stables leading their horses elizabeth leslie could not have said why she remained hidden in the huntleys stable loft that day rather than announcing her presence the adults below her talked quietly to each other about ordinary things of the celebration to come and of what they would be giving the children bess learned that her mother and bothwell would be presenting her with a longedfor strand of pearls plus a bracelet earrings and matching brooch of pearls and diamonds at twelfth night she was to have a lynx cape and a necklace and earrings of garnets she grows so fast sighed cat we shall soon have to arrange a suitable match for her george and henriette have suggested that their second son andrew might suit bess shes going to be a beautiful woman agreed bothwell keep her from court cat nodded i will hae no problem there bess is like her grandmothers she prefers being a country mouse she will make the man she marries an admirable wife bess preened silently in her hiding place pleased that her mother should have such faith in her then bothwell leaned over and said something bess could not hear her mother laughed and grabbing a handful of hay tossed it at the earl the chase was on and the two adults romped back and forth until they collapsed laughing in a pile of hay in the empty stall directly below bess the young girl could not see what was going on beneath her unless she peered over the edge lured by assorted sounds she carefully lay on her stomach and looked down bess had only the vaguest idea of what went on between a man and a woman what she saw below enlightened her somewhat her mother lay on her back in the hay the paleviolet velvet skirts of her riding habit turned up cats long shapely legs sheathed in knitted purple lace stockings were spread and between them lord bothwell labored back and forth bess could see nothing of great note for both bothwell and her mother were kissing passionately while breathing roughly and murmuring unintelligible things to each other then her mother cried out quite clearly oh bothwell i adore ye and all was quiet but for the sounds made by the horses so that was lovemaking strangely she wasnt shocked it was a curious matter and it did clear up things she had overheard the maids speaking about when they thought she wasnt listening lord bothwell stood and adjusted his kilt then pulled cats skirts back down bess saw her mother sit up and was amazed at how lovely she wasall rose with her tawny tousled hair damn francis that was nae wise what if someone had come in they would have left rather quickly i imagine the great border lord laughed besides madame my love i dinna hear ye complaining he finished teasingly cat laughed helplessly i have always wanted to be ravished in a haypile she admitted and he echoed her laughter but slowly cat sobered i dinna think i can bear it my love hush my darling dinna think about it let us enjoy the time we have left let me come wi ye francis please let me come wi ye cat his voice was patient and very tender sweeting we hae been through this before we canna be responsible for the destruction of all the leslies then too my love i am a poor man now james has everything i own how would we live surely jamie has forgotten me now that prince henry has been borntis said he fair dotes on the bairn surely he would hae compassion on our children as to our livingoh francis i am a very wealthy woman in my own right just a word to my bankers the kir as and my investments and gold can be placed anywhere in the world bess was shocked to hear her mother talk of abandoning her family especially when she had promised to return to glenkirk she strained to hear what bothwell would answer she did not have long to wait never he spat never would i allow a woman to support me as to james softening his stand ye may disabuse yerself of that notion madame james has not altered his stand at least my children are half douglas and allied by blood to a great family which will protect them but ye leslies intermarry who will protect them unless we obey cousin jamie he will destroy them christ my love my sweet sweet love i hate the thought of losing ye but i cannot build a life wi ye on the ruins of glenkirk and all his family bess could see her mothers face clearly now and the tragic look was almost too much for the girl to bear cat stood very straight and composing her face into a mask of passivity said i am sorry my lord for adding to yer pain what is it about ye lords of bothwell that turn sensible women into irresponsible ones mary stewart lost both her kingdom and her only child for love of yer uncle james and here am i ready to sacrifice my entire family for ye he held her close her eyes closed and she smelled the damp leather of his jerkin sometimes she thought sadly sometimes i wish i could just close my eyes and nae wake up i dinna know how i bear life wiout this man then she realized that he would be even more alone than she would be there would be no spouse no family no bairns for him penniless he would roam the continent selling his sword to the highest bidder or being kept by women there would always be women happy to take care of francis so why would he not let her do it as if reading her mind he said no not a pennypiece my love never from ye for i love ye wi the others it does nae matter she looked at him ruefully in control of herself now let us go in and get dressed for dinner francis i will never stop loving ye my darling he said quietly and turning from her he strode from the stable oh christ bess heard her mother swear softly dear christ help me to be braver than i am he needs me to be strong now then she followed lord bothwell from the stables bess remained quietly in the loft stunned by what she had heard she had grown up in the last halfhour and for some reason it hurt it had not been the sight of her mother and lord bothwell coupled in close physical embrace that upset her but rather the fact that their love brought them pain bess did not understand that for she had always believed that love would be sweet if it brought pain rather than pleasure why did they pursue it slowly she climbed down the loft ladder then picked herself clean of telltale hay she could not ask her mother for answers but perhaps later on she could pursue this puzzle for now she had to hurry and change lest she be late for the celebration chapter the holidays had passed deepest winter had settled upon the land the leslie children had long since returned to glenkirk though the king knew that bothwell sheltered with the gordons he had not learned that the countess of glenkirk was with her lover james sent the earl of huntley an arrogant letter offering a full pardon if he would turn bothwell over for execution the great highland chief gave orders that the royal messenger be fed and allowed to rest the night in the morning he had the man brought before him i want the king my cousin to know that this message comes directly from me he said quietly i do not believe that james would even hint that i violate the laws of hospitality therefore i do not believe that this letter is from him the earl of huntley quietly tore the parchment in two pieces and handed them to the royal messenger i return this to my lord the king in hopes that it will help him to trace the bold traitor who so blatantly uses the kings name for his own foul ends when bothwell learned of huntleys brave and clever ruse he thanked him but said i must go now this is the end and if james would really have me dead there is no hope maitland thinks he has won and bothwell laughed harshly he actually believes that by breaking the back of the nobility he can substitute his own influence but if he really thinks that then he is a bigger fool than all the rest those stern men who molded the king did a better job than they realize jamie may be superstitious and a bit of a coward but he will be the only king in this land mark my words wait at least until the spring protested george gordon and there is cat she is a brave lady your countess of glenkirk but this will break her heart bothwell didnt need to be told that they had been living in a fools paradise pretending they were normal people she had been sleeping when he had left her to join huntley but he believed she would be awake now she was awake and being sick into a basin when she had finished he wiped her mouth with a damp towel and holding her close said i ought to beat yer backside black and blue for this she said nothing so he continued my foolish foolish love have ye gone mad ye canna foist this bairn on glenkirk do ye think he will welcome ye back swelling wi our bastard the child is mine she replied looking fiercely at him this child is ours cat yers and mine with patrick in england there can be no doubt christ hes a proud man hell nae accept the bairn hell accept it she said grimly he owes me that my god said bothwell in amazement do ye mean to make him pay the rest of his life for one nights indiscretion hasnt he been punished enough no she spat angrily out at him in time perhaps i will forgie patrick but i will never forget never that indiscretion as you call it has cost me everythingmy happiness my peace of mind where am i in all this oh god it is so easy for ye men with yer pride and yer damned sacred code of ethics i have been destroyed by the three of ye patrick used me like a common drab to soothe his injured pride yet i am expected to be grateful that he took me back james dirtied me and i will never be able to wash away the stain he left on me and ye francis she rounded on him what was my first attraction for ye that jamie wanted me is that why ye fell in love wi me my lord to spite the king another victory over the royal bairn she wanted to hurt this man as they all had hurt her his big hand slashed out and slapped her before he realized it her eyes filled with tears but she made no sound instead her fingers gingerly touched her cheek and felt the welts her head was ringing with the force of his blow but she could hear his voice raging i love ye he shouted and his fingers dug cruelly into the soft flesh of her arms i hae from the beginning but ye were the virtuous countess and i respected that virtue ye see my love i only seduced those women who wanted to be seduced when jamie bragged he had forced ye into his bed i was ashamed for and i ached for the shame ye must be feeling then patrick and james hurt ye so i grabbed at the chance they so foolishly offered me i love ye yer a spoilt stubborn bitch but i love ye cat it is hard enough to leave ye behind my darling but to know that i leave ye wi my child in yer belly he stopped taking her chin between his thumb and forefinger he tipped her face up to him why my darling why did ye do this to us because she answered him softly because i canna bear to lose ye entirely my love do ye think that because i am safe at glenkirk twill be easier for me christ bothwell twill be harder never knowing where ye are or if yer safe or if ye lack for anything when ye leave me this time i shall never see ye again in this life at least the child will gie me hope francis and twill be a constant reminder to me of our love do ye understand that my lord without the child i should retreat into some twilight world to escape the reality of what has happened to us the child will help me to maintain my sanity when glenkirk tells ye he will nae let ye keep the bairn send it to me twill nae be easy but twould be a comfort to hae our son wi me in my exile and the child shall nae suffer the stigma of bastardy i will legally acknowledge him so he may bear my name she laughed twould be a damned inconvenience to ye my gallant lover to tramp about europe wi a wee bairn besides my lord tis a lass i carry i know i am always damnably ill in the beginning wi the lasses her eyes teared again for a moment once at hermitage when bess had been intolerably rude to ye ye promised me that one day we would hae a lass of our own now we shall and she shall be a comfort to me in my loneliness and i shall never see her he said softly yes ye will each year i shall send ye her miniature and ye shall see how she grows tis small consolation my dear for a child i shall never hold in my arms twas hard enough to leave just ye behind but now he paused i dinna mind overmuch about the twins for glenkirk assumes them his and they will grow up leslies but this poor wee bairn he put a big hand on her belly who will see that my little lass is nae hurt i will she answered him softly no harm will come to our daughter francis i swear it if i were patrick leslie said bothwell quietly i should probably kill ye the earl of bothwell might kill his unfaithful wife but the earl of glenkirk will not she answered him with assurance patrick is far too civilized and i am not he cocked an amused eyebrow at her nay francis yer not if ye were more civilized yed nae be in the coil wi the king but oh my love dinna change for i love ye as ye are he laughed but soon turned serious again dinna press glenkirk too hard cat he loves ye and he is pricked wi guilt for what he did but he is a man sweeting tis a large morsel yer asking to swallow and i fear he will not she nodded and he had the oddest feeling that she would be deliberately reckless pregnancy seemed to calm her as the time for his departure drew near for him it was the opposite it worried him tremendously to have to leave her behind they fought over money again wealthy in her own right she was eager to put her money at bothwells disposal but he was as proud as she was rich and would take nothing from her fool she shouted at him wiout gold yer as helpless as a beetle on its back i will manage he replied tersely bothwell bothwell listen to me my love france is nae scotland or england ye hae no real friends to shelter ye ye must hae money to live please let me help ye the money is nae patricks tis mine left to me by mam invested by me over the years please take it let me instruct the kiras to place my wealth at yer disposal in their paris bank no my darling he said quietly but he was touched by her offer and her concern i told ye once that i could not accept so much as a pennypiece from ye for i love ye i would not have history say that francis stewarthepburn loved the countess of glenkirks money rather than the countess herself alas history never remembers women in love my name shall die wi me she looked up at him dear god francis how will ye live my sword will be fer hire the french kings always have need of another good sword twill earn me a place to sleep and a full stomach dinna fret my love i shall survive i wonder she mused whether a bed and a meal are enough for the master of hermitage kelso coldingham liddesdale and crichton they will have to be until i can build a fuller life for myself there are ways aye she hissed suddenly furious at him between some overblown duchess legs ill wager he laughed down at her possibly my darling yer love for me has blinded ye to the fact that i am a ruthless man take the money francis be safe i beg of ye no catriona no she knew she had lost it was useless to argue further still she vowed to instruct the kiras to deliver to him whatever he needed if he should ask and the king of france would have a large bribe to assure bothwells welcomeand his safety meanwhile in edinburgh the king sought to bribe a merchant friend of bothwells to betray the earl instead master tennant arranged for a ship to aid the earl in his escape to france it would await bothwell off rattray head on april though bothwell argued against it cat rode with him her condition was fine i will nae lose this bairn she assured him and she had arranged with the abbot of deer abbey to shelter them on the night before he would sail as they took their leave of the gordons henriette whispered to her my maid nora says that glenkirk arrived home three days ago cat knew that nora had been walking out with a leslie manatarms since christmas say nothing she whispered back henriette nodded they rode towards the coast with a troop of gordon retainers to protect them and reached the abbey by days end the abbot greeted them nervously for he lived in terror that the king would learn he had sheltered the earl of bothwell still he owed his friend abbot charles leslie a great favor which he now repaid by sheltering for one night the countess of glenkirk and her infamous lover settled in the abbey guest house cat told bothwell i dinna want to sleep tonight we hae the rest of our lives to sleep he understood and held her close so she would not see the tears in his own eyes lately he had seen her build a shield about her emotions she would he knew make no scene he loved her the more for it for had she weakened for even a moment he could not have left her behind just as he could not live with her knowing he had destroyed the leslies francis stewarthepburn was whatever his enemies said about an honorable man it would be his downfall they spent the night sprawled before the blazing fireplace talking and just oncein the early hours before the dawnhe made love to her for the last time his hands roamed gently over her lovely body bringing her passion to a delicate peak for the last time she felt his hardness within her and abandoned herself to the rapture he always brought her and when it was over he bent and kissed her softly swelling belly they rode out from the abbey before dawn reaching the coast as the light grew standing on the cliffs above rattray head they watched the bobbing ship a black silhouette in the dark sea against the brightening sky the signal had been given and as they descended to the beach they could see a little boat making its way to the shore the gordon menatarms had positioned themselves discreetly about the beach cat and bothwell stood facing the sea his arm was about her yet she felt nothing then he turned her so she faced him and gazed down at her the small boat was almost to the shore pulling a sapphire ring with a gold lion on it from his finger he gave it to her for my lass when she is old enough he said she nodded wordlessly and put the ring in her pouch he gently touched her cheek there will nae be anyone else cat there never was anyone else ye know that dont ye yyes francis her voice shook slightly dinna grieve love yell be safe wi glenkirk he said and then he drew her into his arms and for the last time took possession of the mouth he loved so much she melted against the hardness of him her whole body protesting their fate neither of them had ever realized that a kiss could be so sweet they clung to one another until an urgent voice pierced their awareness my lord my lord we must hurrytis dawn and the tide will soon be against us reluctantly he pulled away but his deepblue eyes never left her leafgreen ones farewell my beloved he said softly go safely my dearest lord she answered he turned and hurrying across the sand stepped into the little boat francis he turned to find her running to the boat and caught her outstretched hands i love ye bothwell there was never anyone else but ye there never will be he smiled gently at her i know catriona i always knew now my darling gie me a smile let me see but once more the smile that enslaves me it was terribly difficult but as the boat moved away and their hands were pulled apart she smiled radiantly at him and caught his last words coming over the hiss of the waves i will love ye forever catriona mairi she stood on the damp sand in the chill of the april morning watching the cockleshell skim across the waves to the ship she saw him climb safely aboard and watched as the anchor was hoisted the sails filled quickly and the ship began to move slowly away she stood looking after it until her eyes burned and the ship was no longer even a speck in the distance she was unaware of the waves lapping over her boots suddenly she heard a familiar voice say quietly come madame it is time for ye to go home she turned to face her husband and his eyes were slivers of ice reaching out he roughly pulled her cloak aside and his gaze disdainfully raked her rounding belly the force of his blow sent her to her knees arms clutched protectively about her body she looked defiantly up at him hurt his bairn and as god is my witness i will go after him then ye may contend wi james stewart by yerself pulling her roughly to her feet he snarled at her i let ye whore wi yer lover but i will nae claim his bastard when yeve birthed it it goes then i go too patrick she shouted back at him had ye protected me from the kings attentions i should have remained yer good and faithful wife but ye did not protect me and i fell in love wi francis now i must live the rest of my life alone apart from my love but i hae his bairn and i will nae allow ye to take it from me ye must kill me first if ye try to steal my child i will take it and go after him her voice was rising steadily i have been forced to sacrifice my happiness and his own for the damned leslies now ye would try to take the one living memory i have of francis christ i hate ye i hate ye angrily he caught her by the arm and his fingers hurt her cruelly control yerself madame he said softly through gritted teeth there is no need to inform the entire district of our differences we will continue this discussion at glenkirk she pulled away from him there is nothing to discuss patrick she began climbing the path to the top of rattray head where her horse waited patiently it was then she realized that the gordons had gone and leslies stood in their place a sudden weariness overcame her and she would have stumbled but for patrick leslies strong hand beneath her arm keep moving madame twould not do for lord bothwells brave and bonnie whore to fall on her beautiful face now we are riding straight through to glenkirk thats almost three days from here she protested aye he answered grimly yell nae kill me or the bairn glenkirk ive ridden the borders wi him he said nothing but helped her to mount she was exhausted physically and emotionally and needed rest but he would stop only briefly to rest the horses and allow his men to relieve themselves with each mile she grew whiter at one point conall spoke up gods mercy sir yer going to kill her for sure let her rest but before patrick could answer she spoke up no we go straight through to glenkirk he shot her an angry look i make those decisions he said go to hell glenkirk she replied evenly and spurred her horse ahead when they finally reached glenkirk castle she accepted his help dismounting then walked alone to her apartments where she collapsed on the floor she never knew that it was patrick alone who cared for her in her delirium but he learned again from her fevered ravings how terribly he james and even bothwell had hurt her she relived it all and sitting by her side he was forced to share it all for a time she was back in the early days before their marriage when she had shyly given him her innocence and then angrily fought him for her rights far more shocking than he was prepared for was the sudden and intimate knowledge of what the king had done to her hearing her plead against performing the perversions that james had forced her into sickened him and then he found himself reliving the rape through her eyes weeping bitterly she sat straight up in their bed and staring at him with sightless eyes held out her hands to himbegging him not to shame her he was devastated but the most painful experience of all for patrick leslie that night was to hear once more of her love for bothwell when she spoke of him her face became a totally different face from the one he had always loved it was a far more beautiful faceserene and mature that she and bothwell adored each other was obvious and he who had loved her since she was a child ached to learn that only francis stewarthepburns love could satisfy cat he was touched to learn that she had tried to give bothwell her wealth and equally touched to learn that the great border lord had refused her it was funny thought glenkirk but had they not loved the same woman he and bothwell might have been friends one thing he did not learn however was the truth about the paternity of the twins even in her great illness she protected her children several days later she came to her senses again and with a frightened gesture clutched her belly dinna fear glenkirk said harshly ye still hae yer bastard and he departed leaving her in the care of her servants cat was a tough creature and she quickly regained her strength her color returned and she grew sleek and plump with the passing weeks she spent her time resting and with her children only bess was old enough to know that the child her mother carried was not her fathers and bess wanted no more wars with her mother she made her peace with cat by asking to be the childs godmother and cat agreed pleased bess had grown up meg could say nothing to cat unwilling to choose sides between her stubborn son and her equally implacable daughterinlaw they were both so proud the dowager finally resolved her dilemma by going off to visit her youngest son and his wife for an indefinite stay the earl of glenkirk treated his wife with a cold courtesy they were bound together by the church and by royal command cat responded in kind it appeared an impossible situation in midaugust of the countess of glenkirk was delivered of her ninth child a daughter the following day she sat up in bed receiving her family at her back were laceedged pillows and her tawny hair hung loose and shining about her shoulders it was not until late afternoon that the earl of glenkirk visited his wife she had given up hope of his coming and was alone nursing her daughter he stood in the doorway of her bedroom watching her and for a moment his eyes softened then she looked up and their eyes met may i come in cat she nodded drawing up a chair by her bedside he sat down and watched the child suck hungrily on the plump breast shortly the baby fell asleep and before she could stop him glenkirk took the child from her he cradled the infant in the crook of his arm and looked down at it it was pinkandwhite with a tiny heartshaped face and damp auburn curls thick dark eyelashes tipped in gold lay like halfmoons on her cheeks he had seen enough infants in his time to know that this one would be a great beauty what will ye call her he asked i had not thought on it yet she answered since she is probably the last child we will ever have i should like to name her he said her eyes widened in surprise what would ye call her she asked hesitantly frances he said quietly frances leslie is to be her name for the briefest moment she did not believe she had heard him correctly but his eyes were warm suddenly and he smiled at her i will nae ask yer forgiyeness cat for what i did to ye cannot be erased or forgotten but i dinna want james stewart to destroy us and our family as he destroyed bothwell i know yell never love me again but can we nae begin afresh and be friends i have never stopped loving ye sweetheart and i doubt i ever will she drew a deep breath and felt her heart swell until it ached a hard lump rose in her throat and tears burned her eyelids reaching out she took his free hand and pressed it to her cheek then she looked up at him and her eyes were like emeralds bothwell was right she said softly he said we would be safe wi ye glenkirk lay the sleeping child in her cradle and then returning to his wifes side took both her hands in his am a luckier man than he sweetheart i have been given a second chance he smiled again at her and she tremulously returned the smile she would make her peace with him for her daughters sake and because they would be safe with him but no matter how long she lived she would not forget francis stewarthepburn the great border lord the uncrowned king of scotland and her beloved he would always live fiercely in her secret heart book ii part v flight to love chapter catriona leslie sat quietly before her bedroom fire watching the dancing flames and trying to absorb the events of the past weeks her husband was dead or so everyone assumed she could not however imagine patrick dead nor did she feel he was still she sighed the facts seemed indisputable eighteen months ago patrick had sailed from leith in a sixship convoy aboard his flagship the gallant james they were bound for the new world on a furbuying expedition it was a new venture in the leslie interests and the earl of glenkirk had gone along to be sure the new business would be successful in part cat blamed herself for his departure though they had made their peace after frances annes birth and there was no enmity between them neither was there anything else to all outward appearances the earl and countess of glenkirk were an ideal couple but cat pined every waking moment for her exiled lover the earl of bothwell she said nothing but patrick leslie knew and continuously cursed himself for the supreme act of stupidity that had cost his wifes love for close to a year now the earl had toyed with the idea of mounting an expedition to the new world furs had always been an important part of european fashion and the quality of skins beginning to trickle in from the new world was quite superior why asked patrick should our ships carry such valuable cargo for others when we can buy the furs ourselves and sell them in europe ourselves so it was decided that the first leslie ships would leave in early spring of followed three months later by a second group commanded by the earls brother adam leslie in the hope that his absence would give her time to heal and perhaps begin thinking of him in a more loving fashion the earl of glenkirk chose to lead the expedition himself cat had even gone to leith in the company of all their children to bid him a safe journey i will bring ye back enough beaver to make a whole cloak he promised gaily dark fur shows yer beauty to perfection and he kissed her tenderly go safely patrick and return soon she answered him yell be all right cat she smiled up at him and for a brief moment he saw her as she had been before life had hurt her so badly ill be fine glenkirk and the leafgreen eyes twinkled mischievously at him i am quite capable of being on my ownif ye call being wi nine bairns being alone and they had parted she had had no premonition of disaster no premonition that she would never see him again but six weeks ago in midjuly of the second convoy of leslie ships had returned to leith heavy with a cargo of rich furs and bringing also the terrible news adam leslie not even waiting to oversee the unloading had spurred his horse cruelly to reach glenkirk with the announcement that patrick leslie and his six ships had never reached their destination in the new world the king had quickly learned of the tragedy and without consulting the leslies he declared young james leslie the fifth earl of glenkirk cat was furious though glenkirk needed its lord once again james stewart was interfering in her life he had written to her this week that her mourning was not to exceed six months she was to be back at court by spring his motive couched in kindly rhetoric made her laugh and swear alternately the young earl was ordered to marry quickly to ensure the glenkirk succession thank god thought cat to herself that patrick and i had the wit to betroth jemmie to isabelle gordon two years agoelse king jamie would interfere in that as well the kings letter continued since patricks mother meg still lived glenkirk had the unusual distinction of having two dowager countesses as the elder resided in the dower house the younger must come to court so the young people might have their marital privacy and so the older woman would not be disturbed cat snorted ye dinna fool me jamie wi patrick gone and bothwell exiled ye think to hae yer way wi me come to court and gie my son and his bride their privacy pah come to court and gie ye my body you bastard ye say nothing of my other bairns what would ye say if i arrived wi them all she was in a very difficult position and could not ask her young son for protection against the king but the young earl knew most of the reasons for his parents estrangement now with the king seeking to entrap his mother again jemmie sought and found what he believed was a solution to free cat without openly offending the king as he burst into her apartments she looked up startled my god ye look so like patrick she said with a catch in her voice he knelt by her side saying softly i hae the answer to yer dilemma mother i know how we may thwart the king wiout bringing his wrath down on the lesliestis foolproof she put a hand on his shoulder and he saw the sadness in her face jemmie my love i thank ye but i am trapped and i would nae shame yer fathers memory by destroying his familyour family the king wants me as his mistress and there is simply no escape for me i must obey him nay listen to me the king is nae aware that i know of his duplicity what if after bella and i and bess and henry are married this winter we all troup to court leaving ye here to complete yer mourning period we return to find ye gone only a note remains telling us yeve gone to visit our leslie cousins in france in hopes of overcoming yer depression and said cat excitedly catching his mood if as soon as ye leave edinburgh to return home workmen arrive at glenkirk house to completely refurbish it the king will nae suspect that i dinna intend to return she chuckled i will secretly transfer the deed to glenkirk house to bella and my lodge acuil to bess that way when jamie discovers that the bird has flown he canna confiscate them yer right my son if ye play the loyal and loving subject then jamie dare not touch anything leslie his involvement has been wi bothwell yer father and me if he believes ye know nothing he can nae punish you or our family his pride will nae permit it for he is very anxious the english hae a good report of him the old queen has never officially declared him her heir and she might name arabella stewart his first cousin but jamie ye must publicly denounce my wicked behavior not even bella must know of our plot he grinned at her aye mother ye are indeed a shameful hussy but id hae ye no other way then he became more serious yell need money ill ask the kiras the best way of secretly handling funds for ye nay jemmie but thank ye for the thought theres nae been a need for ye to know but i am a very wealthy woman in my own right i will hae the kiras begin to slowly transfer my funds to europe where will ye go he asked her knowing in his heart the answer she would give him she looked straight at him why jemmie i go to find bothwell if francis will still hae me i will be the happiest woman alive i dinna think ye need fear that lord bothwell doesna want ye i understand he was recently expelled from france for killing a man in a duel the unfortunate gentleman in question made an unkind remark regarding a lady of quality in scotland who held bothwells devotion and where is francis now she asked evenly italy he tried spain but the spaniards are a bit too religious and their court is quite stuffy yell find yer border lord in naples go to him mother and be happy marry him as ye both always wanted glenkirk will ever be here for ye but i dinna think youll need it frances anne will remain here until yer safely established i send her to ye then ian and jane also she said quietly james leslie laughed softly i always suspected as much though thank god father never did she flushed under her eldest sons amused gaze ye amaze me jemmie how can ye be so tolerant i am tolerant because ye were always a good mother to us i am tolerant because until the king forced ye into his bed ye were always a good and loving wife to my father i am tolerant because the same hot blood that flows in your veins mother flows in mine i have seen how other men look at ye and as a page wi lord rothes household i have overheard things whatever happened that lost my father yer love i blame on the king i dinna suppose ye would tell me now would ye for a moment she was thoughtful and then she spoke when yer father found the king wi me he was shocked and very very hurt the king might have saved glenkirks pride but instead he cruelly praised my performance in his bed to your father he took him into my antechamber and there they spent the next few hours drinking glenkirk whisky and talking afterwards when they were both very drunk they entered my bedroom and she stopped for a minute her face white with the memory she resumed quietly yer father and the king spent the rest of the night taking turns raping me after several years i forgave yer father jemmie but that night killed my love for him i could understand and aye even sympathize wi him but for him to believe that i who was ever faithful to him had willingly betrayed him she stopped momentarily lost for words he was ever stubborn was patrick leslie i loved him once jemmie but i always questioned our marriage we were i suppose too alike i fled after that night to the only friend i had lord bothwell i only meant to gain time to have a little peace to think but francis and i fell in love the rest ye know as for james stewart i despise him he plays the good christian king the perfect husband the ideal father alas he is a hypocrite and the greatest lecher i hae ever known i thought he was nae interested in women but preferred men said jemmie naytis a ruse he uses to hide his real desires that father could treat ye sol he deserved to lose ye if i had known i would hae killed him myself jemmie jemmie yer poor father suffered terribly for that one extravagant cruelty he returned from glenkirk eager to see me and instead found his halfnaked wife being fondled by the king how would ye nae felt if it had been yer bella nay tis james who is to blame yer fathermay god assoil him is gone francis is in the kingdom of naples and though i dare not communicate wi him i will soon be going to him the old life is almost over and i will soon be on my way to bothwell for now however our thoughts must be on planning yer wedding to isabelle gordon and yer plans mother will be taken care of jemmietis best ye know nothing more lest ye innocently gie me away when i am gone and until i am out of disgrace wi the king ye can secretly get in touch wi me through the kiras she kissed him on the cheek despite my love for bothwell she said i would nae leave ye if i dinna think ye could handle yer title and the duties that go wi it learn a lesson from yer ancestors jemmie only the first earl of glenkirk lived to be a whitehaired old man most of the others involved themselves wi the stewarts and died young if i had not been so insistent about going to court perhaps none of this would hae happened yer father and in fairness to his memory jemmie i tell ye thisyer father warned me nae to get involved wi the stewarts i would nae listen but ye must let yer uncle adam guide ye in business and keep as much from court as ye possibly can but what happens mother when the old queen in the south dies what if our king goes to london he will jemmie he impatiently waits for the day he may leave scotland then yer uncle adam must go to london to represent our interests but ye and bella must remain here glenkirk must never be ruled by an absentee lord twould be its downfall teach yer sons a love of this land so it may never be wiout a leslie ye talk as if yell neer see glenkirk again mother i wont jemmie i dinna think james will ever forgie me the insult i will deliver him rest assured that should i ever set foot on english or scottish soil while our royal cousin rules i shall be quickly and quietly arrested imprisoned and aye even killed when i go i am gone i only pray that francis still wants me james leslie snorted he does of that i hae no doubt god how desperately he sought to keep ye if ye had both been less honorable people but then ye were not and ye sacrificed yerselves for us leslies no more mother though i will publicly condemn ye ye go wi my blessing and with my love the smile she gave him was radiant and he was slightly taken aback jesu mother if that is the way ye smile at all the men who please ye i am surprised ye hae not been ravished at least a hundred times she laughed happily a thousand my impudent young lord now be off wi ye jemmie i hae a wedding to plan he turned to go jemmie he looked and she held his eyes while she rose in a gesture of respect i am most grateful to ye my lord most grateful yell make a fine earl i am so verra sorry i canna be here to watch ye govern young james leslie bowed quickly to his mother and then was gone chapter james leslies fiancée isabelle gordon was a younger daughter of george and henriette gordon the earl and countess of huntley as huntley house had been burned to the ground two years before by a group of fanatic dissenters she was to be married at glenkirk some said the gordons had been singled out not because they were roman catholichalf of scotland still wasbut because they had openly sheltered the earl of bothwell several years ago now however the king had given his blessing to the marriage and was even coming to the wedding which would be celebrated on december the young couple would then keep the christmas through twelfth night holidays there before going to edinburgh for the winter season as soon as the wedding date was set young isabelle came to glenkirk cat insisted she must learn how to run this castle if she is to be its chatelaine but madame protested the future countess of glenkirk who was pretty and sweetnatured though inclined to be lazy surely ye will always be here to help me nay my dear belle i will nae be making glenkirk my home the king has suggested i return to court i will be making my home in my townhouse in edinburgh jemmies grandmother however will be in the dower house should ye need advice on running the household tis really she ye should go to anyhow meg knows glenkirk better than any of us george gordon looked across the cozy family hall at cat bella my dear he said smoothly will ye run to the nursery and see that old nanny has settled the littlest bairns for the night yes papa isabelle dutifully rose and did as she was bid yet she wondered what they wanted to talk about that she was not allowed to hear do ye need help cat asked huntley when his daughter had gone dinna tell me that jamie has dared to pursue ye again he has george i am allowed six months to mourn patrick and then i must present myself at court for the kings pleasure the bastard swore lord gordon dinna fret george i will follow my heart the earl of huntley looked at the widowed countess of glenkirk and a slow smile spread over his face jesu what a vixen ye are then more seriously hell nae take his vengeance on jemmie and belle will he nay george what reason could he offer in public for attacking two innocent and loyal young subjects they know nothing of the matter is this why ye asked to have the wedding date set now his majesty suggested it george he felt the glenkirk succession should be protected as soon as possible gordon chuckled more likely he felt ye should be in his bed as soon as possible cat laughed out loud poor jamie would be very upset to know how transparent his motives are why shouldnt they be to us cat hell the stewarts have fucked every noble family in scotland were all cousins henriette gordon leaned forward in her chair and asked softly what will ye do cat dinna ask me questions i canna answer riette but cat hush yer pretty mouth woman said her husband so while she openly went about the business of preparing a lavish wedding for her eldest son cat leslie secretly prepared for her escape to italy in this endeavor the kiras the leslies bankers and business associates for many years willingly helped over the next few months cats vast fortune would be transferred to the kiras rome bank by way of paris though the king of france might have to cooperate with scotland the pope in rome did not especially when the matter involved a noble catholic widow fighting to preserve her virtue against the chief protestant heretic in europe it was decided that cat would sail down the north sea into the english channel and across into france from there she would go overland to italy as the sea route was much too dangerous the mediterranean teemed with turkish pirates she would have her own coach driver footmen and outriders the only other person at glenkirk aware of cats plans was con all moreleslie glenkirks assistant captainatarms cat wanted only glenkirk people in her entourage and conall was the man to arrange it well he said dourly if it has to be marriage to lord bothwell or royal whoredom to jamie stewart bothwell is the lesser evil ill help ye mistress cat but gie me time to choose my men carefully catholics only the protestants would be too uncomfortable in italy single uninvolved men wi no one to come home to so theyll stay wi us no youngsterstoo hotheaded but able men in their twenties or thirties and ill nae talk to any till just before we go less chance of the word getting to one of jamies spies who will ye take to serve ye susan mayhap one other he nodded not surprised that she already had it all worked out she was like her greatgrandmother janet leslie and never did anything without carefully thinking it out too many people had underestimated her intelligence and resourcefulness he chuckled and she asked why do ye laugh blue eyes crinkling with mirth contrasted with his weathered face he replied because i would gie a years pay to see the look on jamie stewarts face when he finds out yeve escaped him again oh conall she admonished him her own laughter bubbling up hae ye no respect for the crown the crown aye but cousin jamie tis either a foolish man or an overly stubborn one who pursues a woman who so obviously doesna want him are these qualities that make a good king i dinna think so but in his kingly duties he is a good king conall tis in his personal life he falters he has never really been comfortable wi his fellow man though he would desperately like to be she turned to the windows facing out across the hills ah conall all i ever wanted to do was live my life quietly at glenkirk pah snapped the older man dinna delude yerself yeve always been too restless twas nae lord patrick who yearned for court her stricken look stopped him ah lassie dinna fret over it now im a leslie myselfalbeit from the wrong side of the blanketand i know tis the women in this family who hae always been the wild ones as the autumn deepened she took every opportunity to ride the leslie lands leaving the wedding plans in megs competent hands but meg had always understood cat far better than anyone else and one day the older dowager accompanied cat on her ride tis much too lovely a day to be indoors meg announced loudly for the benefit of the stableboys if i look out my window at those fields of michaelmas daisies once more i shall go mad she pulled herself into the saddle and chuckled lord it must be two years since i last rode come along cat and she gently kicked the fat sides of her old brown mare cat followed wondering what had possessed meg to come riding with her they rode in silence for at least fifteen minutes then meg slowed her horse to a walk and moved up next to her companion cat turned to face her well meg what gets ye onto old brownie and dinna rhapsodize to me over michaelmas daisies meg leslie laughed i thought that was a rather nice touch my dear but ye are right of course michaelmas daisies dinna interest me now tell me cat when do ye leave us cat was not startled and answered quietly after bess and henrys wedding ye go to francis aye is it safe for the family i believe so with all my heart meg since the king doesna know that jemmie knows the situation between us i dinna believe he will hold our young earl responsible for my defection he will be angry but jemmie will be angrier and will vehemently castigate me for the wretched manner in which i refused the wonderful honor offered me meg laughed again then jemmie knows yer going knows why bless me meg he arranged it i was all ready to gie up and yield myself to james but jemmie feels his very innocence in the matter will save us he feels that this is the only chance i will have to escape and he is right what reason could james possibly give for an undue display of vengeance on our family now we are at peace and the leslies of glenkirk hae always been loyal to the crown this is the one time i may flee wiout endangering our clan and if francis has found a new love my dear he was always a man for the lasses and never particularly constant he was to me meg replied cat quietly aye said the older woman he was but he is gone from ye almost three years cat he loves me yet meg as i love him i feel it but persisted meg if he doesna will ye return home not as long as james pursues me meg i simply cannot be the royal whore i will settle in france if bothwell doesna want me he will cat said meg gently i simply wanted to be sure ye knew what ye were doing there are many women in yer position who could be happy enough being the kings mistress if i loved jamie said cat i would be content but i hae never been a woman who could lie wi a man she disliked and i dinna care for the king i will nae forgie him for what he did to poor patrick it was the act of a cruel man and i detest deliberate cruelty then meg said something that brought tears to cats lovely eyes ye go wi my blessing my dear strange as it may seem i know that patrick would approve yer course he never forgave himself ye know but i forgave him meg i could no longer love him as i once did but i did forgie him she smiled jemmie knows nothing more than that i go before springtis better that way conall is coming wi me susan also though ive said nought to her yet what provision hae ye made for the children cat colin and robbie will remain wi the earl of rothes household until they are each fourteen then they are to go to the university in aberdeen as jemmie did afterwards their european tour and then marriage jemmie and i hae just finished negotiating a marriage agreement wi my brother wi his only son dead he is without an heir and has four daughters to marry off colin will wed the eldest when he is twenty as my brothers heir he will be the next master of greyhaven robbie will wed wi the next daughter in the following year i hae settled a good sum on robbie and bought him a fine house wi good lands near greyhaven so he may always be quite independent of his older brother amanda i hae betrothed to charles heir my daughter will be the next countess of sithean meg raised her eyebrows i thought my daughter janet aimed higher for her son cat laughed janet is not simply wed to a leslie she was born one her son may hae a title but my daughter has an enormous dowry and by strange coincidence amanda is in possession of several hundred acres of pastureland needed by sithean for their sheep little morag will become malcolm gordons wife shes to hae a very large dowry and a manor house of her own even younger gordon sons come high megs eyes sparkled dear lord she said breathlessly ye grow more like mam as ye get older then she became serious again the bairns what of them ye canna leave yer little ones jemmie will send them to me when i am settled meg twould be dangerous for them to travel wi me and they would slow me down if the king sends his people after me the bairns will make me vulnerable twill be only for a few months meg nodded i suppose tis best they rode in silence for a while longer then meg spoke again cat i know i hae no right to ask but ian and jane are bothwells also aye meg even he did not know until just before he went into exile when we first parted i thought i should never see him again and i wanted his child patrick however no sooner had me back then he was bedding me and he kept on bedding me until twas quite obvious i was wi child he assumed the twins were his and for all our sakes i said nought ye were right my dear but poor francis having to leave scotland knowing that he was leaving not only ye but his bairns also ah my cat ye both deserve yer happiness thank ye meg ye hae always been a good friend to me the older woman leaned from her saddle and reaching out gripped cats hand yer more daughter to me than my own two be happy cat please be happy chapter james stewart smiled sweetly at his wife no no annie tis unthinkable ye canna possibly go to glenkirk for young james leslies wedding he patted her distended belly fondly nay we must nae endanger the bairn but it is so close to christmas wailed the queen i do not want to be without ye then i will be back to spend christmas wi ye annie ye cannot unless ye leave immediately after the wedding and that would be most rude then i will nae be back said the king irritably what difference does it make i will be here for new years and twelfth night but in denmark we always celebrate christmas en famille james was becoming annoyed ye are nae in denmark annie yer queen of scotland he roared and the queen began to cry dear heaven thought the king i canna hae her guessing why i dinna want her wi me there there mdear he said convincingly i canna offend the leslies of glenkirk i must go to the young earls wedding especially since tis my cousin of huntleys wench he weds the gordons gie me trouble enough and i will nae gie them an excuse to start more trouble by not going to their daughters wedding tis winter and the roads are bad be reasonable sweetheart ye canna go junketing all over scotland in yer present condition the child sniffed the queen thats all the good i am to ye jamie a royal brood mare we can hae many bairns annie said james but where would i get another like ye the queens lovely sky blue eyes filled to overflowing oh jamie she said in a choked little voice the king put an arm about his wife now let us hear no more of this foolishness yes jamie said the queen sighing happily but he barely heard her so intent was he on thoughts of the lovely cat leslie who would soon be his it was over four years since he had seen cat and their last meeting had not been everything a man hopes for from the woman he desires but now alone and unprotected the widowed countess of glenkirk should prove more obedient to her royal masters wishes awaiting his arrival cat knew what she might expect she realized that she could not escape james attentions even in her own house and she steeled herself to be sweetly complacent so he might not suspect that she intended fleeing she must not even speak openly with jemmie with her sons marriage impending cat had removed her things from the apartments of the earl and countess of glenkirk it had not been easy leaving the rooms that had been hers all these years but in a few weeks they would rightfully belong to young belle to camouflage her plans for escape she went to the expense of redoing an entire suite of rooms for herself in the westtower apartment which had once belonged to her greatgrandmother janet before that lady built her own castle at sithean the tower had not been used since and cat fancied she could feel the other womans presence well mam she sighed aloud i am in another coil ye always warned us to stay clear of the stewarts my willfulness has cost us all and now i must flee my home or submit to the kings lust i wonder what ye would think of me if ye were here today she walked to the bedroom windows and gazed out across the glenkirk hills to sitheans loch and to greyhaven her childhood home here she imagined her greatgrandmother waiting for her lover colin hay the master of greyhaven well if mam could defy convention to be with her lover thought cat then so can i she sighed ah bothwell tis almost three years since the terrible day i stood on rattray head and watched that damned ship take ye from me and in all that time we hae nae dared to even correspond i dinna doubt that there hae been many women in yer bed but is there one whos love has made ye forget me dear god please no and as she closed her eyes in an agony of doubt his face swam before her darkened eyelids that dearly beloved rugged face the deep sapphire eyes the sensuous mouth the marvelous auburn hair and elegant short tailored beard he always had as she leaned against the cold stone she imagined the velvet firmness of his broad shoulder and his big hand gently stroking her long hair suddenly for the first time in all these long months cat wept she wept in great gulping sobs she wept for patrick leslie and the happy years they had had before james ruined their lives she wept for their loss of innocenceboth hers and patricks but most of all she wept for the earl of bothwell the man she loved cruelly exiled and impoverished because of his cousins jealousy francis who so loved his castle hermitage and his beloved bordersforced to wander europe alone and friendless but soon she vowed soon she would seek him out across europe and when she found him she stopped what if he had remarried after all even francis might have to compromise his honor in order to live no he had not remarried but they would marry when she found him and then jemmie would send their bairns to them and they would live to a peaceful old age far from the intrigues of the court but first she must contend with cousin jamie he would come crawling into her bed when he arrived for the wedding well and she laughed through her tears he would find her eager she who was so used to regular lovemaking had not had a man since her husband went off those long months ago she despised james but her body craved a mans touch for once it would be she who used him seeking out her eldest son she warned him ye must nae let the king know that yer aware of his nocturnal visits to me while hes here the young earl was shocked jesu mother would he dare under our very roof she laughed at his outrage dare he is the king lord jemmie james would dare almost anything with regard to his personal desires if ye understand this ye will understand dinna be fooled by his show of piety and learning he is outwardly pious because it keeps his protestant kirk contented and out of his private affairs he is learned yea but he is also superstitious cruel and willful never trust him no matter how fair he speaks to ye learn from my mistakes jemmie dinna involved yerself wi the king or the court but what should be our attitude towards the stewarts mother loyalty in times of danger to the crown or to the country at all other times maintain yer distance when forced to be wi the king show admiration and affection be agreeable wiout being a toady jamie can be most charming and his humor is quite droll he doesna mean to play the villain ye simply must nae get too involved jemmie nodded but his brow was furrowed i wish he were nae coming to the wedding do ye think the queen will be wi him at least her presence may help to keep his lust in check she will nae come jemmie i hear she is breeding again and the king will use it as an excuse to keep her in edinburgh dinna fret my son if i am to escape royal james he must believe that i am ready to accept his will his visit here will reassure him completely the widow of glenkirk will receive him hesitantly but sweetly i shall worry about my position and he will offer comfort and encourage me to trust him completely and once he has assuaged my fears he will leave feeling very selfsatisfied and manly jemmie leslie looked at his mother in frank amazement yer the most devious woman ive ever known he chuckled i would nae like to hae ye for an enemy madame cat laughed aloud tis strange she said but yer father once said that same thing to me five days before the wedding was to be celebrated james stewart arrived at glenkirk he was greeted by his distant cousins the leslies and his closer cousins the gordons his amber eyes lingered a moment on the blackgarbed countess of glenkirk and cat flushed uncomfortably under his gaze it was her duty and megs to escort the king to the suite of rooms set aside for the occasional royal visitor james glance swept the large rooms each warm with its own blazing fire most attractive dear cousin margaret ye leslies hae the knack of making a man feel welcome i hope all yer rooms are as pleasant oh yes james replied meg i may call ye james maynt i after all i could be yer mother giving his arm a little squeeze she smiled up into his face her eyes twinkling in a kindly fashion and cat wondered if she were going mad what on earth possessed meg to simper so i am continued the elder dowager supposed to make my home in the dower house but i am here in the castle more often than not i live in the south wing where the sun can warm my old bones the earls suite is in the east wing so that the morning sunaccording to traditionmay wake him early and send him about his duties christ in his heaven thought cat where is she getting such nonsense the royal suite has always been here in the west wing so royal visitors will nae be wakened early but find their rooms filled with warm afternoon sunlight after a mornings hunt finished meg triumphantly what a charming and thoughtful custom said the king he turned to cat who had maintained her silence all this time ye no longer reside in the earls suite no sire cat kept her eyes modestly lowered meg chattered on oh no james we hae redone those rooms for little belle cats apartments are right here in the west wingin the tower she was her greatgrandmothers favorite girlchild and dearest mam lived in the west tower so when cat had to pick other rooms she chose mams why there is even a secret entrance from here to those rooms megtis a family secret chided cat softly ahhhh breathed the king but i am family sweet cat tell me aunt meg what of this secret entrance meg giggled i am nae sure she said but cat would know come dear one i always remember mam chuckling about that secret entrance where she used to let colin hay in when he came calling i know ye know where it is and it does have an exit into this very apartment doesnt it cat hesitated then spoke low aye it does the king tried to keep the impatience from his voice it was obvious that the old woman liked him and was slyly attempting to further his cause come cat dinna be coy wi me what of this secret entrance is there one here she walked across the bedchamber to the fireplace and pressed a rose carving on the left side of the mantel a small door swung open taking a lighted candle from a wall sconce cat beckoned them to follow her the flickering light wound up the cool winding passage for two and a half flights then cat stopped reaching up she touched the molding around a door the door sprang open walking through they found themselves in what was obviously a womans bedchamber gracious gasped meg the king simply smiled if ye followed the passage down said cat ye would exit at the bottom of the tower into a little courtyard fascinating said james and now he took the candle from cat i shall see if i can find my way back alone we will leave our door open james until yer safely back said meg call out my dear the king slipped through the door and began his descent the flickering candle disappeared from view at last they heard him call i am safe aunt meg and a door clicked closed cat then closed up her end of the passage and turning to her motherinlaw exclaimed jesu madame ye surely missed yer calling ye should be selling maidenheads in the highgate meg laughed ye dinna think he suspects nay the only thing he suspects is that yer on his side bless ye meg now our jemmie will surely be safe after i go james will think all leslies adore him and ye must indeed go my dear the way the king looks at ye cat dear heaven it turns my blood cold he would devour ye will ye be safe wi him here aye meg i am well used to handling jamie this time however i must play the shyly reluctant and very repentant mistress twill nae be easy but the king must never guess that i merely bide my time she went to the garderobe and drew out a deepviolet velvet gown i dinna think patrick would mind if i came out of mourning for jemmies wedding she turned damn me meg where is he i canna believe he is dead and yet if his ship did not reach the new world where is he am i a fool is it only that i feel guilty over his going meg nodded i hae had the same feeling surely i should feel something if my eldest child were dead he is gone and yet he is not still ye go cat do ye feel he will ever return not to me meg i feel that patrick has somehow passed from my life if i did not feel that i could nae go even wi the threat of the king hanging over me get some rest my dear said meg kindly twill be a long evening i fear and she hugged cat before she left cat did not even bother to call her tiring woman instead she removed her dark gown lay down upon her bed and slept fitfully when she awoke susan was busily filling the new porcelain hip bath which scent madame lilac said cat stretching lazily i am wearing the violet velvet gown susan when yeve finished there bring me my jewel case a few minutes later she sat sifting through her many necklaces deciding what she would wear a chain of gold filigree worked with chunky baroque pearls and large amethysts caught her eye she held it against the violet of the dress and smiled an hour later she was ready bathed in lilacscented water gowned in the lownecked violet velvet her generous breasts swelling provocatively above a single ruffle of creamy lace her honeycolored hair was parted in the center drawn back over her ears and twisted into a knot of curls at the back of her head from the front it looked very severe from the rear the tawny curls caught with mauve and white silk flowers were bewitchingly feminine in the great hall of glenkirk that night there were over two hundred diners including the leslies of glenkirk headed by young james the leslies of sithean with their earl who was cats first cousin charles and the hays with cats father as their chief the immediate family totaled some ninetyfive persons not counting the moreleslies who were the familys bastard line there were numerous gordons as george gordon earl of huntley was the chief of his clan and there were the king and his many retainers in her entire life cat had never seen the castle so full at the high table the king found himself between the bridetobe and her mother to his chagrin cat was seated on the other side of her son the beautiful widow of glenkirk did not lack for admirers when at last the long meal ended the dancing began but cat refused the eager gallants pleading that she would dance at her sons wedding but not before she was she gently reminded them still in mourning she remained demurely seated on the dais watching while the king danced first with bella then with meg and finally with henriette his duty done james stewart returned to the dais and sat next to cat a page put a goblet of chilled wine in his hand and he sipped appreciatively finally he spoke how is it possible madame that yer more beautiful now than ye were four years ago i am mad for ye cat i long to be alone wi ye yer majesty is most kind he made an impatient noise why are ye so formal wi me love ye hae nae said a warm word to me since i arrived yer majesty has me at a disadvantage she said in a low voice we did nae part on the best of terms he laughed softly triumphant we will resolve all that later my love now gie me a little smile and reaching over he tipped her face up to his she raised her leafgreen eyes to his amber ones and smiled shyly at him the king could feel desire sweeping him he wanted her as he had always wanted her but this time he intended gaining the upper hand immediately she was a passionate little vixen but once she accepted him as her master he believed that she would be loyal towards midnight cat laughingly announced to their guests that those who wished to retire might and those who did not might dance drink and play until dawn predictably the older members of the gathering departed the king however remained behind it took time for cat to bid her guests good night but she was finally free to retire she allowed susan to remove her gown shoes and jewelry and put them away thoughtfully she removed her silk underblouse and handed it to her tiring woman who already had an armful of ruffled petticoats standing naked in her stockings and garters she said go to bed susan tis late and i can finish myself i will sleep late so dinna disturb me till midmorning susan curtsied and left the room cat sat down on the bed removing her laceedged garters she rolled her stockings off brushing her thick hair she recalled her last scene with james after a time exhausted by all the wedding preparations and by memories she fell asleep she awoke at the touch of a warm mouth against the nipple of her left breast startled her eyes flew open and looked into a pair of very amused amber ones then suddenly the kings eyes grew serious and he said get up cat we hae things to settle between us first puzzled she threw back the covers and stepped naked from the bed his eyes grew warm at the sight of her but he spoke coldly i am willing to forgie ye yer past misbehavior madame in the spring ye will return to court and live openly wi me as my mistress ye will obey my slightest whim i will brook no disobedience cat ye belong to me do ye understand aye she whispered she was stunned by his new forcefulness then prostrate yerself as a slave would and beg my pardon a wave of nausea shook her jamie please must ye shame me so i know i must obey ye but dinna make me do this cat yer a proud woman i cannot believe that ye truly mean to obey me unless ye will do what i hae commanded ye no matter how distasteful to ye if ye mean to be obedient then ye must begin wi this though her appearance remained meek inwardly she burned with rage if she refused him he would be distrustful of her she knew she must yield to his demand in order to allay his fears swallowing hard she knelt leaning over until her head touched his slippered foot forgie me my lord king she said softly for a terrifying moment he rested his foot on her slim neck the merest pressure on his part would have broken it cat bit her lip until it bled in an effort to prevent an outward show of fear or anger yell pay for this james stewart she thought dear god how i hope ye hurt when i leave ye may it rankle and eat at ye the rest of yer life and may ye neer find another woman wholl please ye as i do then suddenly his foot was gone and he was raising her up the smile he gave her was sweet forgie me my love but i had to be sure ye would yield to me this time wiout a fight there is no other woman in this world i would trouble so much for but ye are worth it cat christ ye excite me he drew her into his arms and kissed her quickly forcing her lips apart so his tongue could roam it took all of her selfcontrol not to push him away instead she took refuge in tears of relief lowering her head and sobbing into his shoulder pleased convinced that he had mastered her for good now james became generous he lowered her onto the bed took her face between his hands and kissed her again his fingers moved to the slender column of her throat and then to her full breast crushing the softness of her in his hands he bent and let his hps wander it was with an awful stunning clarity that cat realized she felt nothing her body which had always succumbed to the delicious intensity of lovemaking was not responding frightened she struggled weakly beneath him james mistaking the movement for passion forced his knee between her thighs and thrust into her so wrapped up in his own desire was he that he did not realize she was feeling nothing sick with fear that he might comprehend her thoughts cat thrust her hips up to meet him murmuring endearments into his ear apparently he noticed nothing and when his passion broke in a wild storm about her she held him in her arms and closing her eyes made soft crooning noises sated he lay atop her breathing hard christ he swore i hae never known a wench like ye cat no woman has ever satisfied me as ye do he rolled off her propped himself up on an elbow and gazed down at her was it good for ye too love tis been many months i know since yeve had a man playfully he nibbled at her breast do i please ye cat she turned away from him unable to speak for a moment now she knew how the whores of the world probably felt silent tears rolled down her face he turned her onto her back and gently brushed the tears from her cheeks they call me a wise king he said but wi the lasses i am a fool twas patrick who last held ye in his arms and loved ye i can see ye have nae accepted that he is dead he gathered her into his arms i love ye my lady of glenkirk i hae missed ye so very much cat i was overeager to possess ye dinna weep sweetheart patrick would be happy to know yer safe wi me she made a strangled sound that he interpreted as further sorrow and he held her closer he gave her a little squeeze and releasing her rose from the bed and crossed the room i will leave ye now sweetheart for this day has exhausted ye i can see that opening the secret passage he stepped through saying sleep well my beautiful love the door closed behind him for once in his life thought cat james has left at just the right moment she lay flat on her back hands beneath her head staring at the velvet canopy over her bed what was the matter with her she had always considered her sensuality a curse of sorts but now she wanted it back only once before had her body refused to respond and that had been after the terrible time when patrick and the king spent a night raping and sodomizing her she had finally gotten over that what was wrong now was it james or was it her the king would be here at least another five nights and she had to do something what could she do she was going to have to feign passion and hope to god she could fool him cat needed to talk with someone who would understand the problem and there was only one person who might help her though adam leslie rose early his wife fiona had to be wakened by her tiring woman susan says mistress cat would speak wi ye here get up mistress fiona ive got yer robe for ye hurry called flora pushed and pulled into her gown fiona found herself led through a littleused back passage of the castle to cats apartments in the west tower she found her beautiful cousin awaiting her impatiently leave us susan ill call when we need ye li anyone asks say i am still asleep as the girl closed the door behind her fiona helped herself to a goblet of watered wine and said ye dinna look as if ye got any sleep at all i didnt fiona sprawled on the bed let me guess she said tis the king again he still harbors a passion for ye i know in the great hall last night he could scarce take his eyes from ye yell nae escape him this time cat tis plain to see he means to hae ye he already has fiona said cat dryly and he went away happy there is only one problem i felt nothing he is as good a lover as ever and god knows i needed it and yet i could raise no passion last night he was so hot to possess me that he did nae notice but what of tonight my god cousin what am i to do fiona forgie me but before ye wed wi adam ye had many lovers did ye feel passion wi all of them or did ye pretend wi some i dinna know how to pretend nonsense laughed fiona ye simply jog yer hips and roll yer head a bit then ye moan and breathe heavily most men are so intent on their own lust that they rarely notice whether a woman is really enjoying herself look cat tis only a few nights he will be gone after the wedding hold him tight and tell him how marvelous he is and that ye love what he does to ye ye know how cousin i think so fiona but tis nae for a few nights he has ordered me to court come spring hell cat why tell me that ye dinna intend

between yer legs now theres a man cat laughed delighted im glad we are friends fiona yer so deliriously sensible jesu though coz i was so frightened last night jamie was randier than an old billy goat and i felt nothing fionas mouth twitched with amusement what did ye do i cried and jamie thought my tears were for patrick he soothed me by saying that patrick would be relieved to know i was safe wi him can ye believe the man fiona choked on her wine tis a wonder glenkirks ghost didnt rise up and kick the kings royal ass then she said well twas a good start if jamie detects any reluctance on yer part now he will believe it stems from yer inability to accept patricks death cat looked worried is it jamie fiona or is something the matter wi me tis jamie fiona said without hesitation yeve neer been a cold piece leslie women never are oh ye and i may be the most obvious in our sensuality but dinna think that because they look so prim and proper those milksop cousins of ours are cool my poor brother charles is exhausted from all the demands of dear janet and i understand yer own brother has been known to flee his eager mary on occasion why i have it on the best authority that our brotherinlaw james must service ailis daily else she flirts wi the stableboys cat collapsed on the bed helpless with laughter oh fiona she gasped how will i ever look janet mary and ailis in the eye again wiout laughing what a wonderful bitch ye are coz and just how do ye know all of this fiona raised an elegantly plucked eyebrow ihae never been unfaithful to adam if thats what yer thinking she said and then her cheeks reddened with a memory she shared with cat well only once she amended softly i am simply the kind of woman men talk to cat for a moment the two women were silent and then cat spoke again can i do it fiona if anyone can fiona replied ye can cousin jamie in taking one kind of happiness from ye has unwittingly given ye another go after it cat leslie dinna let anyone stop ye this time chapter glenkirk castle filled to the bursting point as the wedding day drew near the earl of huntley was a power to be reckoned with in scotland and the presence of the king put a special seal on the whole affair the guests overflowed into the dower house into the very eaves of the castle cat had even been forced to allow some ladies and their tiring women to sleep in her antechamber her body servants were doubling up in susans room in order to free two small rooms servants who had accompanied guests were sleeping in every available nook and cranny fortunately the december weather was good and the guests were able to spend their days out of doors hunting with the king who had a passion for it cat did not enjoy hunting and used the excuse of wedding preparations to avoid it but meg and the gordons along with the younger family members rode daily with james the king was delighted with the elder dowager of glenkirk whom he now addressed publicly as aunt meg she rode knee to knee with him each day rarely leaving his side young jemmie also showed an admiration for james which pleased the king greatly he enjoyed this healthy normal family once cats position in his life became public he intended including them in his own growing family to cats immense relief the king was too busy during the next two evenings to visit her what she was not aware of was that her son jemmie had slipped a sleeping herb into the kings wine james stewart was scarcely into his night shirt before he fell asleep on december however the king insisted that cat ride with him as she detested the long riding skirts that fashion decreed she wore what she always wore when ridingmens green trunk hose high leather boots a leather jerkin white silk shirt wide belt and a wide heavy leslie plaid to wrap about her in case of very cold weather tucked into her belt was a jeweled dagger and she wore soft leather gloves the men of the party were of one mind catriona leslie looked marvelous not only had she handsome breasts that jutted out as impudently as a young girls but she had a damned fine wellturned leg the younger women admired her daring among the older ones there were those who thought her costume shocking and those who were amused by the countess apparent eccentricity though cat detested the sport she rode like a young diana at the kill it was cat who leaped from her horse and drove the dogs back with a small but fierce rawhide whip what no one knew was that she had learned to handle the dogs in order to avoid seeing some beautiful wild creatures throat cut the dogs took all her concentration they had killed but two does and a stag when the king ordered an end to the hunt his amber eyes burned with desire as he looked upon the countess of glenkirk the huntress had roused the kings passion and to cats embarrassment he did nothing to hide it the men now eyed her boldly and she knew they wondered if the king would bed her the women looked at her with something akin to envy for james stewart had never publicly sought any woman but his pretty young queen to be a kings mistress was considered an honor cat was distressed she wanted no public acknowledgment of the kings feelings towards her to break the tension she swung back into the saddle and looking boldly about declared in a loud voice ten gold pieces theres nae a man here who can beat my lolair back to the castle and pulling her horse about sharply she kicked him into a gallop a dozen menthe king includedgalloped after her adam leslie turned to his wife who was biting her lip with laughter she thinks to cool his ardor said fiona in a low voice to her husband but she only inflames him all the more cat bent low over iolaires neck the big goldenbay gelding moved with smooth strides easily outdistancing his pursuers go my great gold love she crooned at him none can beat ye suddenly she saw a dark wickedlooking beast drawing up alongside her it was the kings midnightblack stallion james was a magnificent horseman and he was determined to win but cat was not the type of woman to give him victory he would have to take it if he could a dozen horses thundered down out of the forested hills onto a flat stretch of road that led to the castle wild highland yells rent the air and it seemed that sparks flew from the flying hooves as they struck the frozen ground on the castle battlements glenkirks menatarms cheered their lady as the bay led and roared disapproval as the black gained the men shouted as the bay pulled ahead again and galloped across the lowered drawbridge into glenkirks courtyard followed just a second later by the king on his black and a minute later by the rest of the party cat leaped lightly from her saddle tossing the reins to a stableboy she rubbed the bays muzzle and whispered something in its ear running up the steps she turned ill be collecting the gold ye all owe me this evening gentlemen and she laughed at their expressions ah sandy she teased lord home ye know iolaires speed of all people why did ye take my wager that damn new gray of mine was supposed to be so fast cat muttered lord home irritably laughter greeted his remark and cat called again theres meat and wine in the great hall gentlemen eat hearty and she disappeared into the castle laughing and talking the noblemen dismounted and trouped up the steps into the great hall it wasnt until they had poured themselves great goblets of sweet golden wine and were tearing off chunks of meat and bread that they noticed the king was not among them looking about him one man observed looks like jamies not through riding for the day aye murmured another softly but distinctly but id surely rather mount and ride that honeyhaired mare than that wild black brute of his there was laughter and then someone observed i wager the mare is wilder than the stallion but sweeter shot back another man laughter rang as each of the noblemen tried to mask his thoughts about the beautiful countess of glenkirk james stewart mounted the stairs to cats apartments two at a time and strode angrily into her bedroom naked but for her silk shirt she showed no surprise as did the frightened face of her maid go along susan dear ill call ye when i need ye the girl fled the room well jamie her glance was haughty and only the jumping pulse in her throat revealed her nervousness vixen he snarled his face dark with anger you wanton vixen ye had the whole pack of them after ye like dogs after a bitch ye belong to me cat ill hae no other man imagining what twould be like to be between yer legs he was in a high rage lunging he ripped away her silk shirt and shoved her back onto her bed he was on her instantly his knee forcing her thighs apart astounded and equally angry cat fought back she tried to claw him with her nails but he caught her wrists with one hand and held them fast above her head she twisted furiously beneath him but james thrust his hardness into her unwilling and unready body she cried out with pain and renewed her struggle he lowered his head and cruelly bit her nipples cat screamed and struggled harder but her resistance seemed to inflame him he was gaining great pleasure from hurting her frightened by the fury in his face she changed her tactics her struggles ceased and her hips began the sweet rhythm that maddened him so very much his grip lessened freed she caught his head in her hands and raised it to her lips nay hinny she whispered huskily arching to press her soft breasts against his damp chest dinna hurt me jamie luv love me my lord love me now and her ripe mouth found his pressing demandingly against his lips until they opened and allowed her little tongue to dart like a flame in his mouth his cruelty turned to yearning and he hungrily sought to satisfy them both witch he murmured against the silken tangle of her golden hair i always said ye were a little witch ahhhhhh my sweet love and then he lay quietly against her pounding heart cat lay weak with relief her lack of ardor had once again escaped james notice instead he praised her sexual performance christ love ye leave me drained he placed a burning kiss on her breast where his teeth had marked her slightly i am sorry cat i dinna mean to hurt ye but ye made me so jealous love i couldna bear for them to look at ye so yer a mistress to be proud of cat ye drive men mad wi just looking at ye come back to court wi me after the wedding i canna wait any longer for ye sweetheart cat caught her breath here it was the thing she had feared all along reaching up she gently touched his face nay jamie hinnytis but a bit over three months since ye declared patrick dead if ye do not care for my reputation i do after jemmies wedding there is bess to attend to and then twill be but a little while till springtis not so long my lord will it nae be sweeter for the waiting jamie do not let the gossips say ye hold me in so little regard that ye will nae gie me time to mourn my lawful husband come spring no one can say i dishonored glenkirk in my rush to gain yer favor and yer protection always prudent always careful his voice purred approval what a perfect mistress yell be cat by this time next year ill hae ye full to bursting wi my son and what a son hell be our bairn ill wait sweetheart ill wait she smiled sweetly at him thinking id rot in hell before id bear yer bastard james stewart but she was truly safe now when he left glenkirk this time she would never see him again cat could feel almost kindly towards him now again that night she escaped his attentions and she managed to forestall him the following night as well by pleading the wedding on the following day for which she must be rested james leslies wedding to isabelle gordon was a triumph of good planning good food and good weather the bride was radiantly lovely the groom elegantly handsome the wedding feast lasted a long time with many courses and entertainments at last cat bess and henriette took isabelle from her new husband and pursued by a group of rowdy young bucks gained the safety of the earls suite the lovely wedding gown was removed and taken away by belles maid quickly she was dressed in a pale shellpink nightgown her face hands and neck were bathed in warm perfumed water and her mother brushed her long dark hair remember what i have told ye said henriette gordon in a low voice her daughter nodded what did ye tell her asked cat amused that she must defer to jemmie in all things replied henriette simply nothing else cat was incredulous riette how could ye the little countess of huntley was close to tears cat i tried only yesterday she was my babe and now suddenly she is fifteen and grown i tried to tell her of what happens between a man and his wife in the marriage bed but she looked so damned superior it embarrassed me get the countess of huntley some wine cat commanded a servant girl bess watch the door she turned to isabelle well my girl do ye know of that which occurs between a man and a woman nay bellemère whispered the girl her eyes lowered christs bones swore cat but before she could say another word the door gave way and a group of men burst into the room pushing jemmie ahead of them while the caudle cup was passed about cat managed to get next to her son smelling of much wine he bent to give her a kiss jemmie she whispered urgently belle is completely innocent that ninny henriette was too shy to talk wi her own daughter be extragentle wi the lass tonight what happens the first time will color her whole attitude towards lovemaking he nodded quietly his eyes becoming serious i understand mother i promise to be kind the toast drunk the jests and good wishes shouted the bridal chamber was emptied of all but the inhabitants for whom it was intended in the crush of exiting the king found his way to cats side i must leave in the morning if i am to be home for christmas i shall be in yer bedchamber in an hour one last time she thought after this night i shall be forever free of ye james stewart but what was she to do tonight fionas voice came back to her love him cat ye know how returning to the great hall she stayed long enough to drink another toast to the new earl and countess of glenkirk and then bidding the guests enjoy themselves she departed alone for she had given susan the night off she filled a basin with water warmed in the fireplace kettle adding scented oil to it she stripped her clothes off and cleansed her skin taking up a small bristle brush she dipped it into a tiny crystal vial of salt and scrubbed her teeth lastly she anointed her body with rare musk touching the stopper between her breasts at the base of her throat and on the soft insides of her thighs she was careful in her selection of a gown for she wanted james to remember every detail of this night for the rest of his life she hoped it would be a long long life her choice was an exquisite gossamer silk fashioned à la grecque it was springgreen to match her eyes and fastened only on the left shoulder from which it fell straight to the floor in a rippling line of pleats it shimmered as she walked and her body gleamed temptingly through the thin silk the garment was similar to one she had worn for the king several years ago she was sure he would remember brushing her hair vigorously with a brush dipped in musk she secured it atop her head with several tortoiseshell pins and brushed the loose ends about her finger into damp curls the king always enjoyed loosening her hair and tonight she must capture his attention in every way so that when he finally left her he would believe he had spent the most ecstatic night of his life ready now cat rang for a maidservant to come lay the peat fire then dismissed her for the night alone she made herself as comfortable as possible on the oak settle by the fire and waited her thoughts flew back to just a few short years before when she had been a cherished wife everything had been so simple the creak of the fireplace door alerted her and she sprang up forcing a smile of welcome the king stepped into the room and blowing out his candle placed it on the mantel his amber eyes swept her slim body in its translucent gown resting for a moment on the fullness of her breasts silently he crossed the room and without a word undid cats shoulder fastening the gown slid to the floor with a hiss of silk drawing the tortoiseshell pins from her hair one by one he dropped them on the thickly carpeted floor stand before the pier glass he commanded her she obeyed him wordlessly and was not surprised when he joined her a moment later he had removed his creamy silk nightshirt and was as naked as she she couldnt help thinking that he was a handsome man with a firm wellmuscled body and extremely large genitals all the damned stewarts were overendowed and oversexed she thought sourly putting a surprisingly hard arm about her he drew her against him and his head bent to place a burning kiss on her shoulder then he reached up and crushed her breasts passionately eyes closed she shivered her revulsion and prayed he thought it was desire she felt one hand caressing her belly the long fingers moving lower to explore the warm wetness of her squirming from his grasp she caught his hand and led him to the bed her mouth curved in what she hoped was a seductive smile and she spoke huskily let me love ye jamie hinny and pushing him back onto the bed she knelt over him her magnificent breasts hanging above him the amber eyes were bright with lust halfsitting james closed his mouth over the rosy nipple of one breast but she laughingly pulled away from him stopping his protest with a kiss her lips covered his face with little kisses that were more like delicious little nibbles as they moved lower her soft kisses scorched his chest moving down to his flat belly and lower until her mouth found his manhood taking it in her warm mouth she nursed on it as a babe would its mothers breast the king groaned and shivered christ christ ahhhhh you witch and he moaned his pleasure over and over as his body arched to meet her mouth when he was hard and ready for her she released his organ and mounted him his halfclosed eyes were glazed with passion as he reached up to fondle her breasts and cat rode him smoothly until he poured his foaming seed into her body his arms tightened about her and he rolled her over onto her back and looked down at her once he said thickly i told ye i would nae be ridden like a maid but oh cat i dinna know my love i dinna know when ye come to me in the springtime ye will do again what ye have done tonight yea my huntress yell fuck me sweetly wont ye she said nothing but instead she stroked his long back cupping his round buttocks in her warm hands and gently kneading them he quickly grew hot for her again and with an almost pained sob of pleasure thrust deep into her finally exhausted the king fell into a deep relaxed sleep he lay on his stomach his face turned away from her one arm thrown carelessly across her for a long time she lay quietly on her back then convinced of the depth of his slumber she gingerly removed the offending arm and slipped from the bed wrapping a light wool robe about her she crawled into the windowseat and gazed sightlessly out into the night hot tears poured silently down her cheeks and her body shook with muffled sobs again she had felt nothing and she had performed like a whore in the highgate but worst of all was the fact that james hadnt known he had eagerly accepted all she gave with no knowledge of her feelings or of the deception she played patrick leslie would have known and francis toobut then they had truly loved her the king for all his fine words merely lusted for her though he might not know it what he really wanted was a highborn whore to service the hot desires which his dull danish queen could not as the shock eased cat began to feel a burning anger james had used her as he would a common trull and she hated him with a fierce fury she had been forced to soil herself in a way she would never forget but in doing so she had gained the revenge she had planned so long ago the memory of this night would live with him forever it would burn in his dreams like a flaming brand and he would wake with aching loins smiling cruelly she rose from the windowseat shrugging off the robe she climbed back into the bed snuggling down beneath the goosedown coverlet the king still slept snoring gently now propped on one elbow she gazed down on him and her lips formed words he never heard goodbye jamie may ye rot in hell before i ever see ye again chapter the wedding guests departed the following day leaving the families of the bride and groom alone to celebrate the holidays it was the first time in many years that the leslies and the hays had gathered under one roof for christmas through twelfth night it was a bittersweet time for cat she knew it was unlikely she would ever be with them all again she savored each day and her bitterness against james stewart increased as she realized even more fully what his lust would cost her when he had left that morning he had bowed low over her hand turning it so he might kiss the palm and the inside of her wrist sensuous witch he murmured low ye drive me wild until spring my love twill be the longest winter of my life longer than ye think ye rutting bastard she thought smiling sweetly up at him until we meet again jamie hinny she said softly farewell madame he said loudly for all to hear our thanks for your magnificent hospitality and he was no sooner across the drawbridge than she ran to her bedroom in the west tower she tore the sheets from the bed and stuffed them into the fireplace where they burned with a fierce whoosh of smoke and flame astounded susan asked could we nae have washed them clean my lady there isnt enough water in the world to cleanse those sheets my girl take the pillows and the featherbed to the linen room and exchange them for fresh cat picked up the exquisite nightgown she had worn and tossed it into the flames never again she thought never again will i have to prostitute myself never get the hip bath from the garderobe she commanded the two lads who brought in the days supply of wood and then bring me enough hot water to fill it she sat in the windowseat looking out over the tranquil blackandwhite winter landscape behind her two maids remade the bed with fresh linen the tub was slowly filled with hot water and then the room emptied but for her and susan who was pouring oil of wildflowers into the steaming tub cat rose and undressed naked she surveyed herself in the pier glass her figure was still good although she was over thirtyher belly was still flat her glorious breasts were firm there wasnt an ounce of fat on her she stepped into the tub and slid down into the hot water

took a soft brush and standing scrubbed herself down sliding back into the water she said there james stewart tis the last of ye amen said susan wrapping cat in a fluffy towel as her mistress rose from the tub cat laughed happily why is it susan that we get on so well and yeve only been in my service a few years yer aunt ellen served me from the day i was born and now gets on my nerves so tis

speak no more of it susan took the hint after helping her mistress to dress she went about her other duties christmas at glenkirk was celebrated quietly with a beautiful midnight mass in the church of glenkirk abbey afterwards the family descended to the candlelit burial vault beneath the castle chapel and decorated it with greens the rosary was said led by charles leslie the abbot when the family departed cat remained behind sitting on a small marble bench in the flickering candlelight and deep silence she gained strength her eyes moved from tomb to tomb until it reached a large brass plaque that read patrick ian james leslie fourth earl of glenkirk born august died at sea april mourned by his beloved wife catriona mairi and their nine children rest in peace she felt the tears prick at her eyelids oh patrick she whispered they say ye are dead and i dinna believe it though it goes against all logic but dead or alive i know yell neer return here patrick jamie is after me again and i must flee or else bring dishonor to glenkirk i am going to bothwell and i know ye would understand she stood up and moved to her greatgrandmothers tomb well ye great schemer she said sofdy even in death ye got yer way i wed yer precious patrick and hae given glenkirk a new generation but now i will hae my way mam and a prickle went up her spine as she detected a faint silvery laugh or did she she walked to the staircase turning to look back she smiled farewell my bonnie ancestors on new years eve the weather was clear and cold and the sky shone with bright stars and a nearly full moon a huge feast was held that night and the pipers circled the table so many times that cat thought her head would burst with the noise a few minutes before midnight the family ascended to the battlements of the castle and stood in the cold to watch great bonfires flaring among the surrounding hillsides scotland welcomed the new year a lone glenkirk piper played the softly haunting leslies lament as the pipes sounded in the deep winter stillness the music was echoed by sitheans piper across the hills cat could not stop the silent tears that slipped down her cheek luckily they went unnoticed by all except jemmie who put a comforting arm about his mother later as they walked towards the great hall she flashed him a quick smile and said i hope yell be as intuitive of yer wifes feelings as ye are of yer mothers his eyes twinkled ahh madame i am i certainly ami her laughter was warm what a dear rogue ye are jemmie yer father was as proud of ye as i am i know he would be relieved that glenkirk is in such good hands now he gave her a grateful smile and taking her aside said i hae a wonderful new years gift for ye let me gie it to ye now and he pulled her down the corridor to the earls apartments sitting her down in a chair in the antechamber he rushed into his bedroom he returned a minute later with a flat red leather box for a moment she looked at the unopened box in her lap whatever was in it was of great value she was certain it was the first valuable thing he had ever given her another proof she pondered sadly that his father was gone shaking off the unhappy thought she opened the box and gasped nestled in black velvet lining was the most beautiful pendant cat had ever seen circular part of it was fashioned in a quartermoon shape and the rest was a crisscross of openwork studded with tiny diamonds and hung with tiny tinkling bells jemmie jemmie she lifted it out admiring the exquisitely delicate chain tis a copy of one that mam owned i never saw mam wear anything like this and tis neither wi the glenkirk or the sithean jewels remarked cat yer right mother she left it behind when she returned from istanbul father told me in her apartments in the palace there was a wall of tile in the bedroomby the fireplace i believe there was one tile with a thistle pattern she had the wall behind it hollowed out and lined in a fine wood twas there she kept her jewels safe on the night she left the pendant was overlooked in her haste it had been lying towards the back mam told father that she always regretted the loss the sultan had made it for her to celebrate the birth of their first son sultan suleiman tis probably still there but how did ye know what the pendant looked like if ye never saw it mam described it in detail to father several times he described it to me he often said ye were like her proud and willful yet wise thank ye jemmie suddenly he was a boy again i wanted ye to hae something to remember me by he said his voice trembling ever so slightly as he fought to keep it under control why my darling she said catching his face between her hands i will nae forget ye yer my firstborn and we share more than ye realize when ye were but a wee little fish swimming about in my womb i used to talk to ye ye were my strength he laughed what did ye speak on mother all sorts of foolish things jemmie and she paused a moment yell nae be able to come for a few years but once jamie has forgotten me ye and belle can come to visit us he looked at her sadly and said softly but very distinctly damn james stewart to a fiery hell and turning on his heel he left the room cat closed the jewel case with a click ye echo my own sentiments my son she said and followed him from the room the day following the feast of twelfth night the young earl and countess of glenkirk left for court accompanied by the brides parents the rest of the guests dispersed in their various directions in four and a half weeks cats daughter would wed and then cat would be free to go on her way there had always been a tension between mother and daughter because of lord bothwell not knowing her parents problems bess her fathers favorite had automatically taken his part but bess was now in love with her prospective husband it was having a softening effect on the girl cat debated telling bess that she would soon be leaving scotland it was bess however who spoke to her a week before the wedding she came to her mother and said once ye told me that when i fell in love i should understand how ye felt about lord bothwell i returned ye a snide answer mother but now i understand i truly do why do ye stay in scotland when the king was here at christmas he looked at ye in a way that frightened me ye must find uncle francis mother and go to him only then will ye be safe cat hugged her daughter thank ye bess i will go now wi a lighter heart knowing ye really understand bess eyes widened and she opened her mouth to speak but cat gently covered the girls mouth with her hand jemmie will speak of it wi ye one day love yes mother i understand said bess smiling at her what a pity thought cat that we have become friends now that i must leave her the wedding of bess leslie and henry gordon was a quiet one compared to the previous wedding only the family attended jemmie and a sparkling isabelle returned for the festivities and two days later escorted the newlyweds back to edinburgh for the winter season at court before they left both bess and jemmie came to say a private farewell to their mother jemmie was tall and looked so painfully like his father at that age that tears sprang up in cats eyes bess so radiantly happy was a darkhaired mixture of both her parents i want ye to know said cat softly that i love ye both well how i shall miss ye they both clung to her and bess began to weep nay hinny scolded cat gently stroking her daughters hair if the new bride is sad the king may find me out be strong my daughter and help me win this battle that i fight wi jamie he must not suspect that any of ye knew bess mastered herself the others she asked ill speak wi them but nae the bairns i know tis a great burden i put on ye but please bess and ye also jemmie look after them for me later when it is safe ye may all come to visit wi me but now i must travel quickly ye understand that they nodded and she kissed them each in turn leading them to the door she saw them out later on that day she stood on the top step of the castles main entrance waving gaily and calling loudly for all ears to hear i will see ye in the spring my dears gie my loving regards to his majesty she stayed there waving until they were out of sight before retiring to her tower to weep in private the following day would see her two younger sons fourteenyearold colin and twelveandahalfyearold robert on their way colin was going to the university of aberdeen and robert back to his duties as a page with the earl of rothes household that night she drew her four older children about her and told them that she would be leaving glenkirk and why she had worried about disappearing from their lives without explanation and had decided that telling them was worth the risk her judgment was vindicated when her nineyearold daughter morag said quietly i am glad ye go mother i dinna like the king tenyearold amanda nodded in agreement aye dinna worry for us mother besides yeve seen to our futures rather well i shall enjoy being countess of sithean cat couldnt help but laugh yer such a practical little puss she told her daughter when asked robbie soon colin began to chuckle what is so funny his mother asked him im sorry im nae still wi rothes said the boyman id enjoy seeing cousin james facethe sanctimonious lecher thank god yer not wi rothes said cat yed gie me away for sure but she laughed conall said almost the same thing she told them and the girls and robbie joined in the mirth the following morning the boys were gone and for the next few days cat was dejected she spent a good deal of time in the nursery playing with her three babies then one evening she appeared unexpected in her motherinlaws bedchamber meg understood instantly wordlessly she rose and hugged cat to her so soon cat nodded tis dark of the moon and there is no better time for me to go unnoticed if i stay any longer i will nae be able to go meg it tears at me even now then god go wi ye my daughter oh meg ye were always closer to me than my own mother i shall miss ye so much try to explain to my parents meg i will my dear dinna think too harshly of yer mother she has always lived in her own sensuous little world where the only other occupant was yer father i will make her understand and who knowswhen yer safe we may even come visiting my bairns yell be sure to look after them meg aye and yell nae let them forget me until i can send for them nay love now go catriona go before ye make a foolish and emotional decision gently meg kissed cats cheek and pushed her from her chambers for a moment cat stood in the cold dark corridor ill nae see this again she thought and the tears flowed down her cheeks my god if anyone sees me ill be hard put to explain fiercely she wiped the wetness from her cheeks and ran through the back passages of the castle to her own apartments the servantswith the exceptions of susan and her young sister mayhad all been sent to bed is everything done cat asked susan yes my lady conall and his men hae seen to it he said we were to leave as soon as ye returned she hustled cat into the bedchamber where she had a steaming tub waiting tis the last yer apt to get for a while cat smiled weakly did ye pack everything i told ye and ye hae my jewel cases aye to both questions if the kings men come looking theyll find most of yer clothes still here awaiting yer return ah what fun twill be to buy ye new clothes in france the heaviness was beginning to lift from cats shoulders ye and may shall have some new clothes too she promised within the hour she was dressed and ready then susan who stood behind her unexpectedly fastened about cats neck the lion pendant given her by lord bothwell i thought ye should be reminded of what yer going to my lady nae what yer leaving cat smiled suddenly happy susan i didna think ye could understand the wrench this is for me i thank ye susan for helping me through a hard hard time yer a good friend to me and i willna forget it catching up her furlined cloak she walked to the fireplace and pressed the carving that opened the door to the secret passageway be sure the door is shut tight behind ye girls she said and taking a candle she stepped into the corridor minutes later they exited at the foot of the west tower where conall waited with three horses cat swung herself onto iolaires back while susan and may rode pillion with conall leading the way they rode out from glenkirk unseen by the watch on a hill high above the castle they were joined by a party of men so large that cat was taken aback christ she swore how many are there conall fifty i couldna hae ye chasing all over europe wi just half a dozen men to protect ye ye can afford it and raising his arm he signaled the start of their journey wait she commanded turning iolaire she looked back down onto glenkirk looming dark against a darker sky for a moment she hesitated torn with one final doubt leave glenkirk leave her bairns leave scotland leave nearly all she held dear and then she saw james sensuous face before her and she heard his voice low and insinuating saying and ye will do to me what ye did this night yanking her horse about cat shouted forward and galloped away they would be sailing from rattray head where bothwell had left from so long ago since the gallant james had disappeared with patrick leslie the leslies new flagship new venture would be taking cat to france cat thought the name most appropriate they rode through the night stopping twice to rest the horses at dawn they made camp in the ruins of huntley castle the ride in the cold night air had given cat an enormous appetite and she happily accepted a small rabbit broiled on a stick which was brought to her by one of the men susan supplied a loaf of bread a cup and a flask filled with sweet wine cat shared these offerings with her two servants and happily stuffed herself full at last she wrapped herself in her heavy cloak and went to sleep by a small fire kindled in what was now a freestanding fireplace when she awoke it was midafternoon and the camp was quiet susan and may were sleeping near her she lay for a few minutes drowsy and warm within the safety of her cloak then slept again when she woke in late afternoon the camp was abustle with the activities of cooking several lambs were turning over the cook fires and on a large flat stone boasting a smaller fire beneath it rested a number of freshbaked loaves well away from the heat stood several unopened casks of ale conall to me madame where did all of this come from my lord of huntley told his people to be on the lookout for ye and to see we were well fed and cared for while on gordon lands her face softened why bless george for that she said then theres nae too much ale is there i dinna want the men too drunk to ride weve a long night ahead of us and we must reach rattray before dawn just enough to keep them happy my lady theres a small cask of wine for ye too dinna forget to refill yer flask for tonight she nodded and accepted the tin plate susan handed her it held thin juicy slices of meat early green cress and hot bread dripping butter and honey the cup was filled with rich malmsey and put at her side on the ground again cat stuffed herself afterwards as the men ate she stood and addressed them conall has told ye of my journey if any of ye have changed yer minds about going now is the time to say so and to return to glenkirk if ye go back i only ask that ye remain silent as to my whereabouts silence greeted her words and looking out at the glenkirk men she felt quick tears prick her eyelids fighting to control herself she said simply thank ye thank ye all they were ahorse within the hour and rode through most of the dark night she could smell the sea long before they reached the coast its salt tang growing stronger with every passing mile they arrived at the rendezvous well before their deadline and conall signaled towards the sea with a lantern which he had managed somehow to stow in his bulging saddlebags from the darkness came an answering light he drew forward a familiarlooking young man my son andrew he announced gruffly cat raised an eyebrow dinna tell me conall ye couldna find the time to wed wi his mother but a leslie always recognizes bis own am i correct aye madame he drawled and she laughed andrew and ten of the men will sail on the new venture wi ye he said ill go wi the others and the horses on the anne la reine from peterhead will ye be long behind us cat asked nervously i dinna like landing in france wi so few men well be ahead of ye the anne la reine is lighter and a bit faster than the new venture yer coach horses coachmen and grooms left three days ago and will be waiting for ye dinna fret lass ill be waiting for ye she smiled warmly at him all right conall then she turned her smile on the young man well andrew moreleslie not enough pretty girls to keep ye home at glenkirk too many my ladyand an equal number of angry fathers cat laughed yell do lad they descended to the beach to meet the longboat it slid up onto the sand and the sailors scrambled out to pull it safely onto the beach for a moment cat flew back in time remembering when she had stood before on this wet and windy beach it had been a bit less than three years ago and she had ridden with the earl of bothwell to bid him goodbye as he began his exile she had thought never to see him again now she stood on this very beach ready to begin her own selfimposed exile an officer detached himself from his men and bowed over her hand first officer malcolm moreleslie at yer service my lady i am hughs son yer susan and mays older brother aye madame is not the captain a moreleslie sandy alans boy good god conall i certainly sail well protected by the family he would have wanted it that way conall muttered fiercely cat put out a hand and patted the older mans arm ye wanted to go wi him eh conall aye but hed nae hae it stay home conall he said who else can i trust to look after her christ man dinna tell me this now at the moment of my departure madame if i dinna think hed approve of this road ye take id nae be here but i am and while tis in my hands ill keep ye safe and then he blushed beetred as she stood on tiptoes and soundly kissed his cheek god go wi ye conall she said and joined susan and may who were already in the boat without further ado the small boat was on its way through the darkness to the new venture then she was being swung up and out over the water and when she opened her eyes again she was on the deck being greeted by the captain ive put ye and yer lasses in my own cabin my lady yell be more comfortable there he said thank ye cousin she said bringing a flush of pleasure to his ruddy face hed heard about cat leslie and what a fine woman she was her acknowledgment of their relationshiphowever tenuous that relationship waspleased him too it brought him extra stature in the eyes of his men will ye take yer main meal wi me and my officers he asked gladly the captain bowed ill be about my business now madame duncan will see ye safely to yer quarters the new venture was a big sleek caravel of some eighty tons she carried a full dozen guns and had been designed for speed and maneuverability yet generous cargo space her crews quarters were dry warm and comfortable outstanding for the times there was a separate cooks area incorporated into the seamens quarters so the men might have warm food or ale when they finished their duties the leslies demanded absolute obedience and loyalty from their sailors but they paid them well and cared for them properly consequently leslie employees were the best duncan the ships boy led cat and her two serving women to a large cabin high in the stern of the ship through the leaded and paned bow windows cat could see that the stars had faded and the sky was growing lighter the cabin was comfortably furnished with a goodsized bed and two trundles there were turkey carpets on the floor and velvet hangings at the bow windows and the two smaller ports beautiful brass lamps lit the room and on an oak table stood two decanters of wineone red one gold could ye eat mlady asked duncan is there any fruit aboard lad apples maam and some seville oranges bring both and some hard cheese and bread ohh my lady said may plaintively im starving i could eat a big bowl of porridge i surely could wi honey and clotted cream cat laughed at the girl not this morning my lass if ye would nae succumb to mal de mer ye will eat and drink sparingly this day later when the two young women lay sleeping cat sat in the velvet windowseat and watched the coast of scotland slowly growing smaller above her she heard set the course for calais eastsoutheast and an echoing voice answered eastsoueast the beautiful leafgreen eyes strained towards the fading coastline a tear slid down her pale cheek and then another and another she wept softly bitterly until the sadness began to lift and she had a sudden awareness of excitement growing within her behind her lay her old life but ahead lay her very reason for life ahead was francis stewarthepburn she could not be so ungrateful as to weep over what the gods had taken from hernot when they had given so much chapter the messenger sent by the king of scotland to the younger dowager countess of glenkirk returned quickly to edinburgh what do ye mean she wasna there demanded the king in a tight little voice shes gone to france the auld dowager said and proper upset she was too seems the young one just took off early one morning wiout a word to anyone james sent for the earl of glenkirk and his sister lady elizabeth gordon do ye know where yer mother is he asked them at glenkirk sire said the earl without hesitation she is nae at glenkirk answered the king fiercely she is in france for a moment both young faces registered surprise then bess said to jemmie she went after all oh i do hope twill cheer her what do ye mean lady gordon bess smiled sweetly at the king and then said in the same warm confidential tone shed used with her brother why sire she spoke of visiting our leslie cousins in france ye see tis been a terrible year for her first our father dying then jemmie marrying and coming wi bella to court and then my marrying and coming to court colin is away at the university and robbie a page wi rothes why siretheres scarcely anyone home but the bairns shes been so lonely she said she might go to france for a bit but then she said nay bess smiled again and shrugged elegant little shoulders i suppose she changed her mind again we women are so unpredictable amused the king suppressed a smile and then his mouth tightened in anger she was to come to court this spring oh yes said bess brightly twas the last thing she said to us when we left glenkirk after my weddingthat she would see us at court in the spring and to gie her loving regards to the king she turned and stared accusingly at her brother jemmie ill wager ye forgot dolthead how could ye a small smile played at the corners of the kings mouth at the embarrassed look on the young earls handsome face they were such a charming family thank ye lady gordon ye may leave us jemmie stay i would speak further wi ye bess curtsied prettily and left the room james looked sharply at james leslie he saw nothing but open honesty and admiration the king pursed his lips and said slowly yer mother has displeased me glenkirk in a sense she has deliberately disobeyed me the young face looked genuinely distressed i commanded yer mothers presence at court this spring in fact he paused a moment for effecti planned to make her my mistress and she was well aware of it surprise and incredulity registered on the young face sire this is a great honor ye do glenkirk christ sir what can i say then damn me her behavior is intolerable i always felt my father spoiled her but i am sure she will return soon she is simply willful but i dinna believe disobedient the king looked pleased there was no nonsense here the lad was with him shed have no place to hide now this was one glenkirk hed have no trouble with at all the earl considered it an honor that james had singled out his motherand rightly so i will send word to my good friend king henri that yer mother is to be sent home jemmie looked earnestly at the king i will write her also sire i am now the lord of glenkirk and i honor my mother as much as she merits it but she must understand that tis my word that is law at glenkirk not hers she is after all but a woman and therefore must be guided yer majesty has offered her yer protection i will nae allow her to fling such graciousness away the king was pleased but alone he brooded did she really intend returning or as the little nagging doubt in the back of his mind suggested had she fled him again he had warned her once what he would do to her family if she refused him but that was when her husband was alive it would have been possible to trump up charges against patrick but the young earl was a different matter punishing him would be far too transparent and would reap terrible consequences for the king the leslies of glenkirk were no longer a defenseless clan without powerful ties the kings own cousin george gordon the earl of huntley was as troublesome in his way as bothwell had been he was not going to stand idly by and allow his daughter isabelles happiness to be destroyed and james wanted no open clan rivalries left behind when he mounted the english throne then too there was the young earl of glenkirk himself in the short time he had been at court he had made himself very popular and he was openly admiring and supportive of the king one could hardly accuse such a charming and loyal young man of perfidy besides james genuinely liked the new earl of glenkirk the king slouched low in his chair fingering the diamondandblackpearl necklace he had sent to cat with the messenger he thought anxiously that she must come back she must he could notnay would not spend a lifetime yearning for her but what if she did not return he groaned aloud she must chapter the new venture had made an easy passage from rattray head to calais the captain was heard to remark that in all his years of sailing he had never encountered such fair and constant winds in the north sea let alone the north sea in late february the anne la reine had arrived some twelve hours ahead of cats ship and conall and his men awaited their lady on the docks because conall deemed it safer cat and her two servants rode inside the coach on the fourday trip to paris her entourage was extremely impressive two coachmen sat on the box two footmen rode behind four grooms on horseback followed behind the coach each leading yet another horselolaire among them conall led fifteen men while andrew with another fifteen brought up the rear on each side of the coach rode ten men besides cat and her servants there was one other occupant of the coach and when cat had disembarked at calais she had almost fainted at the sight of him conall had grasped her arm and said sharply tis his bastard halfbrother hes been raised here and the young priest stepped forward and raised her hand to his lips i should not have startled ye so madame i have always been flattered to know that i look like patrick i did not realize how much until this moment aye father except that yer hair is blond and his was dark yer his mirror image even the tone of yer voicel learning of her visitfor cat had sent a message ahead to her two unclesthe priest had come from paris to meet her his name was niall fitzleslie and he had been the only bastard of the third earl of glenkirk his mother had been the youngest daughter of the laird of rae and she had caught the earls eye when meg was pregnant with her last baby the third earl had been unable to resist the ample and available charms of the lairds daughter nine months later niall had been born upon learning of his daughters condition the old laird had sent her off to his sister in caithness there she had remained until she died when her son was ten the third earl of glenkirk had always seen to his bastard sons support and when niall was left motherless his father had sent him to be raised by his brother donald in france thus meg had never known of her beloved husbands one deviation formal recognition by his father had made nialls acceptance into the church a certainty donald leslie of glenkirk had been a third son and it had been necessary for him to make his own fortune with his cousin david leslie of sitheanhimself a fourth sonhe had gone into military service as a mercenary it was while serving france that the two cousins caught the fancies of two young heiresses who were also related donald had wed himself to ren de la provence and sired six children in rapid successionfive of them sons so his fatherinlaw the old sieur de la provence had been made happy in his old age now that he was dead donald was the sieur de la provence david lesliebrother to cats motherhad done equally well by marrying adèle de peyrac the onlychild of the elderly sieur de peyrac he had sired foursons the two leslie cousins had as part of their marriage contracts agreed to add their wives names to their own hence in france they were known as donald leslie de la provence and david leslie de peyrac cat had never met either of her uncles as they had left scotland before she was born the entire family is quite excited by your visit madame niall told her we realize of course that you are in mourning no longer patrick would nae have liked it i was saddened to learn of his death i liked him ye knew him niall fitzleslie smiled yes i knew him when he was returning home to scotland he stopped unexpectedly in paris and there was no time to remove me to another place i will never forget the look on his face when he saw me twas a look of pure surprise then he laughed and said little brother i must obviously greet you so before he left we had a long talk and he told me of our fathers death he continued to pay for my support with our uncles and after i became a priest he settled an amount on me with the kiras a man he wrote me is still a man even if he is a priest and should always have his own money he was a good man i will pray for him he was a good man cat replied then she looked at the young priest and said father i should like you to hear my confession among other things it will answer all the questions i see in your eyes she lowered the window of the coach and hailing the nearest man called tell conall i want to stop for a rest as soon as possible a few moments later the coach pulled into a sheltered clearing and susan and may exited to stretch their legs kneeling on the padded floor of the luxurious vehicle cat put her two slim white hands into the large tanned one of the priest she remained this way for almost an hour while she spoke softly of the last few years of her life the priests face remained impassive throughout her recital when she stopped he said in the eyes of the church you have certainly sinned grievously but you have paid a far greater penance than your sin demanded my daughter your current flight puts your family here in some small jeopardy should king henri be asked by king james to aid in your return i think however that your king is gauche in pursuing you when you so obviously dislike him lord only knows henri quatre is a lover of great renown but he has never to my knowledge forced a woman james stewart is obviously a barbarian you will of course forestall any threat to your family here by staying only a short time i will mon père only long enough to buy new clothes as i left most of mine behind at glenkirk the priest grinned an admirable excuse for a new wardrobe ma belle cousine she laughed i really do want to hurry for i am most anxious to reach lord bothwell niall fitzleslie raised cat up sit back now madame our business is over he smiled at her does lord bothwell know you are coming no i dared not communicate with him before i left glenkirk i will arrange with our paris bankers to send a message to naples i think he will be a very happy man remarked the cleric when he was here at king henris court he seemed so so the priest struggled for the right word so incomplete i realize that sounds strange but something seemed to be missing in him and for him now i know what that something was cats face lit up and niall was staggered by the sudden flash of pure beauty mon dieu chérie you almost make me regret my vows of celibacy he said her clear laughter rang within the coach you definitely have the leslie charm mon père it is a good thing you have taken holy orders there are already too many lusty leslie men running about this earth they continued their journey through picardy into isle de france and up to paris cat was enchanted with the city and quite amazed to discover how unlike london edinburgh or aberdeen it was she had assumed that all big cities were much alike paris was unlike any place she had ever seen now she understood why the current king had switched his allegiance from protestantism to catholicism in order to end religious wars in france remarking that paris is well worth a mass cat would be staying with her uncle david whose house was thirty miles southeast of paris near the royal residence of fontainbleau when they reached the far side of the city niall instructed the coachmen as to the proper roads to travel and rode on ahead so david leslie de peyrac might know of his nieces imminent arrival it was late afternoon when the coach and its escort drew into the courtyard of the chateau petit before cats grooms could jump down two liveried footmen were at the coach door opening it lowering the steps and helping cat down an elegant gentleman stepped forward had he not looked so like her mother cat would not have recognized him as her uncle smiling he kissed her on both cheeks catriona welcome to france the sieur de peyrac drew forward a tall darkeyed woman your tante adèle cat curtsied welcome to petit chateau smiled adèle de peyrac i am sorry your visit must be so short nonsense ma femme catriona will stay as long as she likes it will not be long uncle i am bound for naples and i must reach there without delay i stop only long enough to arrange for a new wardrobe in paris and to rest you need not travel back to the city said adèle i have an excellent dressmaker who will come to the chateau we will send for her tomorrow morning and taking cats arm in a firm grip she led her up the main staircase to an exquisitely decorated suite of rooms as the doors closed behind them cat pulled out of her aunts grasp and whirling about said very well tante let us talk adèle de peyrac smiled good you are sensible tell me quickly now why have you come to france i certainly hope you do not think you can make your home with us now that your son is married cat was incredulous the woman must be mad gods bones madame why on earth would i want to live with you do not be angry my dear replied adèle we all know that a dowager countess has far less access to the gracious life as her sons mother than she had as her husbands wife perhaps you and your sons new wife do not get along and it has been necessary for you to remove yourself i do not imagine it is easy to be poor cat resisted the strong urge to slap the smug face before her madame she said icily i do not know what gave you the erroneous idea that i am poor but i beg to inform you that i am a very wealthy woman in my own right i was when i married glenkirk and i still am if i chose to i could live with my son and his bride who is a sweet and loving girl however i prefer to remarry i am on my way to naples to do just that remarry whom lord bothwell said cat evenly mon dieu he is a savage and yet he is most charming or so i have been told with this pronouncement adèle de peyrac left the room susan sniffed she doesna like us does she my lady cat laughed no susan she doesna like us how long must we stay here my lady just a few weeks susantis still winter and i would wait a bit the following night cat met her uncle donald and his wife renée who was as warm with her scots niece as adèle was cold i wish you had stayed with us chère catherine adèle is not a particularly hospitable woman cat patted the plump dimpled hand its all right ma chère tante i only stay a few weeks and then i am gone renée de la provence leaned forward and whispered i must speak alone with you as quickly as possible make some excuse to go to your room a bit later cat discovered her aunt renée already awaiting her in cats room is it true catherine that you are rich cat bit back her laughter for the little woman looked so distressed yes tante i am rich oh dear adèle thought at first that you were poor and she could barely wait for you to come and be as quickly gone tonight however she told me that you were rich and that she intended wedding you to her eldest son giles impossible cat was angered and astounded i travel south to wed with lord bothwell besides i thought all the de peyracs were wed giles is a widower and though he is my own nephew i must tell you i do not like him he was married for five years to the daughter of my friend marie de valmaison two years ago the girl committed suicide before she was wed to giles she was the sweetestnatured brightest and sunniest girl imaginable but afterwards she became quiet and frightened always looking to giles for approval of every word she spoke it was as if she feared him do not fear for me tante renée i will wed no one but francis hepburn nevertheless child beware giles de peyrac back in the main hall of the chateau cat was introduced to her six de la provence cousinsfive charming young men and their wives and a delightful sixteenyearold girl named marguerite whom everyone called mimi then her uncle davids sons and their wives were presented to her she quickly understood her aunts fear and dislike of giles de peyrac although his brothers were all pleasant enough the eldest de peyrac son was tall and as austere as his mother with an almost spanish look about him his hair was dark and his black eyes held a peculiar gold flame that flared when he was excited he took her hand turning it over to kiss the inside of her palm and quickly tickling it with his wet tongue cat snatched her hand back outraged she was furious and repelled by his behavior as well as disgusted by the strange eyes that plunged deep into her décolletage and slowly swept upward to her face we have much in common ma belle cousine said giles de peyrac we are both left widowed in our prime and he paused we are both experienced she ignored the remark giving him a perfunctory smile and turned away to talk with mimi but when it came time to sit down to the meal she found him next to her to cats intense embarrassment he made a great fuss over her choosing the choicest viands to put on her plate and insisting she drink from his cup she could barely manage to be civil quickly turning to her other dinner partner she discovered it was niall fitzleslie his eyes were brimming with amusement and she said quietly in gaelic do you not think my aunt is obvious in placing her odious son on one side of me and a priest on the other the thought of her favorite child possessing your wealth is very tempting catriona then how did ye know i spoke gaelic ye told me ye spent several years in caithness what else would ye speak there annoyed at being ignored so pointedly giles de peyrac asked what is that gibberish you speak it has an ugly sound cat gave him a cold look while niall said tis gaelic we speak cousin madame la comtesse speaks to me of my youth cat managed to avoid her reptilian cousin the rest of the evening and with the arrival the following day of the parisian dressmaker she was prepared to forget him entirely the woman had brought three assistants and an enormous collection of fabrics one look at cat and she chortled ah madame la comtesse what a pleasure it will be to dress you mon dieu what a tiny waist what magnificent breasts such skin eyes hair i can see that once you arrive at court it will not be long before our evergreen gallant has a new mistress when i have finished with you madame there will be no one more ravishing cat laughed happily i regret i shall be a disappointment to you madame de croix i am not going to court but to italy to be married you must make my clothes in the italian fashion the little womans face fell where in italy madame la comtesse naples ahhhh the smile reappeared naples the climate is temperate and the nobility fashionable we will use light velvets cottons linens and silks of all weights the necklines will be very very low the skirts fluid and flowing you will be a vision she signaled to her assistants who immediately began unrolling bolts of materials cat gasped never had she seen such a marvelous display of fabric or colors a soft lilaccolored silk caught her eye and she pointed to it for my wedding gown she said madame de croix smiled broadly oui but only for the overskirt for the underskirt we use the same color in a light velvet which we will embroider with gold thread and seed pearls the sleeves will flow like water and we will embroider their edges too very appropriate for naples now if you were to remain here and go to court i should design the sleeves tight at the shoulder and wrist and full in the center but she shrugged tis too stifling a fashion for a warm city now madame la comtesse let us get your measurements clad only in her shift cat stood upon a stool while the dressmaker and her three assistants buzzed about her chattering in their quick parisian french suddenly cat became aware of another person in the room and looking up saw giles de peyrac leaning against the open bedroom door staring avidly at her ignoring him she said to susan in gaelic fetch conall to remove that vermin an uncomfortable few minutes passed and then conall was standing next to giles de peyrac speaking in soft careful french he said we can do this two ways my lord either ye leave quietly or on my ladys very explicit orders i will remove you saying nothing the frenchman turned and departed conall following how long asked cat would it take to make one dress for me could you do a dress in one day using three girls i could madame la comtesse then send to paris madame de croix i want two dozen of your best seamstresses and i will pay their wages myself twelve are to work on my gowns and the others are to do everything elsethe shifts nightgarments cloaks embroidery whatever at the womans incredulous look cat smiled send someone you trust to the banking house of giscard kira and ask whether madame la comtesse de glenkirk can afford such extravagance you will find that i can i wish to be gone from chateau petit within two weeks shuddering cat glanced at the nowempty doorway chapter two days before cats departure an unfamiliar horseman rode into chateau petit within the hour cat was summoned to the library david leslie de peyrac looked uncomfortable and a trifle nervous sprawling in a chair was an elegant gentleman who leaped to his feet as cat entered the room my niece madame la comtesse de glenkirk catriona this is monsieur le marquis de la victoire the elegant bowed low over her hand kissing it reverently and holding it a moment too long his blue eyes swept her admiringly and he couldnt resist ogling her just a trifle the waxed points of his moustache twitching slightly madame i am your devoted slave he murmured with a violetscented breath cats laughter rang clear and her leafgreen eyes twinkled you overwhelm me with such attentions monsieur le marquis she protested prettily delighted with this beautiful woman who was obviously skilled in court repartee the marquis spoke again madame it is my unbelievable good fortune to have been chosen by the king to escort you to fontainebleau your king wishes to see me there must be some mistake monsieur le marquis i am merely traveling through france on my way to italy you are the widow of patrick leslie yes then there is no mistake madame i will need time to change monsieur le marquis and of course i must be properly chaperoned i shall be accompanied by both my tiring women my confessor and my captainatarms and his men and of course we shall travel in my coach but of course madame all the proprieties will be observed another hour passed and cat found herself traveling the seven miles through the forest between chateau petit and fontainebleau on nialls advice she had dressed herself in an elegantly seductive darkgreen velvet dress that emphasized the color of her eyes and the whiteness of her skin the neckline was cut very low to reveal the full swell of her breasts over it she had flung a hooded cloak fashioned of alternating bands of darkgreen velvet and soft dark beaver it closed at the neck with a large gold clasp set with an emerald niall spoke quietly to her as they rode along dont underestimate him catriona henri de navarre is a shrewd man answer his questions candidly but tell him only what you think he needs to know no more he enjoys women especially women of spirit and intelligence he has great charm but what she asked can he want with me i imagine james stewart has discovered your absence and has sent to his fellow king for aid in obtaining your return i will not go back niall if that is why henri wishes to see you ma belle then use all your charms to dissaude him i know you can mon père cat was shocked what is it you are telling me to do whatever you must do you or do you not wish to be lord bothwells wife i do dear god i do then do whatever you must do to achieve that goal a few minutes later they reached fontainebleau and the marquis was at the coach door to escort cat to the french king your women and your other people may wait here he told her niall slid easily from the coach to the courtyard looking directly at robert de la victoire he said quietly i think i shall visit my old friend père hugo the kings confessor i will be ready to return on your command madame la comtesse clutching her cloak about her cat followed the marquis through a maze of winding and dimly lit corridors until finally he stopped pointing to a paneled door he directed through there madame and turning around he disappeared into the darkness cat gritted her teeth and grasping the door handle turned it and entered into a beautifully furnished small library at first glance the room appeared empty then a tall man stepped from a curtained alcove come closer madame la comtesse i will not bite you she walked directly up to him and swept him a low curtsy monseigneur you are gracious to receive me a smile briefly touched the corner of his mouth remove the cloak madame we will talk cat unfastened the gold clasps laying the garment neatly on a chair she turned back to the french king he had a sensuous handsome face with deepbrown velvet eyes they scrutinized her with frank approval his gaze moved downward from her beautiful face to rest quite openly on her lovely breasts pushing above the neckline of her gown magnifique he breathed i can well understand james stewarts frantic desire to get you back madame la comtesse though she had been halfexpecting it the shock was almost too much for cat she swayed slightly instantly the french king was at her side a strong arm about her waist i will not go back monseigneur not unless it be in my coffin henri de navarre was distressed ahh no chérie i cannot allow that to happen she swayed again and the king scooped her up and swiftly carried her through the curtained alcove to a bed his long slender fingers expertly loosed the laces of her bodice pouring a small amount of amber liquid into a goblet he put an arm about her shoulders and forced her to drink cat gasped and coughed gods nightshirt whisky the french king laughed an excellent restorative suddenly aware of her dishabille cat struggled to relace herself but another wave of dizziness overcame her and she fell back the king leaned over her pinioning her gently between his arms do not be afraid chérie i will not make you return to your king it is all too obvious that he repels you and i have never believed in forcing women sweet surrender in the battle between the sexes has far more charm than rape the brown eyes caressed her warmly and cat felt herself blush under his very ardent gaze his voice was soft would you surrender to me chérie he asked and she barely had time to murmur monseigneur before his mouth closed warmly over hers expecting to react as she had with james cat was startled to feel a tremor run through her body the mouth on hers was tender and expert she felt herself relax her eyes closed and she sighed deeply he laughed softly and the slim fingers quickly undid her laces baring her completely to the waist his mouth moved down the slender column of her throat to the twin silken globes of her breasts she couldnt stop him though for a brief moment she tried to struggling to escape the outrageously delicious feelings that were sweeping over her this was wrong she didnt even know him nonnon chérie he gently admonished her pressing her back among the pillows you want this as much as i do and she realized with shock that he spoke the truth she did not know him yet she needed his very masculine body in order to reassure herself of her womanhood james had made her feel like a whore henri of navarre a virtual stranger was making her feel alive and feminine again his lips traced a pattern across her faintly trembling breasts moving downward to her quivering navel his large soft hands caressed her with an expertise that left her breathless and halffainting she felt those hands beneath her full skirts stroking her satiny thighs and then moving to touch her more intimately a throbbing aching tightness began building within her she cried out monseigneur and felt seeking her her breath was coming in short quick little gasps and she sobbed gratefully as his hardness penetrated her he moved smoothly delighting in her passionate response lingering happily within her warmth holding himself in perfect check as she sought and found her own heaven then taking her one final time to the heights of ecstasy he joined her in fulfillment cat excited by this expert lover first fainted and then drifted off into a relaxed sleep when she awoke several hours later he was quickly at her bedside with a glass of cool wine blushing furiously at the memory of what had passed between them she accepted his offering with lowered eyes look at me chérie he gently commanded her his hand imperiously raised her heartshaped face to his i pity james and i certainly envy my friend lord bothwell he said her leafgreen eyes widened and she swallowed hard youyou know francis yes chérie i do we spent many happy hours together before he so foolishly killed a de guise in a duel i have enough trouble with that family as it is and i was forced to exile my friend then you know i journey to naples to wed francis yes chérie and all along you intended to let me go my way yes chine ohhhhhh her eyes were wide with outrage she struggled off the bed desperately trying to lace herself up my god monseigneur how could you how could you henri de navarre could not help himself and he began to laugh catching at the angry little hand that pummeled his chest because you adorable creature with a courtful of delicious and willing beauties your francois did nothing but sigh and moon over you i simply could not believe such perfection existed but now and he smiled down at her i believe ma chérie he tipped her face up to his you will not tell my good friend francois that i took shameful advantage of you will you chérie her lower lip began to tremble and she struggled to retain her dignity you are an impossible man monseigneur she scolded him beginning to laugh in spite of herself his fingers expertly laced her up was it so terrible what we did i was under the distinct impression that you enjoyed yourself as much as i did her eyes met his and he heard her say i did monseigneur but for a reason you would not suspect tell me last christmas when my son wed isabelle gordon james stewart came to glenkirk to spend his days hunting and his nights in my bed when he touched me i felt nothing i was forced to pretend an emotion i did not feel so as not to offend my royal cousins pride after several nights of it i became afraid that perhaps something was actually the matter with me and today chuckled henri de navarre you discovered that there is nothing the matter with you nestce pas yes she said softly i am delighted to have had a part in reassuring you madame la comtesse he returned dryly she laughed mischievously do not play the wounded one with me monseigneur twas you who seduced me henri smiled down at her i will not deny madame that this has been a delightful interlude his finger touched the tip of her nose and he sighed but now you must return to your uncles chateau and prepare for your journey to italy she caught up his hands and kissed them merci merci monseigneur mille mercis he again took her face in his two hands you love him very much dont you chérie yes monseigneur i love him it has been a long and very lonely three years i have been as half a person without him i have never felt like that about anyone replied the french king i do not believe many people do monseigneur and i dp not understand why francis and i were singled out to share such a lovebut we do henri de navarre gently traced a finger down her cheek how lovely you are chérie with all your innocent love shining out of those marvelous green eyes go safely to your beloved rogue and tell him that i miss him what an addition you both would have been to my court picking up her cloak he carefully draped it around her shoulders taking her hand he led her to the door and opened it here she is mon pèresafe and sound he took her hand kissing it he said adieu madame la comtesse the door to the study closed and she was alone in the corridor with niall fitzleslie the priest led her back to their coach in the courtyard when they were safely on their way he asked well madame did you leave the lions maw unscathed cat laughed almost mon père still i like your king then you are free to go on to lord bothwell yes niall i am free the following day the two families gathered to bid cat farewell she retired as soon after the evening meal as was politely possible for they planned an early start already the coach and a smaller secondary vehicle brought to transport cats new wardrobe had been packed and stood ready but for their horses that very morning the marquis de la victoire had arrived with a certificate of safe passage from henri de navarre for madame la comtesse de glenkirk it would enable her to travel unmolested through france and through various italian territories as well in the deep of the night cat woke suddenly aware that she was not alone standing silently in the darkness at the foot of her bed was a man she knew at once who it was what do you want giles how did you know it was me catherine who else would dare to intrude on me giles are you really leaving us in the morning yes why because she said patiently as if explaining to a child i travel to naples to wed lord bothwell he is not the man for you catherine he is a cruel crude northerner he killed my friend paul de guise you do not know what kind of a man he really is tis you who do not know lord bothwell giles i have known him for years i love him and i always have loved him for a moment giles de peyrac was silent then she heard a sharp intake of breath you then you are the woman he mourned you are the woman for whom he scorned and insulted clarice de guise giles de peyrac moved from the darkness into the halflight by cats bedside and his voice was strained vindictive we stripped him of almost everything he had in reparation before the king exiled him when he left france he and that mangy servant of his had naught but the horses they rode and the clothes on their backs now you think to go to him and make his life pleasant my best friend is dead the strange gold light flickered in giles de peyracs eyes i wonder ma belle cousine how your lover will receive you knowing that i have used you like an animal and he will know giles she deliberately raised her voice but he was so lost to reason that he did not notice giles leave my bedchamber at once she heard a soft movement in her dressing room and knew with relief that she had wakened her tiring women giles de peyrac reached out grasping the neckline of her nightgown he ripped the sheer material away easily before she could stop him he flung himself on her cat screamed a scream cut off by his hand on her mouth cat twisted her body wildly trying to escape the hands that pinched and hurt her the black eyes glittered cruelly the little gold flame flickering madly thats it he whispered in an excited voice fight me fight me i like it when women fight me my god cat realized hes mad but i wont be raped again not again suddenly giles de peyrac was lifted off her his arms pinioned back by andrew i warned you lad said conall quietly and then he plunged his dirk directly into his prisoners heart giles de peyracs odd eyes widened in surprise and then went blank as he crumpled to the floor amazed cat watched as niall stepped from the darkness having administered last rites he commanded dump him outside the walls by the servants gate it will look like footpads andrew and conall picked up the body silently and carried it from the room gasping cat began to weep with relief vaguely aware that she was being gathered against a broad chest niall fitzleslie held her easily his hand stroking the tawny hair suddenly be became aware of the soft bare breasts pressing against his chest his heart began to beat wildly and for a brief moment he closed his eyes enjoying the sensation then gathering his weakening selfcontrol he said quietly giles de peyrac was a depraved monster who virtually killed his own wife i want you to forget this ever happened are you all right now still clinging to him she turned her tearstreaked face up to him and he groaned christ catriona dont look at me like that i am a priest but i am a man also ma belle then let me go niall i can feel you trembling against me go away before we are foolish reluctantly he released her and she drew the sheets up over her nakedness though celibacy was a vow often broken among the priesthood he himself had never before been tempted he had had his share of wenches before admitting to his vocation and had never regretted leaving carnality behind but now as if reading his thoughts she said quietly honest doubt makes for a stronger faith mon père thank you for rescuing me but i would rest now twill soon be dawn and whatever happens i must be on my way today he nodded dumbly will you hear my confession before i go i think it would be best to keep this in the family finding his voice he said yes come to the chapel at dawn i will be waiting and he slowly walked from the room susan came to see that she was all right cat smiled wanly and patted her arm i am fine thank ye for getting conall i knew if i raised my voice yed hear me susan flushed twas nae me my lady twas may she sleeps light thank god for it now go back to bed child twill soon be morning cat dozed in the darkness until her inner sense told her that dawn was near waking she dressed herself quietly and made her way to the chapel where niall waited the young priest was composed again but had a haggard look about him kneeling cat placed her hands in his and began her confession he listened quietly as she recited a list of small indiscretions and the slightly larger sin of her few hours with henri de navarre the penance he gave her was light and his hand shook slightly as he absolved her touching her bowed head she looked up at him then green eyes twinkling and said and for your sins mon père three aves and three paters niall fitzleslie choked back his laughter catriona you are impossibly irreverent and i thank you i have made a great todo over nothing havent i yes mon père you have there is a world of difference between the thought and the deed merci ma fille she kissed the hand extended to her rose and allowed him to escort her from the chapel lowering his voice he spoke in gaelic the body has not been found yet if you leave quickly you should be gone before it is we are ready now have you eaten no we will do so on the road when they entered the courtyard of the chateau they found david leslie de peyrac awaiting them adèle bid me say her adieu if you left she seemed to feel you might stay though i know not why he kissed her soundly on both cheeks before you go niece will you satisfy my personal curiosity from whom do you run from james stewart she answered him frankly and king henri knows yet gives you safe passage yes uncle the sieur de peyrac chuckled go with god niece and if you should ever need my help you have but to ask though with your powerful friends i doubt youll need me sometimes family is best uncle thank you she replied and kissed him he handed her into the coach and she leaned from the window and said adieu mon père et mon beaufrère niall thank you for everything niall fitzleslie kissed the slim hand extended him adieu ma belle be happy i shall conall forward and the countess of glenkirks entourage rumbled out of the courtyard of chateau petit and onto the main road which led through the forest of fontainebleau and south to the mediterranean coast as soon as they were clear of the castle the coach pulled into a clearing and cat descended a bundle under her arm and disappeared into the thick undergrowth several minutes later she reappeared dressed for riding in her hose and leather jerkin her hair tucked beneath a tam she tossed her clothes to susan and may within the coach as conall rode up leading iolaire swinging easily into the saddle she stretched clamping her knees against the horses sides she kicked him forward im free conall she laughed at last i am free to naples to bothwell i am free part vi my lord bothwell chapter down the plump backside of france they rode through towns and villages that eventually began to blur and hold a sameness nemours briare nevers lyons vienne avignon marseilles and now cat got her first glimpse of a southern sea so different from the cold north it dappled aqua here green there turquoise to the left purple to the right and clear to its sandy or coral bottom they remained several days in marseilles and cat delighted in the city and its waterfront markets with fruits and fish and spices there were french spanish turkish russian moorish english venetian genoese sicilian and even black sailors seeing the ships lining the quaysides she wished that she could sail out into the golfe du lion through the ligurian sea past corsica and sardinia and into the tyrrhenian sea to naples but cat knew well that beyond the safety of marseilles harbor turkish corsairs lurked waiting to pounce upon any poorly guarded ship before they left marseilles the messenger sent to naples by giscard kira joined them to report that though he had delivered the message to the villa where lord bothwell was staying he had not seen bothwell the earl had been away cat became anxious to resume her journey giles de peyrac had said that francis had been stripped of everything but his clothes and his horse if francis was living comfortably he must have a wealthy protector it could of course be a male friend but cat would have wagered her entire new wardrobe that it was a woman it was angela maria di licosa was a contessa by both her marriage to alfredo conte di licosa and her birth as the daughter of scipio conte di cicala her mother maria teresa had been born a muslim in the ottoman empire at fourteen maria teresa had been captured in a raid by christian knights and her captor scipio di cicala had not hesitated in ravishing her but he had fallen deeply in love with his slavegirl and she finding herself pregnant did the intelligent thing she converted to christianity and married her lover in time to legitimatize their eldest son their youngest child was angela she grew to be as beautiful as the angels for whom she was named and as wicked as the devil she worshipped her parentsespecially her gentle motherdespaired of her and as soon as she was old enough they married her to alfredo di licosa twenty years angelas senior she came to her husband a virgin but soon tired of his lovemaking after giving him two sons she began taking lovers alfredo di licosa was a sophisticated man and as long as his wife was discreet he turned a blind eyes to her infidelities after all he had his diversions too besides she was absolutely insatiable and he was no longer a boy even when angela brought her lovers into his house he did not mind provided there was a good covering excuse for their being there proprieties must always be observed francis stewarthepburn had come into the house of alfredo di licosa innocently enough from france he had gone to spain but feeling the hot breath of the inquisition on his neck he had left for naples with his manservant angus he brought with him an introduction from a friend of the spanish king to the conte di licosa who was happy to shelter him that lord bothwell should become the contessas lover was inevitable francis appreciated beautiful women and angela di licosa was indeed a beautiful woman willowslim she had exquisite high coneshaped breasts and a waist a man could span with his hands her skin was milkwhite with no touch of color even in the cheeks her eyes were like a night skydeep and fathomlesswith beautiful winged brows riding high above them her long straight hair was blueblack and hung nearly to her ankles she was a charming woman when she chose to be and she generally chose to be charming with men other women she merely tolerated or ignored she was not particularly well educated though she could write and read a little she had been raised to be an ornament and she was successful in that in the earl of bothwell angela di licosa recognized a man of wit charm education and great sexual appetite and bothwell always desperately seeking to blur the memory of his only love was willing to be angelas lover as long as it amused him he was no saint and he had to live cat had offered him her entire fortune before he left scotland but he had refused to take even a pennypiece from her she had raged angrily at his foolish pride knowing that money could mean safety to him from those for whom he cared only in passing francis would accept money it was his way the thought of him in another womans arms sent cat spurring out of marseilles they raced through toulon following the coastal road to monaco where she spent but one night in an ordinary inn refusing the princes invitation to rest a few days at his palace the party moved on into the state of genoa and through tuscany to rome conall forced her to stop in rome and rest a few days christ woman he roared yer killing my men wi this pace the earl knows yer coming hell be rid of his doxy before ye get mere she was exhausted with deep purple shadows beneath her eyes she slept for two days but on her third evening in rome she told conall we leave in the morning i want to make naples in three days i sent the coaches ahead wi half the men this morning he told her susan and may are wi em i wondered where my women had got to and thought that perhaps some of these darkeyed young men had lured them away conall sniffed not likely theyre my brothers own girls and id nae like to answer to hugh if harm befell them tis a pity ye dinna think so piously when yer happily fucking wi another mans daughter conall she answered him a mischievous light dancing in her eyes he glowered at her do ye think ye can get yerself up and ready to leave by dawn he demanded aye she drawled back and will ye be sleeping alone also conall he burst out laughing gie over lass yeve a wicked tongue in yer pretty head for sure ill be up see that ye are the following morning saw cat and her men on the road to naples by their second evening they had caught up with the lumbering laden coach and baggage wagon they were nearer to naples than they had anticipated the following day cat rode until they were within a few miles of the city stopping then at a small inn to bathe and change clothes the innkeepers wife clucked with disapproval at the dusty longlegged woman who strode into her inn and up the stairs to the best bedroom but a tub of hot water and almost two hours later the innkeepers wife smiled broadly her approval at the exquisitely gowned and coifed woman descending the stairs cat and her women reentered the coach which proceeded into the city and to the house of signor pietro kira it was midafternoon and the banker was away on business his eldest son escorted the countess to her newly purchased home near the village of amalfi south of naples it was the young kira explained fully furnished and staffed according to instructions received from benjamin kira in edinburgh cat gasped at the view through the coach windows the road they traveled was precariously high above the sea which glittered in at least three shades of blue beneath them finally they turned into a small treelined side road through gates with a bronze plaque reading villa del pesce doro within minutes an exquisite house came into view it was unlike anything cat had lived in before the roof was of red tiles the villa itself a pale creamy yellow the white gravel driveway swung around in a circle and up to the house in the center of the circle was a velvety green lawn bordered with flower beds already filled to overflowing with multicolored blooms in the middle of the lawn was a round fountain with a laughing cupid riding a golden fish all the area about the house was planted with flowers of every description ohhhh my lady breathed young may tis the most beautiful thing ive ever seen for once the child doesna blather nonsense agreed susan at home the snowdrops will be but daring to poke their little heads up and here tis already june cat smiled at them both thinking that this was a house for lovers and if he was not already waiting bothwell would soon be here the coach stopped and her grooms let down the steps as the house servants emerged from the villa young signor kira introduced them there was the majordomo paolo and his wife maria the housekeepercook there were two kitchen maids two housemaids and half a dozen gardeners lord bothwell she asked paolo has he arrived yet no one has come madonna cat turned to signor kira your messenger said he delivered my note to lord bothwells villa where is his villa quite near signora contessa she turned to paolo again have one of the gardeners show my captain the way sì madonna conall go the highlander swung back into his saddle tis shameful how anxious ye are he grumbled dinna fret she shot back at him im sure that curranteyed wench yeve been ogling will wait and she laughed at the rude noise he made as he rode off she turned to the young kira you are my guest tonight signor it is too late for you to ride back to the city alone they entered the villa cat was very pleased the main floor boasted a square foyer with a center staircase and three salons a library a family dining room a formal dining room and three kitchens maria spoke as they ascended to the second floor it is a very small house i fear madonna there are only six bedchambers however the third floor is spacious and i have given your women a nice room just above you she waddled down the hallway to a pair of carved doors with lionhead decorations and exquisite goldandporcelain handles flinging open the doors she announced ecco madonna your bedchamber cat walked into a spacious airy room with two long double windows that opened onto small iron balconies over the rear gardens the room looked out to the sea there was a large high bed hung with sheer seagreen silk draperies and a matching coverlet the furniture was a warm wellpolished walnut and the walls were creamcolored with gilt designs near the upper part and on the ceiling heavy silk draperiesalso seagreen hung on either side of the two windows between the windows sheer creamy silk curtains blew in the soft breeze on the cool tile floors were thick sheepskin rugs across from the windows and to the left of the bed was a large fireplace with a carved marble mantelpiece the only other furniture in the room was a large armoire a table and some chairs on the wall opposite the bed and to the right there was a door maria opened it with a flourish your bath signora contessa she said cats eyes widened the walls and floor of the room were a marvellous blue tile and in the center of the floor was a large sunken marble tub shaped like a shell with golden fish ornaments at one end look madonna said maria excitedly she leaned over and twisted one of the three golden fishes on the edge of the tub water flowed into the tub and when you wish to empty it she chortled pulling the center fish up see is it not marvelous the last owner of this house was a turkish merchant they bathe far more than is healthy but no matter how is the water made hot asked cat it is stored in a porcelain barrel which always has a low flame burning beneath it look susan may isnt it wonderful no more lugging barrels of water you can draw me a bath right now lord bothwell will soon be here and while cat swam about her scented tub conall followed the young gardener several miles across the hills to another great villa well hidden within the trees here the gardener stopped and pointed well come on said the scotsman no signor capitano i go no further if she knows that i came to help take her man away she will curse me who conall was puzzled the witch what witch the contessa di licosa it is her house the lord bothwell is her lover conall thought for a moment well the man had to live and yet he had not been at the villa to greet the woman he professed to love conall had assumed that they would meet somewhere on the road between rome and naples then he remembered what the messenger had told them he had not delivered the message directly into lord bothwells hand because the earl had not been at the villa was it possible that the earl had never received the message yes it most certainly was a typical womans trick wait here for me he told the nervous gardener and started his horse up the road he rode unchallenged when he reached the house he found it ablaze with lights dismounting he banged on the door it was opened a few moments later by an imperiouslooking majordomo i wish to see lord bothwell i am sorry he cannot be disturbed who shall i say called i am captain moreleslie man said conall pushing the officious servant aside and i intend disturbing his lordship right now a bothwell to me a bothwell a bothwell from the upper story of the house conall heard the slamming of a door and francis stewarthepburn appeared leaping lightly down the stairs sword drawn walking to conall he peered closely at him conall conall moreleslie aye my

of the stairs there appeared one of the most beautiful women conall had ever seen she glided down the stairs like a cat and purred in a deep voice caro where do you go our guests will soon be arriving why was i not given the message delivered here several weeks ago what message caro but her dark eyes flashed angrily at conall bothwell saw her and laughed you are a very bad liar angela mia i warned you that one day i would turn to you and say goodbye this is that day now with guests coming could you not wait until tomorrow who will be my host you might ask your husband angela francisco she held out her beautiful hands in a pleading fashion i love you he laughed again angela mia you are a marvelous actress there is only one thing in this world that would take me from your side and she is waiting for me now adieu cara mia within minutes they were on the road back to the villa del pesce doro and they never heard the shrieks of outrage made by the beautiful contessa di licosa what is cat doing here shouted lord bothwell over the wind and the pounding of the horses hooves she will tell ye herself my lord conall shouted back the sun was sinking into the western sea when they reached the villa she waited in the doorway and he slid from the saddle before his horse had even stopped everything was suddenly very quiet as they stood stock still looking at each other the servants were frozen silent not daring to move so charged was the very air about them cat his voice caressed her and she swayed cat my precious love how come ye here i am a widow francis patrick is dead god assoil him they moved towards each other angus fetch a priest commanded lord bothwell and then he caught her to him and slowly enfolding her in his arms he found her eagerly waiting mouth he drank in the sweetness of her murmuring softly against her lips surrendering herself completely to the storm tearing at her she clung to him she could hardly stand she could hear her heart pounding within her own ears finally she managed to gasp why a priest his strong arm supporting her he looked down into her upturned face because my darling i intend marrying ye now tonight before kings or families or anyone can come between us ever again oh francis she whispered i hae missed ye so damned much and she began to cry dinna weep my darling yer safe wi me now and this time no one will separate us now love tell me why did jamie relent and let ye come to me he didnt francis i ran jemmie is now the glenkirk and he felt twas the only chance i would have what was between james stewart patrick and us had nothing to do wi jemmie he didna think that jamie would try and revenge himself on the leslies now she drew into the house does our royal cousin know where ye are he was told that i went to france to recover from my widows depression but i imagine hes very angry at me for i was ordered to return to court this spring he even sent to king henri and demanded his aid in arranging my return henri of navarre sends his regards to ye ye met him aye he was most kind he told me how very much he regretted having to send ye away henri was always kind to women chuckled bothwell young or old fair or ugly he has unbelievable charm and the ladies love it but before he could pursue the conversation further cat led him into one of the salons overlooking the sea g about she demanded and who is the owner of the villa in which ye hae be staying the conte di licosa said bothwell smoothly is it his wife or his daughter yeve been sleeping with these long nights my lord francis deepblue eyes twinkled jealous my darling he teased if she ever looks at ye again i will tear her heart out he laughed happily beware my darling the contessa de licosa is reputed to be a witch is she cat was not impressed he chuckled she likes the peasants and the other uneducated masses to think so and she really is quite talented in herbal medicine she enjoys the small power her reputation gives her shes halfturkish as her mother was born in morea and captured by angelas father years ago she has two brothers the older of whom in an odd quirk of fate was himself captured by turks twenty years ago just as his mother once converted to christianity he became a muslim he is now one of the sultans generals is she very beautiful asked cat yes replied bothwell honestly but the peasants call her langela del diavolothe devils angel he moved to take her in his arms cat my love i dinna want to talk of angela my god i canna believe tis ye do ye know how many times i have dreamed of such a reunion knowing it was impossible do ye know how i have longed for ye sure that i would never hold ye in my arms again in this life i have lain alone more nights than not aching for ye gently he traced his finger down a tear streak our bairns well she whispered in a choked little voice safe at glenkirk wi meg jemmie will send them to us when tis safe a few months at most and then we shall be a family at last his arms tightened about her and his mouth brushed against hers i should like to be a bridegroom before i am a father my darling she laughed softly perhaps ye should have thought about that before ye sired three children on me my lord tis siring the fourth one im looking forward to my pet the door to the salon opened on them and a grinning conall entered accompanied by angus and a blackrobed cleric so franciscotis you who summon me in such unruly fashion bishop pasquale when did you get back from rome this afternoon and a good thing i did these two wildmen came roaring into the church demanding a priest they frightened my priests half to death what is your great need of a priest bothwell you dont look to me as if youre dying the earl drew cat forward my lord bishop may i present to you caterina maria leslie the countess of glenkirk we wish to be married no bothwell there have been no banns read waive them my friend the bishop smiled why should i francisco my child he said directing his gaze on cat how well do you know this man he is the father of my three youngest children my lord bishop answered cat we would have been wed six years ago had our king not threatened the cardinal of st andrews with persecution of the church if he dissolved my marriage now i am a widow and though king james seeks to make me his mistress i fled my land to wed with lord bothwell please my lord bishop waive the banns i have been traveling almost two months and have come over a thousand miles my lord and i have been separated three long years marry us tonight how long have you been widowed my daughter asked the bishop my first husband sailed for the new world two years ago this month his ship never reached its destination the bishop looked at the two people standing before him they were certainly not impetuous children but adults obviously in love that in itself was unusual in marriage between people of rank then too the bishop liked lord bothwell and believed that the sooner he was safe from angela di licosa the better that the beauteous woman before him could separate bothwell permanently from angela he had no doubt very well francisco and caterina i will marry you tonight be at the church of santa maria del mare in amalfi within the hour there is a consecrated chapel here in this villa my lord bishop said cat softly very well my daughter here it shall be when give me but time to change my clothing she turned to bothwell and spoke in scots english when i wed wi patrick twas in a dressing gown and i was already in labor wi jemmie all this winter i hae done nothing but prepare brides for their weddings so beloved for you and for me i shall take time to be a bride he took her by the shoulders and kissed her forehead go along my love i shall see the bishop is comfortable bishop pasquale settled himself comfortably and sipped appreciatively at the goblet of sweet palegolden wine that lord bothwell handed him i have always believed that you were born under a lucky star francisco else your head would long ago have parted company from your shoulders your betrothed is a lovely creature so the scots king covets her aye he hides his lust from public view but what he did to heri shall not distress you with unsavory details but before james stewart forced her into his bed by threatening her family she was a good and faithful wife she was called the virtuous countess and that in itself was what first attracted him and when did you become involved with her francisco i knew her at court but not until she was forced to flee from both the king and her husbandwho was shocked and hurt to discover her dilemmadid we become intimate we were friends and she had nowhere else to go what happened between us simply happened i have never known such happiness as i have with her nor have i ever known such agony as without her the bishop nodded my son he said do you know how fortunate you are i know kings who would give anything for what you have cherish it cherish this woman who makes you so happy god has blessed you both greatly at the end of the hour cat reentered the salon with her two tiring women and found only conall awaiting her he was dressedto her amazementin his leslie kilt and full highland regalia where did ye find that man he looked shocked ye dinna think id travel wiout my kilt lassie if id died on the journey what would ye hae buried me in pray however tis in the capacity of yer father that i act now being yer nearest relative here i shall lead ye to yer betrothed offering her his arm he swept her from the room and to the chapel behind them susan and may each in her finest followed the chapel of the villa had been in existence longer than the house it was small and of romanesque design used as a mosque by the villas former owner it had been rededicated to the christian faith on the orders of benjamin kira the jewish banker who knew and admired his clients quiet devotion to the roman faith in a scotland turned protestant when he had been informed that the house purchased for the countess of glenkirk had an ancient chapel kira ordered it refurbished at his own expense this was his gift to the extraordinary woman he had admired since her girlhood and whom he would very likely never see again the chapel was simply furnished with a white marble altar topped by two magnificent heavy gold candlesticks studded with diamonds rubies emeralds and amethysts there was a matching carved gold crucifix the small windows were newly redone in precious stained glass and the vigil lamps were of heavy ruby glass handblown in murano set into holders of filigreed gold and silver the entire chapel glowed softly in the light of at least fifty beeswax tapers as conall led her down the chapel aisle to the altar cat saw her six houseservants and all of her glenkirk men standing witness to the ceremony no one would be able to question the legitimacy of this marriage as her eyes swept past them she saw bothwell waiting for her he like conall was attired in full dress kilt suddenly clearly aware of what was happening she smiled happily at him he smiled back at her his eyes shining approval of her gown the sleeveless lilac silk overdress glowed softly in the candlelight and the slightly darker underskirt with its gold and pearl embroidery shimmered the sleeves of the underdress were of lilac gauze and her rounded arms gleamed seductively through them her honeycolored hair was parted in the center and caught up over her ears in a mass of ringlets that spilled down over the back of her neck and shoulders she wore a misty mauve veil topped by a small crown of sweetsmelling nightblooming white flowers conall solemnly led cat up to lord bothwell and placed her slim hanad firmly into his treat her well man growled conall huskily or yell answer first to me before the young earl has a go at ye she is my life returned bothwell quietly meeting conalls look evenly as the ceremony got underway their joy was so great that neither quite believed it was happening they went through the ceremony in a haze hearing the bishops words vaguely and responding automatically and then it was over they were wed for a moment they stood staring at each other then they began to smile at one another and they could not stop finally the bishop stepped down and put an arm about them it is true my children you are wed do i dare hope there is a bit of wine left with which we may toast this happy occasion cat blushed which the bishop found charming in a woman over thirty bothwell laughed happily and pulling himself together put an arm about his wife and led the way back to the main part of the villa where maria and paolo had rushed ahead to bring up several bottles of wine from the cellars a few of the glenkirk men had brought their bagpipes with them and they began to serenade the newlyweds cat gazed at them intently there was one wedding gift that only her men could give her husband standing before them during a lull in their playing she spoke quietly my mother was born a leslie of sithean and i was wed for eighteen years to the glenkirk tonight ye hae been witnesses to my second marriage to the earlof bothwell we are both exiled from scotland exiled by our king who threatened the leslies with destruction unless i became his mistress what ye hae just witnessed in the chapel of this villa is my answer to king james ye hae protected me loyally and brought me safely to my dear husband now ye must decide what yer futures will be ye may return to your homes at glenkirk and yell hae my blessing or ye may pledge yerselves to the earl of bothwell the choice is yers conall stood the men who came wi ye came because there is nothing to keep them at glenkirk we are happy to pledge ourselves to lord bothwell but on one condition should the leslies or our homeland ever need us we will go he directed his gaze to bothwell we know that ye would go under those circumstances if ye could sir francis nodded i would he said turning to his wife he said simply thank ye love she smiled back at him i will retire now my lord she answered softly she hurried up the stairs to the master bedchamber followed by her women silently the three women removed cats gown and petticoats while susan hung the gown within the armoire and may brought cats basin of warm scented water cat rolled her stockings off naked she took the cloth handed her and washed herself pulling the pins from her hair she fiercely brushed her tawny mass until it gleamed in the candlelight susan slipped a simple long loose gown of palest lilac over her and then the two servants withdrew lord whispered young may in a shocked voice my lady cat is overeager for her husband nay silly puss chided her older and wiser sister she but wanted time alone before he comes what on earth for asked may yed need to be more of a woman to understand that pet puzzled may shook her head cat stood on one of the bedchamber balconies overlooking the moonlit garden she welcomed the soft night air on her skin and smelled the sweetness of the night blooms her mind was whirling this morning she had wakened a widow but now she was a bride awaiting her husband in their nuptial chamber everything had happened so quickly for a moment she was frightened then she heard his voice cat she turned and saw him standing across the room gazing longingly at her he held out his arms and suddenly she was shy she hesitated instantly comprehending her mood he moved quietly across the room and gently enfolded her in his arms his hand slowly caressed her silken hair and a tremor ran through her tis been a long long time my darling he said i feel so foolish she whispered into his shoulder i am behaving like a virgin faced with a stranger instead of a grown woman faced with her beloved and wonderfully familiar husband nay my darling i love yer shyness ye hae always had a charming innocence about ye that i love if ye dinna want to make love we will not i know ye are tired after yer long journey francis kiss me and she raised her head up for a moment he gazed lovingly at the face turned expectantly to him his slender fingers explored it gently touching her cheeks her closed eyelids her nose her mouth her stubborn little chin then he bent his arms circling her waist pressing her against him his mouth tenderly touched hers he had always made love to her with incredible gentleness and that had not changed yet she felt that tonight there lurked beneath the surface of that calm a fierceness that he was fighting to hold in check deep within her a flame of passion flickered and she shuddered the mouth on hers suddenly became more demanding and her arms slid up and around his neck his hands caressed her long back and she moaned softly her body beginning to tremble weakly against his slowly he moved across the room until he felt the bed against the back of his legs they fell to the bed turning quickly he reversed their positions so that she was beneath him smiling down at her he undid the row of tiny ribbons holding her gown together she caught his hands and their eyes met francis i love ye dear heaven how i love ye and i love ye my beautiful precious wife his head dipped low and his mouth found her breast she gave a soft cry and he reassured her only if ye want it sweetheart but i do francis how can i make ye understand how much i want ye for three yearssince that last night we made love in the guest house of deer abbey i have dreamed of being in yer arms again though i dinna believe it could happen i have hungered for the feel of ye the taste of ye other men have possessed me my poor patrick who sought so desperately to regain that which he had lost our cousin james who thought he could command my love and who used me like a common whore i sheathed my body in a protective coating so they should nae destroy me tonight for the first time in three years i feel completely alive francis and if ye dinna make love to me now i shall die i hae always said he answered smiling that slow smile she loved so that ye were the only woman who could keep up wi me for three years i hae tried to forget ye between the legs of any woman who smiled my way i dinna have to forget any longer my sweet cat but i warn ye my darling my hunger is fierce this night the leafgreen eyes regarded him levelly do your worst my lord she challenged and pulling his head down she kissed him slowly tauntingly daring him oh he felt a stab of desire pierce him and forcing her lips apart he ravaged her mouth tenderly his tongue flickered across her taut breasts teasing the nipples into hard little points it moved on sliding between the warm valley of her breasts arid down to her navel she cried out as a burning began and spread through her loins sated momentarily with her sweetness he easily straddled her lowering his head so his mouth might close over a pink and tempting nipple she moaned beneath him struggling to shift him into a closer proximity her rounded hips thrusting upwards hungrily please francis she begged him please now he wanted to prolong the delight but as hungry as she was for him his own desire was even greater his hand caressed the heartshaped face all right love he murmured into her ear and thrust deep within her gaining an almost equal pleasure from both his possession of her and the long shuddering sigh that tore through her she was whole again for the first time in three years lost in that lovely silverygold world between consciousness and unconsciousness she murmured contentedly as his hardness sent wave after wave of pleasure pouring over her and it didnt stop even when the hardness broke flooding her with his seed he pulled her into his arms and kissed her tenderly she said nothing her beautiful eyes saying it for her and he smiled happily sweet cat he whispered my beloved adversary my dearest love tis all right now my darling tis all right we hae come home at last chapter the little church of santa maria del mare was the fashionable house of worship for the noble and wealthy who lived near amalfi on the fourth sunday in april of the year the earl and countess of bothwell attended midday mass as they walked together afterwards from the church cat saw an exquisitely dressed and very beautiful woman standing just ahead instinct and francis slight pressure on her arm told her that this was her husbands castoff mistress before he could speak the familiar deep voice called so francisco this is your new whore the silence in the church piazza was instantaneous as heads turned to view the coming battle cat froze bothwells eyes were blue ice but his voice was steady and honied as he turned to alfredo conte di licosa and said fredo may i present my wife caterina maria the contessa di bothwell bishop pasquale married us five nights ago and a more beauteous and radiant bride i have never seen injected the bishop confirming the earls announcement the conte di licosa bowed over cats extended hand contessa the pleasure is all mine i assure you his dark eyes twinkled the corners of cats mouth turned up for a moment and she murmured a polite response then her leafgreen eyes slowly and coolly raked angela di licosa who stood looking furiously back at her with blazing black eyes finally cat turned away looking up at her husband she drawled clearly really darling shes hardly up to your usual standard angela di licosa stepped angrily forward her hand raised threateningly cat not flinching grasped the hand in her own do it madame and you will spend the rest of your life minus a hand she hissed and while we have this moment together my dear let me warn you to forget francis he will not come back to you she dropped the other womans hand angela rubbed her wrist then why do you warn me because i can see you are that foolish type of woman who will persist because her pride is damaged remember that he left your house at the mere mention of my name we were wed that same night do not embarrass us or your family there is more binding francis and me than you can imagine cat turned her back on the other woman taking her husbands arm she moved away to accept the congratulations and good wishes of the neighboring nobility all of whom were delighted to see the contessa di licosa get her comeuppance alfredo di licosa chuckled well my dear i had never thought i should live to see the day when you were bested be quiet you snake she snarled furiously at him i will kill her no that would be too easy i will make her suffer i will do it slowly painfully she will wish she were dead the conte di licosa smiling at his friends and neighbors hustled his angry wife into their coach you will do nothing angela do you understand me nothing your reputation already has the inquisition looking in your direction let them look she spat back at him they can prove nothing the inquisition does not have to prove anything just a hint of suspicion is enough face the truth my darling francisco amused himself with you as you amused yourself with him it is obvious that the man is deeply in love with his wife let it be i do not want lord bothwell for an enemy and if i must choose between him or you it will be him he at least is trustworthy but angela di licosa could not forget the beautiful cat the contessa di bothwell had to be at least several years older than she was and yet she did not look it nor did she use the heavy cosmetics of the day her skin was flawless with its own lively natural coloring her body was young and firm angela imagined that beautiful face and body scarred ruined would francisco love her then the answer sounded resoundingly in her head yes he would angela had seen how bothwell had looked at his wife he had never looked at angela that way angela had never admitted the painful fact to herself before and the reality outraged her francisco had never looked deeply at her at all during the next few weeks angela di licosas desire for vengeance grew it seemed that every noble family in the area had to give a party for the newlyweds and she and alfredo were always invited refusal was unthinkable the countess of bothwell quickly became a popular figure among the men and the women she was lauded for her beauty her charm her wit lord bothwellalways the roverbarely left his wifes side and the looks of adoration that passed between them became legend it was this very devotion that gave angela her idea for the perfect revenge in these past weeks she had learned that lord bothwell and his bride had been in love for years but had been separated for varied reasons until only recently together at last they were gloriously happy angela di licosa decided to separate thempermanently she had thought of having one of them assassinatedpreferably cat but the finger of suspicion would have pointed directly at her so she discarded that idea too the pain of separation would be greater if they both lived if the beautiful countess of bothwell were forced to submit to another mans attentions and if her husband knew it and were powerless to rescue her the anguish would be unbearable she believed her plan to be foolproof no one was likely to consider her responsible angelas oldest brother had been captured by the turks at the age of eighteen when he had gone off to sea determined to fight the ottoman corsairs who were constantly raiding their coast his turkish mother had told him if you are captured loudly proclaim your nobility tell them that you are the son of ferhad beys daughter fatima of morea who was captured twenty years ago submit to islam as i have to christianity and your fortune will be made he had been captured for to pursue the turk in the mediterranean was foolhardy but he remembered his mothers words and followed her advice he was saved from the marble quarries and entered in the princes school over the years he rose swiftly through the ranks until he had become one of the empires most skilled generals called cicalazade pasha and trusted by his captors he might have escaped back to his homeland but he chose not to go home the best he could hope for in italy was to succeed to his fathers title conte and inherit a moldering castle that grew more expensive to maintain as each year passed he would be married off to the best dowry available and expected to father several sons if he were lucky he would be able to afford one elegant mistress if not he would have to make do with the local peasant women as cicalazade pasha he owned a magnificent palace on the bosporus well staffed by an army of slaves he was married to a granddaughter of suleiman the magnificent and he had recently been appointed a grand vizier to sultan mohammed his wifes cousin he maintained a large harem which catered to his sophisticated and varied sexual tastes cica pashas hobby was beautiful women all through the civilized world his slave merchants were on the lookout for beautiful exotic women to satisfy his appetite beauty and personality attracted him virginity mattered not his harem was stocked with rare beauties and fabled throughout the east angela di licosa gave credit where credit was due the countess of bothwell was an unusually beautiful woman and angela was quite sure that her rapacious brother would welcome the exquisite addition to his bed there would be no problem in transporting her victim either for a turkish fleet lurked off the coast angela knew one of its captains he was called khairaddin after the famed admiral of the time of suleiman the magnificent one of his duties was to carry messages between cicalazade pasha and his italian family angela could get in touch with him easily she would learn how soon he planned to sail home several days later a peasant woman sat drinking wine with a sailor in a neapolitan waterfront cafe you tell khairaddin that i dont care how dangerous he thinks it is i must meet with him personally there is a small crescentshaped beach two miles to the southeast of amalfi i will be there tomorrow night an hour after sunset the signal will be two lanterns burning on the beach the woman got up and hobbled out the sailor finished his mug cursing softly under his breath he slapped some coins down on the table and left the cafe the following night a boat rowed by six sweating black slaves slid onto the sand of that beach an enormous man dressed in brightred pantaloons and a redandblackstriped shirt his large waist wrapped with a gold cloth sash from which protruded both a jeweled dagger and a scimitar heaved himself out and walked up onto the beach he had small feet for such a large man and they wore elegant gold leather boots with red tassels a heavily masked and cloaked woman stepped from the shadows i am the contessa di licosa she said take off the mask so i may see with whom i speak said khairaddin gruffly and when she did he nodded you look nothing like your brother well little girl what can i do for you i want you to take a gift to my brother you got me off my ship to tell me you want me to carry some damned trinket to my lord cicalazade women pah this is a very special gift captain it is a woman for my brothers harem she is a prize beyond compare a noblewoman of beauty breeding and charm bring her safely to my brother i will reward you in gold and i am sure you will gain great favor with my brother who is this woman contessa her identity is not your concern but her villa is on the other side of this point you probably know the house well for it once belonged to abdul mehmet the merchant in a few days this womans husband will be called away if you attack the house at dawn in his absence you will meet no resistance there are only six houseservants five of whom are women i assume she also has a body servant i dont care what happens to the servants but treat this woman gently i want her delivered safely to my brother khairaddin looked sharply at angela di licosa why do you do this signora la contessa it is not like you to seek slaves for your brother is this a plot between you and the womans husband to rid him of her angelas face reflected hate so virulent that khairaddin stepped back in surprise i hate them both she hissed tis my vengeance on them he will die a thousand times knowing that she is a slave and that he is powerless to do anything about it what if the woman dies not her laughed the contessa di licosa cruelly she will survive hoping to return to her beloved francisco but that will never happen khairaddin considered a moment even if the woman were a gift from cicalazade pashas sister he too would gain a certain measure of favor by conveying her safely to her new master how will i know when it is safe to kidnap the woman watch the skies off this beach in the hours before and after midnight for the next few nights a red rocket will be the signal that you may attack the following dawn she held out a bag to him a small token of my gratitude captain feeling the weight of the bag he smiled broadly signora la contessa it is a pleasure to do business with you is there any other message you wish to send your brother she handed him a sealed packet and without another word turned and disappeared back into the shadows khairaddin made a small grimace and turning walked back down the beach to his boat she was a cruel one was the contessa di licosa he wondered what her poor victim had done as his boat bobbed back over the waves to his ship he thought that perhaps he should clear out the cabin next to bis it was a decent size and could be made comfortable for a woman and her servant he had decided that he would instruct his men to bring along the ladys woman to serve her it had been his experience in dealing with women captives that those who had a friend did better than those who were all alone if this poor woman did not reach the grand vizier in good condition then he would be blamed safely back aboard his ship he called his officers together and told them of the planned raid on the villa del pesce doro other than the noblewoman and her servant take no captives were not a stinking slave carrier treat them gently or by allah ill castrate the lot of you no rape the woman is for cicalazades pleasure and his pleasure only what about the servantgirl asked the first officer well perhaps when were safely under sail but waste no time at the villa you cant expect the men to pass up a group of young girls captain they rarely get ashore on this type of duty all right all right chuckled khairaddin indulgently let the men who go with you have the servant girls but bring me the lady and her personal servant untouched about two dozen men should do it said the first officer now all we need do is sit and wait for the next few days chapter cat sat crosslegged in the center of a very tumbled bed watching her husband dress she was naked and rosy from their recent lovemaking and her pretty mouth pouted why cant i come wi ye francis because my beautiful bride he smiled at her tis nae a social call i am making the duke of avellino wants us to clean out the bandits that have recently been infesting his district ive gone on border raids wi ye she protested aye he smiled again his eyes misting at the memory ye were the most fetching borderer i ever knew wi

and despite the fact ye are a rich woman i feel better earning my living wi our men we should nae be gone more than two weeks why dont ye write to jemmie and see if he can arrange to send the children i think tis time our bairns met their father she smiled teasingly at him will ye miss me bothwell and she stood up stretched and slunk provocatively across the room he gently smacked her pretty bottom dinna wiggle yerself at me wenchtis hard enough to have to leave ye after less than two months he bent bis head and found her eager mouth oh cat sweet cat he murmured between hungry kisses then damn yeve done it again i never knew a woman who could rouse me so she laughed low and wriggled out of his grasp go play at war my randy lord he looked at her ruefully put some clothes on nymph and bid me and our men a proper goodbye she arrived in the foyer of the villa in time to hear conall say i still think we should leave some men here to guard the villa guard us from what demanded cat my god i never knew such a peaceful place i dont know said bothwell thoughtfully conall could be right there are always pirates lurking off the coast there is nothing of value here to attract pirates dinna be foolish ye need every man yeve got the two men looked at each other and shrugged cat was right they joined their men who were mounted and waiting conall climbed into his saddle and moved to the front of the group but bothwell stood for a moment facing his wife his elegant hands on her shoulders i wish ye could come wi me my darling he said but it should nae take us long to wipe out the nest of mangy beggars that disturbs avellinos peace thank ye for gieing me yer glenkirk men for my own christ to be useful again he crushed her to him i love ye catriona stewarthepburn and he kissed her passionately his mouth bruising hers with a sweetness that sent desire racing through her her lips were petalsoft and warm beneath his he began to wish the duke of avellinos bandits safe in hell are ye for avellino or are ye for bed my lord earl demanded conalls scathing voice bothwell reluctantly moved away from his wife if that man were nae the best captain in christendom i would cheerfully strangle him he said through gritted teeth as he mounted his own stallion cat laughed softly putting a hand on her husbands leg she smiled up at him i love ye francis come home safe to me she turned to conall take care of him always be at his back aye aye said the captain impatiently then they were off down the driveway the dust swirling around and behind them she stood before the villa until they had all disappeared then running inside she called to paolo sì signora la contessa what engagements do we have planned for the week only a dinner party on saturday evening at the conte di licosas villa she sighed with relief cancel it paolo with lord bothwell away i have the perfect excuse to avoid that wretched woman paolo smiled he liked the contessa di licosa no more than his mistress did she was an evil woman the following day he did as his mistress had ordered and sent word to the di licosa villa that the countess of bothwell could not attend the fete due to her husbands absence angela di licosa laughed happily the timing was unbelievable and her own alibi was now unchallengeable it would be so easy to slip away from her party to signal khairaddin better yet she could send her servant to make the signal a roomful of people would attest to her constant presence and as the villa del pesce doros gardeners would not be at work on sunday the pirates raid would go unnoticed for a full day by that time the countess of bothwell would be well on her way to cicalazades harem angelas laughter reverberated wildly through the house hearing it the servants crossed themselves and murmured among themselves when langela del diavolo laughs beware and that evening at her fete the contessa di licosa was more charming more delightful than ever before the party was such a success that it did not end until close to dawn when the last of the guests stumbled happily drunk to their beds across the misty hills at the villa del pesce doro a scream tore through the clear dawn cat sat straight up in bed wide awake listening hearing another shriek and the sound of running feet she leaped from her bed and ran to the window the sight before her momentarily froze her with terror the garden was swarming with men in baggy pantaloons and it did not take more than a second to realize that they were under attack by turkish pirates maria the cook and her two little kitchen maids lay upon the ground being raped surrounded by men who were waiting their turns the two housemaids were fleeing from some four or five men across the garden paolo lay in the kitchen garden near a basket of freshly cut herbs his head bashed to a bloody pulp christ hae mercy whispered susans voice next to her and then cat heard little may weeping with fright get into the linen chest you two she commanded them theyll nae touch me ill be ransomed hurry susan was already opening the chest quickly pulling out an armful of sheets she helped may to snuggle down stay there until yer absolutely sure theyre gone lass then go quickly to carlo the gardeners home and remain hidden till his lordship returns but susan protested the girl ye must hide wi me i must stay by my lady cat lassie susan gently covered her younger sister with the linens and closed the chest firmly down cat looked at her tiring woman theyll rape ye susan i wie nae be able to stop them susan looked levelly back at her mistress im nae a virgin my lady but may is and it would surely kill her besides yell need me there was no more time for talk the bedroom door splintered under a strong shoulder and burst open revealing close to a dozen men unable to control their terror the two women screamed clinging to each other in fright a huge figure of a man came through the door he examined them briefly then said to cat in guttural italian what is your name little girl i am the contessa di bothwell said cat amazed to find that she still had a voice and the other my tiring woman susan she answered him beginning to shake dont be frightened little girl said the giant i am captain khairaddin of sultan mohammeds imperial navy i have orders to transport you to the harem of our grand vizier cicalazade pasha neither i nor my men will harm you cats eyes grew wide with a mixture of fury and fear no she shouted it was too much three years separation from francis a wild flight from scotland and james stewart then at lasthappiness now it was to be snatched away from her nooooo she screamed no noooooo and as the giant stepped forward to reach for her she paled and collapsed onto the rugs khairaddin nodded to one of his men who picked cat up carefully and started out the doorway with her susan needed no encouragement to follow but her own heart almost stopped when one of the men asked the captain in italian shall we fire the house khairaddin snorted and let the entire district know were here he snapped no fool as they crossed the garden susan was glad that cat had fainted the women servants lay naked their throats cut their limbs twisted grotesquely three of the maids had the bloody stain of their lost virginity on their bruised thighs and susan silently thanked god that may had not had to suffer this cruelty that her turn was coming she had no doubt she was afraid for she had lied to cat and was as virgin as the day she was born as they helped her into the little boat that would take them to the great ship anchored off their beach the mens hands were all over her they laughed as she angrily slapped them away they spoke their ribald comments in italian so she would understand them susan gritted her teeth and reminded herself that she was susan moreleslie of glenkirk and not to be terrorized by a bunch of ragtag foreigners her fears lessened somewhat when she and cat were put into a comfortable cabin the sailor who had carried cat lay her carefully upon the bunk and left the room the lock turned in the door looking around susan found a pitcher of water a silver ewer and a soft linen cloth susan poured some of the water into the basin wrung the cloth out in it and lay the compress upon her mistress head she rubbed the slender wrists peering worriedly into cats still white face the door behind her opened and khairaddin entered the cabin how is the little girl he asked kindly still unconscious and no thanks to you snapped susan you frightened her half to death telling her she was being put in a harem whatever the ransom for us lord bothwell will pay it there is no ransom i have orders to convey this woman to the harem of our grand vizier cicalazade pasha she is a gift to h from his sister susan looked puzzled his sister who is this sister and what right has she to give my mistress to her brother my mistress is a freebom noblewoman and a cousin to the king of scotland the viziers sister is the contessa di licosa said khairaddin susan was astounded that bitch by god ill kill her myself when i get my hands on her the jealous whore a great rumble of laughter burst from khairaddin my very thoughts on the woman little girl but tell me why does she hate your lady so because said susan angrily the contessa di licosa covets my ladys husband and he will have nothing to do with the witch the captain nodded sensing sympathy susan said quickly oh please sir my lord and lady are rich beyond measure return us and they will reward ye a hundred times more than ye ask i wish i could little girl for i do not like being part of a womans war but alas i cannot the man to whom i take your mistress stands high in the sultans favor if he learned that i had disobeyed his sisterand he would i should be flayed alive i am truly sorry little girl you and your beautiful mistress must accept your fates it will not be so bad cicalazade pasha is good to his women susan was desperate she could hear the creak of the ship as it prepared to get under way oh sir you do not understand my lady and her husband are but newly married after many years of separation she will surely die without him and when he finds her gone he will tear the earth apart to get her back that is not my problem little girl i must get you safely to istanbul your mistress will not die for i can see she is of stronger stuff than that look at her now she is no longer unconscious but merely sleeps susan knelt at cats side and saw that the captain spoke the truth cats breathing was regular and even and the color was back in her cheeks thank god breathed susan khairaddin left the cabin locking it behind him susan sat by the sleeping woman all day cat did not awaken and susan knew it was because she was still in shock that evening khairaddin returned to the cabin and his large hand fell on susans shoulder now little girl the time has come for you to entertain my officers susan stood up her face white with fright please she pleaded with khairaddin i might have let you be taken by my crew in the same way as those girls at the villa were taken he said quietly but because you are her servant i saved you for my officers they will not hurt you little girl there are only three of them opening the cabin door leading to the officers common room he gently but firmly pushed her through and closed the door behind her susan stood frozen praying that if she didnt move the men would not notice her the three sat across the room around a low table drinking coffee and talking then one looked up and called why heres the wench come here girl she shrank back against the door her heart hammering wildly as the man stood up and came towards her he was tall and swarthy with dark hair and eyes even white teeth and a wellbarbered black beard he pulled her away from the door and into the light susan cried out and the mans eyes softened dont be shy girl we want to be friendsdont we lads the two other men grinned at susan and she shivered my name is hussein and i am khairaddins first officer the fellow with the bushy beard is abdul the second officer and the beardless youth is ibrahim our navigator here you two savages he berated his companions give the wench some coffee she looks cold and frightened sitting back on the cushions he pulled susan down onto his lap ripping the front of her nightgown to the hem he began fondling her breasts hussein laughed indulgently when she screamed come on little girl dont be foolish you know why youre here whether you cooperate or not the results will be the same youre going to be fucked it wont be so bad you could be one of those poor creatures back at the villa who serviced the crew we wont hurt you we just want a bit of loving the tears spilled down her cheeks please she sobbed oh please dont i am so afraid iiive never by allah said hussein i think weve got us a virgin he tipped her face up to his are you a virgin little girl wordlessly she nodded get the dice ibrahim commanded the first officer we always dice to see who has the first taste when we have a virgin he explained matteroffactly to susan stand still girl she obeyed terrified he towered above her for a moment and then bent and tore the rest of her garment from her the thin material of her nightgown shredding as she fought to hold onto it he laughed at her efforts and patted her bottom outraged she rallied and slapped at him then gasped with shock as he squeezed one of her breasts there she is gentlemen and as pretty a piece as ive seen in a long time clean sweet as honey with breasts like summer melons for a moment the three men gazed hungrily at the girl then abdul growled come on make your toss im so hard already you could break it off smiling hussein handed the dice to the young navigator go on ibrahim you first ibrahims toss netted him a three and he laughed goodnaturedly i always end up last abdul snatched up the dice and chuckled as an eight showed he eyed the naked girl licking his lips in open anticipation youll have to go some to beat that hussein he gloated but the first officer coolly took up the dice and after rolling them around in his palm for a moment suddenly threw them across the table allah curse you muttered abdul as nine came up hussein laughed ibrahim snatching up the dice said to the angry second officer come on abdul we might as well continue dicing while lucky hussein has his turn with the girl pushing susan down onto the cushions hussein straddled his terrified prize hungrily he kissed her his tongue thrusting into her mouth darting about like wildfire rousing emotions in the unwilling virgin that she had never known she could feel his hands seemed everywhere feeling eagerly touching gently squeezing cruelly then his hand was between her legs seeking to ascertain the truth of virginityhe grunted satisfaction to find her intact struggling wildly she tried to fight him off and he laughed i like spirit wench but youll not win she felt his manhood hard and seeking against her thighs and she tried to turn her body away to her shame the other two men were kneeling at her side encouraging hussein and offering advice is the little virgin too much woman for you hussein mocked abdul get off her man ill show you how to put it in right can we hold her down for you teased ibrahim ill take the fight out of her when its my turn shell have no fight left after a real mans had her boy bragged abdul at that point susan felt a burning pain spread through her loins and she screamed with it but as hussein moved quickly back and forth within her the pain lessened and her screams died to a wailing moan to her everlasting shame she could not control her own hips and they moved in time with husseins the man atop her suddenly convulsed and collapsed on her he was quickly polled off above her the bushy bearded abdul loosened his baggy pantaloons and fell on her she tried to buck mm off but he slapped her cruelly and her teeth cut her lower lip drawing blood he was in her quickly but to the amusement of his companion was as quickly drained of his passion the boy was immediately in his place groaning and straining above her unable to bear any more susan fainted but when she had regained consciousness she found that her ordeal was not over she was forced to submit to each of them again finally they let her sleep but again in the morning she was forced to service each of them by this time however her shame had eased and she demanded they bring her water for washing the dried blood and semen from her thighs laughing and patting various parts of her anatomy they brought her a small wooden tub and a rough towel and somewhere hussein found a sliver of soap which he offered her grinning clean and wrapped in a towel she demanded of him and what am i to wear you who were so quick to tear my only garment theres a trunk in your cabin youll find suitable garments in it for both you and your mistress then he patted her cheek youre a good little wench he said kindly i hope we didnt hurt you too greatly last night no she whispered blushing furiously and fleeing back to the cabin next door she allowed herself the luxury of a few tears she found the trunk and opening it saw that it contained all manner of indecentlooking garments she lifted out sheer silk pantaloons gauze blouses brocaded boleros seethrough little veils and soft kid slippers are ye all right the question made her jump and she turned to see cat sitting up in the bunk aye my lady were ye raped susans head drooped and she sank down beside her mistress aye she whispered why did ye lie to me lass ye were a virgin werent ye susan nodded then said simply i couldnt leave ye alone my lady i thought yed need me it wasnt too terrible just the officers and there were only three of themone just a boy cat put a protective arm about her servant oh susan i am so sorry my dear i would nae have had this happen to ye for all the world i was no help to ye at all fainting like a green girl what has happened where are we and who are they everyone at the villa is dead except may once they had us they did not search further thank god they are turkish corsairs and have orders to convey us to istanbul ye are to be a gift to the grand vizier cicalazade pashafrom his sister the contessa di licosa what cats face was incredulous tis absurd she carina do such a thing then my god she has i hope francis strangles her if her brother is anything like angela khairaddin tells me that the vizier is very important there will be no ransom and no escape cat closed her eyes for a moment then said we must not panic yesterday i gave in to fear but i will not allow it to conquer me again i must survive to revenge myself on angela di licosa i must survive to return to francis dinna be afraid my faithful susan the leafgreen eyes twinkled for a moment ye did tell me ye wanted to travel did ye not lass what stories yell have to tell yer grandchildren susan couldnt help but laugh and cat was relieved the young woman was indeed made of strong fiber well why not she was a leslie get dressed my girl and pick something out for me too my god the garments are thin enough arent they oh susanone thing confide in no one but me trust no one but me together we shall outwit the turk and i for one shall enjoy it happy to see that she had cheered susan cat wondered silently to herself if there would ever come a time again when her life was quiet and orderly then forcing herself to the humor in her predicament she laughed and said oh well i should probably be very bored with an orderly existence part vii the vizier chapter even the fates seemed to be conspiring to whisk her quickly to her destination the ship sped down the tyrrhenian sea through the straits of messina and into the mediterranean towards crete where they stopped to take onwater and fresh food a small shiver ruffled cats outward calm as she gazed at the shoreline and realized that she was following in her greatgrandmothers footsteps for the first time the fairy story of janet leslies life became real to her greatgranddaughter and cat was afraid she wondered if the thirteenyearold janet had been afraid at least i wont be exhibited naked on the slave block she thought with relief if you please the grand vizier you wont a small nagging voice whispered in her head but what if he does not like you how can you possibly compete with young girls you are over thirty why do you frown so little girl inquired khairaddin who had taken to playing chess with her in the evenings are you finally ready to admit that i am a better chess player than a mere woman forced from her nightmare cat laughed no you old sea trout i am not then her lovely face became serious again tell me he said share your troubles with me and perhaps i can ease them i am afraid khairaddin i am no nubile virgin to be offered to the grand vizier i am a grown woman with children i have been married twice what can i possibly offer cicalazade pasha he will laugh at his sisters gift and sell me in some slave market the fat man sitting opposite her looked back at her with sympathy little girl he said patiently have you looked in a mirror lately there is not a man alive who given his choice between you and some poor virgin would choose the virgin and neither would cicalazade pasha his harem is quite famous the vizier prefers beauty charm and wit to innocence let the sultan amuse himself with a weekly procession of virginsnot so with my lord cicalazade and another thing my beauty if my lord cicalazade desires to sell you off i will buy you myself and his laughter rumbled throughout the cabin i have as much chance of that as i do of being pope he wheezed chuckling happily the ship sailed on into the aegean sea skirting the small greek islands when the ship slipped through the dardanelles and into the sea of marmara cat felt a wrench of real loss knowing that she now had truly left her world already the turkish clothing she wore felt familiar and comfortable and she could not help but wonder what cicalazade pasha was like perhaps when she explained the situation to him he would accept a ransom for her and allow her and susan to return home his reputation belied that of a man so desperate for a woman that he would hold one against her will cat comforted herself with that thought he sounded almost civilized they reached istanbul in late afternoon when the sun was spreading its light across the golden horn giving the newcomers an understanding of the famed waterways name khairaddin sent a messenger immediately to the palace of the grand vizier and within an hour a closed litter and a troup of armed guards appeared at the ship to take them away it is unlikely i will ever see you again little girl said khairaddin to cat may allah guide youeven if you are a better chess player than i am the tears sprang to her eyes impulsively she kissed ms cheek he patted her shoulder and led her onto the deck where he turned her and susan over to a black eunuch i suppose captain said the eunuch pettishly to khairaddin that they do not understand turkish which of the barbaric western tongues must i use cat stamped her foot angrily and speaking in flawless turkish berated the eunuch toad uncircumcised spawn of pigs offal how dare you speak to me in such a fashion in my land i am a great lady i will not be shown disrespect by such as you the eunuch almost fainted and khairaddin bit back his laughter the noble lady speaks the truth osman though she be here against her will she is a special gift from cicalazades sister she and her servant are to be treated gently osman eyed cat warily here was trouble his judgment of women slaves was always infallible and this one would be trouble how is it noble lady that you speak our tongue does your servant also i learned many languages as a child replied cat and yours was one of them my servant is just learning but has a good ear the eunuch nodded it is always easier when they understand yom he observed to khalradbin as if cat wasnt there very well noble lady he said turning back to her if you and your woman will follow me to the litter he looked at them are your veils tight ah yes i can see that they are and before she could say another word she and susan were hustled off the ship she barely had time to turn and raise her hand in a gesture of farewell to khairaddin the curtains were pulled tightly shut and she felt a little jolt as the slaves raised the litter and trotted off she and susan looked at each other in wonder where were they going they would have given anything to peek through the hangings but when they ventured a peep out osman squeaked with outrage the litter moved at an even pace through the noise breeze and sea smell of the waterfront to the noise heat and human smells of the city and then to the cooler quieter area near the yeni serai of the sultan here along the shores of the bosporus near the imperial palace was located the smaller palace of the grand vizier safe within its courtyard the litter stopped and was set down and the curtains opened please to step out noble lady said osman and they climbed from the litter your servant will be taken to your quarters noble lady you are to come with me to haramid the grand eunuch and susan found herself being led off by a black slavewoman cat followed osman into the palace through what seemed a maze of corridors and finally through a large carved door into a square room sitting on a pile of cushions was a short but enormous coalblack man dressed in red and blue silk robes upon his head was a clothofsilver turban with a large center ruby make obeisance to the grand eunuch hissed osman frantically falling to his knees and bowing low insect she whispered fiercely at him i am a kings cousin i kneel to no one but god and my lord rich laughter rumbled forth from the great mountain of flesh well said woman my lord cicalazade likes spiritprovided it is tempered with wisdom the voice was high and seemed strange in so large a man osman wait outside and as osman left the head eunuch turned to cat i am hammid master of the viziers household what is your name my beauty drawing herself up proudly she said i am the lady catriona stewarthepburn the countess of bothwell i am a cousin to his majesty king james of scotland who will on the death of queen elizabeth also be king of england i am here against my will having been kidnapped with my servant from my home by your masters sister she covets my husband and he refused her she thinks to revenge herself on us by sending me here if you will but send word to my husband lord bothwell he will pay your master double whatever ransom he wishes there will be a rich reward for you also the vizier is not in the habit of collecting ransoms woman you were not sent here for that purpose as you are well aware if the viziers sister wished to extort monies from you she would have done so she wished you removed from your husband and saw a chance to do her brother a good turn at the same time he watched her from beneath hooded lids to see the effect his words would have on her this was his way of judging her worth he would have been very disappointed had she not showed spirit i am a married woman said cat i will not submit to your master i would sooner be dead the eunuchs laughter again rumbled across the room nonsense he said you are life itself do not make idle threats i have dealt too long with your sex to know when they are serious about suicide he saw the glint of tears in her eyes but she shed not a one and he was pleased that she showed courage in this difficult situation do not be afraid woman you are not to be delivered shrieking to my master you will need a few days of rest to recover from your ordeal and to observe our ways come closer now so i may see you better she slowly moved forward until she was standing directly in front of him disrobe for me woman no she looked startled at his request even mutinous hammid sighed i do not wish to embarrass you woman but if you do not obey me i shall simply call in osman and he will do it for me for a moment she stood rigid with anger determined to make it difficult for him then realizing the futility of her situation she shrugged and slowly pulled the veil from her face and then from her head next she removed the satin brocade bolero her fingers trembled as she undid the tiny pearl buttons on the gauze blouse and took it off lastly she kicked the kid slippers from her feet and stepped from the silk pantaloons put your hands up behind your head woman and when she obeyed he murmured superb at her beautiful rounded breasts with their darkrose nipples loosen your hair and turn for me the tawny honeycolored hair tumbled almost to her waist he smiled when my master sees you woman he will be lost you are a delight to the eye now dress yourself again and osman will take you to your quarters where your body servant waits are you hungry she nodded i will give orders that you be served a supper immediately afterwards you will have a bath a massage and a good nights sleep you will be a new woman in three days time i will take you into the city myself for there is something i wish you to see he clapped ms hands and osman reappeared to lead her out hammid sat motionless for a moment after they left and then said well master i think your sister has unknowingly done you a great kindness what do you think of the woman a tall man stepped from behind a carved screen behind the grand eunuch she is magnificent allah hammid i am eager to have her already my loins burn to have her beneath me helpless and halffainting with my love gently my lord she will be yours i promise you but first i must win her over and gain her trust this is a prize worth waiting for my lord but will she yield my friend i see a stubborn streak in her that will be hard to break hammid smiled she will yield my lord did you note the lushness of her body it is the body of a woman used to almost daily lovemaking it has been several weeks since she was captured and kapitan khairaddin assures me that she was untouched during the voyage though her mind will not admit to it her body already grows eager for a mans touch we will make her world one of sensuous delights until her sexual hunger far outweighs her desire to withstand us a week two at the most my lord cica and she will be yours cicalazade pashas white teeth flashed in a smile what shall we call her incili replied hammid incilithe pearlyes i like it hammid and while they continued to talk cat followed osman again through the maze of corridors realizing suddenly that they had crossed some invisible line and were in the harem section of the palace there were women everywhere women of all races and colors women of privilege and servants cat was able to hear some of their comments but managed to keep her face impassive allah what a beauty i wonder if the brain matches the face they seldom do feriyke lateef a sultan will certainly have her royal nose put out of joint by this one isnt that too bad then there was laughter and then she was being led into a pleasant airy room and susan was there mistress and tiring woman fell happily into each others arms i was so worried said susan can we be ransomed no said cat we will have to think of something else however i am safe from the vizier for the present osman unable to understand them demanded what language is it you speak woman speak turkish or if your slavegirl is not facile enough to converse with you speak french or italian so i may understand you cat laughed at him we speak gaelic the tongue of our ancestors but if it discomfits you we will speak turkish osman looked uncomfortable the slaves will bring you supper noble lady afterwards the grand eunuch has given orders that you be taken to the baths i will return in the morning to see you they were brought a large bowl of lamb chunks in a sauce of onions and peppers two small loaves of hot flat bread a dish of yogurt half a dozen ripe peaches and a little bowl of sugared almonds a decanter of lemon sherbet was provided for drink the slavegirl who served them brought two bowls and two goblets but there were no implements for eating when cat asked why she was told that new captives were never given anything that might aid them in suicide they would have to use their fingers and the flat bread which had been provided they ate ravenously as they had not eaten since midmorning and were surprised to discover how good it all was when they had finished the slavegirl brought them a bowl of perfumed water and towels then an old slavewoman arrived to escort them to the harem baths susan was expected to fend for herself but cat was put into the capable hands of the bath mistress who first saw that she was thoroughly washed including her hair next a palepink paste was carefully smeared over the haired areas of her body and when it was wiped away a halfhour later she was completely denuded of body hair while she waited for the pink paste to do its work her fingernails and toenails were carefully pared it would have been unthinkable for her lord and master to be scratched she was exposed to a steam room and then to a more temperate bath where she was stretched out on a marble bench and massaged cat was so relaxed and weak by this time that she could barely walk back to their quarters where she immediately fell into a deep peaceful sleep the next three days were spent quietly with osman coming each morning to escort them heavily veiled on their walk through the viziers gardens each afternoon she was escorted to the baths where she was bathed and massaged with oils and creams until her skin began to be extremely sensitive to the touch of nearly anything in the evening she was allowed to watch certain of the harem entertainments usually dancing cat was at first astounded and then intrigued by the open sexual suggestions made by the dancers movements as boredom began to set in on the fourth day osman arrived with the information that she must put on her outdoor clothing and veil and follow him your slavegirl will remain here its all right cat told a protesting susan she was led to a large litter and once inside was surprised to find herself sitting opposite hammid good morning he said cheerfully i see these three days of rest and relaxation have done you good i did not think it possible that you could be lovelier but you are i was beginning to get bored i am not used to inactivity is this all your women do sit around waiting to be summoned to their masters bed how awful she stopped a moment to catch her breath and then asked where are we going to the slave market you are a woman of great determination i will show you what will happen if you oppose my master his bedchamber must be like a beautiful gardenpeaceful fragrant and a delight to the senses if you do not yield to him but fight instead he will order you sold off if this happens you and your servant will undoubtedly be separated and it is very possible that your exquisite fairness will attract a slave broker from the arabian peninsula or the african interior i do not think you would enjoy being stripped naked and inspected by prospective buyers i do not think you would enjoy being sold to a jungle chief if you yield to my master however your safety and comfort are assured the choice is yours the look she gave him was a candid one why do you torture me hammid you know that i must yield to your master he nodded you are an intelligent woman my beauty but if you yield only your body to my lord cica he will know and be offended you must yield allyour mind and your body i cannot and you cannot expect me to hammid you must they rode in silence until finally the slaves stopped and the litter was lowered to the ground the grand eunuch climbed out and offering her a hand helped her out there are many slave markets in this city he said but this one deals only in beautiful women cat looked about her and saw women of varied ages sizes shapes and colors on the raised platform a beautiful girl was now being auctioned she was completely nude and the prospective buyers were not shy about poking and squeezing the girl her face revealed shame and fright cat shivered finally the girl was purchased by a man with a fierce mustache cat was forced to stand quietly watching for almost an hour then hammid got involved in the bidding on an exquisite goldenblond circassian girl of about thirteen when he had secured her purchase cat heard him tell the slave merchant send the maiden to the yeni serai with the vizier cicalazade pashas compliments then he and cat returned to their litter as they rode cat said quietly i will try hammid but i promise you nothing it will not be easy for me he smiled good i have not misjudged your character do not be afraid my beauty i will give you time to accept your status you will be happy i promise you the vizier is a magnificent lover and he will pleasure you as no man ever has he is like a young bullhot and inexhaustible cat lowered her head as a flush swept her cheeks it had been weeks now since she had last lain with francis and she was frankly edgy but she would have died rather than allow hammid to know this the eunuch knew her thought and smiled i have decided upon your turkish name he told her you will answer to the name of incili it means beautiful pearl and you are that indeed we will call your servant mara the next few days were quiet ones though she was permitted to mingle with the other women of the harem she felt no particular urge to make friends she was frankly curious about lateefa sultan the viziers wife but she never saw her when she had been in the harem for over two weeks she returned from the baths one afternoon to find the grand eunuch hammid waiting for her i am going to present you to the vizier tonight he said stricken she implored him so soon the time is propitious he told her come now incili you are no virgin but a woman of experience does your lovely body not ache for a mans touch do you not crave a mans hardness deep within you how long now has it been since you last lay swooning in a lovers arms stop she whispered oh please stop i have left special clothing for you i will come for you at eight at eight she stood shivering in the hot summer night waiting for hammid her garments were the sheerest of palepinkmauve silk gauze the pantaloons were embroidered at the ankles with a band of goldandsilver thread and a matching band rode her hips below her navel a tiny sleeveless open bolero its edges embroidered in seed pearls barely covered her breasts she was of course veiled a second longer veil had been placed over the first hammid arrived with a small litter and walked alongside it as it was carried towards the viziers bedchamber i will go in with you tonight do not be afraid incili my lord cica will be kind then they were there his hand was at her elbow as he guided her through the door i have brought the woman incili as my lord commanded the eunuch said to a tall man in the shadows hammid then removed the head veil the face veil and the bolero as her breasts were exposed cat heard a soft intake of breath from the man the eunuchs hands were swiftly drawing the pantaloons down and off she was completely naked thank you hammid you may go now as the door closed behind her she stood frozen frightened wondering what to expect then the man stepped from the shadows and cat saw before her the handsomest man she had ever seen in her entire life he was tall and ruggedly tan but where his white pantaloons rode low on his slim hips she could see his skin was as fair as hers his hair was dark wavy and cropped short with just a touch of silver at the temples his eyes were to her surprise a light grayblue he was nothing at all like his sister angela his facial features were those of a classic greek statue with high cheekbones straight nose wellspaced eyes and a full sensuous mouth he wore a beautifully clipped and tailored dark mustache he held out his hand his eyes locking hers automatically she placed her slender hand in his his touch was like fire i have never possessed anything as exquisite as you incili the voice was warm velvet you do not possess me yet my lord cicalazade she answered coolly the white even teeth flashed in a quick smile and he laughed it is but a matter of time incili is it not bending he picked up the larger of the two veils and twisting it into a rope put it about her waist and drew her towards him as her breasts touched his bare chest she began to tremble instinct warning her that this was not a man easily led one hand firmly lifted her chin bringing her face up so he might look down at her he smiled green eyes he said softly they are beautiful incili but then you know that dont you her heart was hammering wildly and she could not speak she was furious with herself what was the matter with her she tried to turn away but his head dipped quickly and his mouth closed over hers unreasonable panic gripped her and she struggled to escape him but he simply held her closer gently forcing her lips apart to allow his tongue entry she tore her head away from him her eyes wide gasping great gulps of air to clear her mind her hands flew up palms against his hairy chest trying to hold him off he laughed low and catching her hands in his forced them behind her back so that once again their bodies were intimately pressing against each other again he took deliberate possession of her mouth and when his tongue darted deep within her mouth lightly touching hungrily stroking she felt deep within her the banked fires flicker into flame slowly she ceased her resistance and began instead to respond to the warm pressure of his mouth feeling her yield he brought one hand around to delicately caress a round breast incili his voice was low edged with passion you rouse me as no woman ever has and he was leading her through an alcove to a large bed upon a dais falling backwards onto the bed he gently drew her down to him he held her just slightly above him so that her breasts hung like ripe fruits lifting his head to them he licked the nipples sending shock waves of desire racing through her turning her over onto her back bis dark head dipped and his mouth closed hungrily over a breast nursing on it eagerly sending streaks of hot delight through her his lips began a tortuous exploration of her beautiful body searing her and then he saw her tiny molethat outrageously enticing little mark of venus perched high atop the cleft of her womanhood his hand reached down to loosen his pantaloons squirming against her he worked them down and off returning his attention to the fascinating little mole that beckoned him onward his eyes widened with delight and a little smile touched his lips the mole was an invitation impossible to ignore he bent and kissed it pleased with the tremor that shook her now he was almost level with her again and taking her hand he guided it to touch him groaning when her hand closed over him he gazed down for a moment at the beautiful woman beneath him for the first time in his life he believed he had a woman whose sexual appetite matched his own her hand released him and he swung over her his hands gently spreading her thighs he knelt between her legs now and she raised her eyes to him gasping at the great blueveined ivory shaft that sprang from the black mat between his legs grasping her buttocks he drew her slowly towards and impaled her on his swollen manhood for a surprised moment he almost lost his control for she was not only warm and moist but almost as tight as a virgin feeling her squeezing him he groaned with delight regaining control of himself he began to move smoothly within her then he slowly lowered her to the bed straddling her more comfortably her body was covered in a fine damp mist and her head thrashed wildly on the pillow his big hands caressed her gently and his voice sought to sooth her suddenly the leafgreen eyes opened and looked into his grayblue ones she began to weep softly no incili no my exquisite one he said tenderly i see the shadow of another man in your beautiful eyes i would vanquish that man for you will never see him again you are mine for eternity he exulted yield yourself completely to me my beloved i cannot she sobbed i cannot the teasing hands caressed her again and his lips pressed little kisses on her face and throat i will make you forget him the deep voice promised and again he began the sweet rhythm of passion losing himself in her warmth and sweetness when he had brought them to a tumultuous climax he held the weeping woman against his broad chest until exhausted she sobbed herself to sleep she slept like a child relaxed and curled into a little ball smiling he rose from the tumbled bed and moving to a low table poured himself a goblet of fresh orange sherbet sprawling on some cushions he thoughtfully sipped and watched his beautiful sleeping slave hammid had been right she was worth special handling but allah she was a challenge he had but to command and the women of his harem strove to please him even his proud princess of a wife was eager that he be happy with incili however the positions were reversed it was he who was striving to win her over he would continue to do so until he possessed her body and her soul never had he known such ecstasy as tonights he shivered thinking what she would be like when she finally yielded herself to him completely chapter cat awoke surprised to find herself back in her own bed sitting up she asked susan how did i get back here he brought you lord cicalazade himself he said you looked so peaceful he did not want to disturb you i was so frightened when he walked through the door carrying you but he was very kind not at all the monster i thought he would be i like him he is not a cruel man cat said dully then her voice began to quiver but i cannot reconcile myself to this life susan i want my francis i want to go home i want to be free and she began to cry when she had wept for some minutes without stopping susan sent a slave for the eunuch osman who hurried in demanding what is it mara it is my lady sir she will not stop crying i have done everything osman bent over cat why do you weep incili does something pain you cat ignored mm in frustration osman sent for hammid the grand eunuch arrived and quietly dismissed susan and osman from the room then he sat down by cats bed and waited the hysterical weeping continued for some minutes then began to abate slowly until finally it stopped entirely she sat up her face wet and swollen wordlessly he handed her a large red silk handkerchief after mopping her face she noisily blew her nose very well incili tell me what troubles you he said everything she burst out i want to be free i cannot bear being cooped up like this in my country women are free to roam their own lands here i am confined to the harem and a daily walk in a walled garden i hate it i hate it hammid nodded understanding this was not an uncommon problem with new captives and he was willing to make great concessions to see that this woman was content for years he had sought for a woman who could balance lateefa sultans influence over his master the ottoman princess was beautiful and clever she had dutifully borne her husband three sons and twin daughters but her sex drive was low consequendy she did not mind that her husband kept a large harem to satisfy his great appetite but hammid worried that his master might fall under the influence of the wrong woman the wrong woman could turn hammids carefully tended household into a battleground of warring factions the wrong woman could even affect national policy as long as cicalazade pasha was a vizier to sultan mohammed in incili he had found exactly what he sought to counterbalance his royal mistress he had quickly ascertained that she was not only intelligent but ethical she was a beauty with a wisdom seldom found in women most important of all he had seen that her sexual appetite could be as great as his masters hammid even believed that lateefa sultan and incili could be friends and with these two women he hoped to aid cicalazade in becoming a great vizier for hammid was an ambitious man and to be master of a great mans household was a goal worth his reaching for i will gain permission for you to walk in lateefa sultans garden it is not walled but open to sea and sky i will also suggest to our master that he take you cruising in his caique would you like that she nodded and later he continued when you are more settled i will allow you trips to the bazaars of the city oh yes please hammid good now are the hysterics gone yes he smiled in a kindly fashion i am pleased incili lord cica spoke to me this morning of his delight with you you have pleasured him as no woman ever has you are to go to again tonight cats mind raced she thought to herself if i must endure this for the present i will make it as pleasant for myself and for susan as possible she looked at the grand eunuch i have no clothing the lowliest maiden in this harem has more to wear than i am i to be parceled out little gauze garments each night if i am to please my lord cica then i must be allowed to choose my own wardrobe it has been my experience hammid that it takes more than skill in a mans bed to hold him or perhaps you really do not care if cica pasha grows quickly bored with me hammid was delighted she might not be completely ready to yield herself but this typically feminine interest in clothing was extremely encouraging i will send for the women bazaar vendors so you may choose whatever you like if you see materials you also fancy buy them i will have our seamstresses fashion garments for you you may also purchase jewelry cosmetics and perfumes he was feeling very generous when you have made your choices osman will see that the women are paid the bazaar vendors brought an enormous variety of things for cat to look at cat treated herself generously buying several dozen gauze blouses in whites and colors pantaloons with matching jackets and long caftans in lime green mauve lilac turquoise pale blue and blossom pink she found several bolts of fabric that pleased her a deepblue silk embroidered with tiny silver stars a heavy red satin a palegreen brocade shot with gold threads and two gauzesone of gold the other of silver from the cosmetic vendor she bought only a little kohl refusing the white mercury paste the henna and the red paste used to color lips the perfume vendor fared better leaving three crystal flasks with cat one held musk one a fragrance of wild spring flowers and the third a foresty thing ofgreen fern and moss with just a hint of ambergris now came women with trays of jewelry and cat bought carefullya dozen little gold bangles and a dozen of silver delicate gold chains some plain some studded with amethyst garnet topaz aquamarine or peridot caught her fancy she bought several ropes of beads both pink and white coral turquoise and jade she bought ropes of pearls strung on thin gold wires and earrings to go with everything else she had already bought when osman protested her extravagance she rounded on him go to the grand eunuch insect if he says no then i will obey osman sighed and paid the happy vendors she ate lightly and then spent two luxurious hours in the harem baths being pampered for word had already reached the bath mistress of cats favor with the master back in her room she slept to be awakened in early evening when she again ate lightly of fresh yogurt and fruit studying the garments she had purchased she decided upon the lime green the ankles of the silk pantaloons had bands of a slightly deeper green embroidered in goldthread flowers with it she wore a sheer longsleeved gauze silk blouse striped in the two greens and topped it with a short sleeveless limegreen silk jacket with its sides and bottom banded in heavy gold embroidery and seed pearls the bolero was fringed in tiny pearls below her hips was tied a goldandgreen striped silk sash her kid slippers were studded with pearl flowers over her long darkgold hair she wore a long diaphanous green silk veil about her neck she had fastened a rope of jade and a rope of pearls gold bangles jingled on her arms and goldandjade earrings bobbed from her ears hammids fat face split into a wide grin when he saw her magnificent incili he exclaimed you have taste and a flair for style he escorted her as far as the door to the viziers bedchamber there he left her saying i wish you joy this night she walked into the room calmly to find him waiting she saw the approval in his grayblue eyes and he teasingly said i hear you have been spending my money reaching out he pulled the veils from her face and head you imply you find favor with me my lord she said coolly yet until today the lowliest female in your harem had more than i i am neither a greedy nor an acquisitive woman but i must have clothes with or without them you are the loveliest of women incili and she saw the quick desire flickering in his eyes seeing a chess set on the low table she quickly asked will you play with me my lord cica he was amused do you play he asked very well or so both my husbands told me she answered with a poise she was far from feeling his hand indicated the pillows opposite the ivory chess pieces while he himself sat opposite the black onyx ones then suddenly a wicked light came into his eyes and he said wait she looked questioningly at him remove your jacket and your blouse incili if you would forestall the inevitable i shall at least have the delightful pleasure of your breasts she flushed and he was pleased she was angry but she was forced to obey him she was a wonderful wild thing and he was very much enjoying their battle eventually of course he would tame her completely the thought of her begging his favors excited him greatly and like a great beast his manhood awoke and stretched itself she played with a serious concentration that he admired and because he could not take his eyes from her beautiful breasts he found himself in danger of losing to her she deliberately thrust her breasts forward and moved in such a way that they bobbed provocatively in order to even the odds again he moved around the table to sit next to her casually putting as arm about her he fondled a soft breast enjoying her disconcerted gasp and the sadden hardening of a rosy nipple his head dropped and he kissed her silken shoulder while moving his king piece into an apparently vulnerable position flustered and unthinking cat quickly moved her queen piece and was horrified to hear the vizier chuckle check my distracting beauty and he pushed her back into the pillowsmate before she had realized what was happening he was atop her laughing down at her his hands stroked the tight quivering globes beneath his touch do not be angry with me my sweet incili you are too delicious to resist and i do not want to play games with you i want to make love to you i am not one of your soft harem beauties quick to spread her legs for the master she spat at him i will not yield it will be rape he laughed again and his eyes twinkled all right he said then it will be rape which could be very titillating and she felt his hands on her hips untying the striped sash and inching her silk pantaloons off no she shrieked no straggling angrily against him she tried to claw at him and he laughed he was stronger by far and cat began to tire successfully stripping her the vizier slid his own pantaloons off while still straddling her now he lay his warm naked body the length of her naked body enjoying the satiny feel of her he made to kiss her but she furiously turned away from him chuckling he caught her head between his hands and his mouth swooped down on hers gently he ran his tongue along her little white teeth and though she tried to deny him the fires of her own desire were fast rising her hps parted with a despairing little moan and as his tongue darted into the fragrant cavity of her mouth she shivered beneath him his lips moved to tenderly kiss her eyelids and then her cheeks wet with silent tears he stopped and raising himself on one elbow he asked quietly why can you not give yourself to me completely your body longs for mine yet you deny me a full victory iii do not love you my lord cicalazade i love my husband in my land a woman who yields her body to a man she does not love is considered the lowest of creatures but i love you no incili dont look incredulous i speak the truth were i only interested in your lovely body i should not care about your feelings but i do care unless i have all of you my love i have none of you and that is intolerable to me the intensity of his voice was frightening you will never see your husband again you belong to me now but i will be patient for i want you to love me and the sensuous mouth was again closing hungrily over hers demanding searing unable to stop herself cat clung to this passionate man and felt his hands stroking her trembling body his lips were on her breasts bis tongue tracing tantalizing patterns torturing the nipples into hard hurting little peaks the teasing tongue moved across her shrinking belly sinking lower and lower seeking access to her sweetness his tongue was like soft fire burning into her writhing body thrusting deeper and deeper until she was mindless with the waves of pleasure sweeping over her then he was in her hard and hurting making her cry out in rapture begging himto her shamenot to stop never in all of his life had he wanted so desperately to prolong bis own passion she consumed him with a flame of lust unequal to anything he had ever experienced as he strove to bring her to complete fulfillment he didnt want to stop but then his foaming seed was pouring fiercely into her and she cried out her joy but afterwards she wept again in ins arms sobbing against the dark mat of his broad chest he held her tightly while one hand caressed her tawny head soothing her for a brief moment he understood her anguish for he knew that if he ever lost her his own world would be meaningless he cicalazade pasha grand vizier to sultan mohammed iii caught in the silken web of his beautiful unwilling slavewoman what irony the weeping had stopped and he slept cradling her against him awaking in the dark of night he sensed that she was not sleeping hammid tells me he said softly that you are feeling confined would you like to go with me tomorrow night it is the night of the full moon and i own a small island down the bosporus on it is a little kiosk with a roof that opens to the sky tomorrow night i will take you there and make love to you beneath the moonlit heavens he felt her tremble next to him and turning pulled her into his arms his lips were tender and so was his body now as he gently took her again delighting in her little moan of surrender this time she did not weep afterwards but for a few moments cuddled sweetly against him it was fortunate that on the following day he had no state business to attend to for he could not keep his mind on anything but incili he spent part of the morning conferring with his household master about the arrangements for the evening late in the morning he went to see his wife lateefa sultan was a greatgranddaughter of selim i her grandmother had been a halfsister to suleiman the magnificent she was a beautiful woman who had inherited the magnificent coloring of her greatgrandmother firousi kadin and the gentle disposition of her grandmother guzel sultan her long hair was silvery blond and her eyes a turquoise blue she had been married to cicalazade pasha as a girl and their children were now grown and gone she lived a quiet life surrounded by every comfort secure in the friendship of her husband one night weekly each friday he visited her bedbut it was usually to sleep for she did not particularly care for lovemaking since his vast harem satisfied that part of his nature and since she had dutifully borne his children he respected her sensibilities they were old and good friends the vizier and his wife on this bright morning he sat with her in a small kiosk overlooking the water he looked slightly haggard and was she thought beginning to show his age in all the years we have been together i have never asked for a favor he said she smiled it must be a large favor you ask since you remind me that you have never before requested one as an ottoman princess you have never had to fear the advent of another wife for i can have no wife but youunless of course you give me your permission to take another until now i have never wanted to take another wife it is the new slave incili said lateefa calmly is it not enough that you possess her body no he replied quietly i want more and i do not believe she will yield it to me until she is my wife has she said so she is ignorant of our ways i do not think it has occurred to her that i would want her as a wife you would like her though lateefa so hammid assures me she answered him dryly then looking closely at him she said i am not sure that i believe my own eyes but they tell me you are in love can it be that after all these years the great cicalazade pasha is actually in love with a mere woman have you finally succumbed to that tender passion do not mock me lateefa his voice was hard oh my dearest cica i do not believe me i do not its just that you have always prided yourself on the careful noninvolvement of your emotions now however i see a different man very well my lord hammid tells me i will not have to play the forgotten gulbehar to your beloveds kurhem so i will give you my permission to take incili as your second wife when will the happy event take place later today before i take her to the island of a thousand flowers so soon my lord i would erase the past to which she clings so tenaciously once she is my wife she will begin to settle down he knelt and taking lateefas hands in his kissed them tenderly thank you my gentle dove you have always been the most understanding of women lateefa watching him stride back across the garden felt a wave of pity sweep over her she had not met the woman they called incili and yet she felt that her husband in seeking to possess this woman sought the moon it was a desire he could never fulfill chapter you are to become a muslim incili said hammid quietly cats green eyes widened never she answered do not be foolish my beauty chided the eunuch it is but a formality six times a day you must kneel towards mecca and pray who is to know what is in your heart but god cat thought a moment his words made sense and undoubtedly her greatgrandmother had thought the same way for she could not have been a sultans favorite wife and an avowed christian too besides survival and escape were all that mattered very well she told hammid i will do what you ask early in the afternoon she was given a special bath of purification and brought to a womens mosque near the viziers palace where she automatically answered the questions put to her by the elderly muezzin by late afternoon she was officially a convert to mohammed she was not however aware of the fact that as soon as she returned to cicalazades palace the vizier signed papers making her his second wife according to muslim law neither her knowledge nor her consent were necessary only the permission of her legal guardian was required hammid who accepted a large sum of gold as her bridal gift was that guardian when evening came cat waited impatiently for the litter that would carry her to the viziers caique her small excursion of the afternoon had whetted her appetite for freedom and she had even managed to reconcile herself to the fact that for the present cicalazade pasha owned her she had decided to cease her resistance to him her objective was to return to her husband in italy and in order to do this she must be able to speak with the kira family in constantinople she could only gain that privilege if she were trusted and she would only be trusted if she appeared to have accepted her fate not even her loyal susan must suspect her thoughts it was a secret she would keep to herself until her plans were completed she started guiltily at the sound of hammids voice you look so serious incili what is it you think of my beauty profound thoughts are not good for a woman she laughed you have indeed caught me hammid but i think you would approve the direction of my thoughts i have been thinking that you are right i will not say that it is easy for me but i have decided to try to accept my fate after all tis not so terrible a fate perhaps in time i shall be able to love my lord cicalazade do you think it will happen hammid the vizier does appear to harbor some small affection for me hammid could scarcely control his delight and excitement she could not have made her decision at a better time i can he said carefully if you will allow me ease some of your anxiety will you trust me i will try she answered him but what is it you would do it is an ancient form of relaxation and suggestion called hypnosis i will place you in a trance and suggest certain things to you when you awaken you will be more at ease with your situation do not fear this however for if you do not wish to obey my suggestions the hypnosis will not work your own strong will is your best protection i trust you hammid she said proceed the eunuch took a gold chain with a small diamond tear from about his neck watch the tear incili he swung it slowly before her eyes is it not beautiful with its rainbow colors the voice was soothing and kindly cat felt a delicious warmth wash over her you must concentrate on the tear my child and soon you will begin to relax the pendant swung slowly and cat felt her body growing languorous her eyes heavier and heavier as they slowly closed are you asleep incili yes hammid the eunuch took a pin from ms robe and lifting her foot jabbed it quickly into her tender sole she neither pulled away nor cried out and he was satisfied that she was really in a hypnotic state are you ready to submit to cicalazade pasha as your lord and master yes hammid i will try hard to please him i am happy with you incili and i want you to be happy you have only to follow the dictates of your body my beauty let your lovely body overrule your quick intellect lord cicalazade loves you deeply you have affected mm as no woman ever has will you not give mm the satisfaction of knowing that he has pleasured you for a moment she was silent as if struggling with her emotions then her soft voice said yes hammid i will yield myself to my lord cica the eunuch smiled satisfied thank you my dear i am content that you will both be very happy one other thing however you must not mention to the vizier that we have had this conversation i will not very well incili on the count of three you will awaken refreshed and ready to spend a night pleasing your lord one two three cats eyes opened fascinating she said i slept yet i heard you clearly and i feel ever so much more at ease hammid thank you the eunuch smiled again are you ready to join the vizier now yes and again tonight i compliment you on your costone cat smiled she enjoyed wearing the luxurious clothing of a priveleged woman and she took great pains with her appearance tonight she wore palepink silk shot with silver threads her gauze blouse was rose her jacket edged in silver and bits of blue lapis her hip sash and slippers bore alternating stripes of silver and turquoise she wore silver baubles on her arms and large drop earrings of carved turquoise susan had done cats hair in a new fashion drawn back and up the honeycolored mass was woven into one large braid with turquoise ribbons and a string of tiny seed pearls across the beautiful face hammid fastened a veil of rose gauze she settled herself comfortably in the litter almost bouncing with excitement in anticipation of her outing the bearers moved quickly through the harem corridors out across the gardens and down to the private marble quay where the viziers caique awaited it was a graceful vessel completely gilded with a red lacquer design along the sides the oars were alternately paleblue enamel and silver and the slaves who pulled those oars were all coalblack those who pulled on the silver oars wore blue satin pantaloons sashed in silver those who pulled on the paleblue oars were garbed in bluesashed silver cloth pantaloons the awning of the vessel was stripped in red gold blue and silver and held up by four gilded posts carved around with flowers and leaves the silk curtains were scarlet and gold gauze and the deck waspolished rosewood beneath the awning was an enormous assortment of multicolored pillows where cicalazade pasha awaited hammid carefully handed her from the litter into the caique reclining comfortably on her side she raised her eyes to him and said in a low sultry voice good evening my lord a smile lit his face good evening incili turning to the oarmaster he nodded the caique began to pull slowly away from the quay moving directly into the bosporus in the direction of the black sea the sun had not yet set and she could see the sammergreen hills tumbling into the water behind them the sky was a riot of pinks golds mauves corals and deep purple against blue cat breathed deeply and the vizier laughed do not tell me that the air outside my garden smells better beloved tis the smell of freedom my lord his eyes were troubled and then he said quietly do not chafe so my beautiful captive dove today i have changed your humble status my wife lateefa sultan is an ottoman princess and i may not have other wives except with her permission i thought muslim men were allowed four wives all except those wed to imperial princesses this afternoon however with lateefas permission i took you as my second wife her eyes widened pleased he continued you are i know wondering how this can be under muslim law neither your knowledge nor your permission was necessary you are no longer a slave my precious one are you not happy his face radiated pleasure as he looked expectantly at her the blood was pounding angrily in her ears it took tremendous effort but she quickly caught hold of her emotions speaking so softly that he was forced to bend to hear her she said you do me an incredible honor my lord she was unable to say any more for fear of betraying herself it was enough he drew her into his arms kissing the mouth that opened easily beneath his he covered the upturned face with kisses moving to the slim pillar of her throat and down to her breasts eagerly he pulled the rose gauze blouse open tearing it in his haste hungrily he sucked at her nipples each in turn and then laying his head against her heart he sighed contentedly sure that he had won her over completely tonight we begin anew my precious incili his deep voice vibrated with emotion the past is dead my beautiful bride only the present and the future will concern us look the full moon is rising and above it venus the planet of the goddess of love soon we will be at the island of a thousand flowers and there in the starlight kiosk we will spend a night of rapture raising his head from her breasts he gazed at her little gold lights dancing in his grayblue eyes she was speechless drawing his head back down to her breasts so he could not see her face she suppressed the urge to scream furious she wondered how her greatgrandmother had managed to live so many years in a muslim world so neither her permission nor even her knowledge had been necessary for marriage to take place now she knew why hammid had insisted on her quick conversion to islam he had pretended to be her friend lulling her into a false sense of security in order to aid his master she would never trust him again but she would play the gameher way this timeand hammid would not know it for the time being she would be the adoring second wife of the vizier she would not allow outrage to betray her she would make them all think she had been pacified and tamed the caique was approaching the island quay and cat could smell flowers my lord cica she said softly we near our destination i would rearrange my blouse lest the slaves see what they should not sighing he raised his head i could stay like this forever beloved we will soon be in our bridal chamber my lord and then you may resume your dozing she teased playfully neither of us will rest this night my wife his voice thickened with passion and she shivered the caique bumped the quay and the vizier leaped from the vessel to tie it fast we will not need you until morning he told the oarmaster see the rowers are made comfortable but do not unchain them the temptation to escape would be too great reaching down he took her hand and drew her out of the boat i regret we must walk my love but i did not wish on this night of nights to be burdened with slaves my lord cica forgets that i am no pampered eastern beauty in my country women not only walk but ride horses too lead on my lord i follow they ascended the island climbing up a flight of stairs cut into the side of the cliff and it seemed to cat that the island was no more than a tall rock however when they had reached the top she was surprised to find herself in a beautiful carefully tended garden in the center of which was a marble kiosk the moonlight was so bright now that she could easily see and identify many of the flowers there were damask roses gold of ophir roses sultans balsam bougainvillea lilies sweet nightblooming nicotiana and moonflowers there were trees heavy with ripening peaches and pears and cypress pine and other ornamental trees were set among the small bubbling fountains its exquisite she said honestly never have i seen such a beautiful garden i laid it out myself he told her proudly she had not discerned this side of his nature like my master the sultan i have learned a trade he took her hand and led her down the white gravel path towards the kiosk set in the center of an oval reflecting pool the kiosk rectangular was of creamcolored marble with a small pillared porch crossing a narrow latticework bridge they entered the kiosk through an open wooden door studded in brass nails cat was stunned by the room directly across from her a wall of leaded windows looked beyond the pool across the garden to the moonlit sea beyond beneath her feet was an enormous medallion rug woven in red green gold and varying blues on the wall to her right a silk hanging depicted a persian garden on the wall to her left was a door and next to it was another silk carpet this one showing a pair of lovers seated in their garden in one corner of the room was a low round brass table surrounded by pillows gold and silver lamps burning scented oil hung from the painted and beamed ceiling but the major piece of furniture in the room was an enormous square bed set upon a carpeted dais in the very center of the room it had neither a head nor a foot nor were there any hangings it was simply a square platform with silken sheets and a down coverlet on the dais near it were several small low tables of ebony inlaid with bits of colored mosaic or iridescent motherofpearl upon the tables were carafes of golden liquid and bowls of fruit olives and sugared almonds coming silently up behind her he put an arm around her one hand cupping her breast while bis thumb rubbed the nipple do you like it beloved it is all unbelievably beautiful she answered sincerely look above the bed he said and she glanced up to see the ceiling roll back to reveal a glass dome giving a magnificent view of the night sky she gasped i have never seen anything like that how it is done by a process far too complicated for your sweet little head to comprehend my dove he answered spinning her about and kissing the tip of her nose cats temper rose but she quickly swallowed it and tipped her face up to him inviting him to kiss her again he brushed his mouth lightly against hers and then said let us to bed my beloved may i valet you my lord she moved behind him to remove the sleeveless redandgold brocade robe beneath it he wore a silk shirt embroidered in gold and silver thread blue pantaloons trimmed with silver a jeweled blue sash and red leather boots she helped him with each item of his wardrobe unable to keep her hands from straying to the broad hairy chest none of her lovers had been particularly hirsute and she was fascinated by his hairiness naked he sprawled on the bed disrobe for me now he commanded her and do it with grace the leafgreen eyes looked intently at him and he felt a tingle go through his limp member then her fingers gently peeled back the sleeveless jacket until she was able to shrug it off her fingers moved to the rose gauze blouse loosened it and then stopped instead she removed her sash a delightful smile lit his features as she kicked her little kid slippers off then turning her back to him she slid the blouse off she could hear his breath becoming faster and ragged loosening the drawstring on her silk pantaloons she let them slip slowly to the rug and stepping away from them she turned quickly to face him he smiled again the carafe with the gold liquid incili pour us each a goblet she caught the scent of rich wine puzzled she looked to him i thought liquor was forbidden the muslim the sultan drinks he answered and the mufti has ruled that when a sultan takes to drink it is permissible for all to do the same and for poets to celebrate it in general i hold with the koran i neither drink nor allow it in my household but this night beloved is our wedding night we will toast each other in the sweet wines of cyprus he raised his goblet and said to you incili my wife though you be second in my house you are first in my heart looking directly at her he drained his goblet cat knew she was expected to reply in kind raising her own goblet she spoke softly to you my lord cica as long as it pleases allah that i be your wife i will endeavor to please you and she drank her goblet empty it is not necessary for you to call me my lord in the privacy of our bedchamber beloved you will call me cica or husband yes call me husband i have yet to hear you say it to me say it incili say husband silently cat prayed forgie me bothwell and then looking at cicalazade pasha she said husband his eyes burned into hers and she felt heat sweeping over her body he smiled at her you can feel the heat can you not do not be afraid hammid has put something into the wine that will enable us to prolong our pleasure we will go on and on this night she shivered terrified at the meaning behind his words then he stood commanding her to kneel before him she obeyed him and her heart hammered wildly when he said taste of me my sweet as i will soon taste of you before her his manhood lay limp nesting within the wiry black hair obey me his voice demanded sharply with trembling hand she lifted the drooping member and kissed its tip knowing she had no other choice she placed it in her warm mouth and sucked allah allah he groaned with delight after a few minutes he reached down and pulled her up they fell onto the bed cat on her back his mouth found hers and as his kiss deepened in passion cat felt the burning heat pouring through her body his touch was inflaming her and she was losing control she suddenly wanted him desperately and she wiggled beneath him moaning her pleasure at the long skillful fingers that teased her desire begging him to increase his efforts allowing him complete and unchecked freedom with her body hammids posthypnotic suggestion that she obey the dictates of her body and the powerful aphrodisiac was combining to drive her to a frenzy as he looked down at her she whispered you are like a bull my husband a mighty black bull the grayblue eyes glittered and he answered and you beloved are the bulls matea sweet little golden heifer quickly my pet onto your hands and knees and i shall love you as the bull does the heifer and he turned her onto her stomach pushing her knees up swiftly he mounted her sighing happily at the warm wet welcome of her his hands fondling the breasts that hung quivering she gasped with pleasure as he rode crying her rapture at the waves of delight washing over her it didnt stop he was utterly inexhaustible as he drove deeper and deeper into her again and again until she finally fainted when she regained consciousness he had turned her onto her back and was bending anxiously over her she reached up a slim hand touching his cheek gently and said tis all right cica and then she felt him spreading her thighs to push himself into her again above her the moon passed slowly over the glass dome leaving the black sky to fade with the dawn chapter francis stewarthepburn reached avellino to find that the bandits who had been plaguing the district had disappeared as suddenly as they had come their recent presence was distressingly evident in the burnedout farms fresh graves and frightened women and children for several days bothwell and his men poked about discovering nothing they returned to the villa del pesce doro and found an empty house there were six new graves in the garden fortunately for the earls sanity the head gardener had been waiting for his master to return nodding to the graves carlo said paolo maria and the maids the little may is with me signora la contessa and susan were carried off come my lord the girl can tell you she was there but escaped somehow i know not how for she has not spoken much since she fled to us almost three weeks ago i think however that she will speak to you at the sight of them may flung herself into conalls arms weeping ohhhh uncle conall twas terrible the pirates carried off my mistress and susan conall grasped the girl hard by her shoulders pull yerself together lassie and tell us exactly what happened think carefully may and leave nothing out gulping her sobs back the girl rallied susan and i were sleeping on the trundle in my ladys room while ye were away it was sunday dawn and we awoke to a terrible screaming when we ran to the windows and looked out the garden was full of turkish pirates paolo was already dead they bashed his head in while he was cutting the herbs for the breakfast eggs maria and the girls had their throats cut after the pirates were finished with them they were rrr but she couldnt get the word out and bothwell put a gentle hand over her mouth dont lassie we can imagine what happened tell us how you escaped tell us of my wife and your sister and he withdrew his hand two large tears ran down the girls cheeks but she began again my lady bid my sister and me hide in the linen chest but susan would not she told my lady it dinna matter what happened to her since she was nae a virgin twas a lie she told my lord for susan is as virgin as i am and unable to help herself may began to cry again they let her weep for a few minutes and then bothwell said quietly go on lass what happened next they hid me in the chest and bid me not move until twas absolutely quiet and i was sure the pirates had gone then i was to go to carlos and remain until ye returned no sooner was the lid down than i heard the bedchamber door being smashed in and then i heard the pirates entering they dinna hurt my lady or susan but they took them away did they say anything you could understand susan asked conall the girl thought a moment then her features cleared aye the captain was very polite to my lady he said his name was it sounded like karoteen he also said he had orders to take my lady to the grand vizier cicasomething pasha santa maria gasped carlo he did not understand the girls story because she spoke in her own language but he understood the names she spoke khairaddin my lord he said excitedly kapitan khairaddinthe namesake and some say the grandson of the great kapitan pasha of suleiman the magnificent he is in the personal service of cicalazade pasha the grand vizier of the ottoman empire but what would some damned turk want with my wife carlo looked uncomfortable bearers of bad tidings were never liked still his lord must know cicalazade pasha is only halfturkish his father is the conte di cicala my lord he is also the older brother of the contessa de licosa i will personally kill the bitch said bothwell in a deadly voice not if i reach her first said conall quietly simultaneously they turned mounted their horses and rode to the conte di licosas home as quiet as the grounds at the villa del pesce doro had been those at the villa del mare were quieter at first bothwell feared it deserted but when they reached the house a servant ran out to take their horses and another escorted them to alfredo di licosa i want angela said bothwell with no preamble you are too late my friend the inquisition has her she will burn tomorrow in the main market square of naples have you seen her can she still talk do you know what she did she has sent my wife into slavery in her brothers harem i must talk with her before she dies so that was it sighed alfredo di licosa her servant barto was caught signaling the turkish pirates he implicated her and then accused her of witchcraft claiming that she held his soul in bondage so he was forced to do her bidding naturally the inquisition heard and came for her immediately they have been waiting for something like this for angela has made no secret of her contempt for the church it was as if shed gone mad she laughed at them and made no attempt to save herself i dont think she really believed it they didnt even bother to torture her they simply condemned her to the stake and she truly doesnt care where is she being kept alfredo in naples at the inquisition prison i will go with you francisco and we will get bishop pasquale too he can get us the necessary permissions bothwell nodded tell me fredo is there anything angela is afraid of anything at all i must have a lever to force her to talk with me snakes answered the conte di licosa angela is terrified of snakes bothwell looked to conall and nodded go back to the gardener man conall returned the nod aye ill get them and ill meet you at the cross of san genaro on the naples road with his captainatarms gone bothwell turned again to the conte i am sorry fredo i would not add to your pain i know you love angela i want my wife back if i must move heaven and hell to get her i will youll never see her again francisco if angela sent caterina to cicalazade pasha your wife is gone if you could even get as far as istanbul she would already be either dishonored or dead face your loss and accept it as i am accepting mine never do you think i care if shes forced by another man as long as i can have her back do not tell me that i cannot get her back for i can and i will the conte di licosa shook his head sadly but as he had promised he accompanied bothwell on his journey first they saw bishop pasquale who hearing the story changed from his clerical robes into his riding clothes and led the way to the naples road conall was already waiting by the san genaro cross a small covered reed basket attached to his saddle it was close to evening by the time they reached the city had the bishop not been with them bothwell was sure they would never have been admitted to the grim black stone fortress all the windows were barred and smoking pitch torches lit the entrance riding authoritatively up to the entrance the bishop demanded immediate entry and speech with the prison governor they were quickly admitted conall gingerly removed the basket from the pommel horn of his saddle and followed the guard into the prison they were immediately assaulted by the odor of rotting food of unwashed bodies of feces and urine a low wailing assailed their ears jesu whispered conall to bothwell weve gone to hell the earl shot him a warning look and they were led up a twisting flight of stairs to the governors apartment there they were greeted by bishop guido massini the prison governor who said to bothwell i have heard of you my lord there was some discussion in your country regarding witchcraft and you are a heretic i believe no guido said bishop pasquale quietly lord bothwell having seen the error of his ways has returned to holy church he is married to a most virtuous and devout woman they both attend mass regularly and are extremely generous to both the church and the poor i am relieved to hear it answered the bishop a deceptively merrylooking little man whose smiling features were belied by his icy black eyes what may i do for you my lord the prisoner angela di licosa guido we wish to see her she is responsible for the abduction of lord bothwells wife by turkish pirates before she dies tomorrow we must learn from her what instructions she gave the pirates bishop massini was most irritated is there no end to that womans infamy yes of course you may see her however even if she will tell you there is little hope of your getting your wife back from the infidels but the bishops face softened with bothwells look but i must i must he said i will write the pass for you for my captainatarms also and we must see her alone the bishop looked first at bothwells distraught face and then at conalls grim one what is in the basket he asked the captain then raising a fat white hand he hurriedly said no i really dont want to know pulling out a prewritten parchment he scrawled the name of angela di licosa in one place and his own at the bottom holding out the parchment to bothwell he said come back and have a goblet of wine with me when you have your information he turned to the other two men remain here if you do not wish to accompany them francis looked to alfredo di licosa who shook his head no i have said my goodbyes i do not wish to see her ever again bothwell and conall followed the guard up a flight of stairs she is lodged quite decently thanks to her husband the guard remarked conversationally most of the witches are below with the water rats we are to see her alone replied bothwell coldly you are to remain outside the cell and no matter what you hear you will remain there unless my captain or i call you makes no difference to me came the reply the guard stopped before a door found the right key and opened the door they stepped through into the cell and heard the door close behind them angela di licosa stood her back to them gazing out through the barred window if youre another priest go away she said she whirled about francisco caro so there is a god but the welcome in her eyes died in bothwells icy gaze i have come said the earl coldly because i hope that even you will want to clear your conscience before you die regarding the matter of my wife what exactly did you arrange her black eyes widened and she burst into hysterical laughter outside the closed door the guard shuddered at the sound angela wiped the damp from her eyes with a ragged sleeve really francisco you are simply incredible yes i arranged for your wifes disposal but she must truly have god on her side for that idiot servant of mine was caught so tomorrow i die alas if i cannot have you then neither can she she laughed again a bit ruefully this time you will have neither of us francisco and that isnt at all what i had planned once more angela what exactly did you do with her the woman regarded him with some amusement and shook her head francis reached out and wrapping the soft blueblack hair around his hand cruelly yanked her to him i have no time to waste angela where is she the black eyes glittered viciously but she said nothing using his other hand bothwell ripped the prison smock from the womans body and brutally shoved her onto the straw mattress of the cell cot before she realized what had happened her arms and legs were bound to the cot posts in a spreadeagled position what are you doing she shrieked i will call the guard he will not answer angela i have the prison governors permission to obtain my information in any way necessary now what instructions did you give your turkish friends regarding my wife she regarded him coldly for a second and then raising her head spat full in his face bothwell nodded to his captain conall opened the woven basket looking into it thoughtfully he chose a short plump green snake he handed it to bothwell who wrapped the reptile about his hand and caressed the weaving darting head sliding it off his hand he placed it on the straw mattress between angelas open legs the contessa di licosa shrieked wildly francisco for the love of god take it away take it away what exactly did you do with my wife she strained against her bonds her black eyes dark mirrors of terror but still she would not answer him he could see the pounding of her heart in her chest the snake uncurled itself and began to move slowly towards her she screamed again a long wailing moan of animal fear it goes for the warmth and moistness of you angela soon it will seek the darkness of your womb where so many have been before it and when it is safely up inside you wriggling around i shall take another from the basket and another and another until your belly is a nest of snakes can you feel them inside you already angela does it feel good my dear the cruel eyes bore pitilessly down at her for the briefest moment amazement at his cruelty overcame her fear but then the fear returned tenfold slamming into her so fiercely that for a moment she couldnt draw a breath finally she was able to gasp i sent her to my brother take that reptile away i will tell you all only take it away casually bothwell lifted the snake from the mattress and dropped it back into its container talk then you bitch or ill shove the entire basket up you i sent your precious bride to my brother cicalazade pasha the sultans grand vizier he is quite a connoisseur of beautiful women and his prowess is legendary she is not there yet francisco but she will be soon then cicas head eunuch will have her bathed and perfumed and he will lead her to my brother where she will be stripped naked for his inspection when he has seen herfor i admit that she is beautifulhe will pleasure himself on her body you bitch snarled bothwell angela di licosa laughed you will never see her again she is lost to you soon she will lie beneath my brother moaning her desire she lowered her voice to an intimate level they say he is a bull and he will teach her to please him you will have nothing but a memory and the knowledge that another man is fucking her angelas voice now became silky soft and caressing think of it francisco her tawny hair spread upon the pillows her firm white legs eagerly open to receive her masters swollen manhood she will beg for his favors living in a harem of a hundred other beauties she will compete for his attentions as eagerly as any of them the savagery of her words ripped into him and bothwell rose from the edge of the cot his face a mask of pain and anguish crossing the cell he pulled the door open and exited slowly conall moved to stand beside the condemned woman for a moment he stood staring silently down at her angela was frightened for this man did not regard her nakedness with desire this one showed no emotion whatsoever you are a wicked woman he said quietly but do not think that you have won we will bring her safely back to us i have not watched over her since she was a child to see her end this way bending he took his knife and cut through the contessas bonds and before she realized what he was doing he lifted the basket of green snakes and dumped them in her lap as he left the cell he smiled wolfishly hearing the shrieks behind lock it up again he commanded the guard its not to be opened again until morning conall moreleslie was not surprised the following day to hear that the devil had come for the soul of angela di licosa during the night leaving her body and half a dozen green garden snakes as a memento of his visit the crowd gathered to see a live angela executed was disappointed the body was tied to the waiting stake and burned to ashes giving the cheering crowd a small satisfaction chapter conall moreleslie allowed the earl of bothwell exactly twentyfour hours to wallow in his grief then he dragged francis to a bathhouse in the turkish quarter of naples where two burly bath attendants scrubbed the drunken man down next he was put into a hot steam room until every pore was open and running freely then he was sloshed with scented tepid water and allowed to sleep on a marble bath bench in a slightly less volcanic steamroom awakened after an hour with a cup of boiling turkish coffee he vomited up most of the wine he had imbibed and was then taken into another tepidarium to be shaved and bathed again lastly he was dressed in his own fresh clean clothes which conall had brought with them his old clothes were burned finally he was bowed back out into the street where his captain waited bothwell was so weakened that he could barely mount his horse and he cursed conall roundly conall simply said ive found a tavern several streets over owned by an englishman who knows how to cook beef decently and led the way to la rosa anglo a table in a private room awaited them the landlord himself from the north of england served them slices of hot halfraw roast beef dripping its bloody juices onto great slabs of yorkshire pudding the table held a pottery bowl of artichokes in oil and vinegar a tub of sweet butter and a hot round loaf of crusty bread the flagons were filled to the brim with foaming brown ale at the sight of which bothwells eyebrows shot up the tavern keeper grinned toothily aye me lord october ale it is i makes it and casks it meself each year tis no easy task in this place bothwell sat down he didnt feel particularly hungry but suddenly the scent of the beef began to work its magic on him and he reached for the salt half an hour later he pushed back his chair and said thank you conall the captain nodded ive taken the liberty he said of asking master kira to see you hell be waiting for us now my lord can he help possibly my lord the kiras main banking branch and their family head are both located in istanbul bothwell rose and paid the landlord the man gaped at the generous coin in his hand thank ye sir he babbled anytime we can serve the border lord were proud to do so but bothwell had already mounted and was riding towards the jewish section of the city and pietro kiras house conall smiled pleased that he had roused the earl from selfpity they reached the kira dwelling and were quickly ushered into the best salon servants hurried in with wine and biscuits then came pietro kira elegant in a long furtrimmed black gown a large gold chain and pendant hanging about his neck and shoulders he grasped lord bothwells hand saying i am so sorry to receive you under these circumstances my lord let us sit down you will tell me everything that you know the earl repeated what he had learned from young may and from angela di licosa yes nodded the banker we knew all of that but it is good to have it confirmed we have already sent a message to the head of the family in istanbul do not be afraid for your wife my lord she has friends about her and when the time is right we will contact her she is a brave and resourceful lady i would go to istanbul as soon as possible signor kira indeed you would my lord but you must not at least not yet not until we have ascertained that the countess has arrived is safe and has been contacted by our people for you to show up in the sultans capital demanding your wifes return would be absolutely fatal to you and possibly also to your wife sultan mohammed is a strange man given to alternating moods of great kindness and unbelievable cruelty he is deeply fond of his vizier if cicalazade pasha is taken with your beautiful wife and you arrive to demand her back you could find yourself quickly dead my lord let us move slowly and carefully the countess is quite safe it would not serve cicalazade pashas purpose to hurt her but how will i get her back pietro kira how when we know what we must regarding your wifes position then we can plan my lord it may be possible to ransom her more likely we will have to abduct her in the meantime please return to your home and wait to hear from me and my lord i think you should know that your wifes monies are at your complete disposal prior to her arrival here in naples she arranged with the house of kira that you and your children should inherit her wealth should anything befall her bothwell looked pained i cannot touch a pennypiece of her money he said conall said quietly yell need gold for the running of the household my lord why not simply have all the bills sent to signor kira he will keep a strict accounting i know ye would neer take her wealth for yourself but lord man yer her husband and shed nae thank me if i let ye starve to death afore she comes home bothwell nodded sadly absently whatever ye think is right conall i leave it to ye conall turned again to the banker your messengers are swifter than ours sir will you see that the young earl of glenkirk is informed that my ladys children are to remain safely with him until further notice she had sent a message asking that they be sent out to her but now of course tis impossible we will see to it captain said pietro kira already thinking about the message he would be sending to his uncle in the ottoman capital istanbul was the home of the kira family once a small merchant family of jews they had thanks to their matriarch esther kira risen to become one of the most powerful banking houses in all of europe and asia esther kira had been born in at six she and her small brother joseph were orphaned and taken into the house of their fathers oldest brother at twelve esther was peddling hardtoobtain merchandise to the harem ladies of the rich at sixteen she was allowed entry to the imperial harem and at twenty her familys fortune was made when she met cyra hafise mother of suleiman the magnificent when sultan suleiman ascended the throne in esther kira and her family were forever exempted from the paying of taxes for services rendered the crown no one including esthers family ever knew what those services were but it would have been unthinkable to question the imperial word considered of value now by her uncle esther was married off to his younger son when her only brotherinlaw died childless it was esthers sons who inherited the nowgreat banking house that was only just since it was esthers efforts that had brought the kiras their stunning success just as esther had been a favorite of suleimans mother she became the favorite of suleimans favorite wife khurrem kadin and of selim iis favorite nurubanu and of murad ills favorite safiye safiye was the mother of the present sultan esther kira was now in her hundred and eighth year showed no signs of slowing down and enjoyed nothing more than a good intrigue the times she often complained were not nearly as exciting as they had once been the current head of the house of kira was esthers fiftythreeyearold grandson eli eldest son of her eldest son solomon who had recently died in his mideighties eli kira was confused as to what cousin pietro expected of him he had after all never even slightly circumvented the law let alone contemplated breaking it entirely by stealing a woman from someone elses harem obedient however to the lesson drummed into him since childhood he immediately consulted with his grandmother the once lustrous dark hair was now snowwhite but the currantblack eyes had lost none of their sparkle had cats greatgrandmother cyra hafise still been alive she would easily have recognized her old friend i will she told her worried grandson pay a call upon lateefa sultan if this woman is indeed in the harem of cicalazade pasha the princess will know she chuckled richly and if this woman is anything like my lady cyra she stopped and the chuckle became a cackle of laughter aiiiiii may yahweh have mercy on the poor vizier this information did nothing to reassure eli kira of the wisdom of his course but he was a man of scrupulous honor and his familys success was due to this womans family therefore he owed her and he would pay the debt lateefa sultan was delighted to see esther kira it has been much too long she said settling the old woman comfortably and directing the slavewomen to bring sweet sherbets and the sticky paste candy that she remembered esther loved i am old beyond time my child said esther kira and it is not often i go to see friends my strength is not as it once was lateefa sultan cocked her head to one side you know that i am delighted you are here she said yet i do not fool myself that you have expended your precious strength on a mere social call the old woman nodded a new woman has recently been introduced into your husbands harem there are many new women esther they come weekly do not play word games with me my child i was old before you were born you know the one of whom i speak incili said lateefa quietly i am quite sure you mean incili what do you know of this woman my princess very little esther she was sent to my lord by his sister he is besotted with her here lateefa paused a moment it is not common knowledge yet esther but cicalazade pasha haswith my permission of coursetaken incili as his second wife esther kira sucked in her breath sharply then it must be she whom i seek will you introduce me to her lateefa sultan who is she esther how do you know of her as they were alone esther decided to take the princess into her confidence she would need her aid she was born a noblewoman in her own land said the old lady her first husband was a great lord of their country her second a greater lord she is beloved by her own king who wanted her for his mistress she is admired by the french king who would have been delighted had she remained at his court and more lateefa sultan what i would tell you now must remain a secret even from the lord cicalazade do you agree to it the princess nodded your husbands second wife is a greatgranddaughter of cyra hafise herself eighty years ago i smuggled the youngest of cyra hafises and selim is sons prince karim out of the eski serai i put him aboard a ship bound for scotland he was accompanied by my brother joseph the little prince was six years old and the last of selims sons other than his full older brother suleiman cyra hafise was afraid that the child would be a rallying point for malcontents when her husband died and suleiman ascended the throne she did not want him killed though suleiman loved his little brother he would eventually have had to dispose of the boy if his own reign was to stay troublefree an epidemic of plague struck the city that summer and cyra hafise and i arranged that it appear the little prince had the disease she took him into isolation after several days i smuggled the dead body of a child the same size as prince karim to her and i took the living child out the same way the longdecayed bones resting in the grave of prince karim are those of a poor nameless boy and that my child is why the kiras were exempted from paying taxes when sultan suleiman became our ruler neither he nor his father nor anyone else in this land knew that prince karim lived and in cyra hafises homeland of scotland only my brother joseph a priest and cyra hafises brother and father knew the childs true parentage lateefas eyes were wide in amazement and old esther kira laughed there is more my child that was just the beginning of the intrigue if you were to open the coffin of the great cyra hafise herself you would find naught but stones twice suleimans favorite wife khurremmay allah curse her memorytried to poison my dear lady my lady cyra knew but two ways to stop her either she had to go or khurrem had to go cyra hafises one weakness was that she loved her son too well she feigned her own death and returned to her homeland before she did so however she told sultan suleiman that he must be on his guard against khurrem in the future he wept and made a great protest at her secret going but he heeded her not khurrem was later responsible for the deaths of suleimans two best sonsprince mustafa and prince bajazet this left the misfit selim ii to inherit the ottoman empire do you know the day when cyra hafise actually died on the very same day that sultan suleiman did and incili is a greatgranddaughter of cyra hafise and sultan selim and a granddaughter of prince karim as you are a greatgranddaughter of firousi kadin and sultan selim and a granddaughter of guzel sultan the old woman cackled and nodded her head lateefa sultan and incili share more than a husband does she know of her imperial ancestry esther i do not know that my princess but i would imagine she knows at least some of it then why has she not spoken possibly because she was not sure how to use the information she has probably not yet decided how to escape from here escape good heavens esther why would she want to escape from here my lord is madly in love with her and she has every luxury money can buy she does not have her freedom my child in her land women are free to roam as they please as for luxury she is a fabulously wealthy woman in her own right but most important of all when she was stolen away she was a bride of two months wed to a man she has loved deeply for many years he reciprocates her feelings and it has been all my nephew in naples can do to keep him from coming with a rescue force to retrieve her you must help me to aid her in escaping lateefa sultan i would never deliberately do anything to harm my lord cica he loves incili as he has never loved anyone even me i do not want him hurt listen to me my child if incili is onetenth the woman her greatgrandmother was she will try to escape she will die trying rather than be separated forever from her true husband will that not hurt your lord cica more he is a proud man and if he is openly scorned by this woman it will hurt him more until now you have held the place of honor in your husbands heart and household but if incili remains he will soon put her above you your royal family will be publicly shamed which means the sultan will become involved who knows what he will do lateefa sultan looked wretchedly uncomfortable for a moment then she clapped her hands and a slave entered go to the lady incili and tell her that lateefa sultan has an old friend visiting whom she would like to present to her when the slave had left the room lateefa turned to esther kira i have met her only once but she is charming i know that cica will not accept a ransom for her i have never seen him this way about any woman he bitterly resents any time spent away from her and how do you think she feels asked the old woman in public she is quite reserved but obedient how she behaves in the privacy of her bedchamber i do not know she has made no effort to make friends with anyone and will be served only by her own servant who came with her the other women of the harem are fearfully jealous of her she is extravagantly beautiful esther she even makes me a little jealous esther kira smiled a little smile of remembrance her greatgrandmother she said was the most beautiful creature i have ever seen her hair was the most fantastic redgold and her eyes were greengold sultan selim worshipped her and strangely his other three wives loved her too ahhh my child those were the good days sultan selims four kadins were unselfish women devoted to the preservation of the dynasty and the empire not like those creatures living in the yeni serai today who scheme for themselves alone it began you know with that wicked khurrem and continues right down to the sultans own mother safiye who today fights with not only her sons favorite but her grandsons as well the sultans were once strong and great warriors even as your own husband cicalazade pasha it is wicked wives and mothers who have ruined them the old woman finished passionately as her words died the door to the apartment opened and a woman entered she nodded pleasantly to the princess saying good afternoon lateefa sultan i have come at your request and i thank you for including me in your party then the green eyes settled on esther kira widened for a moment and then grew puzzled the visitor said softly but it cannot be but it is the old woman chortled triumphantly i am one hundred and eight years old greatgranddaughter of cyra hafise she must have described me very well if you recognize me you are really esther kira yes child i am and lateefa sultan is your cousin for she is the greatgranddaughter of my lady cyras dearest friend firousi kadin who was your mutual greatgrandfathers second wife come my daughters you must be friendsas they were the two younger woman looked at each other for a moment and then lateefa held out her hands to cat come incili if i am to help you we should be friends and trust one another cat took the two hands in her own i have been very frightened she said now i no longer need be knowing that i have friends thank you lateefa and you also esther kira ah child said esther kira how much like my lady cyra you are when you smile but otherwise i should not know you they say i look like my greatgrandmothers mother she replied the three women sat down around a low table and the old lady leaned forward your husband my dear is still safe in naples though restraining him and your captainatarms has not been easy if you will please write and reassure him i will see that the letter is safely delivered we have yet to come up with a plan for your escape but be patient we will my tiring woman was captured with me esther and she must return with me i cannot leave her behind esther kira shrugged philosophically one is impossible two is only slightly more impossible suddenly the doors flew open and cicalazade pasha strode into their midst lateefa and cat rose quickly and bowed prettily esther kira boomed the vizier they told me you had ventured out old friend what brings you to my house i came to see the new beauty who has won your crusty heart my lord and lateefa sultan tells me the rumors in the city are true you have taken a second wife i have spent a pleasant time this afternoon being cosseted by your wives and having a good gossip the vizier beamed and put a possessive arm about each of the two young women the sultan himself would envy me my luck eh esther is my lateefa not sweet the princess gazed adoringly at her husband who glanced fondly but briefly at her before turning hungry eyes on cat and is my incili not a rare and perfect jewel esther kira saw the steel in the smile cat turned on cicalazade pasha and the tenseness of her body this woman is a survivor she thought to herself we will get her safely to her husband she signaled to a slave who helped her to her feet i must go my dears it has been a lovely visit she turned to the vizier you will let your wives come to visit with me will you not my lord of course esther of course in fact i believe my incili would enjoy being able to visit in the city she chafes at confinement dont you my dove a bit my lord cica came the softspoken reply then i will tell hammid you both have my permission to shop and visit in the city whenever you want provided of course that you go in a closed litter and are chaperoned though he spoke to them both he saw only cat come incili he said i desire your presence he looked again at esther you honor my house my friend thank you for coming lateefa will arrange a proper escort for you come incili and he and cat were gone alone lateefa said softly you see how he is esther he is wild for her he will spend the rest of this afternoon the evening and the entire night in her company only a summons from the sultan will move him from her side she does not love him my princess she endures the situation so that she may survive and escape she is made of the same steel as cyra hafise i see determination in her eyes and the same firm set of the mouth as my dear lady had lateefa sighed she is so very beautiful it is no wonder cica loves her beauty pash snorted the old woman beauty is a flower that fades quickly my child if the vizier loves her only for her beauty then he is a fool like her greatgrandmother incili is a manyfaceted woman besides you are the image of firousi kadin my dear and she was considered as lovely as cyra hafise now child i really must go help me to my litter and leaning on lateefa sultan esther kira made her way out of the courtyard chapter within the privacy of her bedchamber or his the grand vizier insisted that his second wife be completely naked her tawny gold hair was pulled back and braided in one large braid the hair mixed with jeweled ribbons she was permitted to wear her thin gold and silver bracelets and anklets she was expected to serve him unquestioningly in all his desires she did so quietly aware that this was the key to her survival outwardly sweet and calm cat raged inwardly at every humiliation this sudden thrusting of her person into an age where women counted less than horses was a terrible shock when cicalazade pasha desired incili all the other slaves were instantly dismissed from his presence he particularly enjoyed having her serve him in his bath there she was expected to join him in the warm water gently bathing his entire body with sweet soaps afterwards they rubbed one anothers bodies with scented oils these sessions generally ended as one might expect cat far from flattered could not help but feel denigrated by the viziers unquenchable desire the fact of his keeping her nude was offensive as well as a blatant invitation to his lust he was insatiable often taking her three and four times in a single night only her indomitable spirit and her passionate desire to escape kept cat unbroken most important to cat was her friendship with lateefa sultan the knowledge that they were cousins descended from selim i and that their greatgrandmothers had been the best of friends invited their own friendship lateefa told cat stories she had heard from her grandmother guzel stories of guzels childhood then the wives and children of prince selim lived above the shores of the black sea in a palace known as the moonlight serai there was a feeling of love to these stories respect for cyra hafise was also evident in them i wish i had known her said lateefa grandmother guzel and her sister my aunt hale always spoke of her with such love she treated them as she treated her own daughter nilufer sultan i knew her said cat she died when i was a child of four but i remember a beautiful and imperious old lady whose many grandchildren grandnieces and grandnephews always deferred to her in the great hall of glenkirk castle there is a large portrait of her painted just before she came to turkey it was always difficult for me to reconcile the painting of that beautiful proud young girl with the imperious elegant old woman lateefas eyes sparkled mischievously and she leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially our religion forbids the painting of the human form but firousi kadin was an artist of some talent she painted many little portraits of the family and when she died she passed them on to her daughter my grandmother guzel who passed them on to me comei will show you she clapped her hands and said to the slave who answered her summons fetch the red lacquer chest at the bottom of the large brassbound cedar chest when the small chest was carefully placed in her lap lateefa opened it reverently the box was divided into several trays lateefa gently lifted a piece of velvet from the top tray revealing six oval miniatures there were two men and four women cat recognized her own greatgrandmother and her best friend firousi kadin whose greatgranddaughter lateefa was her image the princess smiled beautiful werent they the chinese is zuleika kadin selim fs third wife the tempestouslooking girl with the ambergold eyes is sarina kadin his fourth wife the younger of the men is sultan suleiman cyras eldest son the older man is sultan selim i cat stared at these people and at their offspring whose miniatures were hidden in the subsequent trays she was particularly enchanted with the chubbycheeked toddler whom she learned was prince karimher grandfather charles leslie the first earl of sithean born and raised a scot cat had never even considered this small part of her heritage yet there was no denying that her maternal grandfather had been born an ottoman prince even if he had lived most of his life as a scot she had just as much right to the title sultan after her name as lateefa had though no one would ever know that fact it is so strange said cat for me to realize that some of these people are also my ancestors knowing it dearest incili can you not be happy with us cat sighed patiently her cousin was such a child lateefa she said quietly i am no child as cyra was when she came to this land behind me are my second husband for whom i defied my own king and my nine children i cannot simply dismiss these people from my heart i do not love cica i love my true husband lord bothwell you who do love the vizier and have been his wife for so many years should want only the best for him help me to escape my cousin help me to return to my own lord how would you feel if you were stolen from cica and forced to be wife to another do you know that the vizier always keeps me naked in his presence that i am allowed to wear only ribbons and baubles lateefa flushed a delicate rose her voice was a whisper i did not know incili he has ever been the sensualist tis why i never minded when he gathered a large harem the others sated his appetite so that after our children were born i was relatively free of his demands i do not enjoy such things do you only with my true lord and then very much each time i must pretend to submit to our lord cica it pains me i feel less a real woman more a doll a thing lateefa nodded and then confided to cat once several years ago cica and my cousin sultan mohammed had a contest to see how many virgins they could take within the period of one day mohammed won deflowering twentyfour helpless girls cica however was but one behind him so they decided the real winner would be he who had impregnated the most girls the sultan won with sixteen ripe maidens only nine of cicas girls bore children lateefa please cat protested let us visit esther kira tomorrow i must plan my escape or i shall go mad and see if our friend hammid can find some tempting young charmers to divert cica from my bed even if only occasionally the princess nodded sympathetically and on the following day the viziers two wives honored the kira house with a visit there cat was able to write a brief note to francis assuring him of her safety her love for him and her desire to be speedily reunited with him she saw the note dispatched and then turning to esther she asked have you come up with a plan for my escape yet esther kira possibly but your husband will have to come to istanbul to aid us in our plan she looked to lateefa go into the garden my child when cicalazade pasha asks you if you know how incili escaped i should prefer you to answer honestly that you do not know the princess nodded her agreement and gratitude and left them alone i would the old woman continued have your husband come to us traveling the same route you will return by if it is familiar to him it will be easier later your pursuers will not expect you to travel overland so you will do just that at least partway you will leave by small boat and go down the sea of marmara through the dardanelles into the aegean sea once there you will cross to the island of lemnos and from there to thessaly you will enter the peneus river at its mouth and travel upstream to its source in the mountains when you can go no farther on the peneus you will continue on foot across the hills to the aous river where a second boat will await you you will then sail it all the way downstream into the adriatic sea and cross over to italy both these rivers run through sparsely populated areas and except for two small towns on the peneus you should encounter no one there is always danger of recapture however for you travel exclusively within the boundaries of the ottoman empire until you land in italy if you are caught it will mean death better death with bothwell than life with cicalazade pasha said cat fiercely when esther kira when the old woman shook her head i never expected to meet another like cyra hafise what do they feed you in that wild land of your birth incili that makes its women so determined cat smiled slowly the smile lighting her face with savage joy they feed us freedom esther kira large doses of pure freedom selfreliance and independence now when when will i be able to shake the dust of this land from my slippers patience child first we must smuggle your husband and his man into constantinople then we must keep them hidden here and wait for the right moment when it arrives you must come at once bringing nothing but your servant what you need we will supply you will tell me when he is safely here esther no my child i will not if you knew you could not play the part of the viziers loving second wife i will contact you when it is time to make good your escape cat felt the tears prick at her eyelids and she swallowed back the lump in her throat you are right she admitted i would not endanger him then a thought struck her esther where did my greatgrandmother live when her son became sultan in the eski serai the old palace but it is in disrepair and damaged by fire no one has lived there since the time of selim ii why do you ask are the rooms in which my greatgrandmother lived still there yes child the rooms were sealed by order of her son at the time of her official death twentyfour years ago there was a terrible fire in the eski serai but her apartments were in the forest court separated from the rest of the harem and the fire never reached there i would go there esther kira in the rush of her secret departure cyra hafise left something behind that was very precious to her i know where it is and i want it the old ladys eyes sparkled i will take you there myself child i have not seen the eski serai since the great fire and i have not been in cyra hafises apartments in over fifty years once more before i die i would revisit my youth go into the garden and fetch lateefa sultan we will never get away from the overvigilant osman without her do you mind if she comes with us not as long as she will agree that should i find what i seek it is mine she will agree when lateefa sultan heard of what cat and old esther kira planned she clapped her hands enthusiastically i have never been in the eski serai she told them my grandmother lived outside it after her marriage and my father was born in guzels house not the palace who was your mother asked cat my mother was aisha sultan the daughter of cyra hafises only daughter nilufer sister to your grandfather then we are doubly related said cat surprised why did you not tell me what i seek could rightfully belong to you as a greatgrandchild of cyra hafise no my cousin whatever you seek you have the stronger claim since you descend through the male line while i descend from the female the right is yours and besides the lovely turquoise eyes twinkledi somehow think cyra would want you to have whatever it is you are surely more like her than i am now let us go and fend off the diligent osman so our visit may be a private one in the courtyard of the house esther kira settled herself comfortably in her own large litter while the bearers stood ready in the second litter cat sat listening while lateefa ordered their chaperon to remain behind master kira is supplying us with a dozen guards she told the eunuch esther kira and t would show incili where my greatgrandmother lived there is no need for you to go stay and continue your visit with your friend ali torn between duty and the very pleasant time he was having with the kira familys head eunuch osman hesitated as he did so cat slid from the utter her leafgreen eyes narrowing dangerously above her gossamer veil insect she hissed at him how dare you disobey my lady lateefa sultan if you do not return inside the house this instant i shall tell my lord cica of your insolence towards his first wife he will have you beaten to death for your rudeness and turning her back on him she smiled wickedly at lateefa who was struggling to hold back her laughter the frightened eunuch turned ashen and then fled into the house as the two women settled themselves into the litter lateefa chuckled softly you may have been born a scot my western cousin but there is ottoman in you and it shows when the enemy hesitates lateefa never give him a chance to regroup either his thoughts or his forcestis an old highland battle tactic the two litters were swiftly carried through the noisy streets until as the noise began to fade cat could feel the bearers straining uphill finally they stopped leaning over lateefa drew the curtains aside stepping out she offered a hand to cat who quickly joined her cousin before them stood the fireracked ruins of the oncegreat palace which had long ago crowned one of constantinoples seven hills below them sparkling in all its lateafternoon glory was the golden horn they saw the city itself and off in the distance both the yeni serai and the blue bosporus for a moment the three women stood transfixed then esther kira said come my children and i will show you the forest court where the great cyra hafise once lived she signaled to two of the guards to follow them they can hear but are mute she said with a crafty smile they can say nothing of what they see or hear they followed the old woman around the crumbling walls of the eski serai until they came to a small iron gate overgrown with weeds here esther stopped and said to their escort cut the growth just enough so that we may pass but not enough to cause notice in anyone else passing by what if the gate is locked asked lateefa it should be my dear but i was entrusted with a key which willafter all these yearsprobably still work so saying she stepped forward and carefully tried the cobwebbed lock after a moment of jiggling the cranky lock turned with a creeking noise the rusted hinges protesting the gate slowly opened remain here esther commanded their mutes and then she walked slowly into what had once been the garden of cyra hafise the area was waisthigh in ferns weeds and autumn flowers they overran the once neat boundaries of their original beds and the mossy brick walks the garden had been carefully tended until the fire of but now the hedgesuntrimmed these last twentyfour yearsstood like high green walls along the gravel paths to the amazement of the three women the fountains were still operable and filled with not only water lilies gone wild but enormous goldfish as well where does the water come from asked cat it is pumped underground from one of the old byzantine or roman aqueducts this was originally an imperial palace when mohammed the conqueror took the city from the byzantines ah there is the forest court of cyra hafise cat shivered suddenly never in her wildest dreams had she expected to be in istanbul let alone in the very palace from which her greatgrandmotherthat imperious old womanhad secretly ruled an empire this was one of the places where cyra had been young beautiful and very much loved by a great sultan cat had never before thought of cyra in this way the memory of the old woman being too strong awestruck she followed lateefa as esther kira opened a door into the building and stepped through into a dustcovered cobwebladen room all was still cat shivered again feeling about her the ghosts of the past beside her esther kira stood lost in memory as cats eyes grew accustomed to the gloom they sought and quickly found the tile fireplace wall walking over to it she carefully looked for the thistle tile mentioned by her son finding it she gently pressed the tile and it fell into her hand without a moments hesitation she reached into the opening smiling as her fingers found and curled about a hard object in a soft rotting velvet bag drawing it forth she opened the bag drew the pendant out and triumphantly held it high do your old eyes recognize this esther kira and she danced over to the old woman holding the pendant out to her esther kira nodded and smiled with remembrance the pendant made by selim i himself to celebrate the birth of his first child sultan suleiman look on the back here is his tugra why did she not take it with her incili she prized it above all her jewels in the rush of departure young ruth missed it they did not even realize it was not among her things until they reached scotland my eldest son gave me a copy of the pendant this new years since i am here i thought i should like to retrieve the original i would like you to keep it for me esther or better yet send it to the kira bank in rome for me when i escape i should not like to be encumbered with such a valuable jewel you are wise to trust me with it incili if it were found among your things it would be difficult to explain i will wager that the vizier does not give you enough pin money to account for such an expensive toy let me see it asked lateefa softly and she reverently took it from the old womans gnarled hands it is beautiful how much he loved her he placed her above all women how wonderful to be loved like that so few of us ever are sighing she handed the pendant back to esther kira who returned it to its bag and placed the bag in a pocket somewhere within her voluminous robes for a few minutes longer the women wandered about the imperial apartments of the longdead sultan valide cyra hafise cat could not shake the feeling that she was intruding replacing the thistle tile she regretted that she had not thought to ask susan along susans grandmother ruth had spent her early years in this very palace finally esther led them back out through the garden again to their litters as they returned to the kira house both cat and lateefa were strangely silent in the courtyard of the house they hugged the old lady and thanked her profusely for the tour as osman stood fussily by wanting to hurry them but not daring to do so returning to the viziers palace they talked softly of the secrets they shared bound even more closely by the afternoon cicalazade pasha awaited them impatiently his eyes were narrow his expression sulky and they should have been warned but both lateefa and cat were happy exhilarated by their outing where have you been he demanded i returned from the yeni serai to find my house deserted we have been visiting esther kira my lord said lateefa merrily she took us to the old eski serai and we showed incili where the great cyra hafise once lived it was a delightful afternoon and we thank you for giving us your permission to go i have spent the afternoon devoid of companionship complained the vizier my lord cica teased lateefa smiling winningly up at him you have the most famous harem in the empire next to my cousin the sultan i cannot believe that you were bored other than by choice without warning the viziers hand shot out and slapped lateefas face astounded she gasped her eyes filling with tears shocked for he had never been known to beat his wife the slaves stood impassive scarcely breathing but cat flew at the vizier furiously beating on his chest dont you dare touch her she raged at him she did nought to you you are unkind and unfair truly frightened now lateefa tried to pull cat away no no incili you must beg my lord cicas pardon and she attempted to draw cat down to her knees cat turned from the vizier and gently touched lateefas cheek a handprint showed white against the red never he had no right to slap you he has every right said lateefa desperately trying to stem the anger she saw burning in cicalazades grayblue eyes he is our lord and master we are nothing but that which he makes us incili you cant really believe that pleaded cat turning lateefa knelt before the vizier her head touching the toe of his outstretched boot forgive me my insolence my lord and forgive her also she is still new to our ways and i know she meant no harm cicalazade pasha put a gentle hand on lateefas head i will forgive her for your sake my dear but she must still be punished lest others in my house think i am a weak master he nodded curtly to two eunuchs who grasped cat by the arms take her to the whipping post and prepare her for punishment he commanded oh my lord sobbed lateefa raising a tearstained face to him please do not whip incili she is my friend the vizier again nodded to a eunuch take the lady lateefa to her apartments he said quietly afraid lateefa obeyed him the eunuchs dragged cat into the center of the courtyard where after removing her jacket they chained her between two posts her gauze blouse was ripped away entirely baring not only her long lovely back but her full breasts slowly the vizier walked across the courtyard and stood silent beside her for what seemed an eternity then cruelly grasping her tawny hair he pulled her head back and said in a soft voice the punishment will be mild this time incili but never defy me again publicly or otherwise i adore you my jewel but i will not be shamed that is why i will personally mete out this chastisement if you will beg my pardon i will cease otherwise you will receive the full twenty lashes he bent his head and kissed her fiercely laughing softly she bit him on the lower lip drawing blood little bitch he loosed her head and she heard him walk back across the courtyard where osman waited with the whip fool the vizier swore at a eunuch ply the lash i dont want her skin marked like a crocodiles the suspense was terrible and cat felt her heart pounding with a mixture of fright and anger the whip cracked several times as the vizier tested it and her stomach heaved uneasily then she heard a sharp hiss and the first blow touched her back her teeth bit into her own lip now also drawing blood the third blow drew a soft moan from her the fifth a small cry on the eighth she could bear no more she screamed unable to bear the cruel pain for he was not being gentle her back was afire and the pain grew worse with each blow yet she would not beg his pardon finally unable to endure any more she fainted but osman was quickly there waving a burnt feather beneath her nose dragging her back to the terrible reality of consciousness miserable woman he chortled you will not escape your punishment forcing her eyes open she glared at him with an icy green stare she heard hammids voice saying you are a fool to antagonize her osman the lady incili is not out of favor nor is she likely to be she is only disobedient then the chief eunuchs face came into view yield to him my daughter the whip bit into her burning back never she managed to gasp as the blackness rose up to claim her again the eunuch shook his head then called out she craves your pardon my lord the look on his face dared osman to challenge his word release her commanded cicalazade pasha and see that her back is tended to at once i shall expect her in my bed later this evening they carried her to her apartments where both lateefa and a whitefaced susan waited carefully the slavewoman removed the rest of cats clothing and she was placed stomach down on her bed her back was a mass of angry red welts and susan began to weep how could he how could he no one has ever treated my lady thus no one do not weep girl said lateefa kindly it looks worse than it really is see the lash was plied and the skin is not broken there will be no scars and in a few days both the pain and the welts will be gone then she carefully bathed the injured back herself with cool water and gently rubbed a palegreen cream into the welts its a special salve she told susan and it will take some of the pain from the welts now sit by your mistress until i return lateefa hurried through the corridors of the palace to her husbands apartments i would beg leave to speak with you alone she said humbly dismissing the slaves he motioned for her to sit by him i myself have cared for incilis injuries my lord but she will be unavailable to you for at least two or three days she is yet unconscious and running a slight fever you punished her cruelly cica had the lash not been plied you could have killed her she will be all right he asked anxiously and lateefas heart contracted at the worry in his voice esther kira is right she thought i did not mean to hurt her the vizier continued but she was so defiant she would not beg my pardon until eleven lashes had been meted out what did you expect cica asked lateefa quietly this is no peasant girl youve taken for your second wife this is a proud european noblewoman she is used to speaking her mind i am trying to teach her our ways but it will take time you must be patient with her you like her he said i am glad i am glad that you have become friends yes we are friends cica now please my lord give her a few days to heal both her back and her spirit she will not forgive you easily this time i am afraid you will have to amuse yourself with your harem you have ignored them shamefully since incili came and there is an outright rebellion there my lord hammid can tell you very well he acquiesced sulkily i give her three days at the end of that time i expect her back in my bed docile and obedient to my will lateefa bit back the smile that threatened to burst forth it will be as you wish my lord husband she answered him quietly and she left him to return to cats bedchamber how is she she asked susan still unconscious a bit restless too my lady go to your bed mara your mistress received this punishment in defense of me it is only right that i sit with her tonight bring me my embroidery before you retire during the first few hours lateefa sultan sat quietly plying her needle twice she trimmed the wicks of the lamps and refilled them with scented oil once she rubbed the green salve into cats back again her eyes grew tired and blurred with the ache of watching the colored threads on the snowwhite linen she admired the beautiful lines of her cousins back and buttocks wondering if she really enjoyed a mans lovemaking as she said or if she hated it as lateefa did within the harem there were those women who loved each other lateefa knew this sort of thing was forbidden but the eunuchs had a tendency to turn a blind eye to it as a happy woman caused less trouble than an unhappy one lateefa was above the women of the harem by birth and by rank none of them would dare approach her and she had never approached any of them she wondered whether a woman lover would be as rough as cicalazade was cat moaned still unconscious and turned over calling francis francis lateefa was stunned by the beauty of her cousins breasts and torso they were flawless and creamy bending over lateefa said softly hush incili its all right now my dear but cat called again francis francis oh yes my love yes lateefa could not understand the words for they were not turkish but she could see from the look on her cousins face what it was she dreamed about it was the face of a woman being made love to by a man she adored cat thrashed slightly fearful that she would injure herself lateefa reached out to quiet her her hand brushed the unconscious womans breast instantly the nipple sprang erect and cat moaned unable to help herself lateefa reached out and caressed the soft globe of rounded flesh feeling a thrill as the beautiful woman on the bed strained to her touch trembling the princess rose from her chair and divested herself of her robes she lay down on the bed next to cat her shaking hands caressing the naked body of her unconscious cousin careful to avoid the sore back cat writhed beneath the touch lateefa bent her head eagerly licking cats nipples cat moaned again and lateefa turned over on her stomach her fingers teasing at her own womanhood her hips moving against the action of her own hand until she collapsed with a great sigh of relief onto the mattress for a few minutes she lay there flushed her breath ragged then she rose from the bed dressed and picked up her embroidery she sat back down in her chair stunned by what she had done in the beginning of their marriage cica had often made her caress him and she had hated it she had not hated touching cat cats skin was smooth and lovely she dozed to be awakened later by susans gentle touch let me watch now my lady said the girl softly nodding her silent thanks lateefa sultan gratefully departed for her own bed and for the shy pretty new slavegirl she had recently acquired who would be waiting up for her the girl was lonely and frightened lateefa knew several times her hands had touched her mistress intimately blushing prettily with confusion the girl had begged her pardon lateefa had thought nothing of it now however she knew that the girl would respond to her favor and her kindness should she decide to proffer them cicalazade pasha might take ten women to his bed every night his wife lateefa sultan no longer intended being lonely chapter three nights later her back sufficiently healed cat was back in cicalazades bed her return was a sulky and defiant one but the vizier was bored with the succession of compliant beauties who had recently shared his bed and chose to be amused rather than angry it was this very show of independence that made her interesting to him though cat came to understand his position she could not forgive him the christian new year of began and cat standing alone on lateefas terrace overlooking the sea found herself straining to hear the sound of the glenkirk bagpipe a single tear slid down her cheek and she wondered if francis were with the kiras yet the winter deepened and the viziers passion for her did not abate she no longer fought against him having accepted that she must endure her fate until she could change it with the new year she instinctively knew that bothwell was near soon she would escape the early spring came and with it arrived problems along the hungarianaustrian border of the empire the sultan would send cicalazade pasha to the border mohammed iii was a big man with fair skin deep brown eyes and black hair beard and mustache he could be kinder than most and crueler than any man alive upon his ascension four years earlier he had ordered the execution of his nineteen brothers the oldest of whom was eleven and he had drowned the seven of his fathers concubines who had had the misfortune to be pregnant his sexual appetite was legendary his beautiful venetian mother safiye had encouraged his every desire in an effort to remain in control of him the sultan had one admirable trait he was loyal to those who were loyal to him and treated the men who served him with great kindness and generosity noting the crestfallen expression on his viziers face he asked what is it that stems your enthusiasm cica a year ago you would have been eager for an assignment like this one the vizier sighed you will think me a fool my padishah but last year i took a second wife and i am saddened at the thought of being away from her the sultans eyes glittered i had heard that she is an exquisite creature is it true then cicalazade pasha sighed again she consumes me with her beauty take her with you then there is nothing unusual about a woman on campaign with her master thank you my lord but no said the vizier genuine regret in his voice if i took incili with me i should not attend to my lords best interests the sultan chuckled i am grateful that you put our interests above your lust but tell me cica do you dare to leave lateefa and your new wife together they will undoubtedly tear each other and your house apart in your absence nay sire tis amazing but they are like sisters in fact several months ago i was obliged to chastise lateefa and incili flew at me like a vixen in an effort to defend her friend i beat her for her insolence of course the sultan nodded sympathetically you were wise my friend women are good only for one thing they must ever be taught who is master then he clapped his vizier on the shoulder cheer up my friend youll only be gone a few months and think how eager your incili will be for your return the two men laughed companionably and then the sultan said if lateefa and incili are friends cica why not have them both in the same bed with you taking two women at once is delicious he lowered his voice so that only cicalazade would hear him the viziers eyes narrowed then grew wide and he replied i will try that when i get home my lord it sounds most diverting the sultans eyes were dreamy it is my friend it is very diverting then he grew businesslike again i will have yakub bey see to the readiness of your troops he is to be your secondincommand take your wife incili to your island for a few days but be ready to leave a week from now allah go with you cicalazade pasha rode back through the late morning to his palace have incili transported to the island of a thousand flowers within the next few hours he commanded hammid i want the island well stocked with fruits nuts coffee sherbets eggs and sweets one hot meal daily is to be delivered in the early evening i will allow only two servants on the island to serve us send incilis woman mara and a young eunuch towards midafternoon cat found herself being rowed down the bosporus in the viziers caique susan sat opposite her wideeyed and a young eunuch sat in the front of the boat why asked susan are we being hurried to the island because the vizier is being sent to quell a disturbance and will not be back for several months she lowered her voice and spoke in scots english just a little while more susan and i shall be free of him for the next few months she did not tell her serving woman that she had received a message from esther kira that very afternoon shoved into her hand by a jewelry vendor visiting the viziers harem the message had read make an excuse to stay on the island when it is time for the vizier to leave she had later burned the paper in a brazier amazed that the kiras already knew the viziers plans when she herself had only just learned of them unused to the east she could not know that gossip was important in keeping up with current events at the same time the vizier had been with the sultan esther kira had been with the sultans mother after the vizier had left the palace the sultan had joined his mother and her elderly friend for coffee he related with some amusement how loath was his good friend cica to leave his new bride they had all enjoyed a good laugh at the viziers expense esther kira had returned home to inform francis stewarthepburn that he would in a few days time be reunited with his wife the plan was really quite simple they would wait until the vizier and his army were several days march from the city and then lord bothwell and conall would take the island killing the slaves it would be several days more before the viziers household discovered the absence of incili and mara by that time they would all be on the aegean of all this cat knew nothing when they arrived on the island cat delighted in showing susan the gardens they were alone but for a white eunuch feisal the caique having returned to the viziers palace cat showed the two servants the two tiny cubicles where they were to remain once the master arrived they were expected to be useful but as invisible as possible no sooner had the vizier arrived than he commanded cat to remove her garments she protested i spend a fortune on clothes and jewels to please you my lord cica and you rarely allow me to wear them wear them for your friends i love you as allah fashioned you pouting she obeyed him slowly and teasingly removing each article of clothing as his eyes glittered hungrily susan then served them a hot supper cat noted that the meal was filled with foods and spices considered conducive to lovemaking she shuddered imperceptibly knowing that the next three days would be exhausting when the dishes had been cleared away the vizier told susan you may sleep mara but tell feisal to remain on call in his chamber yes master replied susan as she left the room now he turned his gaze on cat come here incili and she moved around the low table next to him drawing her across his lap he sighed with contentment as his hands began caressing her look at me he commanded and she raised her green eyes to meet his grayblue ones it was as she had feared the pupils of his eyes were dilated and tiny gold flames danced within them he had obviously consumed a quantity of aphrodisiacs and would be utterly insatiable she trembled and he laughed as if he knew her thoughts his deep voice was low and intimate we do not have to hurry my love indeed we will not and his free hand slid between her legs to caress her she felt her strength ebbing as the familiar languorous feelings began to wash over her at first his touch was delicate but it soon became an irritation she tried to squirm away from him but he held her fast cat began to experience a warmth where he touched her and a moan escaped her she could not believe it but she was fast losing control of herself sliding away into a rainbow world where exquisite sensation followed exquisite sensation until she was gasping with a passion she was unable to stop it occurred to her vaguely that he had fed her the same aphrodisiacs he had taken frightened she cried out and tried to sit up but he gently lifted her from his lap and placed her carefully on the colored cushions her fairskinned body in startling contrast against the deep rich colors of the velvets and satins looming over her he looked like a colossus as he stripped his wide trousers off her heart beat wildly at the sight of his long smooth wellmuscled legs he knelt and pushing her legs up found with his mouth the place where his fingers had lately been soon satisfied that he had rendered her mindless he drew her legs back down pulling himself up he drove into her she sobbed with relief he thrust cruelly back and forth deliberately hurting her yet the pain he inflicted was a part of the wildly sensual experience and she relished it he caught a nipple in his teeth and bit down sharply on it she screamed and tried to twist away but then his hot tongue licked furiously at the injured nipple soothing away the hurt she began to shiver violently and unable to control it she panicked desperately she sought to escape the man responsible for what was happening to her but now his passion mounting uncontrollably he was unreachable she fought him she was being violently assaulted buffeted by a stronger sexual force than she had ever known and she simply couldnt handle it then suddenly it was over and she was falling falling away into the sweet peaceful darkness of unconsciousness a gentle stroking of her body was her first awareness of returning consciousness cat lay quietly with her eyes closed her whole being rebelled at this sensuous man who called her wife yet treated her solely as an object for his pleasure open your eyes incili she obeyed keeping her lashes modestly lowered lest he see the terrible mixture of fear and repulsion she felt it is time for you to bathe me incili yes my lord cica she answered rising from the bed she walked across the room to the bath she was amazed that her legs could hold up at her call the eunuch came and the bath was made ready her slim fingers decanted the bottles holding the both oils she sniffed each finally choosing an attar of roses pouring it into the tub she dismissed the eunuch and called to the vizier your bath is ready my lord naked cicalazade pasha came into the bath where cat waited to serve him he stood quietly while she laved his body with warm water now her hands were gently rubbing a soft soap over his broad chest and back kneeling she soaped his legs and his genitals quivered she quickly caught up a boarsbristle brush and scrubbed him down sluicing him once more with warm fresh water there my lord she said briskly you may now soak in your tub the voice that answered her was amused thank you my love wash quickly and join me and he submerged himself in the large square greentiled pool slowly she soaped herself putting off the moment when she must join him in the bath he watched her from beneath hooded eyelids knowing almost precisely what she was thinking and thoroughly enjoying her discomfort he kept her nude and forced her to these menial duties in an attempt to tame her too her helplessness gave him a delicious feeling of power the pleasure he gained from this constant battle between them was far better than the easy conquest of a dozen other beautiful women finally unable to delay any longer she was forced to enter the heavily scented tub he immediately reached out and drew her against him her soft breasts straining against his chest the tender nipples irritated by the dark furry mat of his chest his mouth closed over hers for the first time that evening his probing tongue almost gagging her he drew her arms around his neck then his hands slid beneath the water to cup her buttocks and pressing her against the back of the tile tub wall he raised her up and impaled her on his hardness she gasped her surprise but the sound was muffled by his lips pressing fierce little thrusts into her he released his passion and then held her more tenderly for she was halffainting chuckling happily at his sense of dominance he vaulted quickly from the water and reaching down drew her out weakened by the warm water and the viziers lovemaking but still obedient to her duties she picked up a warmed towel from the top of the tile stove and wrapped it about him taking a second towel she sat him down and dried him careful to rub the dampness from between his toes stretching him out face down on a marble bath bench she massaged his muscled body with body cream smelling of roses as her hands skillfully kneaded the firm body he rumbled contentment like a large sleek cat finally he called enough and rose up to reveal a once again engorged organ laughing at the look on her face he said the night has just begun incili and i have yet to get enough of you i must somehow cool the fires you create in my loins if we are to be parted for several months she was shaking holding out her hands she pleaded with him please my lord husband no more not just yet it was if she had not spoken catching her hands he forced her facedown onto the same marble bench and straddling her he parted her thighs and entered her gently from behind his hands raised her a little so he could fondle her breasts he crushed the warm flesh in his big hands reveling in its softness pinching the nipples so that she cried out in that moment cats tolerance of cicalazade pasha vanished he was using her like an animal without any thought for her at all only the knowledge that she would soon be free of him kept her from shrieking her fury as it was her temples had begun to throb grunting with pleasure he finally loosed her and rose up exclaiming i have labored hard so far this evening and i am thirsty fetch me a sherbet my dove she stood for a moment on trembling legs then left the bath and crossed the bedchamber to the table where the sherbet decanters stood mixing his favorites together she looked carefully to see where he was and found him sprawled on the bed looking up through the glass dome at the night sky with a thumbnail she carefully flicked open the top of her turquoise ring and dropped a pinch of white powder into his cup esther kira had given her the sleeping potion but she had never dared use it before tonight however she could take no more and she knew that the aphrodisiacs he had consumed would confuse him anyway she smilingly crossed the room and presented him with the cup he drank it down thirstily and carelessly flinging the cup to the floor pulled her onto the bed you are so beautiful he said how you please me incili you please me greatly did you know that my jewel i treasure you above all my women never has a mere female delighted me so much she pressed her face into his shoulder so he might not see it it makes me happy that i pleasure you my lord husband she lied smoothly he groped for her breasts fumbling at her his movements beginning to become clumsy then suddenly she heard him snore lightly she eased herself out of his grasp and lay apart from him waiting to see whether he missed her he was sound asleep drugged by the white powder she had slipped into his sherbet in the morning she would add a different powder to his coffee one which would counteract the effect of the aphrodisiacs and render him almost desireless that should keep her safe for at least part of the day rising from the rumpled bed she returned to the bath filling and refilling the silver ewer she laved herself over and over washing away all evidence of the past hour the bath was the one aspect of turkish life she truly enjoyed dry again she slipped a sheer nightgarment over her head when he awoke he would object and demand its removal but for now she would have some protection from the cool night air laying herself at the farthest edge of the bed she wrapped herself in a light wool blanket and immediately fell asleep when she awoke the sun was already rising cicalazade pasha lay sprawled on his back snoring mightily much as she had left him last night she stretched and unrolling herself from the blanket got up the air was chilly so she lifted from her trunk a soft white wool caftan and slid it over her nightgown she slipped her feet into a pair of woollined slippers and checking again to be sure the vizier was asleep she ran out into the garden the wet grass glistened diamondlike in the early sunlight and the beds of tulips and narcissus were just beginning to open and perfume the air a faint silvery haze hung just above the dark sea and the surrounding hillsides were brightgreen with spring growth for a few minutes she was free again and she reveled in it if she could get through the next two days and could convince cica to let her remain on the island the kiras would liberate her obviously it would be easier to free her from the island than from cicalazades palace she was sorry she had not been able to say goodbye to lateefa when she was safe again she would send her kindly cousin a message through the kiras suddenly a smile lit cats face she had just thought how she could convince the vizier to leave her on the island for a few days she would use his masculine pride against him to gain her own ends it would serve the bastard right it bothered cicalazade that she had not become pregnant he knew she had borne nine living children and he had sired lateefas children and forty on the harem women besides he longed for a child of her body and not knowing of the potion she took to prevent conception could not understand why she had not swelled with his fruit she would tell him she believed she was pregnant pleading the strange fancies of a breeding woman she would beg to remain a few extra days on the island should he refuse her she would weep and pout to gain her way he would expect it as he had no view of women other than as soft foolish creatures a little breeze had sprung up and cat shivered in anticipation she always enjoyed mapping battle strategy laughing to herself she wondered which side of her ancestry was asserting itselfthe scots or the turkish chapter no said the vizier firmly i will not allow it incili she burst into tears you do not love me she sobbed you have stolen me from my husband and used me like an animal you care nothing for me would that the child and i were dead child his mouth fell open what child she raised a teary face to him i am not completely sure my lord for it is a trifle too early to be entirely sure but there is a strong possibility that i am with child a look of incredulous delight passed over his face and she nearly allowed herself a twinge of guilt a child he breathed then my dove there can be no question of your remaining here i will not endanger my son she forced a fresh torrent of tears from her eyes i cannot bear to be penned within the harem right now my lord husband it is so pleasant and peaceful here she lowered her voice so that he was forced to bend down in order to hear her it also allowed him a wonderful view of her swelling breasts the seductive scent that issued from the valley between those glorious bills was deliriously overpowering to the vizier we have spent so many joyous hours here my husband it is the one place i do not have to share with anyone even my dear lateefa she caught at his arm and pressed it meaningfully we have yet another wonderful day ahead of us and her lashes fanned down over her pink cheeksanother wonderful night let me remain here dreaming but a few days after you leave me i need a few more days to be completely sure it would make me so happy dont you want me to be happy my husband and her green eyes filled with tears that threatened to overflow while her soft mouth pouted he was tolerantly amused by the obviousness of her approach she was so typically predictably feminine and it delighted him the look she cast up at him bespoke a night of incredible pleasures should he consent to her wishes and he could honestly see no harm in allowing her to have her way in this she was no girl swelling with her first child she was a successful and a proven breeder he knew that pregnant women had strange whims which should be indulged whenever possible she would be perfectly safe on his island with her female servant for companionship but he intended sending back osman and half a dozen others so there would be protectionnot that anyone would dare to intrude on his island he tried to look stern and thoughtful and she knew she had won very well he said i will allow you to remain for a week but osman will come to guard you of course my lord she answered him demurely he pulled her across his lap into his arms do i not get a reward my dove she pulled his head down and kissed him deeply and convincingly beginning another session of sensuality in the morning he left the island in his caique and was rowed back down the bosporus to his palace in the city where he made arrangements for cats stay on the island she stood on the stone quay waving him goodbye but no sooner was he out of hearing than she whirled about with joy shouting in her own language goodbye my lord vizier farewell forever susan was astounded at cats behavior my lady are you all right better than i have been in almost a year my girl laughed cat now that he is gone i dare tell ye my beloved francis is near and yer uncle conall too i dinna know when but well be rescued in a few days at the most thank god breathed susan fervently twill nae be easy cat warned her we hae a long and dangerous journey ahead of us but i should rather die wi bothwell than spend my days a pampered wife of cicalazade pasha then yer nae wi bairn he said ye were and that i should take extra care of ye gods bones no id nae bear that lustful devils bairn twas but an excuse so we might remain here tis easier to escape from here than from the viziers palace now keep yer wits about ye girl osman and a few others will be arriving later today to aid feisel in protecting me ye must nae gie them any reason to be suspicious of us will my lord kill the eunuchs here of course well need all the time we can get for a head start before they discover us gone good i hate osman and i want him dead cat looked at susan with amazement why what has he done to you they had climbed back up to the top of the island they sat down on a marble bench by the edge of a small goldfish pond ye know that eunuchs dinna function as normal men said susan but there are several ways of gelding a male some have the rod and sac cut away these are usually small children boys who are older are gelded by simply cutting the sac away so they may not reproduce though they are not supposed to they can function with the aid of special drugs they cannot have children of course osman is one of these if a girl takes a eunuchs fancy she stopped well they have several ways of satisfying themselves and osman singled ye out said cat furiously he dared why did ye nae tell me girl i would hae put an instant stop to it i thought ye had enough to contend wi my lady said susan simply cat put an arm about her servant and hugged her ah susan when we are safely out of this i swear yell nae lack for anything ever again as yer greatgrandmam and yer grandmother were loyal to my ancestress so hae ye been faithful to me i will nae forget it we are family my lady though ye be the mistress and i the tiring woman a leslie dinna forget his own aye susan a leslie dinna forget replied cat and as the two women sat quietly watching the fantail goldfish cavorting in the small bluetiled pool bothwell impatiently paced a room in the kiras instanbul house his wife had been kidnapped almost a year ago in the early summer of in midseptember of the same year lord bothwell and conall moreleslie had begun a dangerous journey sailing a small fishing boat from brindisi across the adriatic sea to elyria and the mouth of the aous river they had entered the river by night and sailed up it for many days until they could go no farther they had then left the boat after dragging it ashore and well back into a hidden cave as they hiked across the mountain forest the weather remained mild and they encountered no snow reaching the headwaters of the peneus river in thessaly they found following pietro kiras directions another wellstocked boat waiting with the boat was a young man who introduced himself as asher kira the son of eli asher kira was to escort them safely to the kira house in istanbul and he would teach them the rudiments of jewish domestic life bothwell and conall were to be introduced into the household as a distant cousin and his servant come to study the business methods of the main branch of the kira bank this would deflect curiosity and allow the two men freedom to move about the city bothwell had grown a fine bushy auburn red beard for disguise and dressed in the baggy pants widesleeved blouse turban and embroidered sash and vest of the country he was the very essence of the turkish citizen conall with his black beard was even more impressive asher kira had piloted them successfully and they had arrived in istanbul in middecember of the trip had taken them exactly three months it was now april of and bothwell had been waiting several months now for a chance to rescue his wife late one afternoon a servant entered the room where he was working on accounts and told him that esther kira would speak with him in her garden when he entered the old womans presence she motioned him to the bench next to her though she looked as if a puff of wind could blow her away her voice was strong and her gaze unwavering how do you get on my friend she asked him well madame but i grow more anxious daily to complete my mission i spent this morning at the palace the vizier will be leaving the city for the hungarian province in a few days i would say that you will be able to retrieve your property several days after hes gone is she all right yes but it has not been easy for her and the next few days will be the hardest she knows the time is near and she must use all her wiles to convince him to leave her on his island that is the safest place for the rescue i have thought and thought and there is simply no way to take her from the viziers palace without raising an immediate hue and cry which would bring almost certain recapture with all its ensuing difficulties the island is the only place we may take her from and still have time for getting away she stopped for a moment my lord she spoke gently to him my lord theres something you must know you were told that the vizier prizes incili above all women you were not told that after he obtained his royal wifes permission he made incili his second wife bothwell swore a ripe oath under his breath and esther smiled briefly before continuing so my lord you will not simply be retrieving your wife you will also be stealing his francis began to laugh what is it about the wench that all men who love her want to make her their wife he chuckled my poor cousin no sooner took his royal danish bride for dynastic purposes than he was trying to force cat to accept the position of maitress en titre her first husband patrick leslie had to chase her over half of scotland for almost a year before he could get her to the altar and i may god help me ended up an exile without lands or country foramong other alleged sinstrying to make her my wife now you tell me that cicalazade pasha asked permission of his royal ottomon wife to take my wife for his own the old womans cackling laughter joined bothwells deep chuckle stopping she wiped her damp eyes and said we will go over our plans in a few days part viii the escape chapter she straggled up through the blackness fighting the smothered feeling that overwhelmed her clawing at the hard hand clamped over her mouth full consciousness returned as the voice in her ear became wonderfully familiar shhh lovetis metis francis her eyes flew open and then widened at the sight of the bearded man bending over her the hand was taken away catching her breath she laughingly sobbed damn me bothwell ye look like the sultan himself then the tears spilled out of her and she flung herself at him weeping soundlessly holding her closely he smoothed the head beneath his hand and said in a gentle teasing voice can i not go off to earn us a living madame without yer getting captured by pirates yeve led me a fine chase to be sure her shoulders shook all the harder sweetheart tis all right he soothed i am here to take ye home dinna weep lass yeve been so brave esther kira has told me how brave yeve been she squirmed out of his grasp and turned a stricken face up to him do ye love me bothwell for a moment he looked stunned and then he mused now let me think a bit ive crossed three seas and come through two straits i must now turn about and go back the same way dragging two women wi me it will be a bloody miracle if we get to italy alive perhaps i did it for the adventure of it christ madame what do ye think i am used bothwell i am terribly used i hae been the viziers favorite do ye still want me back he began to laugh then became serious again my ever honest cat do ye think i dinna know what yer life has ben angela di licosa made it very plain what kind of a man her brother was if all i wanted was a body in my bed cat i mightthough not easily ill admithave substituted another woman for ye he wound her tawny hair about his hand and pulled her to him his mouth gently brushed hers and his warm sapphireblue eyes smiled down at her but then my dearest love who would have sworn at me in gaelic or helped me to raise our bairns or talked wi me of scotland on the long winter nights in the years to come she caught her lip in her teeth and her eyelids closed in a futile attempt to hold back the hot tears that poured again down her cheeks aye cat i love ye he said now let us stop this foolishness in less than two hours the sun will be risingtis best if were quickly gone from here the guards she asked conall and i dispatched them there were six did ye kill them all aye the bodies where they died no the vultures will get them and the birds will be seen by the peasants someone is bound to get curious and investigate the supplies for my weeks stay came yesterday no one will come here for at least a week unless something is amiss weigh the bodies with stones and sink them into the sea then there will be no carrion for the birds and therefore no curiosity he shook his head admiringly madame ye constantly surprise me he said and handed her a bundle from the floor yer traveling clothes get dressed while i get conall and attend to the other business susan is waiting in the boat go down to the landing when yer ready and dinna be fearful of the young man theretis esthers greatgrandson asher he goes with us partway tis nae the young men who frighten me bothwell standing up he grinned rakishly at her yer a fetching sight madame with yer pretty tits pointing at me like that would that we had some time this bed looks comfortable never here she answered him vehemently ive spent too many unhappy hours here id sooner be tumbled under a hedgerow once we are safely away from here madame i will see if i can accommodate ye he chuckled and ducked a wellaimed pillow laughing he ran from the kiosk cat sprang from the bed i am alive again she thought triumphantly once more i have survived and she laughed aloud as she undid the bundle he had given her she found womens underclothes but the darkblue pantaloons white shirt vest sash boots and turban of a young man dressing quickly she pinned her hair tightly and covered it with a bandanna before placing the little turban on her head pulling on the boots she stood up and wrapped the sash about her waist catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror she unwrapped the sash removed her shirt and bound her full breasts with a linen cloth then she dressed again adding the embroidered vest over her shirt another look in the mirror brought a smile to her face no one looking at the young man would suspect him of being the viziers beautiful second wife she looked about the room a final time but there was nothing she wanted to take with her from her conversations with esther kira cat knew that whatever she needed for the long journey would be provided by the kira family she would take none of the jewelry given her by the vizier on her right hand she wore the heartshaped ruby that had been given her by patrick leslie and the turquoise ring esther kira had given her to hold potions on her left hand was the great emerald wedding band francis had given her she needed nothing else she didnt even turn back for a last look as she went through the kiosk door she walked swiftly through the lovely gardens it gave her a savage pleasure to think that the man who had used her body as he might have used a dumb animal would no longer enjoy his beautiful island that would be her small revenge on cicalazade pasha he would always associate the island with her and he would quickly hate his pleasure palace with its hundred memories suddenly she stumbled over a body in the center of the neat gravel path it was osman she felt no regret stepping over it she continued on her way carefully descending to the quay where the boat waited exactly one week later the viziers caique arrived to take his wife back to the palace there was no one waiting on the quay and after several minutes the oarmaster climbed the stone steps to the islands top he found both the gardens and the kiosk empty he called out for osman but his voice died in the clear morning air it was frighteningly obvious that the island was deserted running back down the steps to the caique the oarmaster shouted back to the palace the caique made a tight turn and glided back down the bosporus the way it had come the oarmaster did not even wait for his boat to dock but leaped to the landing and ran at top speed to find hammid finding him with the lady lateefa sultan the oarmaster flung himself to his knees and cried disaster hammid there is no one living or dead on the island of a thousand flowers it is deserted i searched myself lateefa sultan watched as hammid turned ashen momentarily her loyalties were torn between the eunuch who had been with her almost her entire life and the beautiful woman who was her cousin she was genuinely sorry about hammids position but she was relieved that incili was gone the immediate problem was hammid cica pasha was going to hold him responsible for incilis loss and his anger would be fierce i will go to the island myself said the eunuch you must be mistaken there has to be someone there there is no one i tell you repeated the oarmaster i even called out the island is deserted change the rowers commanded the eunuch i am going several hours later he returned and sought lateefa sultan the island is indeed empty there are no signs of violence no blood no bodies nothing it is as if they never existed what am i to tell the master my princess he adores incili she was to bear his child what cani say to him he will kill me this last was said with a sad finality and lateefa felt so sorry for the eunuch that she was almost tempted to tell him the truthalmost but not quite tell him the truth hammid you obeyed his orders you sent osman and four others to the island as my lord cica instructed you sent supplies for seven days and at the end of that time you sent the caique there has been no report of trouble why should you suspect that anything was amiss is it your fault the island was deserted i must go back to the island tomorrow said hammid grimly there has to be something that will tell me what happened i will find it do what you think is best answered lateefa sultan the following day hammid returned to the island of a thousand flowers knowing he would spend a restless night otherwise he had gulped a strong sedative so he might sleep and be clearheaded for his task slowly he ascended to the garden eyes on the ground carefully studying the gravel paths there had been no rain to wash away any evidence such as blood for seven days the starlight kiosk was silent he opened the doors and stood for a moment observing the room the huge bed was rumpled and unmade the faint imprint of her head still on the pillow he walked closer and saw that her sleeping garment lay where she had thrown it nothing else in the room was out of place her clothes and jewels were neatly stored in her chest nothing was missing there were no signs of force eight people were missing and he had absolutely no idea where they were or how they had gone but he was going to do his best to find out it was all well and good for lateefa to say that he must tell the truth to the vizier but what truth my lord vizier your second wife has mysteriously disappeared and we know not how cicalazade pasha was not going to accept that outside again in the garden he gazed out over the bosporus the sunlight dappled the blue waters and then suddenly he saw it six dark patches were contrasted against the aquamarine of the sea hurrying as quickly as his bulk would allow he returned to the quay and spoke in low tones with the oarmaster the caique was rowed out a bit into the stream and one of the rowers stripped of his clothes dove deep into the bosporus he surfaced moments later and was pulled aboard what is down there demanded hammid the rower shivered bodies lord six bodies all with their throats cut hammid nodded return to the palace he said sinking wearily to the cushions now he knew or thought he knew what had happened to incili the eunuchs had been taken by surprise and murdered incili had been carried off but remembering the neatness of the kiosk he revised his theory incili had escaped but who had helped her she was in a strange land cloistered from the world yet she had managed to find aid and escape as he searched his mind he kept returning to one constant esther kira the venerable grande dame of the house of kira was the only person from outside the palace who had known incili yet why would the old woman risk her family to aid a captive he commanded the oarmaster to row him to the yeni serai there he spoke with his friend and mentor the aga kislar the aga agreed that the situation was a delicate one but he disliked the friendship between his mistress the sultan valide safiye and esther kira the old woman was a virtual institution with the valides having been an intimate to four of them she seemed indestructible but if she was involved in this scandal then this was his chance to be rid of her the aga gained the sultans ear telling him only what he felt he should know cicalazade pashas second wife appears to have been stolen from the viziers island the aga said we believe that we know some of the people involved but we need your permission to proceed further will you sign this order recalling the conversation with his vizier of just two weeks ago mohammed iii gave the aga his permission and affixed his tugra seal to the order giving hammid and the aga carte blanche to pursue their investigations soon a troop of janizaries was dispatched to the kira house in the jewish ghetto the two black eunuchs followed them in litters eli kira greeted the two men and led them into a salon where they were served coffee honey and almondpaste cakes and sticky red and green candies the banker knew there was something wrong when these two men came calling with a troop of the sultans elite he waited a discreet time indulging in small talk then looking to the aga he asked well my lord aga why do you come to my home so heavily guarded is something amiss is there some unrest within the city that i have not heard about the wife of cicalazade pasha was stolen off his island retreat eli kira what do you know of it the bankers face remained impassive not a muscle twitched nor did any expression ruffle his features there is no way they can know anything eli kira silently reminded himself his dark eyes now widened in surprise lateefa sultan stolen he exclaimed hoping his look was incredulous enough a faint smile touched the agas lips hammids suspicions were correct the kiras knew something not lateefa sultan he said patiently but the viziers new second wife the lady incili why should i know anything of this asked the banker haughtily i did not even know the lady perhaps you do not conceded the aga but i will wager your grandmother does the lady incili was a stranger to this land the only person from the outside she ever had contact with was esther kira and the lady needed outside aid to escape i thought you said she was stolen said eli kira is it not possible that she bribed the eunuchs to aid her why do you assume that because my grandmother casually knew this woman she has masterminded a plot where is your proof you are insulting my lord aga i shall personally complain to the sultan about your actions slowly the aga drew from the sleeve of his robe a rolled parchment which he handed to the banker if you will but take the time to glance at this you will find that it is an order from the sultan giving me permission to take whatever action is necessary in this investigation the sultan does not want his friend and valuable servant cicalazade pasha to be unhappy and believe me eli kira the vizier will be very unhappy when he finds his favorite wife gone eli kira looked steadily and directly at the aga kislar and then he turned his gaze on the viziers grand eunuch i know nothing of this affair he said firmly and if you have no tangible proof other than your outrageous suspicions i must ask you to leave my house no eli kira i intend questioning other members of your family at this very moment on my orders my janizaries are entering your womens quarters how dare you shouted the banker his face going purple with outrage and anger and he ran from the room towards the other end of the house followed at a surprisingly swift pace by the two eunuchs they could already hear the shrieks of surprise and terror coming from the kira harem and the scene that greeted them was quite satisfying to the aga he had wanted to instill just this type of fear in the kira women now as his reptilian gaze swept the room he knew what tack to take maryam kira was whitefaced and obviously very much frightened she stood protectively clutching her two younger daughters rebecca and sarah her eldest daughter debra stood next to her mother equally pale old esther kira was seated in a large chair looking frail but as fierce as a hawk the room was full of brawny young janizaries and several of the servant girls had obviously been molested angry redfaced and fast becoming frightened eli kira blustered at the aga this is the final offense ali ziya i shall send a messenger immediately to the sultan you accuse us of some plot but you offer no proof you invade the privacy of my home with your soldiers molest my servants frighten my women show me some proof or get out be silent all of you all eyes turned to the old woman in the chair what is the problem ali ziya the sultan valide safiye will not be pleased if i tell her of this unpleasantness the aga kislar looked to the old woman here was the real power behind the kiras this tiny apparently delicate old woman with her allknowing blackcurrant eyes she stared unblinkingly at him and he shivered he smiled at her what have you done with cicalazade pashas wife incili esther kira what has happened to her ali ziya i do not know but i think you do nonsense i know not of what you speak the aga smiled again and decided to play his bluff is this all of your family eli kira he asked no there are my sons fetch them came the command the banker nodded curtly to a servant girl and several minutes later she returned with four of the boys is this all there is asher and our cousin john said debra innocently the aga pounced where is your son asher and who is this cousin they have gone off on business for the bank and will not return for some time where and whos this john kira i sent them to damascus and our cousin comes from northern europe from cousin benjamin in scotland spoke debra again eli kira shot his daughter a fierce look be silent debra you are not to speak unless spoken to your manners are too forward for a maiden ali ziya all eyes turned to hammid ali ziya the high voice was excited the woman incili came from scotland i remember her telling me that when we first received her the agas eyes narrowed here was his connection he swung about and looked at eli kira and his sons those two he pointed at the two youngest kira boys what are their ages thirteen and sixteen came the reply a good age came the reply and then the next words fell like hammer blows i will honor your house eli kira i will accept these two fine young men into the corps of janizaries no shrieked maryam kira the bankers voice was firm but his heart was beating very fast you cannot do that ali ziya i pay the head tax my sons are exempt this is an honor i do you eli kira your sons enter an elite military unit dedicated to the sultan himself you cannot refuse my generosity without offending my master and i will do your loyal family even further honor his eyes swung over to where young debra stood i am taking your eldest daughter for my masters harem never have i seen such beautiful eyes their violet color is quite unique i am sure that with the proper training she will enchant him no eli kira was shouting now the girl is betrothed she is to be wed in two days you are wrong my friend the aga smiled in three nights i will present her to the sultan and she will enter his bed as his new plaything perhaps she will captivate him if not she will live out her life in the palace of forgotten women maryam kira flung herself at the agas feet what is it you seek she begged i will help you if i can but do not take my children i pray you maryam eli pulled his groveling wife up eli eli she turned a frightened tearravaged face to him what have you done what is so important that you would sacrifice david and lev what is so important that you would condemn debra to a life of loneliness and shame if you know anything tell him in yahwehs name tell him i beg you eli kira looked desperately towards his grandmother years of training now conflicted violently with his paternal feelings he simply did not know what to do esther kira sighed clear the room of all but ali ziya hammid and my grandson who ought to be told what this terror is all about do not touch any of my greatgrandchildren or you will learn nothing take your men and wait in the courtyard touch no one and nothing the aga commanded slowly the room cleared until only the old woman eli kira and the two eunuchs remained sit sit commanded esther kira this is a complicated story and she settled herself comfortably they looked expectantly at her do any of you know when i was born she asked and then cackled i was born on april first in the christian year i am one hundred and nine years old now of what i am about to tell you my poor bemused grandson knows nothing since however myshe stressed the wordactions have brought difficulties to him i think he should hear this eli kira kept his face impassive there was absolutely nothing that he did not know of his familys business but he understood what his grandmother was doing by removing the blame from him she was trying to save the family it was a prime example of the first lesson she had ever taught himsurvival at any cost he felt a sudden burst of tenderness and affection for the lady who had built his familys fortune he wished he might take her in his arms and hug her instead he sat quietly a slightly expectant look on his face good thought esther kira he understood my tactic then she continued your suspicions are correct ali ziya i did help the woman you call incili to return to her own people so would you have had you known who she was she was a european noblewoman came hammids voice she was a descendant of cyra hafise came back the reply how can that be old woman demanded ali ziya cyra hafise left only her son sultan suleiman and a daughter who was wed to ibrahim pasha of the imperial grandchildren the princes mustafa and bajazet were murdered prince janhagir died prince selim became sultan selim ii and princess mihrmah was wed to rustem pasha the children of ibrahim pasha and princess nilufer never left this land your vast age has finally addled your wits esther kira you are a third my age ali ziya and my wits are still sharper than yours came the quick reply i was for many years a close friend and confidant of cyra hafise i knew all about her and her family she had a brother the earl of glenkirk incili is descended from him and so was her first husbandalso an earl of glenkirk her oldest son is the current earl because of the kind intervention of cyra hafise the kira family has managed the great fortune of the leslies of glenkirk for many years i doubt that incili ever heard of cyra hafise but i almost fainted the first time i saw her she is the mirror image of my longdead friend as lateefa sultan is of her ancestress firousi kadin to see them standing together took me back eightyfive years and i thought for a moment that i had died and my two friends were coming to greet me she paused for a moment to gauge the effect this tale was having on her audience in her grandsons eyes she caught a hint of admiration the two eunuchs sat spellbound and she chuckled within herself eunuchs were such children she continued after i had spoken awhile with the lady incili and drawn her out a bit i knew for certain who she was with the aid of lateefa sultan i attempted to get her to accept this as her life but you yourself know hammid how restless she was then her second husband and his servant arrived to rescue her i introduced them into the house as john kira a cousin and his servant i secretly instructed him in the way of jewish life so that during the time he was here no one would suspect his real identity and mission i had no choice but to help him he is a favorite cousin of the scots king who is the old english queens heir the scots king is very fond of his cousin and is bound to complain to the english queen who will write to her friend the sultan valide safiye who will speak to her son the sultan the whole thing would have become a public scandal the sultans best friend and vizier holding against her will in carnal bondage the cousin of scotlands king you know how these christians are about sexual morals how do you think the sultan would have felt caught in such a tangle the woman incili should never have been sent to cicalazade pasha it was a vicious trick on the part of the viziers sister who is a jealous and cruel woman of bad repute she turned accusingly to the grand eunuch you knew that hammid incili told you who she was and begged you to have her ransomed she could have made you a rich man instead you used her to sate the neversatisfied appetite of your master in the hopes of furthering your own ambitions do you realize the embarrassment you could have caused the sultan and his government neatly she had shifted the blame from her own frail shoulders onto his fat ones eli kira was openmouthed in admiration ali ziya was thoughtful incili is long gone said esther kira once again i have loyally served the house of osman when cicalazade pasha returns from his campaign tell him that the lady incili miscarried and died she was not by the way really with child it was a ruse she used to remain on the island so that her husband might rescue her the eunuchs are dead and cannot talk your rowers can be sold off and replaced and the oarmaster disposed of some way no one else knows that incili is gone they will believe whatever you tell them the sultan knows said ali ziya tell him that the woman died and that the eunuchs lied and hid themselves for fear of being blamed then tell him that everyone involved has been punished it is not important to him and he will forget ali ziya nodded you are right esther kira you know the imperial ottoman well i should replied the old lady i have been dealing with them successfully for almost a hundred years the eunuchs stood up as did eli kira i apologize eli kira for this invasion of your home it did appear as if a crime had been committed in which your family was involved i hope you will not find it necessary to complain to the sultan no said the banker quickly i understand it was just a terrible misunderstanding you simply did your duty the aga kislar looked at esther kira you are a remarkable old woman he said dryly turning he left the room followed by hammid and eli kira alone in the main courtyard of the house the aga turned to hammid do as she suggested if there is ever any question i will back you up do you believe her ali yesand no came the reply the aga climbed into his litter giving the signal for his departure returning to the yeni serai ali ziya decided one thing esther kiras influence with the imperial family must be discredited and without a doubt she must die even in her old age she was far too astute and very dangerous then too she was a living link with a time when the ottoman sultans were strong men who ruled alone without the advice of women or eunuchs ali ziya did not want to see that time return chapter the coast of thessaly stood dark in the early morning purple mountains speared the sunrise sky snowcapped olympus and ossa towering above all between these two giants of the pindus range spread the fertile plain of thessaly split by the peneus river which flowed into the aegean sea in that short time between the ebb and the flood tides when the darkgreen waters of the river mixed lazily with the turquoise waters of the sea a small boat moved from the aegean into the peneus they had been anchored off this particular piece of coast all night waiting for the calm to get them safely into the river and the fioodtide that followed to sweep them up it to the passing casual shoreline observer the boat contained four men and a woman obviously it was a family boat a coastal trading vessel heading upstream to larissa to sell its cargo within the boat the occupants heaved a collective sigh of relief another stage of their journey was over and thus far it had been unbelievably simple from the moment they had cast off from the island of a thousand flowers the skies had remained benevolent and the seas cooperative they had sped down the sea of marmara past the island of the same name where imperial ottoman slaves quarried marble for the sultans export trade onward through the dardanelles and across the aegean cat could not remember them seeing more than two other boats they had stopped only once at the island of lemnos to take on fresh water after all the blue and gold of the sea the river was a startling change cat was stunned by the rugged beauty surrounding her seated in the bow of the boat her dark cloak wrapped about her she did not know which way to look next to her right the precipices descended like the gods themselves from mount olympus and fell steeply to the river mount ossa rose the highest on her left rising fifteen hundred feet straight up from the floor of the valley the valley was lush and there were beautiful horses grazing in the grassy meadows are they wild asked cat for she saw neither houses nor people nay bothwell answered her they are specially raised and have been since earliest times now the turks own the ranches but were not apt to see any people until we reach larissa the turks are on the ranches and in the cities and this river passes through only two towns the river began to narrow into a gorge the vale of tempe he said as their boat slipped into a close greenlit world legend says that poseidon the greek god of the sea created it so he might have a beautiful bower in which to woo a daughter of the river god cat looked up at him her green eyes reflecting the light of the vale how beautiful did he win her love i dinna know but tis a most romantic place for lovers the vale is also connected to the sun god apollo a maiden named daphne fled here to escape his lecherous advances daphne was dedicated to apollos twin sister the virgin moon goddess diana apollo was determined to have daphne and he cornered her here she cried out to diana to save her from shame and the goddess obliged her handmaiden by turning the girl into a flowering laurel bush since then the vale of tempe is sacred to apollo and in ancient times the laurel for the victors wreaths at the pythian games was gathered here had you been apollo and i daphne i would never have fled ye francis he smiled at her and she smiled back the trip across the sea had turned her creamy skin a rich golden color and her eyes appeared even greener than usual her rich honeycolored hair had been in the aegean free of its bandanna and turban and the sun had bleached it a pale gold she was very lovely and it had been months now since they had last made love unfortunately this was not the time though the place would have been perfect ahead were the ruins of the temple of apollo set high above the river within a grove of tall ancient oaks he would have enjoyed making love to her in that romantic setting francis sighed and catching her looking at him grinned guiltily she laughed softly i regret it also bothwell she said reading his thoughts yer a witch he chuckled nay just yer other half francis and she caught his big hand and pressed it to her lips will we get home safely bothwell she pleaded we will get home safely cat i promise you the vale of tempe behind them the plain of thessaly spread itself out again in the glory of early summer and before the sun had reached its zenith the walls of ancient larissa came into view cat bound up her beautiful hair again and susan hid her pretty face behind the voluminous folds of a black feridji leaving only her eyes visible after paying the dockage fee to the turkish portmaster they were directed to a pier near the waterfront market they tied up without incident saul kiras house is near enough to walk said asher he is a widower his children grown and gone only his widowed sister is in the house to care for him we should be safe for the moment and he led them across the crowded market alive with mooing baaing clucking and quacking livestock the noise made by the animals and haggling merchants was ferocious and cat sighed gratefully when they had crossed the market square they entered the small courtyard to a yellow brick house saul kira greeted them warmly putting cat and susan into the custody of his sister abigail abigail bas kira looked at cat suspiciously wondering whether this really was a young man cat drew off her headgear so that her long hair tumbled down her back the old woman nodded satisfied what can i get you she asked them a bath breathed cat and susan together and then they laughed at their singlemindedness an hour later they were bathed their hair washed free of sea salt abigail bas kira had given them each clean clothing and cats bandanna and turban were washed and dried the jews never wore them so there were none in the house while susan helped to lay the table cat joined the men bothwell put an arm about his wife good news and some bad he said the good she asked we are not pursued they felt they could not pick up the trail and so they decided to tell your lord and master that you had died miscarrying we will have to continue to move cautiously however as i do not want us to run into any ottoman officials asking embarrassing questions or slavers with sharp eyes she sighed thank god they dinna pursue us but what is the bad news my love esther kira is dead oh francis but then she was a very old lady well over a hundred well god assoil her soul i know she had a great one aye he nodded he was grateful that she assumed age was the cause of esthers death it had not been there had been a sudden fluctuation in the valuation of the turkish currency rumors flew through the city and the people had deliberately been aroused against the bankers old esther kira returning from the palace where she had been visiting with the sultans mother was dragged from her litter and stoned the following day the value of currency had miraculously returned to normal by that time esther kira was dead the sultan and his mother were lavish in their grief but no one was ever brought before the kadi for this obvious murder the kiras however plainly understood the nature of the warning visited upon them by the death of their matriarch asher kira was told to go on to italy with his charges and settle in rome with his uncle the main branch of the kira bank then returned to business as usual but less conspicuously now and without royal favor there was no need for cat to know these things lord bothwell did not want to burden his wife with guilt or grief the worst of their journey lay ahead of them and she would need all her courage and strength for that there was no time for weeping he did ask her if she wanted to communicate with lateefa sultan but cat decided to wait until they were safely in italy then she would send her ottoman cousin a special gifta replica of cyra hafises pendantalong with a letter there was no need to tarry in larissa the following day they bid farewell to saul and abigail and headed upstream to tricca as they left saul kira released a pigeon who would fly to istanbul as a signal that eli kiras oldest son had gotten as far as larissa in safety they reached tricca in two days still keeping to the guise of coastal traders they sold their small cargo of brusa silks to a delighted broker who rarely saw such fine quality they then loaded their boat with just a small quantity of trade goods for barter it was unlikely that anyone would inspect the boat and discover that most of its cargo was stones they departed tricca the day after their arrival and slowly began to make their way upstream as they left the town behind the river grew wilder and rockier with little patches of whitewater rapids bothwell and asher took turns at the helm of the little boat while from the bow cat and susan alternated in keeping watch of the river ahead conall clung to his precarious perch high up on the mast peering ahead for dangerous waters they could not travel at night now for safetys sake they remained in the middle of the stream using their sea anchor and there was always a watch posted as the countryside became wilder less inhabited by farmers and herdsmen it grew thick with bandits finally they could go no further on the peneus they were near the source of its headwaters and the stream became narrow shallow and very rocky they would now have a twoday trek through the forest in order to reach the aous river in illyria and then a short march to reach the spot where bothwell and conall had hidden their boat the little boat that had carried them in safety from the heart of the ottomon empire was sunk without a trace bothwell continued to take no chances they were in a vast forest and it amazed cat that francis and conall were able to find their way the earl of bothwell enlightened his wife by explaining that when they had come through the forest on their way to istanbul he had cut small deep notches into various trees along their route after nearly a year the marks were still there the woodland with its oak elm pine and birch trees was similar to those found in scotland so was the wildlife they saw deer bear wolves and wild boar as well as fowl and birds of all kinds most familiar they each carried only a small amount of food there was a pouch of finely ground grain which when mixed with water could be boiled and eaten as a cereal or boiled and then roasted on hot stones to make a cake a second pouch contained dried figs raisins and peaches asher had a small brick wrapped in red and silver foil made up of dark dried leaves which he called te added to boiling water it made a refreshing amber drink which they found sustaining they were all armed susan had a dagger cat and asher had both dagger and scimitar conall and bothwell carried in addition to those weapons english longbows and arrows the first day they walked many miles before making camp conall managed to shoot two ducks susan and cat plucked and cleaned them and stuffed them with dandelion greens and some dried fruit bothwell never able to resist fishing a good mountain brook managed to catch three trout it was a satisfying meal the following morning they carefully watered the fire down and buried it they began to walk again they reached the headwaters of the aous river by midday and another hours march along the waterside brought them to an overgrown but still serviceable road stopping for a time to eat some fruit and drink some water cat asked about the road roman answered bothwell illyria was a favorite province of the empire there are two legends regarding its name the romans say the name is derived from illyricus the son of the cyclops polythemus and the sea nymph galatea the greeks however claim that illyricus was the son of cadmus and harmonia why was the province favored francis because the illyrians are born fighterstough hardy natural soldiers the romans recruited heavily among them in the third century after christ the first wave of barbarians hit the empire and illyria became the last bulwark of the roman and western cultures most of the outstanding emperors of that period were illyrian elected right on the field of battle by their soldiers now of course tis just a part of the sultans vast empire but there are fewer turks here because the population of this country turned muslim when first conquered rather than lose control of their lands the sultan has firm control of the cities and the lowlands but here in the mountains the tribes are left to enjoy their ancient autonomy they pay a high tribute for it well have to move with caution here i dinna want to attract any attention she looked levelly at him are we in danger let us just say i dinna want to run into any bandits i would say were safe as long as we keep moving and as long as its dark fearing pagan taboos they do not attack at night it was midafternoon of the following day when they reached the cave where bothwell and conall had hidden their boat it was still there the cave entrance well covered and quite undisturbed they might have dragged the boat to the river then but bothwell thought the women looked weary well stop and camp here the night he ordered come morning well be fresh and on our way at first light asher help the women set up camp while conall and i go hunting for our meal they decided to camp within the cave there would be less chance of their fire being spotted of wild animals or of being caught in a sudden rain susan cut reeds from the riverbank and bound them to make torches for the cave with asher kiras help she gathered firewood asher then left them to try his hand at fishing and cat gave her young tiring woman leave to bathe while she finished up within the cave the lessons she had learned riding the scots borders with bothwell served her well now she built a fire lay out the cooking gear and took a jug to the river directly below the cave lay a small crescentshaped sandy beach which bordered a shallow pool within the river made by an almost circular formation of rocks susan bathed in the pool and cat promised to join her shortly returning to the cave she placed the jug on a rock ledge so that no one would trip over it then looked about to see if she had forgotten anything the fire burned hot in a carefully dug pit on opposite sides of the fire the iron spit holders were imbedded firmly in the ground the spit a wooden spoon and an iron pot nearby when the men returned the women would be ready for them satisfied that she had done her part cat was ready to go swimming suddenly she heard a high scream of terror from susan without thinking she ran out of the cave and leaped down the small incline to the beach below too late she realized her mistake she was weaponless except for a dagger having left her scimitar in the cave there was a man on the beach and two more in the water chasing after susan who swam frantically this way and that trying to escape the man on the beach turned to face cat drawing her dagger she crouched to meet him the mermaid has a boy companion with her he called in turkish to his companions cat realized now that they were ottoman soldiers and not illyrian bandits as she had first assumed deepening her voice cat shouted leave my sister be we are loyal citizens of the sultanmay allah grant him long life is this how the sultans soldiers behave attacking helpless travelers her voice rang with scorn they looked surprised and for a moment cat thought they might leave them in peace then one of the men waded from the water and made straight for her cat gasped for the man stood close to seven feet tall it took all her courage not to break and run when he was quite close she called out stop come no further or ill slit your belly wide open the giant stopped eyeing her with some amusement i think my young fighting cock that you are really in no position to give orders but my curiosity is aroused youre not illyrian so why are you here were from tricca answered cat on our way to visit our grandmother whose second husband is illyrian we came up the peneus with a friend a river trader we have been walking for two days now and our grandmothers house is but a few hours from here my sister wanted to bathe before going on the giant smiled slowly and a knowing fear clutched cat i am omar he said a captain with the illyrian regulars we have been here in the mountains collecting the sultans tribute from the local tribes with illyrians we must maintain good manners lest we cause the sultan difficulties their women are forbidden contact with us and we do not molest them it has been weeks now since my men have enjoyed female companionship your sister is very pretty he turned to his men get the river nymph he commanded sharply then he turned to cat pretty young men also make good sport he laughed jumping forward cats knife bit into his arm omar cursed roundly but kept coming several more times she bloodied him but he kept forcing her backward until she found herself against the embankment below the cave for a moment they stood still facing each other her heart was beating wildly and she was panting with fright and exhaustion she could hear susan screaming and she trembled she leaped at him but he turned quickly grunting with surprise as the knife buried itself deep in the muscle of his shoulder with his good arm he hit her a fierce blow on the side of the head and she fell to the ground her turban and bandanna fell away onto the ground there was a moment of silence while the captain removed the knife from his shoulder and dabbed the wound then he glanced back at the halfconscious woman at his feet he shouted his delight by allah another woman a fighting wildcat but a female reaching down he pulled cat up by the arm and catching her face between his thumb and forefinger looked hard at her by allah he muttered almost to himself youre a beauty a real little prize numb she stood quietly as he quickly and expertly stripped her naked allah bless me my fortune is made the captain chortled as he ran his hands over her shrinking body she shivered as feeling began to come back to her easy my beauty he said quietly you need have no fear of me and ill protect you from my men youre worth more to me as you are than bloodied by them theyll sate their lust on the other she saw with horror that susan had been dragged from the water and now lay on her back held by one man while the other prepared to rape her her servants plight roused pity in cat pity for the girl who had known only rape and depravity from men never any tenderness or love at least i have had that thought cat come the voice startled her from her reflections the giant pulled her a little way down the beach and sitting drew her down into his lap she braced herself for the struggle to come his laughter rumbled as he saw her face contort with fear dont be frightened my beauty im not going to force you though allah knows you would tempt a holy man alas i have not functioned as a man since a fever took me several months back still and he chuckled again i know other ways to make a girl happy when my men sleep tonight perhaps well try some eh cat shuddered what are you going to do with me she asked whysell you woman allah have you never looked in a mirror you will bring me a fortune though whether i can get a better price for you in the open market or from fatima the procuress i will not know until we reach apollonia helplessness swept over cat oh god she wailed silently not again then she caught herself the captain and his two men were not aware that the helpless women they had captured travelled with three men if she could only keep them here until the others returned she and susan had a chance but once the two soldiers finished amusing themselves with susan their captain would want to be on his way there was only one way to keep him here and though she shrank from it she knew she must detain them the captain was fondling her breasts he might be temporarily impotent but the thought was strong so much the better saying a prayer for the mens quick arrival cat made her voice softly innocent and said hesitantly i have been a widow two years now captain and my husband was a very simple man what what she stopped lowering her eyes as if in confused embarrassment she giggled nervously what did you mean when you said there are other ways to make a girl happy she finished in a breathless rush captain omars piglike little eyes narrowed and then began to glitter with anticipatory delight a widow for two years a pretty girl like yourself and no suitors to play with i was in mourning and then my father became ill and my sister and i nursed him until he died there was no time for suitors she finished modestly surely your husband was a lusty man and showed you many a fine bed trick oh no captain my husband was many years my senior he was a wealthy man when i married him and father got a very good bride price for me when my poor husband died however he had lost his wealth through poor investments had my dear father not taken me back i should have been destitute youre no virgin still are you cat knew she dare not lie oh no captain my husband did his duty by me once weekly once weekly once weekly roared the giant allah woman if you had been my wife id have fucked you three times nightly and double on the sabbath he chuckled so you were wed to a graybeard who could barely do it and here you are a lusty hot young widow innocent of all the nice things a man can do for a woman to make her feel good tell me my pretty onewould you like me to do some of those things to you now cat hid her face in the giants shoulder taking coyness for assent the captain chuckled again the deep rumbling sound of a pleased tomcat and ran a thick finger along the line of her tightly closed legs cat closed her eyes and concentrated on not screaming in the woods downstream of the river asher kira had heard susan shrieking quickly but cautiously he had hurried to investigate shocked by the scene before him the gentle young banker soiled himself in his youthful fantasies he had imagined the taking of a reluctant woman bat the unpleasant reality of rape terrified him gasping for breath he fought to control his anger and disgust reason prevailed he could scarcely fight off three men alone melting back into the thick cover of the undergrowth asher kira set off for lord bothwell it took him over half an hour for he moved carefully marking his trail so he might find his way back easily he found conall first and poured out his story the scots captain paled grasping the younger man by the arm conall pulled him along to the earl bothwells face darkened with rage and he might have gone crashing back through the underbrush had it not been for the restraining influence of his companions yell nae stop the deviltry now my lord said conall grimly what we want is to get them back alive francis did not think that he could bear it his beautiful brave cat was being hurt again could the fates not leave them in peace and he knew in a fury that nearly overcame him he was going to kill her tormenter himself it was almost night as they grimly made their way back to the campsite silently observing the beach from the little bluff above it they saw that the three soldiers had made a fire and were seated about it susan was not to be seen but catstill nakedwas clasped in the captains big lap as they crept closer they could hear the men arguing i dont see why you wont let us have her captain said one of the soldiers because you cant do it yourself any more you deny mustafa and me you have the other girl issa shes unconscious now captain whined the soldier its no fun fucking a woman who doesnt move let us have a go on goldenhair come on now youve never been one to hoard the goods all to yourself youre a pair of fools this woman is a real beauty if i dont let you two damage her well get a fine price for her in apollonia then you can buy all the women you want this one you leave alone we saw what you were doing to her before captain said issa let us do at least that aw hell shes got such wonderful big tits i want a feel come on captain let us have a little feel captain omar stood up dumping cat and roared no no and again no youll bruise the devil out of her i know you two youre animals fuck the other and think about how much money this one will bring us when we sell her then he plumped himself down again yanking cat back into the comparative safety of his massive lap watching from his hidden vantage bothwell thanked god she hadnt been raped susan poor lass had taken the brunt of the brutality the earl vowed he would do his best to care for her if they got out of this alive susan would never again lack for anything slipping back into the forest he signaled silently to conall and asher to follow him they reached a small clearing and bothwell said quietly i think were well advised to wait until they sleep well each take one of them but the captain is mine the two nodded the earl asked asher do ye think ye can kill a man lad asher kira nodded yes my lord i can after what i saw them doing to susan i can kill one of the men who did it the earl smiled grimly and the three men settled down to wait the moonless night grew darker and gradually the noise from the soldiers died until only snoring broke the stillness carefully now they crept up again to the perimeter of the camp the fire burned low the three men were all there the man who should have been on guard slept as noisily as his companions bothwell shook his head in wonder these turksalleged to be the worlds finest militarywere poor soldiers instead of sleeping in close formation about the fire they were scatteredeasy prey for man or animal the earl nodded to conall and asher shadowlike the three men stepped from the darkness into the faint glow of the firelight methodically they went about their task a hard hand was clasped quickly about a mouth to stifle the cry while the throat was cut from ear to ear the two soldiers died swiftly captain omar was left a bloodcurdling scots war cry ripped through the night the turkish captain scrambled to his feet terrified a quick glance about him told him his companions were dead slowly he turned to face his adversaries there were three of thema beardless youth not worth bothering with and two hardened veterans omar was no coward but he did not like the odds i am captain omar of the sultans dlyrian regulars he said who are you the tallest of the men stepped forward my name matters not spawn of pigs offal you will not live long enough to repeat it the insult was enormous yet the captain was puzzled do i know you my lord what is your quarrel with me he shifted his weight slightly do not move captain said the tall man my young friend has a pistol pointed directly at you it is primed and ready if his finger should slip he paused and smiled have you ever seen a man die of a bullet wound captain a large hole blown clean through his middle the guts oozing out onto the ground like a string of sausages move one step and you will experience that most exquisite agony the giant turk swallowed hard and glanced over at the boy he had regarded so lightly asher kira glared coldly back his slender hand was wrapped lightly about a large evillooking weapon he seemed quite familiar with it even comfortable captain omar stood very still bothwell turned to conall susan alive my lord came the choked reply the weatherworn face wet with tears implored him christ mon what sort of human does this to a young girl and he tenderly cradled the battered body of his niece in his arms cat the earls voice called she came slowly from behind the captain still naked removing his heavy cloak bothwell wrapped her in it asher will take you and susan to the boat as soon as he and conall have launched it and you the captain and i have unfinished business i will stay till it is finished she stated a slow smile crinkled the corners of his eyes you were never one to run from danger were you my love very well then it would be easier if you had some clothes on madame are there any extra among us nodding she said i will not be long francis and climbed back up to the cave taking susans extra undergarments pants from asher and a shirt from conall she was able to put together a decent wardrobe her own sash and boots were salvageable while she dressed the others pressed captain omars strength into service they dragged the boat from its biding place and anchored it in the river just off the beach asher kira waited in it with the injured susan having regained consciousness she alternated between relief and tears conall built up the fire to light the area while the two combatants stripped off shirts and boots understand me turk said bothwell if i do not kill you which i intend doing my captain will do it but because i believe every condemned man has the right to know why he dies i will tell you now that the lady you intended selling into bondage is my wife the girl your men brutalized is my captains niece captain omar let the words slide over him looking his challenger over bothwell was almost as tall as he but weighed a good deal less omar felt confidence swelling through him he would quickly crush the infidel dog as for his bandylegged companion he presented no threat at all but it would be wise to dispose of him quickly whirling he turned on the surprised conall and felled him with a great blow to the head the scotsman slid silently to the sand as cat screamed his name now captain omar turned to bothwell the two men circled each other each assessing the others strength their knives flashed in the firelight suddenly terrified cat knelt by the unconscious conall watching and praying there was a sudden glint of steel and a reddening wound then there was another and another the two men fought on past taunts now an occasional grunt punctuating the silence neither seemed to weary and the firelight dappled their sweatsoaked bodies suddenly the turk flung aside his knife and leaped at bothwell enveloping him in a great bear hug bothwell was caught as surely as a rabbit in a snare he could not struggle and his knife dropped from his hand the giant seemed to be squeezing the very life from him cat he managed to gasp to the boat lass run he felt a rib crack and struggled harder against both his massive enemy and fastrising unconsciousness he knew that if the blackness claimed him he was a dead man the ignominy of the situation struck at his native pride that he francis stewarthepburn should die at the hands of a mindless turkthrough the roaring in his ears he thought he heard his wifes voice and it gave him courage if he died she was doomed to a living hell scrambling across the sand cat picked up first the turks knife and then bothwells legs shaking she plunged both knives repeatedly into the mountain of flesh that was the turk but she could not seem to find a vital spot her blows were no more effective than a gnats bite but like the insect she became a great irritant dropping his halfconscious victim omar turned on her woman he shouted and she jumped backwards he reached for the knives and disarming her slapped her several light blows terrified for bothwell and feeling more helpless than she had ever felt cat dropped to her knees the turk turned back to the earl suddenly a roar tore the stillness spinning about captain omar clutched at his middle a look of pure surprise on his face he removed his hands slowly to look then clamped them quickly back over the hole in his belly as a length of pink gut rolled out but he was not able to contain the blood that poured forth sickened cat scrambled away from him but he kept coming towards her his lips moving mouthing words she could not hear the pink intestines were uncontainable now spilling between his clutching fingers blood spurting over her beyond him stood asher kira the smoking pistol in his hands nearby both bothwell and conall lay unmoving on the damp sand horrified she slowly scanned the scene of carnage in which she had played a leading role suddenly captain omar crumbled dead at her feet terror filling her eyes she screamed oh god no more no more no more part ix the healing chapter in the cool green hills overlooking rome there nestled a beautiful villa commanding a view of the sea many miles beyond a park surrounded the house but the gates leading to it were always closed unless someone was entering or leaving it was called simply villa mia and had been built a hundred years before for a mistress of the borgia pope alexander vi the park was filled with greenery deer birds and little lakes the house was now owned by the foreigner lord stuarti the local people knew little else about him the new lord had a large force of menatarms but only their captain was ever seen entering the house the servants were all women imported from rome tradesmen were stopped at the back door no one from the surrounding area had ever been inside the villa there was a rumor that lord stuarti had a wife but she was never seen and it was known that he occasionally visited the widowed innkeeper giovanna russo when the other women of the village attempted to elicit information from giovanna she would say nothing other than he is a good man with much pain do not ask again for i will tell you nothing this was strange for giovanna was a warmhearted woman who was known to enjoy a good gossip eventually however the villagers accepted the mysterious lord stuarti and no longer paid any particular attention to the villa mia francis stewarthepburn had never intended to return to naples the villa del pesce doro would have held too many frightening ghosts so the new villa had already been purchased and was waiting when he and cat returned bothwell thanked god he had a home to bring her to and that it was isolated she had been near death for many weeks after the terrible ordeal and he was convinced that only his own willpower his desperate desire that she stay alive had kept her alive cat had drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the homeward journey running a low steady fever she would eat nothing pushing food away angrily in her only show of emotion it was all he could do to get liquids into her he had kept her alive in spite of herself getting her safely to italy strangely it was cats plight which made susan refrain from selfpity susan had suffered terribly but hardly to the extent that her mistress had the young woman blamed herself for cats plight tis my fault she is so hurt she said tears threatening but i will help to get her well my lord i swear i will she vowed bothwell was grateful and glad for her company when they reached the villa mia young may was waiting the two sisters embraced may grateful to both her older sister and her mistress for saving her in the attack on villa del pesce doro eagerly aided susan in her efforts to bring cat back to sanity the countess of bothwell had not spoken a word since the night of her rescue and her beautiful eyes remained void of all expression sometimes the earl felt her staring at him but when he turned it was to be met with the alltoofamiliar blank look still he loved her as never before and desperate tried to carry on as if all were normal he did not share her bed sleeping instead in a room adjoining hers at night the door between the rooms remained open so that he would hear her if she called though her face expressed nothing and she was mute she seemed to understand all that was said to her she communicated by looks and signs other than her husband conall and young asher kira no men were ever allowed into her presence the proximity of a strange male was apt to set her to weeping and moaning they had arrived in midsummer and now as the roman autumn progressed she began to venture out of the villa into the gardens for long walks she was always accompanied by either susan or may and the gardeners were warned to remove themselves the moment she appeared the mistress they were told had been very ill and strangers upset her now the gossip in the village began anew and the talk was all about the madonna stuarti though the gardeners removed themselves from cats sight no one had said they might not look upon her from the cover of the bushes in the tavern of giovanna russo they raved about cats palegold hair for her hair had never regained its tawny shade they sang praises to her leafgreen eyes they rhapsodized over her beautiful unlined face and her young girls figure giovanna russo filled their tankards with the regions best slapped away roving hands and listened she had often wondered about her lovers wife for he never spoke of her yet she was sure that the sadness afflicting him stemmed from a tragedy which had befallen his wife he came to giovanna for release only but she was satisfied he was the best lover she had ever had strong tender and considerate one day giovanna managed to slip into the villa gardens she needed to see her rival having seen her giovanna russo was deeply torn if the beautiful lady became well again giovanna would lose her lover yet she loved bothwell in her own fashion and she wanted him to be happy a kind woman she began lighting candles for cat in the village church one beautiful afternoon bothwell waved both his wifes attendants away and tucking cats thin hand through his arm walked with her out into the sunlit gardens susan tells me yer taking more nourishment he said it shows that and the air have made yer cheeks rosy again she said nothing but there was the faintest shadow of a smile on her hps they continued to walk in silence and then suddenly he caught her by the shoulders and looked down into her face cat for gods sake my darling speak to me he had recently seen the blank look receding from her eyes i love ye hinny more now than ever before dinna shut me out cat dinna go away from me again how can ye love me francis her voice was low so low that he was not sure she was speaking but he had seen her lips move why shouldnt i love ye sweetheart her voice dripped scorn god bothwell hae ye no pride i am dirtied i am used filth and i shall never be clean again you are unclean only if ye believe it cat men have used yer body cruelly ill nae deny it his fingers dug into the soft flesh of her upper arms and his eyes bore into hers but no man ever really possessed ye my darling not ever yer soul was always yer own be satisfied with yer plump innkeeper francis she said wearily if any man touches me ever again i shall die he was surprised by neither her attitude nor her knowledge of giovanna very well my love i shall not attempt to make love to ye but there will come a night when ye will change yer mind i will wait cat but in the meantime please dinna stop talking to me if god wills that i have naught but the sound of yer voice for the rest of my days i shall be satisfied for a moment her old smile flashed hypocrite she said but her eyes were twinkling from that afternoon on she began to improve without telling her he had written to her son the earl of glenkirk requesting that their children be sent to them the children would be arriving by christmas bothwell pursued her seeking her love and her trust once again each morning now he breakfasted with her in her bedroom after they had attended mass together in their chapel afterwards he left her sometimes reappearing for lunch he was always with her in the evenings he personally planned each evening though she did not know this with exquisite taste he chose the menu the wines the flowers that graced their table he delighted in giving her little gifts a small wood box inlaid with motherofpearl a palegreen silk nightgown a cage of brightly colored singing finches she accepted each offering quietly the box with a smile the nightgown with a blush the birds with a little cry of pleasure often now he caught her looking at him from beneath her thick lashes and in the nightfor he limited his visits to giovanna and never went to her after darkhe heard her moving restlessly about her chamber he did not approach her for her wounds were still too grievously deep to allow her a physical life he knew that a woman as deeply sensuous as cat would eventually recover and want love once more he waited on december the feast of st thomas a coach rumbled down the white graveled drive of the villa mia as it drew up to the front of the house bothwell hurried his wife outside to greet their guests how could ye she raged at him i dinna want to see anyone but he chuckled wait hinnytis a happy surprise suddenly her heart began to beat wildly with certainty oh francis she trembled is it our bairns his arm tightened about her shoulders aye he smiled tis our bairns the coach stopped and the footmen leaped to open its door and then a boy appeared in the doorway of the coach and it was bothwells turn to tremble the child who stood there was his mirror image ian she pulled from her husbands protective grasp and caught the boy in an embrace that he endured for only a moment mother and he buried his small suddenly vulnerable face in her soft neck then demanding to be put down he looked up at bothwell his sapphireblue eyes were steady as he said my halfbrother the earl of glenkirk has explained the situation sir he has given us the option to use either the leslie name or yours i think father and bothwell trembled again i think we would prefer to acknowledge ye as our sire since ye hae been so kind as to acknowledge us the earl of bothwell swallowed hard and then grinned down at his small son unable to contain himself he grabbed the boy up with a whoop and hugged him hard the grin that came back at him nearly shattered his heart and it was with great amusement that he heard the boy whisper conspiratorially please father put me down or my sisters will feel slighted they are used to being spoiled by the men bothwell complied and turned backto his wife who knelt and embraced the two little girls the larger of the two was cat all over again with tawny hair and leafgreen eyes but the tinier of the two was a mixture of both her parents with her fathers auburn hair and her mothers green eyes at a whisper from their mother they turned to greet him and the little piping voices that called him papa swelled his heart to bursting in the next few days she came back to life and he knew that it was the children who had driven away the remaining ghosts for her now the air rang with the sound of childrens voices to bothwells amazement he reveled in parenthood this christmas was their first all together they attended a mass of thanksgiving in the villas chapel and then cat and her daughters distributed alms and gifts to the poor of the village the village women were awed by the slender beautiful woman with the palegold hair and green eyes who spoke their language so well they were equally enchanted by cats daughters who had decided they preferred the italian versions of their names and were now called la donna gianetta and la donna francesca their baskets empty the earls party stopped at the inn where the ladies of the villa mia were offered seasonal refreshments and while the children munched christmas sweets and cuddled a litter of kittens they had found in the innyard their mother coolly accepted a goblet of wine from the innkeeper giovanna russo innkeeper and contessa studied one another for a moment then the innkeeper said in a voice audible only to cat if i were lucky enough to be married to francisco stuarti i should not continue to deny him my bed signora la contessa you know nothing about it innkeeper hissed cat i know that every time he lies with me he pretends tis you came the retort cat was stricken suddenly close to tears i cannot she whispered you do not know what has been done to me intuitive comprehension rose in giovanna dio mio she gasped sobeing a rich noblewoman is no protection either and impulsively she caught cats hands and looked into her face it has happened to me also signora in the last damned war a troop of french soldiers she stopped and spat they used the inn as their headquarters they were here almost a week and in all that time i dont think i was allowed off my back more than a few hours daily to cook for them of course they killed my husband because he objected after they had gone i did not think i could ever stand to be touched by a man again and yet you are my husbands mistress the right man came along he was simpatico and i wanted him smiled giovanna is not my lord francisco simpatico to you and in your heart do you not want him the beautiful tearfilled eyes gave giovanna the answer she sought i will pray for you my lady she said quietly and turning giovanna walked away from cat knowing that she had lost her kind francisco forever chapter cat had known she was not the first woman in the world to suffer at the hands of men but there had been no room in her heart for anything besides her own hurt now she realized how many others had suffered and she saw that she had been blaming francis for many of her misfortunes deep down she felt that if he had not been involved with angela di licosa the kidnapping would not have happened yet it had and no amount of wishing was going to change it if she allowed it to kill their love then angelas evil spirit would triumph she struggled with herself for several days for weeks she had been restless waking nightly to walk ceaselessly about her room she loved him yet she did not know if she could bear to have his hands on her she was frightened too that she had been drained of all sexual feeling she knew she must make the first move being sensitive to her feelings francis would not too if she were in control of the situation she might draw back at any time without hurting him on the st day of december bothwell rode into rome on business he promised to return by nightfall so they might celebrate the new year together for several hours after he left she debated with herself hesitated and then decided she did not deny to herself that she was afraid but she could also not deny that she wanted him again while the maids made up her large bed with fresh lavenderscented linens and the cook prepared a fat capon for a midnight feast cat spent the afternoon with her children they remembered her well and this confused her until she heard them relating among themselves incidents about her that they were in no position to recall how do ye know these things she asked them why bess told us mother they replied cat sent her eldest daughter a mental prayer of thanks without bess it seemed her little ones would have forgotten her this last afternoon of the old year she oversaw their baths and when they sat about their supper table she sat with them the meal over she surprised them with a silver paper box of pinoccati a diamondshaped redandbrown sugar candy their nursemaid lucy kerr smiled as cat told the children the wild wonderful stories of their homeland finally she heard their prayers and tucked them into bed kissing them tenderly reveling in their happiness bidding good night she hurried to her own room where susan and may were readying a bath for her what will ye wear my lady asked may put out the green nightgown that my lord gave me she said susans eyebrow was raised just slightly as she reached for the bath scents wildflowers she heard her mistress say the ones we brought from scotland in the silver flacon so thought the tiring woman happily she is finally going to try her wings again susan smiled to herself and hoped that her ladys return to the world of sensual delights would be as pleasant as her own had been susan was in love for the first time in her life the cause of her happiness was one of the menatarms who had accompanied them from scotland robert fitzgordon had taught susan that love could be sweet they were to be wed soon after the new year cat snuggled herself deep into the sweet water of the porcelain tub her pale hair had been carefully secured atop her head with tortoiseshell pins the warmth of the water and of the nearby fire combined to make her drowsy and very relaxed the two servants bustled about her putting away her clothes she heard his footsteps in the doorway and her eyes flew open he stood for a brief moment gazing longingly at her and then caught himself i beg your pardon my darling i dinna know ye were bathing francis damn she had not meant her voice to sound so desperate he turned back to her i would have ye stay and tell me of your day my lord her heart contracted painfully at the hope she saw leap into his eyes susan may ye may leave us see that cook will have supper ready when we ring ye may have the rest of the evening to yerselves they curtsied and left quickly come sit by me francis how is asher kira seating himself he spoke at some length of the business that had taken him to the city he tried to keep his eyes on her face but they kept straying to her soft breasts but barely concealed by the water he swallowed hard and forced his eyes upward again she lowered her lashes but he had caught a quick glimpse of the laughter in her eyes cat his voice was suddenly sharp and she looked up at him i am no saint i simply cannot continue to sit here and not touch you ye hae always had that effect on meas ye know he rose and she cried no francis dinna go from me his eyes caught hers and held them in a puzzledgaze then he heard her say softly do ye remember the first time i came to ye francis aye he answered his eyes never leaving hers ye rode two days to get to me and ye were grievously hurt i am once more grievously hurt my lord and her voice crackled but i would be yer wife again for a moment the room was silent then he asked quietly do you trust me cat she nodded then stand up my love she rose from her tub the scented water cascading down her he took the hard cake of soap from its little silver dish and lathering his hands began to soap her she trembled under his touch but stood quietly while his hands moved down her shoulders back and buttocks reaching for the sponge he rinsed her off the soapy water running down between her unsteady legs turn around she faced him her eyes lowered his hands now soaped her breasts and he smiled faintly as the rosy nipples hardened he moved on to her belly which quivered beneath his fingers and lower the soap sliding across her skin as one finger touched the tiny mole she cried out sofdy shuddering catching at his hands with her own hands for a long moment she held him in restraint and then her hands loosed his and fell quietly to her sides wordlessly he continued to wash her moving on to the satiny skin of her inner thighs again the sopping sponge rinsed her free of the suds he lifted her out of the tub and set her gently on the rug before the fire several large turkish towels hung warming on the oaken rack removing one he dried her carefully tilting her small heartshaped face to his he smiled down on her there my darling that was nae so terrible was it no her voice was barely a whisper tenderly he put his arms about her and stood silently for a few moments while her shining head rested against his broad chest then he loosed her saying i stink of horses my pet tis your turn to wash me and before she could protest he had pulled off his clothes and was climbing into her tub he tried to settle himself for a soak looking at the great masculine animal attempting to lounge against her white porcelain tub with its dainty gold border and floral decor his knees sticking out above the water cat giggled and what he asked in an aggrieved voice is so funny madame the giggles became a silvery peal of laughter she laughed until the tears came to her eyes unaware of the cause of her amusement but very relieved to hear her laughter after these many months bothwell laughed too finally controlling herself she managed to gasp francis ye look so silly in my little tub amid the little pale flowers for a moment he looked disgruntled then he gave her a wry grin i probably do sweetheart he agreed i miss the great oak tub we had at hermitage for a moment they were silent remembering the blissful days they had spent at his great border house before the king had exiled him from scotland then bothwell rose from the tub and said quietly wash me as ye used to cat shyly she took the soap losing it momentarily in the water retrieving it and then touching his back with shaking hands as her fingers moved lightly over his skin she felt the familiarity of him return and as she grew bolder her hands became surer he felt the lukewarm water sluicing down his back and he turned to face her faintly amused he watched as she scrubbed his chest his flat belly and then bravely moved lower to soap his genitals as he responded to her touch she gasped softly color flooded her cheeks and her eyes flew upward he stood perfectly still barely breathing regaining her courage she rinsed him off stepping from the tub he took his towel dried himself and asked are ye brave enough to proceed cat she nodded going to their bed she dropped her towel and slid between the sheets holding them open for him he slipped beneath the sweet silk and drew her into his arms she was as stiff and as unyielding as an oak staff he held her gently and when several minutes had passed she began to relax i am so afraid francis she whispered i know my darling he answered but ye must remember that i hae never hurt ye and i will not now but ye want me aye sweetheart i want ye yet ye will not force me why because i do love ye cat because i know that ye hae been cruelly used ye hae every right to your fear but i swear to ye love i will not hurt ye suddenly he felt her body shaking and tipping her face up he saw that it was wet with tears cat the word was an anguished plea then she felt his mouth closing over hers and before she could think she found her body melted against his as the warmth of his love penetrated her she felt her fears sliding away memories fell away as his lips kissed her there were only the two of them now all else was unimportant tenderly he ran his tongue along her lips and felt them open her warm breath rushing into his mouth gently he explored her as though for the very first time feeling her quivering against him look at me cat open your eyes my darling i am francis no one else and i love ye shyly her darkgold lashes lifted off her cheeks and she looked at him his eyes never left hers as his hands caressed her back his long slim fingers gently kneading away the tension he drew her into the crook of his arm and cupped one breast in his hand and all the while he held her eyes with his own she shivered she could feel her heart hammering wildly against her chest as if it wished to escape a fire was pouring into her loins and the wave of desire that slammed into her shook her terribly that she could feel this way after all that had happened with a fierce exultation she realized that she wanted him she wanted him gently he pushed her onto her back and half straddling her his lips ran riot across her body closing over a pink nipple moving lower teasing her flesh with tiny kisses she arched to meet his mouth catching at his head with trembling hands he groaned a sobbing sound completely lost in the moment as she writhed under his hands and mouth and then he heard through his own pounding desire the voice of his beloved pleading with him to take her take her now kneeling he spread her thighs and his voice was thick look at me cat i want you to look at me when i enter you i want you to know tis me not an awful nightmare memory a tremor tore through her but she raised her eyes to his and whispered again take me bothwell take me now and without further hesitation he thrust himself into her while looking deep into her shining eyes she whirled through space free and whole again exulting in their love and then suddenly she felt herself falling falling through endless time through the dimness she heard him anxiously calling her name voicing a little protest she opened her eyes to find him smiling happily down at her her eyes warm and loving why my darling he said gently how far away ye were she flushed rosy and he laughed softly twould hae been a crime against nature if ye had continued being fearful of love my darling he touched her cheek with his finger she caught his hand and held it against her face then he heard her voice low and level i love ye francis but if ye love me i beg of ye my lord never leave me again for each time ye leave me some catastrophe befalls me if i am not being kidnapped or chased by the scots king i am being bedded by henri quatre aye bothwell ye may well look astonished yer charming royal friend ordered me to fontainebleau terrified me into believing that he was returning me to jamie and then seduced me standing up cat walked across the room and picked up the gossamer silk nightgown bothwell had given her sliding it over her head she let it slither down her body its neckline plunged to her navel the gown clinging to her like a second skin she whirled about and heard him swear jesu as his blue eyes raked her from head to toe always she went on just when i think i am safe something happens i must be safe from now on francis i must i am a very rich woman bothwell and ye are a very proud man we cannot live wiout my money but we can live wiout yer excessive pride it has cost us several years of togetherness and it has almost cost us our lives and our bairns ill hae no more of it if ye canna reconcile yerself to my fortune then i might as well return to scotland and beg jamies forgieness as the kings mistress i will at least be safeand hear me francis stewarthepburn ill nae be chased seduced or raped ever again i wont now it was his turn to rise from the bed he walked across the room and picking up a towel wrapped it about his loins the light from the fire dappled his broad back and his face was grave she could hear her heart thumping wildly and she wondered what possessed her to issue such an ultimatum what had she done how would he respond he stood quietly on the window balcony of their bedroom coming up behind him she slipped her arms about him pressing her silkenclad body against him her cheek against his hard shoulder am i not worth it francis she whispered huskily is it so hard for ye to accept that what was mine is now also yours would ye not be willing to share a fortune wi me are ye nae tired i am francis i am weary of being abused i love ye and would be wi ye she could feel his heart beating evenly beneath her hands and he said softly we will nae be able to go home again cat i know francis and i shall miss scotland but for me home is where ye are i have learned that in the years we have been separated i suppose we could get used to the quiet life aye francis we could he turned then so they faced each other his hands rested lightly on her waist hers on his shoulders would ye really leave me cat tipping her head back she looked lovingly up at him her beautiful green eyes diamondbright with tears why damn me bothwell i could nae ever leave ye i love ye i hae always loved ye and may god ha mercy on me for i will always love ye he sighed deeply with relief and she laughed happily why francis did ye doubt me my dear wife from the moment we first met i could nae be sure what yed do or what would happen next it has always been one of yer greatest charms suddenly they heard bells all around them from the village from the villages in the valley below them from the many churches in the city of rome across the hills the bells were tolling out the end of the sixteenth century they joyfully rang in the new year and a new century as francis stewarthepburn bent to kiss his wife a jubilant thought ran through his mind together they had beaten them he and his cat had survived all the pain and the cruelty the world could inflict on them now what could they not do in this wonderful new century happy new year my darling he said and then he found her mouth once more sweeping her away into that special world that belonged to them alone and where no man would ever again intrude epilogue spring in the spring of the year james leslie the fifth earl of glenkirk was informed by his sergeantatarms that a tall masked gentleman was asking to enter his private presence the earl agreed to the audience saying i hae no enemies it was true the current glenkirk kept from court supported the king only when support was necessary and spent most of his time running his vast estates and several thriving businesses and indulging his two small sons while waiting for his pregnant wife to produce the third offering his mysterious guest a whisky he said will ye remove yer mask sir aye came a familiar voice and the fifth earl of glenkirk found himself looking at the fourth earl of glenkirk well jemmie ye might say yer glad to see me said patrick leslie wryly father the young mans face was a study in shock my god father ye were dead they said yer ship never reached its destination explanations in a minute jemmie but first tell me of yer mother and of mine oh lord thought jemmie bad news in both quarters for him he sighed and began grandmother meg died this past winter twas an easy death for she was nae ill she simply went to sleep one night and did nae wake again damn said patrick leslie softly if id only come a little sooner then he demanded and yer mother what of my wife james leslie hesitated again then as there was nothing for it but to tell the truth he answered mother is gone father gone he stopped suddenly then said ah yes of course the king would nae wait long before claiming her would he is she at court is she happy she is in italy father she is lord bothwells wife they share exile together the treacherous bitch how long did she wait before endangering the family and running off to her lover dinna ever speak of her in that tone to me again patrick heard his son snarl and looking closely at the young man he was surprised she was devastated when uncle adam brought word that yer ship was lost she held herself completely responsible for yer death and would probably have remained here at glenkirk mourning ye the rest of her life but for the king yer right the moment he heard ye were lost he declared ye legally dead and me the fifth earl i was ordered to wed immediately in order to preserve the glenkirk succession mother was told she had till spring to mourn then she was expected to return to courtand the kings bed she would hae done it too but for me the king did not know that i knew of what had gone on between him ye lord bothwell and mother therefore i could also not be expected to know of his threats against us i supported him loudly and publicly appearing to push mother at him when he came to my wedding he spent his days hunting deer and his nights in mothers bed i can assure ye i seemed most angry and highly offended when she fled her royal master i even went so far as to write a letter to her demanding that she return i took the chance that james would nae revenge himself on me as i was supposed to be ignorant of the whole drama and i won father i won jesu jemmie there was admiration in patrick leslies voice yer a cool one i planned every detail of mothers escape myself said jemmie proudly susan and her younger sister went with her so did conall and about fifty young glenkirk men who were looking for adventure is she happy jemmie james leslies eyes softened for a moment looking at his father he thought you foolto have lost her aye he answered simply she is very happy patrick leslie sighed i should hae let her go wi francis when he was exiled but the king was determined that if he could nae have her then neither could his great rival bothwell it almost broke her heart and i know but for the bairn she carried she would hae died for a moment he was quiet lost in his memories and then he asked my bairns james smiled mother made provisions for us all before she left i wed bella gordon as ye had both arranged bess was wed to bellas brother henry i hae two lads and bess a lad and a lass my uncle of greyhavens son died and mother arranged wi her brother that colin wed wi his eldest girl and become the next master of greyhaven robbie will be wed wi the youngest greyhaven girl at the same time mother settled an income and a manor on him so he would be independent amandas to be the next countess of sithean shell be married in december and wee morag goes to hundeys youngest son malcolm wi a fine big dowry including her own house patrick nodded she did well by the older bairns jemmie what of the little ones when it was safe and james stewart had decided to forget i sent them to their darents for a moment patrick leslie was silent then he said are ye telling me that ian and jane were nae my bairns that bothwell fathered them as well aye so mother told me id hae kept them and raised them as leslies even so but once she and lord bothwell were settled they wanted their children jemmie gazed into patricks saddened face ye lost her long ago father i canna find it in my heart to condemn her twas ye who threw away her love ye canna complain now father the fourth earl was silent for a moment ye know it all dont ye the whole story aye though when she told me she spent half her time defending ye and yer actions the two men sat quietly for a few minutes then james leslie spoke again yeve been gone five years father did ye really expect to return and find nothing changed where were ye that ye could not come back to us sooner and how did ye finally get here patrick leslie held out his glass more whisky lad tis the one thing we dinna have in the new world that i miss and when his son had refilled the glass patrick sipped it appreciatively then spoke the gallant james put out from leith on march twentyseventh we cruised quickly down the north sea through the english channel and out into the atlantic for the next few weeks we sailed westnorthwest under clear skies fresh winds and in smooth seas then suddenly from nowhere a storm struck us i hae seen some wicked storms in my lifetime jemmie but nothing like that somehowthough only god knows howwe kept the vessel righted at one point a wave the color of green ice and the size of a small mountain bore down on us out of the raging sea i managed to grab hold of a rope that was wound about one of the masts but half the crew on deck were washed overboard with that killer wave when the storm finally abated we had been blown far off our course though until several days later i didna know how far the ship or what was left of her was badly crippled we might have died out there had we not been taken in tow by a spanish vessel at first they thought we were english and were all for destroying the heretics fortunately my spanish is pure castilian let that be a lesson to ye jemmie if ye keep yer languages up yell neer be at a loss in a tight spot i explained to the captain of our rescue ship that we were not english but scots and we were nae protestants but catholics i believe i even mentioned uncle charles the abbot and my uncle francis who is now the popes secretary captain velasquez was quite impressed and seeing the medals about our necks believed us but where were ye father the storm had blown us south jemmie to a tip of the continent a place the spanish call florida we were taken to a small town called st augustine and for many months we were kept there i have since learned that they quickly ascertained my true identity by sending to their ambassador in edinburgh cousin jamie however sent return word to the spanish governor in st augustine that though i should not be harmed i was to be detained for as long as possible i think he hoped to bind cat to him so completely that when i did return we would both be forced to accept the kings will patrick leslie sighed the little bastard then he continued though we were prisoners we were royally treated i had a small house of my own and the few crew that survived wi me were all decently cared for eventually as they saw my restlessness i was allowed to ride out wi my captors lord jemmie what a country that new world is the land goes on forever and the variety of it is incredible mountains deserts and great forests filled with trees its a rich land my son is that why ye didna come back sooner father what five years father yeve been gone five years patrick leslie looked slightly bemused the time went so quickly he said softly ah jemmie what a wonderful country it is ye should see it perhaps i shall said the younger earl and yet ye came home father ye came home to glenkirk what are we to do now i dinna intend remaining here my son i hae tasted real freedom in that vast and rich new world i dinna plan to remain in this poor old one there a man can carve an empire for himself and must toady to nae king in the fresh new world there are no kings i came back to see my mother and to see cat now i find that meg is dead and yer mother is long gone considering the circumstances between ye when ye left said james leslie did ye really expect mother to be waiting if only ye had seen the king wi her he could scarce wait to show his royal ownership of her did ye think i could stand by and let her be held up to shame like that there are some who think it an honor to be a kings mistress but we leslies do not i could nae protect her and i knew that she had nae ever stopped loving francis hepburn she deserved any happiness she could get wi him how can i write her now and say that ye are alive and that the marriage she contracted in good faith three years ago is a bigamous one that once again she must be torn from bothwell i canna do that to her i canna then dont jemmie the king declared me dead four years ago therefore yer mothers marriage to me was legally dissolved i came back because i love ye all and i owed it to cat to come back if her feelings about me had changed she might have wanted to return wi me to the new world i had that in mind when i returned now however my conscious is clear she is safe and happy glenkirk is certainly in good hands wi ye for its lord and already there are heirs in the nursery i would see my family though jemmie just the bairns and adam and fiona i cannot cut myself off entirely from glenkirk dinna fear though for no leslie will gie me away besides if yer to do business wi me tis better that theres no secrecy when i return there is a great deal to do setting up a link between us what do ye go back to father patrick leslie smiled i stopped at benjamin kiras house in edinburgh before coming to glenkirk i brought wi me furs silver gold and jewels of various kinds i can continue to supply ye wi these items and benjamin assures me that he can find the market for them i am a wealthy man again but this time in my own right ill need naught from glenkirk jemmie the younger earl was slightly though guiltily relieved knowing his thoughts patrick leslie laughed then james asked but will ye nae be lonely father i will miss ye and my bairns and certainly my grandsons who im soon to meet however and he grinned the rakish grin that jemmie remembered so well

your mother has remarried i see no reason why i should not do so also luisas mother was the daughter of a spanish grandee and her irish father is my business partner he will be damned glad to hae me for a soninlaw luisa knows of my marriage to cat and promised she would wait for my return patrick chuckled the little wildcat said she would rather be my mistress than another mans wife her father would hae beat her black and blue had i not declared myself then and there the young earl laughed and looked at his father admiringly mother always said ye were never at a loss for the lasses he said for a brief moment patrick leslies face was shadowed in sadness he said seriously only wi her was i ever at a loss jemmie we had good times cat and i and we had six fine bairns but i must say honestly that she was hesitant from the very first about being my wife i sometimes think that left to herself she might never hae wed wi me ah well tis a new century we live in jemmie and though hell never
