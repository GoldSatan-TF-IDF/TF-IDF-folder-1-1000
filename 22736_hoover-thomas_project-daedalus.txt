thomas hoover project daedalus prologue thursday am gload is now eight point five pilot must acknowledge for powerup sequence to continue the cockpit computer was speaking in a simulated female voice russian with the moscow accent heard on the evening tv newscast vremya the soviet technicians all called her petra after that programs famous coanchor yuri andreevich androv didnt need to be told the force weighing down on him had reached eight and a half times the earths gravity the oxygen mask beneath his massive flight helmet was crushed against his nose and the skin seemed to be sliding off his skull while sweat from his forehead poured into his eyes and his lungs were plastered against his diaphragm auto termination will commence in five seconds unless you acknowledge petra paused for a beat then spoke again four seconds to shutdown he could sense the blood draining from his cerebral vascular system his consciousness trying to drift away he knew that against these forces the human heart could no longer pump enough oxygen to the brain already he was seeing the telltale black dots at the edge of his vision its begun he thought the event dont dont let it happen make your brain work make it three seconds the liquid crystal video screens inside his flight helmet seemed to be fading from color to black and white even as his vision closed to a narrow circle the tunnel was shrinking to nothing the first stage of a ginduced blackout was approximately two and a half seconds away youve done this a hundred times before at the ramenskoye flight test center he told himself youre russias best test pilot now just do it he leaned back in the seat to lower his head another few millimeters then grasped for the pressure control on his gsuit the inflatable corset that squeezed critical blood paths he ignored the pain as its internal pressure surged gripping his torso and lower legs like a vise and forcing blood upward to counter the accumulation at his feet two seconds with his right hand he rotated a black knob on the heavy sidestick grip and turned up the oxygen feed to his mask an old trick from fighter training school that sometimes postponed the event for a few milliseconds most importantly though he strained as if constipated in the snow literally pushing his blood higherthe best maneuver of all he liked to brag that he had upped his tolerance three gs through years of attempting to crap in his blue cotton undersuit it was working the tunnel had begun to widen out again hed gained a brief reprieve acknowledged he spoke to petra then reached down with his left hand and flicked forward the second blue switch behind the throttle quadrant initiating the simulated hydrogen feed to the outboard scramjet tridents portside and starboard acceleration was still increasing as the flashing green number on the video screens in front of his eyes scrolled past mach over four and a half times the speed of sound already faster than any air breathing vehicle had ever flown only a few seconds more he had to stay conscious long enough to push his speed past mach raising the fuelinjector strut temperature of the scramjets to the degreefahrenheit regime and establishing full ignition if the scramjets failed to stabilize and initiated auto shutdown he would flame outat almost twentyfive hundred miles per hour you are now experiencing nine gs the female voice continued emotionless as ice pilot will confirm vision periphery the fucking computer doesnt believe i can still see he thought most men of course would have been functionally blind by then prolong the experience of ten gs and you went unconscious the event confirm petras voice insisted thirtyeight degrees he read off the video screens inside his helmet temporarily quieting the computer but now he had a demand of his own report scramjet profile inboard tridents at eightytwo percent power outboard tridents at sixtyeight percent power the voice responded get ready petra spread your legs im coming home the velocity scrolling on the right side of his helmet screen was about to pass through the barrier strut temperature was stabilizing with engines in the scramjet mode the vehicle should be able to push right on out to mach seventeen thousand miles per hour from there it was only a short hop to low orbit if inboard tridents at eightyeight percent power the voice came again lac compression nominal the liquid air cycle equipment would be using the cryogenic hydrogen fuel to chill and liquefy the rush of incoming air oxygen would then be injected into the scramjets at pressures impossible to achieve in conventional engines with a sigh he eased back lightly on the throttle grip in his left hand as he felt the weight on his chest recede the pressure in his gsuit automatically let up he smiled to think that a less experienced pilot would now be slumped in his seat head lolling side to side eyes wide open and blank his bloodless brain dreaming of a lunar landscape he knew hed been there often enough himself in the old days system monitors commencing full operation good from here on the fuel controls would be handled by the inflight computer which would routinely monitor thrust and temperature by sampling every two milliseconds then adjusting but that was the machine stuff the childs play hed just done what only a man could do powerup complete for inboard and outboard tridents portside and starboard petra reported finally hydrogen feed now in auto maintenance mode shed taken full charge he was out of the loop but i just rode this space bird up your icecold peredka silicon lady he felt a burst of exhilaration and gave a long basso whoop it was a crow of triumph a challenge to every male ape in the forest yuri andreevich androv lived for this and only felt alive when hed just pushed his body to the limit he needed it lusted for it it was all hed ever really cared about it was he knew his primal need to dominate his world he knew that but so what other men merely dreamed it played at itin games business even politics he did it and he fully intended to go on doing it roll down her audio dammit he yelled into his helmet mike shes driving me crazy shes supposed to a radio voice sounded back in his ear ramenskoye says all test pilotsyou included my friendpay more attention to a female voice a laugh come to matya darling id like to see her andnayarevayetjust once he smiled in spite of himself as the tunnel widened more and the screens before his eyes began to recolor pale hues gradually darkening to primary shades the blood was returning to his brain acceleration was stabilizing now down to gs shed be a coldhearted piece yuri guaranteed its been so long i probably wouldnt notice thats what he really needed nowa woman you would believe me the radio continued by the way congratulations your alpha was right across the oscilloscope as always zero stress response how do you do it tovarisch i think petra was more worried than you were shut off the tape and cut the comrade crap he barked back sergei i nearly lost it there at nine point five no indication on the physio monitors the flight technician sounded unconvinced the hell with the wavy lines i know what was happening he snapped again still wired with tension can we get another fifteen percent tilt out of this damned seat help lower my head therere no windows anyway so who cares where im looking we can send a memo to engineering the radio voice replied though there may not be time tell them theyd better make fucking time say i want it done not enough time what in hell was going on he took one last look at the highdefinition video screensone for each eyeinside the helmet that would be the vehicles windscreen then flipped the snap and began shoving it up he hated the damned thing thought it made him look like a giant hightech moth shall we powerdown the centrifuge now the voice continued unfazed take it down im ready for lunch and a bottle of juice peit budu ya i read you the radio voice chuckled once more knowing there wasnt any vodka to be had for a hundred miles around the facility reports were the project director had heard too many stories about russian drunkenness and somehow always forgot to include liquor in the supply requisition i hear theres borscht again in the mess today petyr just came in from the north quadrant said it tastes like piss bastards still havent learned pomnyu pomnyu he found himself longing for real food seemingly impossible to produce here just like a drink he waited a few seconds longer till the huge white centrifuge had come to a complete stop then shoved down the metal hatch release and stepped out he looked up at the highimpact glass partition of the instrument room waved to the medical team and began unzipping his flight suit it was only half open by the time the technicians marched in anxious to remove quickly the rubber suction cups and wires he was wearing on his head and chest the instrumentation probes for their body monitor system they wanted to reclaim them before he ripped them off something he frequently had been known to do androv always said he was there to fly whatever plane nobody else had the balls to not take a physical so he wanted the goddam things off and fast air force major yuri andreevich androv was thirty seven tall with the studied swagger all soviet test pilots seemed to acquire after a few years his dark eyes and hair were set off by a high forehead and long lean cheeks and behind those cynical eyes lurked a penetrating intelligence there was something else too the most vital attribute a test pilot can have a perfect natural integration of the two sides of his brain soviet medical studies had shown that the best pilots were artists because handling a plane at three times the speed of sound was primarily a function of the intuitive right side of the brain the side that provides the instincts the seatofthepants judgment the left brain in contrast handled a pilots rational functionsit was his data management system his computer flight instructors for tactical aircraft at the ramenskoye flight test center south of moscow knew that a pilot lost his edge when his brain started getting its signals mixed when it was no longer sure which side was in control they called it the biology barrier the result of information overload in a stress situation it could lead to a total breakdown the brain went haywire yuri androv was one of the few soviet test pilots who never reached the biology barrier he was in fact the best he knew that his gift was one of the reasons he had been specially selected for this project another was experience over the years hed flown them allthe tupolev blackjack the mig foxbat even the ultrasecret new mig foxhound but this hydrogenfueled scramjetpowered monster opened the door to another world above mach you were no longer merely supersonic you were hypersonicwhere no airbreathing vehicle had ever ventured could it be done he had to admit the technology was awesomeall the aerodynamic design by supercomputer the new ceramic composites for the leading edges the mach bursttests in the hypersonic wind tunnel the scramjet statictest powerups at the aeropropulsion facility this was supposedly just a spaceresearch vehicle for godsake but it had twelve engines and whereas the mig the ussrs fastest fighterinterceptor topped out well under two thousand miles per hour this spaceage creation was capable theoretically of speeds almost ten times that the schedule agreed upon called for the certification of both the prototypes in their lowerspeed turboramjet mode and then the commencement of hypersonic flight tests in the scramjet mode that second phase wasnt supposed to begin for three months but now the project director had ordered the test program accelerated demanding the hypersonic test flights begin immediately with the one prototype now certifiedin ten days maybe just maybe it could be done of course everybody else would be sitting safely in flight control there in the east quadrant when he kicked in the scramjets at sixty thousand feet his ass would be the one in the cockpit this was the riskiest project of his life until the operational shakedown nobody actually knew whether or not those damned scramjets would produce a standing shock wave in their combustion chamber creating a supersonic compressor the way the supercomputer promised they would and what about somebodys brilliant idea of using the planes liquid hydrogen fuel as coolant for the leading edges to dissipate the intense heat of hypersonic flight had to do it they claimed computer says theres no other way but that was about as brilliant as filling your car radiator with frozen jet fuel hed be flying in a cocoon of liquid hydrogen and even scarier hed be doing it blind with no windscreen if he burned up hed have to watch it on television he glanced back one last time at the white centrifuge a fiftyfoot propeller with the simulated cockpit on one blade and a counterbalancing weight on the other the centrifuge itself was pure white enamel spotless just like the room a little honest russian dirt would actually have made him feel better riding in that cockpit was like being strapped inside a video game all lights and nothing real frowning he shrugged and passed on through the door greeted the milling technicians and tossed his crumpled flight suit toward two medics from the foreign team who caught it in midair bowed and hurried it into the medical lab for the devil take it he didnt know and he didnt care the fluorescentlit hall was crowded with whiteshirted technicians returning from the mornings test in number one the big hypersonic wind tunnel everybody was smiling which told him the final runup of the model must have gone without a hitch that was the last segment of the revised schedule the hypersonic test flight was on in eighteen days what in hell was the sudden rush what was everybodys real agenda nobody was talking that was what really bothered him had bothered him from the start this topsecret vehicle wasnt destined to be some kind of civilian spaceresearch platform regardless of what anybody claimed who were they fooling the ultimate weapons delivery system had just been built here a hightech behemoth that married advanced soviet thruster and guidance technology with a hypersonic airframe and scramjets created by the worlds leading manufacturer of hightemperature alloys and supercomputers and it was all being done here the one place on earth with the technology here the trouble was this wasnt russia so daedalus devised his winding maze and as one entered it only a wary mind could find an exit to the world again ovid the metamorphoses book one chapter one wednesday am youre lucky i love this spot vance said gazing out over the city nothing else on the planet could have got me up this early in the morning its the one place i thought i could persuade you to meet me the bearded man sighed his dark eyes grim the accent was russian the english flawless i have a problem a very big problem the cold wars over alex or maybe you hadnt heard he strolled on tugging his trench coat tighter what have we got left to talk about please we both did what we had to i still do lifes too short for anything else he turned back now how about telling me whats on your mind vance was firmmuscled and lean with the leathery skin of a man who drank his tequila straight and preferred spending his days in the sun two habits that also had bestowed a network of threadlike smile lines at the corners of his seablue eyes aleksei ilyich novosty had phoned him at the athenaeum intercontinental half an hour earlier begging to meet him saying it was of the utmost importance a cab was downstairs the driver had taken him to the old flea market at monastiraki square where alexs own black limo waited but now novosty was playing games and the days for kgb games were supposed to be in the distant past what did the man want my friend give me a moment novosty wiped his brow manicured nails glistening then looked up and pointed by the way ive always believed that one is the most exquisite female in the world that one there what do you think sexy plenty of style vance swept his eyes over the figure loving how the cloth was shaped by her breast the vague hint of thigh as one leg brushed against the gauze of her tunic but the lady next to hers a looker too always seemed a tough call above them the stone caryatids smiled down their pale faces timeless and ethereal they were greek statues that served as columns for the south porch of the erechtheum the ionic temple standing across from the doric parthenon down below the steep north wall of the acropolis the darkglazed rooftops of athens city of pericles droused mutely in the early haze yes perhaps youre right novosty brushed awkwardly at his patchy stubble searching for an opening he knew vance never made the first move always waited for the other side to show its cards michael i is it true you occasionally still take an assignment i mean outside the usual work for arm i made some inquiries in geneva last week the word is hang on i think youre getting your team colors mixed i work for the other side remember he stooped and picked up a handful of the grainy red soil at their feet massaging it in his fingers and wondering why it had taken him so long to get back here to greece this was where he belonged this was the place the ancient people he still dreamed about but could he fit in again after so many years away yes hed make it work michael vance jr had the sangfroid of one who moved easily among the decisionmakers of two continents he was to the manner bornyaleand hed long since concluded it was the way man was meant to live in years past hed been a field archaeologist and a good one then hed had a brief consulting stint for the cia these days he lived at the nassau yacht club marina where he moored his restored fortyfourfoot bristol racing yacht the ulysses headquarters for his threeboat charter operation he was mortgaged to the hilt but he didnt really care when things got tight he could always take on a quick money job for the association of retired mercenaries arm the situation is not necessarily what youre thinking novosty pressed so perhaps you would consider whatever it is the answers still no the next three weeks are going to be spent working on a tan why tell alex the facts today he was in athens for only a few hours a stopover on the way to crete he glanced at his watchan old eterna chronomatic the classic he lovedand calculated that the flight for iraklion left in less than four hours this time tomorrow morning he would be looking in on the crew from the university of stuttgarts dig for the german historical society part of the restoration of a minoan palace near cretes southern shore novosty and all he stood for were the last thing he needed right now then at least lets have coffee the russian said finally pointing i brought some there in the bag vance needed it to cut his hangover without a word he turned to the marble steps pried open the white paper and reached in plastic dismay filled his voice as he lifted out one of the smooth styrofoam cups and examined it like an insect this nails it game over our side won all the chips now even greek coffee comes american style he frowned as he pried the white lid from the cup whats left its everywhere perhaps theyll wrap these statues in cellophane next who knows i fear the worst he took a sip relishing the first hit of the dawn it was dark and sweet the real thing despite the container michael please at least hear me out he reached for a cigarette extracting it filterfirst from his trench coat i have a serious personal problem and i dont know where else to turn could it be true vance examined him more closely the beard wasnt the only change the left side of his gray coat bulged as he searched for his lighter alex had never bothered to carry his own protection at least never before he knew alex novosty was part of kgbs tdirectorate russias special organization for hightech theft in the old days he operated out of sophia arranging the laundering of underground soviet funds by mingling them with the flight capital and drug money that made its way between turkeys ziraat bank the vaticans istituto per le opere di religione and geneva noquestions fronts with names like the banco di roma per la svizzera the truth was michael vance jr and aleksei ilyich novosty had over the years often traveled the same paths they used the same organizations and contactsnovosty to conceal illicit monies vance to expose them you know i always enjoyed our games novosty looked out over athens his voice trailing off but as you say that was the old days the worlds changed now perhaps we can just be two professionals do some business he seated himself on a block of marble still slightly moist with morning dew and withdrew a wrinkled clipping it was from the times of london here read this please vance glanced down at it then realized he had already read it on the reuters satellite news service he had looked it over stored it in his newsupdate computer file and promptly forgotten about it soviet party official sought in disappearance of funds moscow mar the central committee today lodged formal charges against a cpsu official viktor fedorovich volodin first secretary of the oblast of sakhalin in connection with his alleged embezzlement of government funds and subsequent disappearance the island of sakhalin together with the kuril islands is an administrative district in the far eastern region of the soviet federated socialist republics since being taken from japan in the southern sakhalin oblast has been closed to all western visitors the island is said to have a major military airfield at dolinsk and a naval base at korsakov facing la perouse strait the only yearround passage between soviet warmwater ports in asia and the north pacific it is an economically and strategically vital part of the soviet far east with the only oil fields in the eastern regions the amount embezzled is reported at twenty million rubles which would make party secretary volodin responsible for the largest outright theft of state monies in the history of the soviet union vance looked up the home team at play some ministry shell game probably little budget scam whats it got to do with you my friend this thing is no game novosty crumpled his cup in his other hand the cigarette remained unlit i was involved of course i didnt know then but if dzerzhinsky square finds out i stupidly let myself be he flicked his black italian lighter then inhaled kgb will post me to yakutsk piece by piece in very small boxes vance stared into his dark eyes trying to gauge the truth none of it added up alex youre one of the sharpest guys in the business so assuming this is straight why in hell would you let yourself even get close to it the thing had to be some internal play for a moment the bearded man said nothing merely smoked quietly on his cigarette the sun was beginning to illuminate the cloud bank in the east harbinger of the midday athens shower perhaps i yes it was an unknown but what is life without unknowns the job looked simple michael i just had to launder it easy enough of course if i had realized again his voice trailed into the morning haze so whats the inside story novosty drew once more on his cigarette finally he spoke all right the number of twenty million rubles of course its disinformation typical the real amount naturally is classified there is even a formal directive signed by chief first directorate gribanov guess kgb still has enough clout to write the rules the old ways die hard they and the military are fighting a rearguard action to protect their turfjust as your cia and the us department of defense are doing now which is why they are so concerned about this if they dont get to the bottom of it they will once again be proved incompetent as well as overfunded he scratched at his beard more to the point this operation went around them thats a very bad precedent if you understand what im saying and the money michael was almost three times what they admitted in dollars it was over a hundred million nice chunk of change vance whistled quietly even now though i have to admit it was brilliant flawless viktor fedorovich volodin first secretary of the state committee for sakhalin far eastern district got authority signed off got his passport stamped vyezdnye or suitable for travel and then wired the sixty million rubles not to the district but to the state bank of poland with instructions for conversion a lot of money yes but it was not unprecedented and he did it late friday around two in the afternoon after all the nomenklatura had left for their weekend dachas by monday morning he was in warsaw to clarify the mistake next the money was sent to my old bank connection in sophia by then of course its zlotis i just assumed it was something kgb wanted laundered he paused they claim sometimes things have to be handled outside the nomenklatura to avoid the paperwork bottleneck so how much did you end up cleaning all of it he sighed i converted it to deutsche marks then bought pounds sterling and used those to acquire british gilts the longterm government bonds theyre currently parked in a dummy account at moscow narodny bank in london the momentary lilt drained from his voice but now now what can i do the funds are just sitting there waiting but if i show up and try to wire them out im probably as good as dead the man whos tired of london is tired of life michael the moment im seen in london i may not have a life i think kgb already suspects i was somehow connected if they find me they will turn me into sausages im trapped youve got to help me move it again make the trail just disappear he tossed away his cigarette and immediately reached into his overcoat for another seems to me the first thing you ought to do is try and locate comrade volodin maybe let a couple of your boys have a small hearttoheart with him little socialist realism give him some incentive to straighten it out himself michael first directorate is already combing the toilets of the world for him hes vanished the ministry of defense and the gru the military secret service exactly the minute either of them finds him the mans a corpse he shrugged eyes narrowing if i dont find him first vance listened wondering thats a very touching story you could almost set it to music only trouble is the punch lines missing theres got to be moretoo much moneys involved so who else is in on this south africa israel angola what do you mean ive told you everything i know volodin the bastard used me as part of his swindle but now hes lost his nerve and run disappeared and left me to face sure thats all there is to it he cut in laughing incidentally you take your standard cut up front back at the beginning michael please i am a businessman of course the usual percentage but now like you say its a problem he turned to stub out his cigarette a nightmare think about it a hundred million dollars us thats starting to be real money even for the ussr not even the czars ever managed to steal so much vance looked him over novosty was telling the story backward inside out look whenever somebody gives me only half a setup i just michael no one knows better than you all the ways money can be moved in this world those funds must be made to just vanish from london then reappear another place with no trail i have already arranged for a bank far away after that the money can be returned anonymously what other solution is there he hesitated painfully you know i have no friends i have not boughtthe definition of a tragic life but i remember you always were a man who kept his word i can trust you besides where else can i turn alex forget it ive already got all the fun i can handle vance sipped his coffee now down to the black grounds and undissolved sugar it was both bitter and sweet contradictory sensations against his tongue just like novostys tale part truth and part lie alex had no intention of returning the money for chrisake he was probably in the scam with volodin and now the hounds were baying the main problem was who were the hounds michael do us both a favor help me move it he pressed ill take care of the rest and ill even give you half the two million that was my commission just take it gold tax free its yours youll be set for life all you have to do is arrange to transfer the money to another bank i will tell you i have an account already waiting everything but i cant do it myself theyre too close to me a million dollars he thought christ with that you could pay off the four hundred thousand mortgage on the boats free and clear youd also be helping alex out of a jam and the man looked like he could use all the help he could get he stared out toward the encircling mountains now swathed in fleecy clouds no the deal had too many unknowns the whole point of working for yourself was you could pick and choose your jobs if you ever started going with the highest bidder you were a fool guys who did that didnt last in this business afraid ill have to pass therere plenty of other that was when he absently glanced down at the early sun glinting off the windows of athens in the parking lot below a tan latemodel audi had just pulled in he watched as it idled incidentally he said as he thumbed at the car friends of yours more art lovers novosty took one look and stopped cold michael im sorry i really must be going but perhaps you might wish to stay here for a few more minutes enjoy the women though i hear you like them better in the flesh he reached into his breast pocket think about what ive said and in the meantime you should have this he handed over a gray envelope its the original authorization i received from volodin when he transferred the funds to the bank in sophia look im not please just take it incidentally it probably means nothing but theres a corporate name there i originally assumed it was kgbs cover who knows he continued to urge the envelope into vances hand ive written the london information you will need on the back the account at narodny everything he was turning be reasonable my friend we can help each other maybe more than you realize hold on vance was opening the envelope then he lifted out a folded page blue good name for a dummy front nice mythic ring what novosty glanced back ah yes from the old story daedalus yes everything about this is a fiction i realize that now of course the daedalus corporation does not exist he paused like you say its just a myth vance was examining the sheet an ice blue reflecting the early light almost luminous something about it was very strange then he massaged it with his fingertips it wasnt paper instead it was some sort of synthetic composition smooth like silicon saying nothing he turned away and extracted a booklet of hotel matches he struck one cupped it against the light wind and with a quick motion touched the flame to the lower corner of the sheet the fire made no mark so his hunch was right the paper was heat resistant when he held it up to examine it against the early sun he noticed there was a watermark ever so faint an opaque symbol that covered the entire page it was so large he hadnt seen it at first it could have been reflections in the paper he stared a second before he recognized talk to me he whirled around the truth for a change do you know where im headed this afternoon i confess my people did obtain your itinerary michael but only in order to when only yesterday that was after you got your hands on this right of course i just told you that was the original authorization the daedalus corporation that name is only a myth nothing but paper he began walking briskly down the steps next to the temple of athena nike the sacred way toward his black limousine in the parking lot we will finish this later the final arrangements i will be in touch vance watched as the black limo backed around and quickly headed toward the avenue after a few moments the tan audi slowly pulled out of the parking lot to follow he turned back to look at the temples sorting through the story somebody in this world this daedalus corporation or whomever it represented had a hundred million dollars coming dollars now all nicely laundered and ready to go what did it add up to in years past alex novosty had moved money with total impunity so why would he turn up in athens bearing an elaborate and patently bogus story begging for help it couldnt be for the boys back at dzerzhinsky square in moscow they never went outside with their own problems besides they cleaned money all the time somebody somewhere was pulling a fast one dont touch it he told himself for once in your life just walk away its got to be hot bad news all around just forget it and go on to crete he could hardly wait eva borodin was meeting him there a decadelate reunion after all the stormy water under the bridge or was it going to be a rematch whichever that was going to be a scene he had vague hopes they might put together a rerun of years past only this time with a happy ending still mulling over the pieces of novostys puzzle he turned and headed for the northwest edge of the acropolis in the distance stood the ring of mountains that once served as athenss natural fortress parnes mantled in dark forests of fir the marble face of pentelikon hymettus legendary haunt of the honeybee aigaleos its noble twin crests rising up to greet the early sun and directly below lay the excavated ruins of the ancient agora the city center where socrates once misled the youth of greece teaching them to think now vance needed to think remembering it all later he realized hed been in precisely the wrong place to actually witness the accident he just heard itthe screech of rubber the sickening crunch of metal hed raced to look but the intersection below was already a carpet of flame what had happened there was a gasoline truck short and bulky wheels spinning in the air its hood crumpled against the remains of an automobile he strained to see which was it alexs limo the tan audi then came the explosion blotting out everything an immense orange ball that seemed to roll upward into the morning sky like an emerging sun wednesday am viktor fedorovich volodin was amazed hed managed to make his way this far from the fiery intersection at the base of the acropolis all the way down leoforos amalias without his frayed facade of calm completely disintegrating he bit his lip using the pain to hold back the panic traffic on the avenue was backed up as far as he could see and firemen were still trying to reach the charred remains of the truck on his right the new zapio conference center and its geometric gardens were shrouded in smoke he scarcely noticed breathing was impossible anyway since the diesel fumes of the bus settled in through its broken windows and drove out all oxygen how had it come to this hed spent his entire life in the party apparatus of sakhalin rubberstamping idiotic economic plans concocted in moscow trying to survive the infighting and intrigue of the oblasts state committee then one day a personal aide of none other than the president mikhail sergeevich himself had secretly made an offer that sounded too good to be true help transfer some funds do it for the motherland it would be simple kgb would never know nobody told him hed be stepping into a nightmare and now his worst fears had come true to see your driver crushed alive only inches away then watch him incinerated they were closing in fsyo kanula ve vyechnost he thought kak ve prizrachnoy skazke everything is gone now like a fairy tale he crouched down in the torn plastic seat as the ancient city bus bumped and coughed its way into the center of syntagma square around him were packed the usual morning commuters gripping briefcases and lunch bags cursing the delays and blaming the incompetents in parliament the air was rank with sweat finally the vehicle shuddered to a halt end of the line he rose trembling and worked his way to the forward exit then dropped off as his feet touched down on the warm pavement he quickly glanced right and left searching the crowded midmorning street for any telltale signs that hed been followed there was nobody he concluded with relief the milling greeks didnt seem to notice he was there or care they were too busy complaining about the traffic the smog the latest round of inflation business as usual in athens the timeless city this place he told himself should have been the perfect location to hide to just disappear novosty was supposed to handle the final delivery maybe the crash had been an accident fate sudba things happened that way he was sweating heavily now whether from fear or the early morning sun he wasnt sure already it was a nascent ball of fire in the east promising to bake the asphalt of the square by noon he stepped over the curb and onto the sidewalk the outdoor cafes were all thronged with workers and tourists having a quick coffee before taking on the city this spring day he felt his knees tremble slightly and realized he only wanted to collapse any table would do just melt into the crowd he told himself then nothing can happen nichevo nye sluchitsya he wiped at his brow and settled nervously into the first empty chair plastic and dirty hoping to look like just another tourist the cafe he noted was papaspyrou in front of the american express office perfect above all else he wanted to pass for an american but he was still trying to get it right how did they look elleniko kafe my friend greek coffee he jumped at the sound of the voice over his shoulder seizing the side of the table the voice was speaking english he finally realized maybe he did look american it was an accident he kept telling himself the truck couldnt haverelax novosty made the arrangement with the american didnt he you saw him hand over the letter now the trail will just vanish kgb will never be able to stop it he turned casually flashed an empty smile for the small grayhaired waiter standing behind him tray in hand white towel over the sleeve of his tailored but frayed brown suit sure thanks youre better every day he told himself youre even starting to get the accent right now keep working on it the twang and learn to saunter the shoulders americans walk looser swing their arms seem not to have a care in the world learn to slouch act like you own the world even if you no longer do hed been secretly practicing for weeks getting ready to disappear after his part was over of course hed originally planned to go back home afterward but that was before he had a taste of this the good life the freedom for that matter maybe hed go to america why not hed heard how it worked defection so the stories went could be very rewarding theyd open the golden gates for him at langley the tiny cup of murky black coffee appeared in front of him together with the usual glass of tepid water he reached for the water eagerly and drank it down something anything to moisten the cotton in his mouth there that was better now the hard part something to quiet his mind the cup rattled against the saucer as he gingerly picked it up he could still see the cab of the truck coming out of nowhere hurtling down on them still feel the horror odd but he couldnt remember anyone at the wheel he wanted a face but none was there his own driver the afghanistan veteran grigor yanovich had tried to swerve but he hadnt been quick enough hed caught the first impact the grind of metal that whipped the tan audi around flung open the door grigor thirty years old must have died without ever knowing what happened if not from the impact then from the wall of flaming gasoline that swept over the seat he marveled at his own luck the hand of chance that flung him from the car only a second ahead of the explosion he remembered skidding across the pavement on his back then tumbling into the grassy ditch that separated amalias avenue from the tiny side road of thrassilou some of the raw gasoline had drenched his sleeve but hed been safely out of the way his face down when the explosion came it could have been an accident he swiped at his brow and told himself that anything was possible dont be a fool theyre closing in how much do they know he sipped at the gritty coffee and scanned the street just get through the next few days he told himself once the transfers complete your parts over he was reaching for his small white cup when he noticed the woman striding directly toward his table smiling catching his eye the way she was swinging her brown leather purse the jaunty thrust of hips beneath the suede skirt the carefully groomed auburn hairall marked her as american rich american probably headed into american express to cash a thousand or so in travelers checks america he lounged back in his chair with a rakish air he was he knew an attractive man he had deep blue eyes sandy hair a practiced smile a trim figure far younger than his fiftysix years hed divorced his wife natasha three years ago after she discovered his lunchtime liaisons with one of the girls in the state committee typing pool he had experience handling women three weeks in athens he thought and maybe my luck is about to change if you can get her the nightmare could be over for a while you cant go back to the hotel now they may be watching but if shes got a room somewhere what better way to hide out till the transfer is complete he was still trying to make his ragged mind function now was the time for a pickup routine the lonely traveler kak grussno mnye tak zhalostno mnye no damn not the sentimental russian think american but where hed heard of new york san francisco miami even chicago but what if she was from one of those places all the careful preparation and he still didnt dare put himself to the test so what would he say canada australia her eyes held his interest growing as she continued to approach they were darkened with kohl sensual inviting and she was still smiling even as she placed her hand on the chair across from him was this how the women america was the promised land etot stolnik osvobodetsya viktor fedorovich it took a second for the language to register she was speaking russian calmly inquiring if the table was free but his mind was rejecting it refusing to accept the implications perhaps youd like to buy me a kofye comrade i prefer it very sweet now she was settling her purse on the table adjusting her tight skirt in preparation to sit or would you rather take me shopping i could help you spend some of the money hed never seen her before in his life your part will be routine somewhere in the back of his mind echoed the voice of the presidents personal aide the brisk young muscovite who had come to his dacha that snowy evening last october we will take care of any risks it had all been a lie every word they must have known where he was every minute then he spotted the two men approaching from opposite sides of the square the suits that didnt quite fit the trudging gait why must they always look like the stupid brutal party hacks they are he thought bitterly the incompetent bastards who betrayed me was it novosty did he do this to get them off his trail so be it first ill kill her and then i kill him seething he pulled his body erect while his right hand plunged for the snap on the holster at his belt simple hed just shoot her on the spot then make a run for it through the cafe out the back they wouldnt dare start anything here in the middle of athens that would cause an international incident the snap was open he thumbed up the leather flap and realized the holster was empty the crash it must have jarred loose his new walther automatic had been incinerated along with the audi his life began to flash before his eyes make a run for it he heard his mind saying commandeer the first taxi any taxi he shoved back from the table sending his chair clattering across the patched sidewalk she reached into her leather purse now lying atop the table next to his coffee he heard the click of a safety sliding off dont be impetuous viktor fedorovich youve been such a good boy this last week showing us the sights the perfect tour guide but now your little vacation is over we must talk about what she smiled whatever you think we need to hear i dont know anything he could feel the cold sweat on his palms viktor fedorovich she brushed at her auburn hair as she continued in russian you have the most valuable commodity in the world knowledge that makes you even richer than you think you are now they didnt try to kill me this morning he suddenly realized it was alex they were is he planning to double cross everybody no thats insane hed never get away with it he has to deliver the payment kgb wants me alive he thought with a wave of relief they think im the one who knows where it is his pulse raced what do you want we need you to answer certain questions but not here at a place where its quieter the two men were loitering closer now only a few feet away one on each side of the table the first was overweight with bushy eyebrows and pockmarked cheeks he could be ukrainian the other was medium height wearing a cheap polyester suit balding and sallow neither looked as though he had smiled in the last decade where do you want to go we will take a stroll in the park she gestured toward amalias avenue on the other side was ethnikos kipos the national garden then she smiled again we thought you would like to take the morning air she rose purse in hand and tossed a wad of drachmas onto the wooden table the coffee drinkers around them did not look up from their newspapers and tourist maps as they made their way past the olympic airways office on the corner and across the avenue she said nothing her silence is deliberate he told himself part of a trick to unnerve me it was working he was learning something about himself hed never before known he was learning he was a coward that was the reality he wouldnt hold out hed tell them everything he knew because they would hurt him badly he couldnt bear pain they probably knew that and then theyd kill him anyway because he couldnt tell them the one thing they wanted to know he didnt know it himself viktor fedorovich volodin realized he was about to die all the years of pointless intrigue in the party the fudging of production figures the fatherinlaw whod made his existence wretched it all added up to a lifetime of nothing but misery with the payoff a bullet rasstrel a kgb execution they were entering the national garden a mirage of green in the desert of asphalt and cement that is central athens its informal walkways were shady lanes of quiet and cool that seemed miles away from the smoke and glare and heat of the avenues finally she spoke were running out of time and patience viktor fedorovich lets start with the money where have you deposited it next we want to know the names of everyone ititsi dont know where it is now youre lying she did not break her pace the time for that is over but i dont have it someone else he heard himself blurting out the truth hes in charge of everything you are lying again you are the one who embezzled the funds she was walking by his side as they entered a secluded alleyway of hedges the other two trailed only inches behind there was no escape the criminal is you viktor fedorovich no heii dont know anything how true was that he asked himself he knew where the money was supposed to go but he didnt know what it was for at least not specifically that part had been classified he had the small picture but not the big one if you know nothing then telling us everything you do know should not take very long the calm the assurance in her voice sent chills through him he knew he would talk and they knew it too however the more you have to say the longer we can linger the early morning park with its manicured footpaths and wandering cats was empty except for a few gardeners trimming hedges watering the grass collecting loose papers the sounds of the avenue were rapidly receding now the two men had moved directly alongside one by each arm he realized they were both taller than he was and they smelled wait i dont know where its deposited now i wasnt supposed to know but theres still time i can help they were entering a long arbor a high trellis bright with obscuring red flowers when the first blow came into his left side directly in his kidney he groaned and sagged breath gone while the man on the right slipped an arm around and held him erect yes viktor fedorovich the woman continued tonelessly you will help us because you will want to die long before we let you so shall we try again where is the money its i dont know exactly but he gasped and sagged again as another blow came already he wasnt sure how much more pain he could tolerate how long before he would just blurt out everything he knew a third blow and his knees crumpled he had never known the meaning of pain or fear until this moment why not just tell them his frightened mind was pleading alex has already set it up with the american you are worse than a mere criminal she went on dark eyes filling with anger you are a traitor you will tell us every detail of your involvement from the very beginning how much did they really know he wondered were they bluffing they were bluffing he quickly concluded otherwise she wouldnt be asking him things she should already know if you talk youll jeopardize everything the most important thing now is to keep kgb from discovering the scenario if they do they still could stop it of course they were alarmed they should be in the new russia being born there was no place for them but i cant endure pain ill talk if theres pain he felt a surge of resolve whatever else happens he told himself i wont be the one responsible for making it fail i cant let them know any more than they do now ive another blow struck him in the side and he felt his knees turn to butter none of the gardeners in the park seemed aware that a man was about to be beaten to death to them the four foreigners were merely huddled together as they strolled enjoying the dubious beauty of modern athens another blow came and he wheezed please let me just hed been gathering his strength for this moment now he lunged forward shutting out the stab of pain in his side and wrenched at her open purse the two men reached for him but not before he had it in his grasp his hand plunged in as he rolled to the ground they were on top of him now shoving his face against the loose pebbles of the walkway but they were too late he felt the smooth metal of the grip it was what he wanted he recalled the triumphant words fyodor dostoyevski had uttered upon being released from prison freedom new life resurrection what a glorious moment ya nye boyuc za sebya he thought with joy i have no more fear he heard the shot faintly as the bullet ripped through the back of his mouth and entered his brain viktor fedorovich volodin died with serene final knowledge daedalus whatever it was was still safe and he was free chapter two wednesday pm michael you look marvelous its so good to see you again i really mean that the years have treated you well eva borodin leaned back against the gray fabric of the saabs headrest and appraised him you dont look half bad yourself vance smiled to himself as he returned the favor vintage eva ladling on the flattery but she was smashing just as he rememberedthe coalblack hair the smoldering eyes the high slavic cheekbones then too her every gesture was spiked with the promise of olympic sensuality he remembered that as well everything about her spoke of a time and place far away where there were no rules eva the eternal eva with a phd everythings just the same that part wasnt entirely true there had been some changes probably for the better instead of a plunging neckline and a fortune in gold accessories she was wearing a blue silk blouse formfitting designer jeans with an eightydollar scarf for a belt and lambskin boots far more demure than the old eva what had happened to the dangling turquoise earrings enough musky perfume to obscure radar at least one endangered fur draped somewhere the years had definitely mellowed her the slavic passion seemed curbed today the same way her hair had been trimmed down to a pageboy maybe he thought this was her new look the russian aristocrat of the nineties no michael im different now or im trying to be she laughed flashed her comeon smile and tried to toss her missing hair whoops he thought sure youve changed being formally promoted to director of sigint brings responsibilities she continued congratulations it was two years ago well congratulations anyway he was beginning to wonder if she really had mellowed back in the old days her russianness was her way of making a statement an identity how much could she change want to change shed always been a firebrand throwing things was her preferred mode of communication not to suggest she wasnt verbal she was always passionately happy to see him passionately sad when bad things happened passionately angry when she didnt get her way everything she said was flirtatious carrying a sexual innuendo sometimes he thought she made jean harlow sound like jeane kirkpatrick your call caught me a little off guard he glanced over i never expected to hear from you again after you disappeared into the labyrinth of nsa he knew shed been with the national security agency for eight years now but he hadnt heard that shed been promoted to director of soviet satellite intercepts of course nsa didnt spend a lot of money on press releases still it was no surprise eva knew her stuff when it came to the soviets their satellites their codes i must say though this is a hell of a long way to come for a catchup chat its been way too many years since weve seen each other ive missed you hope you mean that did she he wondered even if she did that wasnt the real reason shed come he knew her too well guess youll have to try and find out she said her voice holding an instinctive automatic invitation guess i will already it felt like the old days how did she know so precisely where all his buttons were the only thing im sure of so far today is that this mornings little accident was no accident hed told her about seeing novosty but not what theyd talked about why drag her into it besides shed known about alex a lot longer than he had just one more piece of the past that didnt need to be stirred up somebody got taken out the question is who we both know novostys a survivor old school but i probably shouldnt say this michael but i assume youre aware hes kgb part of tdirectorate her voice had grown serious that executive vp slot he has with techmashimport is just his cover weve had a file of intercepts on him for years of course i know about him good old alex and i go back a while youre slightly out of date concerning my most recent fun and games all right i mean i wouldnt even bring it up but i think you should be warned kgbs in a big turmoil looking for something she paused whenever this happens therere plenty of stray arrows sure to be flying just stay out of the crossfire a word to the wise i may already be in it thanks to novostys little welcome aboard breakfast he remembered the letter alex had given him but im beginning to think id damn well better find out she looked around sharply what happened did he say something if you believe him somebody in moscow mislaid a few million dollars darndest thing its better left alone darling im on vacation remember he winked at her with better things to do i should hope so she leaned back again and studied his profile well at long last its happened i finally have to admit i need you for something her long dark lashes fluttered warming me up he thought now were getting down to business which is why i wanted to meet you here they were five minutes out of iraklion on an unpaved back road he loved headed for the palace at knossos and so far shed done nothing but hint about what was on her mind everything was still a puzzle for one thing she never needed anybody she was the stalwart russian whod ended their affair eleven years earlier just as casually as she had begun it this afternoon though she seemed to be deliberately keeping the lid on holding back uncharacteristic the truth is she went on ive been thinking about us the old times and the palace shed called him in nassau four days earlier wanting to get together it was the old eva darling this and darling that when he said he was going to crete shed grown strangely silent then shed saidin a curious tiny voicewhy dont i just meet you there in fact thats sort of why i rang so whys the palace suddenly so important to you he examined her still trying to read her mood i need to go back out today try and brush up a bit but that place was part of our problem back when not part of the solution she didnt answer instead she shifted the conversation sideways speaking of the palace i suppose i should congratulate you on finally being proved right did the stuttgart team really ask you to look in on their dig call it the ultimate capitulation he grinned remember they were the ones who led the critical fusillade when the book first came out that makes it doubly sweet right i also remember that book of yours caused such a stink that no serious university would consider hiring you which i assume is why you ended up a parttime spook probably it was the only job you could get youre closer to the truth than you know he laughed wondering for the tenthousandth time if he should have stuck out the academic slings and arrows no the secret truth was he was bored with the university regimen he yearned for the real world he knew it then and he knew it now then the next thing i heard you were down in the bahamas goofing off and renovating some old yacht she looked him over once more shaking her head what did you end up christening it the fuck everybody crossed my mind but then i chickened out and called her the ulysses he leaned back and reflected momentarily on the fortyfourfoot bristol racing sloop hed restored having picked it up for a song at a customshouse sale on bay street formerly the possession of a colombian in the export business it had a hull of one and threequarter inch planked cedar with a trim beam did an easy fifteen knots in a decent breeze he loved her hed installed a fortune in electronics including a micrologic commander loran and a navstar satellite navigation system it started out as a hobby and three boats and a mortgage later it ended up a business and what do you do down there all day just sit around and drink margaritas sure about once a month he reached up and adjusted the open top of the car hate to admit it but on a typical day im usually out of bed by sunrise check the weather then maybe take a short swim to get the oxygen flowing after that i go to work the office is up forward in the ulysses my main discovery is that chartering is pretty much like any other business mostly problems it was there were always tourists who came to nassau thinking they wanted more than the standard hotels topless shows and casinos on paradise island and cable beach they wanted a taste of what it was like sailing through the family islands away from the glitz a feeling for the real caribbean or so they thought that was until they discovered the hard way that the real thing included broiling sun jellyfish stings nosy sharks hangovers seasickness closequarters quarrels with spouses and significant others snapped fishing lines generator failures unexpected weather and you manage to do okay right nobody ever got rich in the charter business at least the kind im in if youre not running highpriced south american produce you have to do it for love not money his real livelihood which he didnt bother to mention came from elsewhere in between managing bahamian skippers and crews he also kept a hand in another occupation in years past hed served as a financial consultant for the cia helping monitor the flow of illicit drug and terrorist money passing through the banking laundries of geneva and the caribbean when the company finally formed its own section to handle that work hed moved on and hired out his expertise to a freelance organization called arm the association of retired mercenaries they were retired all right but only from the antiterrorist units of a half dozen european nations they still saw plenty of covert action squelching those terrorist activities european governments wanted dealt with outside official channels he was their money man and they paid him well which was how he kept his three vessels shipshape and lived a yachtsmans life of ease so after all these years you ended up doing exactly what you wanted she looked at him admiringly a lot of people would probably envy you that i like taking my own risks if thats what you mean well all the same i suspect youre secretly very pleased with the fact youve been invited back to crete i always thought youd return to archaeology sooner or later if i know you you couldnt stay away forever was she right even now he didnt know one things for sure cretes a world apart that was an understatement as he glanced back at the road it was now blocked entirely by a herd of sheep their shaggy brown fleeces suspended above dark spindly legs around them the silence of the cretan countryside was rent by bleats and the jangle of bells the flock milled and darted about their rented saab but failed to move on down the road why bother the shepherd in dark hat and coat lounged sidesaddle on his burro oblivious while his blackshawled wife trudged in his dusty wake bringing up the rear strangers came gazed upon the wonders of his land then departed he possessor of donkey sheep and wife would remain and prevail his weathered face contained all the worthwhile knowledge in the world the parched hills and verdant valleys of crete belonged to him alone now and forever okay he went on youre here im here now how about telling me whats going on thats just it i dont know for sure everybody at nsa claims im starting to see things she paused to examine a long red fingernail so dont you say it too i need some moral support maybe id better hear this first michael i i dont want to talk about it yet its just well give me a hint at least a few days back i decoded part of a transmission she leaned over and started to turn on the radio then changed her mind and straightened look i just need you to help me get my thoughts organized is that why you came all the way here to organize your thoughts youll forgive me if id hoped for a little more in spite of himself he felt mildly annoyed the truth was hed been looking forward to a reunion that wasnt about business you know i sort of had the idea you wanted to well maybe try and piece things back together he looked her over being with you wasnt exactly the worst experience of my life she sighed wistfully and smoothed back her hair fixing humpty dumpty is tough work darling we both know that its been a long time lifes never that simple maybe not for you but it seems very simple to me we just lose the past pretend it never existed he felt his pique growing or then again screw it what are we doing here anyway could it really work a second time around he asked himself why not through all those years after things fell apart hed never once stopped remembering her her mind her body her excitement those memories dogged him now as they drove down the road he knew so well had traveled so many times in his longago life at times the ancient palace here on crete had seemed almost a second home after the publication of his book about it realm of the spiritto universal denunciationshe even began to dream about it he thought hed never come back and now here he was with eva life took strange turns sometimes eleven years ago in new haven when hed decided to work for himself hed actually been saying goodbye to this world and all it stood for back then it had seemed a golden moment to give academia the bird had it all come full circle now fortunately hed kept up with the journals when he had the chance tried to stay on top of what was happening with any luck hed have the pleasure of watching a lot of academics eat crow all he had to do was just deal with whatever was bugging eva and then get on down to phaistos he hoped the stuttgart crew wouldnt realize he was over a decade out of date you know she was searching in her purse then stopped herself and looked up i always remember the palace when i think of you it sort of tied us together best i remember its what finally drove us apart it turned into our irreconcilable difference maybe youre right and it was dumb of me given the lousy luck ive had with men youre probably the best thing that ever came along after that flap over your book i let you get away hold on a second you announced you had to live your own life and i was getting too emotionally involved in my work and it would be better all around if we just shook hands and called it quits no hard feelings it wasnt quite like that she laughed her alluring laugh the one he remembered so well oh no okay maybe it was a little like that out came the sunglasses the old eva again but i was changing michael more every day it was time to try and make it on my own that was definitely what shed decided to do hed always thought she broke things off because she was obsessed with finishing her own phd selfcentered and selfindulgent thats what hed called her at the time just another pampered russian blue blood only years later did he realize how selfcentered hed been maybe shed been right maybe they werent ready for each other yet she sighed and then her voice came as a whisper you know after you called this morning and told me about that nightmare with alex i just drank some retsina and went back to bed she put on the shades adjusted them and looked his way he thought they went well with her new forties hairstyle michael i know things i shouldnt and the things i should know i dont the worse part of all is none of it makes any sense her eyes seemed to soften behind the tinted plastic do you remember the first time you and i talked about this place like it was yesterday who could forget it was just after realm was published relating his theory that the palace whatever it may have been originally had eventually become a ceremonial necropolis an abode of the dead we ended up having a terrific argument over the book nobody wanted to believe me including you come on darling it wasnt my opinion you cared about it was your fathers the revered holder of penns edelstein chair of classical antiquities supposedly the worlds living expert on minoan crete did he really care what the old man thought he wondered not in the way she meant he would have liked it though if everybody had gotten along a little better michael vance sr never quite knew what to make of evas slavic intensity since it contrasted so vividly with his own uptight anglosaxon instincts that was a repressive family strain mike had foughtsuccessfully he hopedto undo all his life eva had looked to be the perfect soul mate in that battle she was born unrepressed her own father count serge borodin was president emeritus of the russian nobility association in america exiled aristocracy they were a people apart he recalled in particular a russian orthodox wedding theyd all attended once the operative assumption that sunny afternoon in oyster bay was that the czar had been a living god the romanovs the worlds last surviving cherubim he still remembered the blackhatted orthodox prelates and the incense and the tinny balalaikas and all the counts and countesses drunk and dancing and crying at the same time growing up in the middle of that she had to be exuberant youd gone off on your own and set the world of archaeology on its ear she continued typical michael but your father refused to stick up for you when all the shit came down i guess i didnt support you very well either i admit now im truly sorry darling looking back no big deal i could handle it sure she reached over and patted his thigh you handled it just great you were disgusted at me at him at all the stuffedshirt academics who never went out on a dig and got their hands dirty you practically dragged me here to show me you were right you were obsessed with the palace admit it it wasnt that bad he looked over at her was it lets not talk about it anymore all right she sighed christ fine with me he was pulling off the main road heading into the flowerlined trail the arcade of magenta bougainvillea that led down toward the palace by the way i brought along some ouzo he indicated a pint bottle in his coat whats a picnic without a little rocket fuel you think of everything i also think we should park up here dodge the tourbus mayhem keep the funny hats and loudspeakers to a minimum yes please besides i could use the air she inhaled deeply around them the few lingering white sprays of almond blossoms seemed like remnants of late spring snow while the ground itself was blanketed with wild orchids lavender and pink anemones white narcissus he watched as she climbed out of the car then stopped to pluck a waxy yellow prickly pear flower next an orangeblue iris cretica he loved the flowers of crete and the afternoon was fragrant with the scent of jasmine and lemon blossoms ahead down the hill was the parking lot for the palace with two tour busses in attendance one just pulling out how long has it been since we were last here together she brushed her dark bangs back from her brow as she squinted into the waning sun sniffing at her cactus flower its beginning to seem like forever but i think its aboutwhatalmost twelve years now and how old is the palace supposed to be ive gotten a little rusty the latest theory going is that it was destroyed about fourteen hundred bc so were talking roughly three and a half thousand years since it was last used guess our little decade doesnt count for much in the grand scheme time flies he remembered how shed been back then that day so long ago when she had been in her midtwenties as inviting as the brazen ladiesinwaiting of the palace frescoes and even more voluptuous mais ce sont des parisiennes a dazzled french scholar had marveled she was like that perfect sensuality for a while hed forgotten all about archaeology and just concentrated on beauty the place where all this occurred was the palace of knossos lovingly restored in the early part of the twentieth century by the wealthy english archaeologist sir arthur evans there an almost modern civilization had flowered to magnificent heights then mysteriously vanished the path leading to the palace down the hill was becoming wider as they walked opening on the distant olive groves in the valley the vista was stunning probably the reason it had been built here he looked over and noticed she was digging in her purse again this time she drew out a pack of dunhills he watched while she flicked a gold lighter the one hed given her as a present so long ago emblazoned with a lapis lazuli skull and crossbones at the time the hint had worked shed quit the return of the death wish when did you start that again last week she defiantly took a puff any particular reason no darling i just did it she exhaled im wound up im im scared michael for godsake how many reasons am i supposed to need hey lighten up hed quit a month after they met but it hadnt been a big deal ive mellowed out from the old days life is like most other thingsa lot more fun when you dont take it too seriously they were moving across the empty parking lot headed for the entrance to the palace it had once been a twelvehundredroom labyrinth perhaps deliberately confusing now the upper courtyard and chambers lay exposed to the sky their massive redandocher columns glistening in the waning sunlight the columns tapered downward as though tree trunks had been planted upside down to prevent resprouting it was a poetic place to meet eva again he thought and thoroughly bizarre as well shed gotten her phd in linguistics specializing in ancient aegean languages then a few months later shed surprised everybody by accepting a slot at the national security agency that sprawling electronic beehive of eavesdropping that lies midway between washington and baltimore on the thousand acres of fort meade itd seemed a startling aboutface at the time but maybe it made sense besides it was that or teaching nsa was a midsized city producing among other things forty tons of classified paper trash a day its official insignia appropriately was a fierce eagle clasping a keywhether to unlock the secrets of others or to protect its own was unclear evas particular branch sigintfor signals intelligencewas an operation so secret nsa refused even to admit it existed employing ten acres of mainframe computers evas sigint group monitored and analyzed every russian transmission anywhere their satellite downlinks the microwave telephone networks within the soviet union the chatter of civilian and military pilots missile telemetry far above the pacific the splitsecond bursts of submarines reporting to base even the limousine radiophone trysts between politburo members and their mistresses the instant an electromagnetic pulse left the earth no matter its form or frequency it belonged to the giant electronic ears of the nsa so why shouldnt eva end up as the agencys top russian codebreaker she was a master at deciphering obscure texts and shed spoken russian all her life who better to make a career of cracking secret soviet communications her linguistics phd was being used to real purpose i want you to help me think some love she went on i know it may sound a little bizarre but id like to talk about some of the legends surrounding this place you know try and sort out fact and fiction now they were headed side by side down the stairway leading into the central court an expanse of sandstone and alabaster tile glinting golden in the pale sun on their left a flight of stairs seemed to lead out but in fact they led right back in again the deceptions of the palace began at the very entrance the truth is about all we have is stories though sometimes stories can be more true than socalled history the standard version is that this area was where the athletes performed ritual somersaults over the sacred bulls the restored frescoes around them showed corridors crowded with lithe minoan priestesses eyes rounded with green malachite faces powdered white lips a blood red they all were barebreasted wearing only diaphanous chemises while their jewels glistened in the sunshine as they fanned themselves with ostrich plumes there were no frescoes however of the powerful bloodthirsty king minos michael she called out her voice echoing off the hard walls you know this place has always felt a little sinister to me none of the lightness and gaiety in those frescoes seems real thats part of what made me start wondering if the minoans hadnt somehow managed to make a monkey out of every ponderous scholar on the planet they were moving down the monumental grand staircase three restored flights of which had originally been five toward the rooms called the royal chambers maybe the reason this place had no walls or fortifications was because you only came here when you were dead who the hell knows whatever the truth was the eerie feeling of the palace seemed to make the ancient stories even more vivid the legends told that king minoss wife pasiphae had a burning passion for one of the sacred white bulls he kept so she arranged for his chief architect daedalus to design a hollow wooden cow for her covered over with a hide she concealed herself inside and as luck would have it lured one of the beasts the progeny of that union was equally beastlythe minotaur a monster with a human body and a bulls head now they were rounding a final corner in the twisting maze of stairs directly ahead was the boudoir of the queen the past welled up for him the frescoes over the alabaster arches showed bold blue dolphins pirouetting in a pastel sea dotted with starfish and sea urchins and just beneath them stood the famous bathroom of the queen connected to the vast drainage complex of the palace great stone channels curved in precise parabolas to control and dampen turbulence daedalus was an engineerarchitect who had mastered the science of fluid dynamics thousands of years before the invention of wind tunnels and supercomputers my favorite spot the bedroom he slipped the small bottle of ouzo from his trench coat pocket in the dank of the palaces lower depths he needed its warmth ive had unspeakably erotic thoughts about this placenow it can be toldwith you no small part of them he handed her the bottle want a hit of high octane glad to know ive had a place in your memory all these years even if it was xrated she took the bottle with a knowing smile then drank its like licorice he laughed blended with jp michael she continued looking around maybe this is the very room where pasiphae gave birth to the minotaur what do you suppose that would fit the story he moved on his eyes still adjusting to the shadows the only thing the legends actually say is that king minos ordered daedalus resident genius to create a secret labyrinth in the cellar of the palace to keep the beast but nobodys ever located it you know i think the labyrinth was no myth it was real only it was here all around us were in it now she handed back the bottle it was this whole sinister palace this realm of the dead after all these years i finally think maybe you were right vindicated at last had even eva come around but why didnt he feel any satisfaction instead he found himself aware of the old chill the almost occult intuition that had first told him the palace wasnt the happy playground everybody supposed it was once more it felt like death but now something else was entering his senses was it imagination in the encroaching dark the lower levels of the palace seemed to be totally deserted with only a couple of persistent german tourists arguing out near the parking lot and yet they werent alone he could feel it he knew it was it the spirits of the dead no it was far more real someone was with them somewhere in the shadows they were being watched he looked at eva trying to make out her eyes in the semidarkness did she sense it too that somebody was nearby waiting maybe listening darling lets talk some more about the myth of daedalus in the version i remember he not much more to the tale after a while a greek prince called theseus arrived to brave the labyrinth and do battle with the maneating minotaur when he showed up king minoss beautiful daughter ariadne instantly fell in love with him naturally i love myths theyre always so realistic well he dumped her later so i guess he did turn out to be a creep but anyway she persuaded daedalus to give him a ball of string he attached it to the door of the labyrinth and unwound it as he went in after he killed the beast he followed the twine back out and escaped with ariadne unfortunately when minos discovered what had happened he was so mad he locked the great chief architect in a tower but daedalus managed to get out hoping to escape from the island however it wasnt going to be easy since minos had clamped down on all the harbors having the ships searched thats when daedalus declared minos may control the land and the sea but he doesnt control the regions above and he constructed some wings attached them to his shoulders with wax and soared away into space first human ever up till then only the gods could just leave the earth anytime they wanted what shed stopped dead still daedalus you remember the first person to fly mankinds agoold dream in fact a few years back some americans duplicated the feat with a humanpowered glider they made it from here on crete over to the island of no you said space did i he smiled call it poetic license but why not back in those days i guess the skies themselves could be considered outer space if they even knew such a thing existed then he looked at her and sobered whats itsits just something thats been in the back of my mind she moved on with a shrug he took another drink of the ouzo and followed her on down the hall toward the famous throne room he was bracing himself now for what was next its walls were decorated with frescoes of the massive minoan body shields shaped as a figureeight that signified the mens quarters of knossos and incised in stone above king minoss wide alabaster throne was his fearsome emblem of authority symbol of his domination of the ancient world there it was he looked around reassuring himself that it was everywhere just as hed remembered hed also been right about something else it was precisely the same right down to the smooth curves of the blade as the watermark that had been on the sheet of paper alex had given him almost four thousand years old it was the insignia of the new daedalus corporation the minoan double ax wednesday pm the dusk was settling majestically over tokyo after a rare smogless day the view was particularly inspiring from the fiftyfifthfloor penthouse of the graniteclad mino industries building the corner office was an earthtone tan carpeted in a thick wool shag the color of elm bark the heavy doors at the far end of the office were emblazoned with a twobladed ax and in the center of the wide expanse between the door and the single desk on a gleaming steel pedestal stood a meterlong model of an airplane more advanced than any the world had yet seen the temperature of the room was kept at a constant degrees fahrenheit a frigid comfortaccommodation for the tawny eightfoot snow leopard named neko now resting on a pallet beside the window gazing down remnant of an endangered species shed been rescued as a starving motherless cub during an expedition in the himalayas and raised for the past six years as a pampered pet of the penthouses owner along the soundproof walls were giltframed photographs of a japanese executive jogging with jimmy carter in tokyo golfing with ferdinand marcos in manila receiving an accolade from linus pauling in san francisco dining with henry kissinger in paris he was the same man now sitting behind the massive slate desk you believe he was an american tanzan mino president and ceo of the daedalus corporation a paper creation of the mino industries group adjusted his pale silk tie and examined the subordinate now standing before him he had just turned seventythree but the energy in his youthful frame made him seem at least a decade younger perhaps two hai minosama the other man in a dark suit bowed we have reason to believe the russian has they were seen exchanging an envelope and your people failed to intercept either of them the man bowed again more deeply an attempt was made but unfortunately the soviet escaped and the american my people were unsure what action to take we do know the funds have not been deposited as scheduled tanzan mino sighed and brushed at his silver temples his dark eyes seemed to penetrate whatever they settled upon and the uncomfortable vicepresident now standing in front of him was receiving their full ire back in the old days when he directed the minogumi clans operations at street level finger joints were severed for this kind of incompetence but now now the organization had modernized he operated in a world beholden to computers and financial printouts it was a new age one he secretly loathed hed been worried from the start that difficulties might arise the idiocy of japans modern financial regulations had driven him to launder the payoffs thoroughly in the old days when he was washingtons man controlling the liberal democratic party no meddling tax agency would have dared audit any of his shadow companies but after a bastard maverick named vancewith the cia no less had blown the whistle on his and the companys clandestine understanding he had arranged the initial financing for the project as well as the political accommodations with letters of credit promissory notes and his word and eventually if need be the full financing could be raised by partial liquidation of his massive real estate holdings in hawaii but the nearterm expensesand the necessary payoffs in the ldpthat was different in japanese kosaihi the money politics of gifts and outright bribes secrecy was everything he remembered how hed had to arrange for the mighty yoshio kodama a powerbroker who had once shared his virtual ownership of the japanese diet and the japanese press to accept responsibility for the cialockheed bribe affair it was a close call that had involved a mere twelve million of american cash to japanese politicians but it had changed the rules forever these days particularly after the recruit debacle had disgraced the ldp yet againmoney had to be laundered and totally untraceable promises had been made schedules signed off the veil of total secrecy kept intact everything was arranged the soviets incompetents that they were had no inkling of the larger plan now it all came down to the funds he needed the money at once he turned in his chair pressed a gray button on his desk and watched the window blinds disappear into their frame neko rose from her languorous pose stretched her spotted white fur and gazed down this was the panoramic view she loved almost as much as he did for her perhaps it was the memory of a snowy himalayan crest for him it was the sprawl of tokyo the elegant peak of mount fuji to the west the bustling port of yokohama to the south from this vantage atop the powerful financial world of japan tanzan mino wanted two final triumphs to crown his career he wanted to see japan become the twentyfirst centurys leader in space and he wanted his country finally to realize its historic wartime objective economic domination of the continent of asia from siberia to malaysia with freedom forever from the specter of energy and resource dependence the plan now in motion would achieve both he revolved again in his chair ignored the subordinate standing before his desk and studied the model it was a perfect replica onehundredth the actual size of the spaceplane that would revolutionize the future the symbol that would soon signify his countrys transcendence in the hightech age to come then his gaze shifted you were unsure what action to take he leaned back touching his fingertips together and sadness entered his voice you know there was a time when i thought japan might still one day recapture the spirit we have lost the spirit of bushido in centuries gone by a samurai never had to ask himself what action to take he acted intuitively instinctively do you understand hai wakarimasu the man bowed stiffly i am prepared to funnel trillions of yen into this project before it is over legitimate clean funds so the sum now in question is almost inconsequential however it is the bait we need to set the trap and it must be handled exactly as i have specified hai minosama again he bowed the next time you stand before me i want to hear that the laundered soviet funds have been deposited in the shokin gaigoku bank as agreed you have one week he slowly turned back to the window now must i tell you what you have to do the man bowed low one last time he knew exactly chapter three wednesday pm michael and eva again after so long pos iste what a surprise the old greeks sunburned face widened into a smile his gray mustache opening above his last good teeth parakalo you must come in for a glass of raki and some of adrianas meze she would never forgive me theyd dropped by the hotel then come here although zenos small taverna was in the center of iraklion its facade was still country style covered with an arbor a bare electric bulb hung incongruously in the middle of the porch penetrating the dull glow of dusk now settling over the square called platia eleftherias where the evenings volta was just beginning once the chaste promenade of eligible young women it was now a deafening flock of motorscooters with girls in tight jeans riding on their backs and the watchful mothers of old were conspicuously absent times had indeed changed since his last time here zeno vance shook his hand then accepted his warm embrace as he was driving hed been wondering what the old greek would think about the sudden reappearance of eva they hadnt been here together since that last trip well over a decade ago still pouring the meanest raki in this town but of course never that tequila you like michael he chuckled with genuine pleasure recalling that vance could down his highpotency version of ouzo like a native ah you know michael your father would never touch it you though he beckoned them through the kafeneions doorway leading the way with a limp the interior was dark redolent of greek cigarettes and retsina wine overwhelming it all were the smells of the kitchenpungent olive oil and onions and garlic and herbs black pepper and oregano although lighting was minimal around the rickety wooden tables could be seen clusters of aging greeks drinking coffee and raki and gossiping the white clay walls resounded with the clacks of komboloi worry beads and tavli greek backgammon but then zeno continued that last trip your birthday present to him on his retirement do you remember when we three were sitting at that very table there in the corner he called for a bottle of my raki and shared a glass with me we both knew it was our goodbye his eyes grew misty with emotion yes coming here finally with his famous son was a kind of benediction michael he was passing the torch to you to continue his work this last was uttered with a slightly censorious tone but it quickly evaporated as he turned and bowed to eva then took her hand in a courtly gesture the old greeks in the room would have preferred no women save an obedient mate in their male sanctuary but traditional hospitality conquered all it is so good to see you two back together he smiled warmly as he glanced up welcome once again to our humble home she bowed back then complimented him in turn in flawless greek so beautiful and so accomplished he beamed you still are the treasure i remember you are a goddess he kissed her hand as ive told michael before you could well be from this island no even more you could be minoan you bear a fine resemblance to the parisiennes of the palace did he ever tell you not often enough she flashed him her sexiest smile but then he never had your eye for women ah the old man blushed i have more than an eye if i were thirty years younger you and i zeno before you drown eva in that legendary charm let me bring her up to date vance laughed she is now in the presence of the man who has probably become the richest tavern owner in all of crete it was true zeno stantopoulos had indeed become a wealthy man in many ways his father had once farmed the land on which now stood the unearthed palace at knossos the handsome sum sir arthur evans paid for the site was invested in bonds which he then passed on to zeno just before the war zeno had the foresight to convert them to gold and hide it in switzerland during the german occupation of crete after the war he used it to purchase miles and miles of impoverished olive groves in the south which he nursed back to full production these days oil went up oil went down but zeno always made a profit his real wealth however was of a different kind zeno stantopoulos knew everything of importance that happened on crete his kafeneion was the islands clearinghouse for gossip and information dont listen to him madam he winked and gestured them toward the wide table in back near the kitchen it was known far and wide as the place of honor the location where zeno stantopoulos held court it had also been the nerve center of the greek resistance during the nazi occupation when zeno had done his share of killing and dynamiting the limp however came from the fifties when he was imprisoned and tortured by the rightwing colonels for organizing popular resistance against them come let us celebrate with a glass of my raki he turned again to eva i should remind you you once called it liquid fire he clapped for adriana who squinted through the kitchen door her black shawl wrapped tightly about her shoulders when she finally recognized them she hobbled forward her stern greek eyes softening into a smile neither of you has changed eva gave her a hug you both look marvelous time my friends time that has changed zeno went on i use a cane now for long walks the way michaels father did his last time here when i saw him i thought old age must be gods vengeance on us sinners and now it has happened to me he smiled with a light wink but i will tell you a secret ask adriana i do not yet need a cane for all my exercise he nodded affectionately in her direction i can still make this beauty wake up in the mornings singing a song it was true vance suspected adriana had hinted more than once that every night with him was still a honeymoon ah michael he sighed i still miss seeing your beloved father on his summer trips here together you two inspired our soul the ancient soul of crete at that point adriana bowed and announced she must return to the kitchen where she was putting the final touches to her proprietary version of kalamarakia fried squid her peasant face hid well her peasant thoughts almost vance had known her long enough to read her dark eyes she didnt quite know what to make of evas reappearance yet speaking passable greek it was true which counted for much but she still wore no wedding band adinato michael dont let adriana stuff you zeno watched her disappear then turned to your health he clicked their small glasses together eis hygeian eis hygeian vance took a sip savoring the moment seeing old friends again real friends was one of lifes most exquisite pleasures and tell me how long will you two be visiting with us this time zenos cretan hospitality flowed unabated perhaps longer than the last have you finally decided to come back to stay maybe make us famous all over again cant speak for eva but ive been asked to look in on the new german excavation down at phaistos a project to try and restore the palace there the way evans reconstructed knossos he glanced over she was now sipping the tepid raki with the gusto she normally reserved for icecold stolichnaya tonight though were just tourists here to see you two again at that moment adriana reappeared from the kitchen bearing an enormous oak tray with a flourish she laid before them fried squid and goat cheese and stuffed grape leaves and octopus and wooden bowls of melidzanosalata her baked eggplant puree flavored with garlic onions and herbs not forgetting her speciality pink taramasalata made of mullet roe and olive oil incidentally we were just out at knossos the palace this afternoon vance took a bite of kalamarakia while she looked on approvingly ah of course the palace zeno smiled i love it still i probably should go more myself if only to remember the days of my childhood during the restoration but with all the tour buses he chewed on a sliver of octopus as he glanced out toward the music in the street perhaps it should be better cared for these days but alas we are not as rich now as king minos was he shrugged and reached for a roll of dolmadakia still we are not forgotten today perhaps we count for little in the eyes of the world but your book brought us fleeting fame once again scholars from everywhere came hoping to prove me wrong vance laughed and took another sip of raki what does it matter my friend they came he brightened even today just to show you today there was a man here right here who was carrying your famous work on the palace he even today vance glanced up had he been right yes this very day outside in the arbor he even sampled some of adrianas meze he nodded at her i did not like him and only our friends are welcome inside book or no book was he going out to knossos eva interjected suddenly staring to the palace he asked about it why else have the book he shrugged again then examined the octopus bowl searching for a plump piece you know michael i could never finish that volume of yours entirely but your pictures of the frescoes he paused to chew his octopus then smoothed his gray mustache and turned again to eva the frescoes of the women i love them best of all and every now and then i see a woman here in life who looks like them not often but i do and you are one of those rare creatures my eva i swear you are minoan he turned back look at her michael is it not true zeno eva reached for his gnarled hand its not like you to forget my people are russian remember from the steppes ah of course forgive me but you see that only goes to prove it he nodded conclusively the minoans we are told came from central asia thousands of years ago the brownhaired daughter of minos was an oriental beauty just as you are im sure of it look at the frescoes zeno tell me vance reached to pour more raki into their glasses the man you mentioned just now was he greek no he was a foreigner he chewed thoughtfully ive never seen anyone quite like him he had a strange way of speaking in truth michael i did not like him at all not a bit what exactly did he say it wasnt that it was something else i dont know and he went to the palace i saw him hire a taxi that was all but whether he went there or somewhere in the south only god could know he looked away perhaps tomorrow i could find out did this man have a beard he pressed no the thing i remember most was that part of one finger was missing curious i focused on that but his features his features were almost asian i would say he paused then turned and asked adriana to fetch another bottle of raki perhaps his accent was from that part of the world he looked back at eva i suppose you would have known my marvelous eva my minoan queen his eyes lingered on her a moment longer then he rose enough now we must all have something for dinner im sure you do not want to spend the rest of the night trapped here with a crippled old greek he disappeared into the kitchen to select the pick of the days catch and that smoky evening they dined on the islands bestbarbounia red mullet which adriana grilled with the head and served with wedges of cretan lemon afterward came a dessert of grapes and soft fresh myzithra cheese blended with dark honey from the mountains near sfakii then at the end she brought forth her own soumada a rich nectar made of pressed almonds after more raki zeno was persuaded to get out his ancient bouzouki tune it and play and sing some traditional songs the music grew faster and more heated and then with only the slightest urgingeva cleared away the tables and began to dance her russian gypsy movements seemed almost greek when they finally broke away the time was nearly midnight the volta had longsince disbanded the sky above had changed from a canopy of island stars to a spring torrent and michael vance and eva borodin were very very drunk wednesday pm you know there was something special about us in the old days vance said as they weaved down the rainwashed street toward the hotel how we used to be all we did was eat drink and talk and make love tonight its three down and one to go youre pretty smashed darling eva laughed and looked him over a girl learns to watch out for deceptive advertising he slipped his arm around her eleven years and in a way this was like it was all happening over again i never shirk from a challenge ill drink to that her voice indicated the challenge would not be overly daunting do we have any theres still that bottle of ouzo in the car she stopped dead still her hair plastered against her upturned face and ran her hands down her body minoan thats what zeno said what if its true she turned back what if i have the same hot blood as the queen who vamped a bull imagine what that would be like as best i remember you could probably handle it she performed another russian gypsy whirl in the glistening street i want to be minoan michael i want to soar through time and space leap over bulls maybe even she twirled again drunkenly then why not do it the queens bedroom he stopped and stared at the galaxy hotel ultramodern and garish now towering upward in the rain the pool was closed but the disco still blared the hell with everything im taking you back there tonight parked next to the lobby entrance was their rented saab he paused and looked in at the half bottle of ouzo lying on the seat then reached and pulled her into his arms come on and get ready is that a promise she curled around and met his lips times a wastin he kissed her again and began searching for his keys she was unsteadily examining the darkened interior of her purse i think ive got an emergency candle in here well use it for light just enough i just hope im not too wrecked to drive in the rain youd better not be i know i am who cares lets just go for it he was unlocking the car and helping her in loving the feel of her body her scent hed decided he was ready for anything and anybody including some mysterious stranger carrying his book the night was brisk with flares of spring lightning over the mountains as the saab weaved through the narrow streets leading out of town eva climbed up and drunkenly unlatched its sunroof to let in the rain by the time they reached the winding country road headlights piercing the downpour the wind was rushing around them wild and free when they pulled into the parking lot of knossos it was deserted and they easily discovered an opening in the guard fence the palace lay before them piece of cake he took her hand and helped her through the wire i propose a toast right here to the past and to the future if i drink much more of this i may not be around to see the future but ill die happy she reached for the slippery bottle as they moved through the abandoned central court eerie in the rain he could almost hear the roars of the crowd four thousand years past see the spotted bulls charging the nubile athletes a heavy gust flickered her candle adding mystery to the shadows dancing across the enigmatic women of the frescoes now i really do feel minoan she headed down the grand staircase brandishing the light then she called out her voice resounding down the maze of windy hallways i am the queen i am pasiphae wheres my white bull eva youre drunk he yelled after im intoxicated its different she laughed low in her throat im intoxicated by the palace the thought of my bull the eternal male her voice echoed more know about eternal males darling theyre like eternal females only harder she grinned at him then proceeded tracing the wide marble steps as she floated down carrying the candle the moist air was scented with jasmine alive with the music of crickets they rounded the last curving steps and the ornate vista of the queens bedroom spread before them its blue dolphins cavorting in their pastel sea he walked over and patted the alabaster portico hard as this your eternal male this is a real test for the eternal female bottom she threw herself down then reached and ran a drunken readiness check across his wet thigh im ready for something hard inside me her voice was strange detached and ethereal when did you start talking like that he loved it not even in the old days when i became minoan darling when i became the blood relation of queen pasiphae she wiggled out of her soaked brown dress and tossed it onto the floor as he watched her begin to sway before the fresco of the dolphins he had the definite feeling time was in a warp that the flow of centuries was in reverse maybe eva was none other than pasiphae reborn the room was perfumed and serene perfect for a queen then she bent down and carefully stationed her candle on the stone looking up she said let me have some more of that ouzo i love being here its shocking and wonderful no this was most assuredly the modern eva as she moved against him her body felt the way he remembered it riper now perhaps with a voluptuousness slightly more toward rubens than botticelli but the skin of her breasts her thighs was soft as ever and the dark triangle was still luxuriant redolent with her scent do it hard like a bull i want to know what she felt she drew back across the stone as he drove inside her yes while rain slammed against the courtyard above the ancient foreboding room began to engulf and rule their senses the feel of her perfumed nipples against him was hard and urgent it was an erotic moment outside of time now her head thrashed from side to side as quivering orgasms rippled through her starting in her groin and welling upward as she arched and flung back her hair then she drew up clinging as though trying to consume him herself in a rite of pure bacchanalian frenzy her breath had become labored not gasps of pleasure but the need of one seeking air eva eva he suddenly caught himself thinking youre here for release escape i know you too well youre not really in this room anymore you want to be but youre not youre somewhere in a realm of beasts and magic and the bloodthirsty minotaur but yet yet somehow hed never felt closer a final convulsion brought them together and then she fell back dazed the candlelight flickered across the alabaster sending ghostly apparitions against the fresco of the dolphins still trying to catch her breath she reached out and seized the bottle of ouzo drank from it thirstily then flung herself once more against the stone after another long moment she pulled him to her michael hold me she snuggled into his arms oh darling just hold me he drew her against him and the touch of her skin was erotic beyond anything he remembered but the palace it was intruding darkly insinuating its presence now it surrounded them like a tomb ominous as death finally he turned her face up and examined her dark eyes they were flooded with fear look youve got to tell me whats going on i want to know the real reason youre here and i want to know it now id somehow begun to hope it was for us but thats part of it darling truly she kissed him deeply on the mouth then reached and began fishing in her purse for the battered pack of dunhills trying to regain her bravado god that was hot i do love being here with you youre stalling whenever you dont youre right she took out a cigarette flicked her lighter and drew a lungful of smoke now i see why pasiphae was such a number this room does something to you not bad for starters she looked down then smiled no darling youre just bluffing i remember that well enough plenty of time for a cigarette some things improve with age he studied her beautifully disheveled form now more than ever he realized she was scared goddammit enough talk to me all right she sighed then leaned back on the ledge of the portico well to begin at the beginning ive been seeing somebody lately make you a deal he interrupted you spare me your stories and ill spare you mine this doesnt really seem the moment to start swapping indiscretions ill bet youve got plenty to swap yourself she looked him over hold on a minute sure thered been women in and out of his life he wasnt a priest besides he liked women darling relax she patted his thigh were both adults you said you wanted to hear this so for godsake listen his name was jerry ackerman and it started back about nine months ago since he was new hed drop by my office now and then you know to learn the ropes what kind of ropes exactly really michael anyway he wasnt exactly world class in the boudoir if that makes you feel any better though needless to say i never told him that our little scene tonight would have blown his brooklyn mind now does that preserve your precious male ego he was just nice and interesting was ill get to that she was tracing small circles on the alabaster week before last he dropped off a computer disk at my office said he couldnt figure it out and it was old maybe two weeks which was unusual especially for satellite intercepts which this was normally we get them the same day so i ran it through my desk station figuring it couldnt be that big a deal she paused nervously then went on well the first part was encoded using one of the standard soviet encryption systems weve had cracked for years and it had a lot of proper names but the rest of it was just a string of numbers no matter what i tried i got nothing but garbage really i thought fort meades football field of cray supercomputers could crack anything i thought so too but this encryption was either so clever or so simple nothing seemed to click i couldnt do it i even began to wonder maybe its not a cipher at all maybe its just some obscure foreign language so i matrixed it against some we have in the data base and love weve got them a zillion megabytes of memory serbocroatian urdu basque she drew on her cigarette sending a glow into the dark above them the rain continued to pound but i still couldnt find anything that would crack it doesnt sound like you he drew her around and kissed her half the time youre too smart for your own good apparently not smart enough she hugged him back automatically then continued when i told jerry i couldnt break the encryption he suddenly got very nervous said okay then hed just take it and try again himself so i asked him to sign it out on my log just routine and thats when he started acting strange at first he refused but finally he did it when i said its like this sweet buns no tickee no washee by then hed stopped coming over to my place and things had gotten a little strained at the edges to put it mildly so i didnt think too much about it at the time dont start telling me more about michael that was the last time anybody saw him he just vanished that night there was even something in the paper mysterious disappearance the apartment where he lived had been dismantled top to bottom somebody must have thought he was holding out and well it just so happened i still had it in computer memory though thats a blatant violation of security procedures anyway the next day i called control and said whats with a certain file gave them the nscid number and they said we have no record of that number quote theyd never heard of it so it must have been a freelance job for somebody outside whoever it was must have paid jerry or maybe blackmailed him into getting me to take a crack at it which is why it was two weeks old it wasnt nsa material at all somebody else wanted it and im known far and wide as ms giveherthetoughones you always were the best right she laughed then reached into her purse and retrieved a three and a half inch gray computer disk and here it is a complete copy ive also got it stored on the eightymeg hard drive of my zenith turbo laptop back at the hotel she tossed it to him jerrys file thats the good news the bad news is its still encrypted he turned it in his fingers welcome to the new age he thought when thousands of pages can be packed onto a highdensity disk the size of a casette tape she took out a compact from her purse and powdered her nose in the light of the candle then turned and searched the stone for her crumpled dress he thought he heard a sound from the hallway outside but then decided it was just more thunder so now what she finally found the dress and drew it loosely on managing not to secure the bustline ive tried and tried to crack it but nothing seems to click after the preamble theres nothing on there but a long string of numbers whatever it is its not any of the standard encryption systems she reached to take it back why am i telling you all this because weve agreed no more games darling therere actually two reasons why i shouldnt one is i hate to drag you into it and the other well theres more im waiting whatevers on here is part of something bigger i know that because of the preamble the section i can read she pushed ahead nervousness in her voice anyway thats when i decided i had to talk to you about some of the things you used to work on he inhaled what are you talking about there were some proper names i dont get in the preamble one was daedalus and another was mino so i thought why not talk to michael it sounded like something that youd i dont know maybe you could help me think anyway i finally decided to take a chance and ring you great nice to finally learn exactly where i fit in he lay silent for a moment trying to suppress his annoyance finally he told himself be constructive all right tell me what you think its all about well she paused again as though unsure finally she spoke her voice faint above the rain did you know the soviet union and japan never actually signed a peace treaty after world war two its because the soviets kept some japanese islands right seem to recall they were the kuriles and also the southern half of sakhalin japan calls those the northern territories and theyve refused to sign because of them she reached over and adjusted the candle surveying the dark around them the gloom was almost stygian well hang on to your diplomatic pouch because i think theyre about to sign maybe as the first step toward im still not sure what he caught his breath how did you find out about this intelligence ive been handling our intercepts but we still havent put together a briefing package for the president and state it just seems so implausible nobody wants to be the one to sign off on it besides nothings settled among other things the japanese diet would eventually have to vote to approve it and nothings come through diplomatic channels its being closely handled by somebody big and anonymous over there anyway my hunch is a vote in the diet would be a squeaker your average japanese man on the street still isnt too enthusiastic about the soviets he leaned back to think given todays global realities a deal like that had to be the tip of some gigantic iceberg in diplomacy there was always give and take and you believe whatevers on this disk is somehow connected to the treaty thats precisely what i believe she sighed the treaty has a secret protocol involved its hinted at in the intercepts but never described and ive got a feeling somehow that this is it doesnt sound like something that would delight washington he pondered on the other hand what could the us do anyway the american military is a hell of a lot more worried about losing its bases in japan not to mention nsas soviet and chinese listening posts than the japanese are about giving up our socalled protection theres not a damned thing the us could do about it id guess whoevers behind this fully realizes that she paused letting a roll of thunder from above die away but the protocol nobody has any idea whats in it not even the kgb i also know that from our intercepts this is getting more interesting by the minute well stay tuned theres more still as it happens im also on nsas oversight panel the coordinating committee we assemble briefing packages that bring together reports from all the departments including photoint photo intelligence from satellite surveillance the spy in the sky recon big bird kh radar imaging well we review all of that sure but think about it the soviets have surveillance satellites too and ps their cosmos series can now relay down digital imagery in real time she paused its classified but put two and two together if nsa intercepts soviet voice and data communications stealing pictures from their spy satellites he knew about it why not alls fair in love and war i think the saying goes okay just pretend you dreamed it up she sighed now from here on it gets a little offthewall so offthewall everybody at nsa refuses to take it seriously the committee keeps wanting to study everything but i think times running out somethings going to happen any day now but something bad he tried to make out her eyes in the dark wondering what she was still holding back michael i shouldnt she reached over and took another cigarette out of her purse anyway the reason i wanted you here was to help me find some answers before somebody decides to try and make me disappear too like jerry she flicked at her lighter three times before it finally flared maybe he thought she had good reason to be afraid he remembered the odd sense that afternoon that they were being watched and then zeno mentioning a stranger carrying his book it was beginning to seem less and less like a coincidence but jesus she went on now theyve found me and ive drawn you into it im really just relax mainly now he wanted to calm her down nobodys found dont you see alex just happens to call you this morning as you were on your way here to see me dont flatter yourself that call was about me which means he knows ive got her hand quavered as she dropped the lighter back into her purse theres already been one murder hey slow down take it easy novostys never scared me even when hes tried just its not him im worried about michael if even a tdirectorate sleaze like alex knows then who else the darkened room fell silent youd better tell me all of it everything again he paused thinking he heard a sound from somewhere in the dark but it was impossible nobody could have followed them here all right she let the words tumble out finally yes we intercept all the soviet satellite photos just the way you thought she exhaled then rose and paced the room a moment its walls now ghostly in the candlelight well lately for some strange reason their soyuz series always seems to have a temporary malfunction whenever they pass over one certain spot on the globe almost as though somebody were turning off their kfa highresolution cameras i kept noticing it but nobody else in photoint thought it was anything but a coincidence still it got me wondering what if somebody over there is pulling a number on the kgb or the gru keeping them from seeing something so i had some of our own photos of that grid sent over from the new kh where was it well it wasnt necessarily where youd think it was the japanese island of hokkaido and the highresolution grid missing was just the northern tip so i went back and checked a series of kh recon photos taken over the last two years theres something new there now michael just this last year or so its been partly camouflaged but i think its a new runway or launch facility or something and the radar maps show some funny surface irregularities at least i think they do nobody else at nsa she looked away but put it together maybe thats part of the treaty somehow their secret protocol some joint a launch facility eva thats impossible the japanese space program is all down on tanegeshima island south of tokyo the island of hokkaido is way up north theres nothing up there but holsteins and hay fields but he thought suddenly its also just across from sakhalin the soviet far east the place the party secretary who embezzled this isnt hay fields darling believe me her voice seemed to drift out and blend with the rain something you said this afternoon thats what made it click about the first man to leave the earth and soar into space you mean i didnt ask for this oh christ how did i she paused again uncertain you know i finally think ive figured out whats happening why its so secretthe treaty the protocol cutting out their own intelligence its partly about space all right has to be somethings cooking something theyre eventually going to spring on the world like the first sputnik you still havent decoded the damned thing okay im guessing but hows this somebody at the top in the ussr has decided to go for a giant gamble to save their system theyve been forced to turn to some nutcakes in japan who can loan them billions and this project is part of it the soviets once cut a deal with nazi germany to buy time so why not the leadership needs time now desperately and you think project daedalus thats the code name in the preamble think about it you know what i believe to get the money and technology they desperately need the russians have had to cave in and do the unthinkable form a new alliance michael theyre about to start rearming japan chapter four thursday am hai so deshoo taro ikeda project director bowed into the red telephone receiver using that breathy clipped speech all japanese reserve for their superiors kore wa honto ni muzakashi desu it has been difficult but they have finally agreed on the revised schedule in nine days he paused to listen then continued hai so there is no other way hai the diet will never approve the treaty unless there is some dramatic symbol of the advantages of the alliance he halted hai security has been maintained here with deepest respect the problem would seem to be with your he paused again now tiny beads of sweat were glistening on his brow hai we are ready the vehicle is hai he bowed again of course there will be no delay the revised schedule is firm hai minosama we he was bowing ever more rapidly into the phone hai we have pushed them as hard as we can he bowed even deeper hai by tomorrows report of course minosama thank you domo arigato gozaimashita the line a highsecurity satellite link connecting the hokkaido facility to the mino industries building in the ueno section of tokyo had gone dead tanzan mino ceo of mino industries group had other matters to concern himself with taro ikeda repressed a tremble the technical part the project here on hokkaido was going well what was happening on the tokyo end first the delay of the funds and now a rumored breach of security kgb had intercepted the protocol that was the word from his informant close to the ceo in tokyo shigata ga nai he thought sometimes things cant be helped taro ikeda was proud he had been personally selected by the ceo to be project director for the top secret hokkaido operation he was fiftyfour years of age a graduate of tokyo university law school a twentyfiveyear veteran now retired of miti the ministry of international trade and industry he was in short a mover in the new japan and he looked itelegantly graying temples tailored silk suits a small mustache to set off his high cheeks at one time he had been the inside choice for miti vice minister before the ceo offered him a chance to fulfill a vision no official source in the ministry could ever admit existed overall he told himself the ceo should be pleased he had carried out his own responsibilities flawlessly and mitl was providing an unofficial umbrella of technical support covering any unexpected requirements through this project the ceo had set into motion a plan that would soon alter dramatically japans place in the equation of world power bushido the way of the warrior the element of surprise no one outside mino industries knew what was really planned not even the prime contractors for the project security every step of the way and now the drama was ready the curtain poised only a few more days and a technological miracle would soar upward from the earth symbolizing the first step in the realization of japans ageold ambition the world would know the twentyfirst century had arrived the japanese century mino industries had made it possible the ceos sense of timing was impeccable only last week he had approved taro ikedas final briefing to noburu takahashi executive director of the national space development agency nasda through contracts to the space systems division of mitsubishi heavy industries was in charge of the major hardware of the japanese rocket program takahashi was also an executive of the new daedalus corporation an unofficial consultant together they had traveled to the agencys space center on tanegeshima the island six hundred miles south of tokyo to monitor the shakedown launch of japans new h rocket series although that vehicle was far superior to both the american titan d and the european ariane it was a technological dinosaur compared to this project this was unlike anything the world had ever seen the project had begun over two years earlier when he was still director of mitis kokuki bukika the aircraft and ordnance section an anonymous scenarioconceived by the ceo of mino industries group tanzan minohad arrived on his desk detailing a revolutionary proposal every director in miti had received a copy the eventual consensus it was too visionary would aggravate japans already delicate relationship with america the liberal democratic party could never be seen to embrace such a project publicly accordingly mitis parliamentary vice minister turned it down officially but that was merely tatame his public face afterward the classified moves the real moves began perhaps it was hinted if the idea were explored outside regular government channels topsecret feelers were sent to the soviets with a green light tanzan mino had immediately created the daedalus corporation hiring away taro ikeda and fortyseven of his miti aerospace engineers the best and brightest from kokuki bukika startup financing had been provided by the ceo personally with some matching contributions by the top executives of japans major zaibatsu industrial groups the scenario was an easy sell since they all realized its payoff would be staggering the only requirement was that it remain top secret until the appropriate moment when the diet would be formally notified by that time however there would be no turning back everything would have to go forward as a package under the ceos direction taro ikeda and his forty seven miti engineers had relocated here on hokkaido to oversee a secret fasttrack project fortyseven perhaps he sometimes mused that number was no coincidence perhaps it was an unconscious act of historical resonance fortyseven brilliant young technicians just like the fortyseven ronin the samurai of the famous legend those ronin had bided their time for many years living in obscurity and ignominy until the moment when they rose up in triumph bushido you must always make your opponent do battle on your own terms and today money and technology were japans most powerful weapons why not use them strategically the ceo had argued the time had come to engage other unsuspecting nations with concentrated strength in a forcible move to achieve japans longterm objectives the way of the warrior taro ikeda surveyed his office his personal command center the space was appointed like the headquarters of a field marshall a deep metallic gray with video screens along one wall permitting him continuously to monitor activities in every sector of the facility and across the top of his black slate desk was marshalled a line of gray telephones with scramblers each a secure direct line to the offices of one of the projects prime contractors the first was to nagoya to the head office of mitsubishi heavy industries theirs was the initial contract let by the ceo after the project financing was in place indeed mitsubishis nagoya aircraft works was the ideal choice to manufacture the airbreathing turboramjetsscramjets for the vehicle that conglomerate had produced over fifty thousand aircraft engines during the great pacific war and more recently their new komaki north plant was responsible for the powerful oxygenhydrogen engines that composed the first stage of the giant h booster the phone on his desk connected him directly to the office of yoshio matsunami mitsubishis general manager for space systems the massive scramjets for this project had been manufactured in nagoya under a veil of total secrecy then statictested at their aeropropulsion test facility and individually shipped here to hokkaido in unmarked railcars another line connected him to the head office of nissans aeronautical and space division in tokyo already in charge of all solid rocket boosters for the japan institute of space and aeronautical science the ceo had hired their senior propulsion engineers to resolve problems connected with airbreathing combustion of liquid hydrogen the third connection was to hitachi city sixty miles from tokyo hitachi limited manufactured the booster cases for the new h vehicle and their extensive experience with composite alloys at hightemperatures made them the obvious choice to create the hypersonic airframe there were other lines as well the vehicles inertial guidance system and flight controlsboth based on advanced soviet designshad been produced at japans national aerospace laboratory preliminary windtunnel tests had been assigned to the kakuda propulsion center whose rocketengine development facilities were already being used to support nasdas program in oxygenhydrogen thruster r ampd the last highsecurity line connected him directly to tsukuba space center at tsukuba science city forty miles from tokyo the nerve center for all japanese manned spaceflight research their cleanrooms and deepspace tracking facilities were comparable to any in the world and their fujitsu sx supercomputerwhich with processors for parallel processing performed nine billion calculations per secondcould provide realtime simulation of a complete hypersonic flight profile feeling impatient now to begin the day taro ikeda settled back and reached for the phones each contractor would give him a quick morning update and then he would outline any further component tests or retrofitting as required in truth these exchanges had long since become scarcely more than rituals since the project was all but completed the major components had already been designed delivered and assembled the contractors had been paid the reports and evidence of their participation declared top secret and locked away from any possible prying eyes all traces of the project had been safely secured there was he reminded himself only one major problem remaining as part of the initial scenario the soviets had agreed to provide a laundered payment of one hundred million american dollars to be used for tanzan minos incidental expenses in the liberal democratic party hierarchy to avoid another recruitbribe fiasco like the one that brought down the prime minister in the money had to be scrupulously clean and totally untraceable but the funds had not arrived how the soviets had secured the hard currency required outside of regular government channels he could not imagine there were even reports the money had been secretly embezzled from certain slipshod ministries that it was in fact hot money but if those funds didnt come through within eight days fully laundered the project would have to be put on hold as a matter of strategy and precaution the treaty could not be placed before the diet unless passage was assured promises had to be kept what had happened to the money whatever it was he thought with a worried sigh the ceo had better solve it and soon if he didnt the whole project might have to be put on hold until next years session of the diet and their secrecy would probably be impossible to maintain for another whole year a disaster he had just completed the last call when he noticed a flashing alert on the main computer terminal advising him that the mornings hypersonic test in number one was scheduled to begin at hours he grunted and typed in an acknowledgment in his view it was a waste of time overkill the sxs simulation had already taken them further than they needed to go but all right humor the soviet team it would only require a morning his contractor briefings now out of the way he transferred all communication channels to the computer modems that lined the walls then rose and walked back to the small alcove at the rear of his office he paused a moment to calm his thoughts then slid aside the shoji screens to reveal what was for him the most important room in the facility here in the north quadrant the ceo had constructed a traditional teahouse tatamifloored with walls and ceiling of soft fresh cedar and pine in this refuge taro ikeda performed an essential morning ritual the brief meditation that quieted his spirit he knew well the famous adage of swordsmanship that the true master lives with his mind in a natural state the challenge ahead would require all the discipline of a samurai warrior the way of zen and the first rule the very first was your mind must be empty natural unattached in order to succeed as he seated himself on the reed surface of the tatami zazenstyle he methodically began clearing his mind the moment was sacred but then drifting through unasked came an admonition of the great chinese military strategist sun tzu intelligence is everything you must know your opponents plan even before he knows it himself it was true the security for this project had been airtight except for one minor breach someone in the tokyo office had stupidly transmitted the final protocol over an unsecured satellite channel it had been intercepted by soviet intelligence fortunately the russian blunderers had been unable to decipher the encryption but someoneeither in the kgb or the gruhad been so desperate he had secretly enlisted the assistance of the us national security agencys top cryptographer it was a brilliant move because nsas supercomputers might eventually be able to break the code when tanzan mino learned of the breach he had given orders that the nsa expert be neutralized quickly and the protocol retrieved if it became public knowledge prematurely the entire scenario could be destroyed now happily the nsa individual had been identified the rest would be easy an unfortunate price to pay but a simple solution with that thought to comfort him he gazed at the polished natural woods of the teahouse and let his mind drift into perfect repose thursday am the first round went wide nicking the edge of the dolphin fresco vance listened startled at the explosion at first thinking it was a sharp crack of thunder from outside then he heard the bullet sing into the dark a highpitched hiss for a moment he wondered if he was dreaming his mind adrift in the bloody myths of the palace then a second explosion flared from the direction of the archway grazing his neck eva he threw his body across hers slamming her against the alabaster portico his free hand slapped awkwardly at the candle crushing out the last sputter of flame as he swung around the empty ouzo bottle clattered into the dark spinning its revolving sound a beacon get it he thought and stretched across the stone to grope in the dark finally he felt the smoothness of the glass gliding at the edge of his reach slowly carefully his fingers circled the neck and he pulled it toward him the room was black now its silence deep as a tomb then the gun flamed once more and again the two rounds ricocheting off the ancient walls somewhere around them after that silence returned no sound except for the heave of breathing whose he wasnt sure as he reached to quiet her she whispered michael they want me she tried to struggle up youve got to let no he forced her back whispering we cant leave when the partys just beginning still grasping the neck of the bottle he moved silently across the floor the stone slabs were icy while the night music of the rain seemed to come from another world he pressed against the wall feeling for the doorway until he sensed a shadow slip past slowly edging into the room the muzzle of a pistol glinted against the flare of lightning outside and he realized it was no more than a couple of feet away now he swung the empty bottle with all his might aiming for the tip of the muzzle the impact coursed up his arm as the bottle splintered against the metal the intruders startled intake of breath was masked by the clatter of the weapon against the stone floor hell reach for it vance told himself lots of luck pal he brought the fractured bottle upward with all his strength aiming for the face although the figure was still formless he let instinct guide his hand the rough feel of shirt fabric brushed past his fingers and then the softness of flesh a scream of surprise pierced the dark bingo got the neck he thought and with a twist he drove the shattered bottle in a warm wetness gushed against his hand i hit an artery blind luck the figure stumbled backward into the dim passageway in a flash of lightning vance saw hands clawing at a neck then came the sound of stumbling footsteps retreating and again silence still gripping the sticky neck of the bottle he bent down and began to search the floor near his feet he felt a hot muzzle and followed it upward to the stillwarm grip it was he realized a mm baretta he kept an identical chromeplated model on the ulysses all right chum now well have a rerun grasping it with both hands in firing position he turned and peered out the open archway the glimmers of distant lightning showed nothing but stone walls and an empty passageway all he could discern was the vertical shaftway connecting the many levels of the palace he pressed against the cold stone wall and edged into the hallway leading toward the steps then he felt a sharp sensation against the ball of his left foot and reached down a spent cartridge shell still warm lay upended on the icy floor pasiphae he suddenly found himself thinking its as though eva had lured the killer here to this very room like the white bull and now he they who knows how many want to kill us both somebody realized she knows too much he tried to control his breathing straining to hear as the adrenaline continued to pump from the staircase up above the crickets had resumed their highpitched medley he listened as they chorused the sounds of centuries past their hymn to the rain there was nothing else no faint sounds far above maybe in the central court men were arguing it was a heated exchange he heard them grow louder and with that the metallic click of another automatic weapon being readied he waited holding his breath as the voices became even more animated what had happened there must have been two maybe even more good time to find a new place to party he turned back to the silent room it was he suddenly realized too silent he felt his way back to the alabaster portico and reached across eva the quiet that followed told him he had been right shed panicked run no he thought she only wants to save you she thinks she drew them here and now shes trying to lure them away bad time to leave just when things were getting interesting he reached down and felt for the righthand pocket of his trousers still lying crumpled in a pile on the floor finally he slid his hand in and searched the keys were gone she had taken them slipped away left nothing no trace only the smashed candle remained annoyed he located a box of hotel matches in his shirt and struck one the room was empty totally bare its dolphins frisking alone in their placid sea across on the other side was the passageway leading through the queens bathroom beyond it lay the labyrinthine twists of the palace hallways perhaps by now eva had found her way out and escaped from the maze of daedalus he tried to think as he finished donning his wet clothes in the dark eva clearly had gotten too close to somebodys plans where would she go cautiously he moved out and began to mount the marble staircase his rubber soles noiseless against the steps the automatic was beginning to feel comfortable even though it had nearly taken his life only minutes before but he never trusted life to a chunk of metal no matter how efficient above him the voices still quarreled and he found himself straining to catch the language what was it greek no maybe russian whatever it was a fierce argument was raging again he tried to guess how many there were he checked the metal clip and decided he had enough rounds to take them allif he had to but that was getting ahead of the game if she had eluded them then why bother the best thing would be to try to slip past the courtyard get through the fence maybe join her at the car then they could move the party back to the hotel keep the momentum he moved carefully on through the hall of the procession edging along the wall against his back he could feel the cold frescoes of the cup bearers locked in their sterile march through time then he heard another voice this time female pazdolba delaetye vcyo shto vam yugodnomnye vcyo it was eva yelling in rapidfire russian arguing shouting orders he couldnt make it out now he edged through the final archway grasping the baretta at that moment an eruption of gunfire splintered the silence a fiery burst in the rainy night while eva was yelling for it to stop it was over as quickly as it had come but she was still screaming swearing actually whoever was there they were no more than thirty feet away but she was still safe he could hear her curses now half muffled in the storm gingerly he edged on out through the entryway and stood at the edge of the courtyard baretta cocked and ready a lighter blossomed in the rain was brought upward to a cigarette and momentarily framed a face alex novosty he was holding what appeared to be an uzi peering down at the glistening stones sprawled across from him were two bodies both in dark raincoats now he was saying something to eva in russian but she was staring past him toward the entryway where vance stood in a flare of lightning their eyes locked and he saw in hers anger and disbelief at that moment the flame of the lighter was cut short but not before novosty whirled and followed her gaze instinctively vance threw himself against the inside wall of the processionway an instant later the uzi blazed again drowning the sound of novostys challenge he held his own automatic barely breathing while the rounds ricocheted against the stone walls was eva part of it what in hell then her voice rose again through the dark a mixture of russian and english she was screaming at novosty finally she called out michael a pause then her voice cracked you may as well stop the charade charade that wasnt the game theyd been playing he decided to wait the moment seemed part of a giant contest where none of the players wore team colors michael old man terribly sorry about that this time the voice was alexs its been a trying night novosty he yelled back ive got an automatic too chum touch one hair of her head and youre history i swear to god now let her go and then well talk my friend my friend im not keeping her the hesitation in his voice belied his attempt at calm you dont understand we have a problem here very serious and i am getting wet why dont you come out and lets discuss it somewhere dry no way you and i have a little catching up to do let her go shes not part of it ah but she is very much a part of it why do you think i am here tonight risking everything i need you now michael more than ever we are all in deep trouble because of her as vance started to respond he felt a glancing blow against the side of his neck powerful numbing awkwardly he stumbled forward cursing his own stupidity of course the man hed wounded had merely disappeared into the palace labyrinth hed been back there somewhere waiting now theyd guided him here with all the shouting he felt the baretta slip from his grasp as his head slammed against the hard plaster of the fresco his attacker was reaching for the gun hands slippery with blood there was hot breath against his face the gurgle of labored breathing it was a dying man with nothing to lose now alex was shouting at eva through the rain telling her to run for it good he thought and turned to shove his fist into the face of the figure struggling to turn the pistol on him the weapon fired a lethal blast next to his ear but the muzzle was still directed away the round glanced off the stone archway and ricocheted down the hallway as their struggle continued he heard the sound of the saab its engine coughing to life too bad ill miss the ride back with that he brought his knee against the assailants groin shoving him against the wall even then though he still could not see the face it was darkened or swathed in a black cloth he couldnt tell which suddenly the passageway flared and he looked up to see novosty rainsoaked holding his small italian lighter in his left hand in his right was the black metallic shape of the uzi just then the attacker drenched in blood finally wrenched away the baretta and was turning trying to speak vance noticed absently that blood streamed from a gash across the side of his neck i am sorry my friend alex was lifting his weapon calmly and with perfect precision things have become complicated but do not worry i have handled it and the uzi erupted the dying man actually managed to squeeze off a round a shot that went wild as the impact of the uzi slammed him against the wall then he fired again almost a death tremor and pitched forward vance started to stretch for the pistol as it clattered across the floor toward him but novostys voice sounded through the storm michael do us both a favor just leave it ive killed enough men tonight three and i knew them all i am very weary of it so please he was walking over still holding the uzi lets have a drink and talk this is very unsettling to my nerves you and your friends screwed up a perfectly fine evening youd better have a good excuse vance watched him very much wanting the pistol in his hands should he make a grab for it and take his chances as i tried to tell you just now it is very complicated novosty was picking up the baretta grasping it carefully with a piece of wet cloth hed ripped from the dead mans shirt then he looked up are your prints on this sort of figures doesnt it i borrowed it from him he pointed down at the bloodsoaked corpse between them so we must clean it he sighed what happened here tonight was a terrible accident my friend obviously how else can it be explained there will be an international inquiry we must now try and simplify the work of whoever has that unpleasant duty youve got some explaining of your own to do what about eva ah yes eva she should have known better than to come here he looked up tonight simply need not have happened it has always distressed me the imprudence of some women he sighed again i do not know if i can cover up this affair it may well be the end for me no kidding killing those two men out there may dampen your welcome in these parts i regret to say it was necessary they wanted to take her but when i reasoned against it they became suspicious which is why i had no choice was novosty here protecting eva he suddenly wondered after all there was ageold blood connecting them eva borodin and alex novosty went back centuries together centuries of russian history aristocrats both they shared family pain and glory from an age long before the october revolution but would she turn to him for refuge no not likely shed never be that desperate like you said this morning alex its unhealthy in this business to know too much tends to spoil all the interesting surprises yes i agree ignorance is often bliss i think thats the expression but having solved one problem i then faced another what to do about them happily our friend here was available to help i honestly think he would have died anyway from his neck wound he glanced up did you do this spur of the moment you are still good michael he bent over and examined the severed artery again my compliments you havent lost it an excellent job i believe this incision would have been fatal he turned back and smiled you have a surgeons touch are you going to tell me who the hell he is or do we play twenty questions he was a professional acquaintance this was most regrettable for everyone mine was a distasteful task i assure you he sighed once more as he laid both weapons against the wall i will trust you michael in turn you must trust me and help me we need to move this poor unfortunate to a more plausible location vance now realized what novosty was planning he was about to pin the murder of the two outside on a dead man this one but who were they whoever this one was one of his hands only had three fingers the little finger had been cut away just below the knuckle forget it im not going to help you do anything im going to walk out of here try and find eva and get the hell away from all this youre a negative influence alex my friend be reasonable he pointed toward the weapons we have work to do we must remove all the prints from those yours and mine then create an accident look you broke up a small party i had going here tonight but now that youve ruined my evening i damned sure dont plan to help you clean up michael neither of us had anything to do with this unfortunate business you or me i wasnt even in greece it must have been some terrible misunderstanding among men of questionable livelihood tempers obviously flared who knows everybody is dead so there can be no explanation beyond what appearances suggest he shrugged and slipped his arms underneath the body incidentally they told me that volodin was captured this morning but he didnt talk instead he killed himself so our situation is still secure you must have a hearing problem maybe you ought to get it checked i just told you its eva im going to help not you you can take the money and my friend my friend you are impetuous please everything is going as planned but now we must move quickly he smiled by the way did you leave anything down below just a broken bottle vance stared out into the rain then you might wish to make it disappear he began dragging the body into the courtyard it will have prints glass preserves them perfectly hes right for once vance thought rubbing at his neck a glimmer of pain intruding he turned and retraced his steps into the dark into the labyrinth as he descended the chill of the palace enveloped him he was bored with the place now its ancient horrors and its modern ones when the dark became too depressing he extracted a folder of hotel matches and struck one its puny light flared and then expired almost helpless against the blackness engulfing him the sound of crickets followed as he entered the bedroom of the queen once more he paused a moment in the dark then struck another match and walked over to the stone bed there was the neck of the splintered bottle covered with bloody fingerprints novosty was right about one thing it would have opened a whole new area of inquiry nobody at interpol had his prints on file at least as far as he knew but that wasnt good enough leave nothing to chance carrying the fractured bottle he began remounting the steps this time he wanted the dark needed it to clear his mind to mask the horrors of the palace the confusion of the shootout swirled in his mind alex novosty had killed three men as calmly as lighting a cigarette why was it just for the money when he emerged distant lightning glinted on the ancient stones of the courtyard contrasting brightly with the darkness below for an instant the palace seemed magical all over again and there perfectly choreographed on the wet pavement was evidence of a lethal duel three bodies lay across from each other two together and one opposite gripping a weapon his neck slashed perhaps it looked too pat but who would know things happened that way the only participant missing was aleksei ilyich novosty he gazed around but he knew he would see nothing yes alex had gotten out quickly and cleanly hed always been hit and run all right vance told himself now its time to answer a few questions who the hell is looking for eva and who wants to silence her are they the same people carefully methodically he began to search the pockets of the two men novosty had killed outside he knew what he was looking for the first appeared to be in his fifties pockmarked cheeks looked very russian in spite of it all he had a small spanish llama mm compact in a shoulder holster the other man was younger though already balding his cheeks were drawn and blood was already staining around the two holes in his cheap polyester suit his last expression was one of disbelief frozen in time hes the backup vance told himself number two thats always how they work he should have stayed back home maybe digging potatoes the passports were bulgarian a forgery stamped with a greek entry visa one week old port of entry athens but they had to be kgb no wonder novosty was in trouble now he was playing both sides of the game finally he pulled around the head of the other man the one swathed in black the one who had almost killed him twice this was the one hed been saving till last trying to guess a bloody brutal face stared back at him and through the torn shirt he could see a garish tattoo covering the back and chest at first he couldnt believe it so he lit a match and cupped it against the rain while he ripped open the rest of the cloth to be sure history swirled around him irezumi the rosecolored dragonandphoenix tattoo was regulation issueinsignia of a kobun of the rightwing ultranationalist minogumi the foremost yakuza crime syndicate of japan he knew it well chapter five thursday am andrei petrovich androv director of propulsion systems gazed out across the windy strait feeling the chill of the sea air cut through his furlined trench coat physically he was almost mythic a giant from grimms fairy tales he had a heavy face nature should wish on no man tousled gray hair bushy eyebrows eternally cocked in skepticism and a powerful taste for beethovens string quartets which he played incessantly in the instrument room he bore in fact more than a passing resemblance to that aging halfmad genius now seventyone he too possessed a monumental mind and was acknowledged worldwide as the founding intellect behind the soviet space program yes he was thinking this location had been ideal here in remote hokkaido they had constructed a highsecurity facility surrounded by windswept wildernessvirgin forests and snowcovered volcanoes even for him a man long used to the harsh winters of baikonur the almost siberian weather along this coast was intimidating this was the most isolated austere and yes lonely spot hed ever known but it was the perfect site mino industries had insisted rightly on this northernmost point of japan for the facility here in a national park on cape soya fifty kilometers west of wakkanai the facility itself had been constructed entirely underground excavated beneath this rocky northern coast in order to be secure and invisible to satellite reconnaisance both soviet and american such excessive precautions hardly a problem in the new mexico desert when the first atomic bomb was tested were the order of the day in this new era of space photography nowadays you even had to find ways to mask telltale waste heat expulsion which always betrayed an unmistakable infrared signature in that respect too their choice of this spot was strategic with the freezing currents of the la perouse strait between northern hokkaido and sakhalin providing a continuous and thermally stable degrees celsius feed for the heat exchangers only the tenthousandmeter test runway could not be concealed fulltime but it had been carefully camouflaged and was used only at night a massive breaker crashed against the rocks at the north end of the shore sending iceflecked spray upward into the morning mist as he watched the freezing cloud and felt its ice collecting on his cheeks he glanced at his watch it was sevenforty he took one last survey of the choppy gray sea and turned back his daily morning walk down to the shore had achieved its purpose his mind was as sharp as the icy wind whistling through the rocks he needed to be at number one by hours when the final test run was scheduled to begin as he did every morning he retraced the concrete steps that led down to the stainless steel entry door leading into the west quadrant when he reached it he inserted a coded plastic card into the slot pronounced his name into the black microphone flush with the metal doorframe and signaled the tv eye two seconds later a simulated voice from the computer granted him access the door sliding aside he nodded to the guards then moved on down the long neonlit gray hallway when he reached the unmarked door of number one he paused to listen the whine of the fans was still a high growl as the engineers ran through the warmup preparatory to bringing its six horse power motors to full power contenting himself that vibration in the fan housings remained at acceptable levels he flashed his id to the guard inserted his magnetic card and shoved open the door without a word he marched to his desk by the main video panel and slipped a scratched old melodiya disk onto his ancient turntable moments later the first movement of beethovens quartet in a minor boomed from the speakers we are ready to switch on the laser field doktor androv a young soviet technician approached gingerly if you wish we can direct the holograms here to the master terminal more of your pretty pictures he was examining the data on the video screens then he nodded da ya gotov when you will as he stared at the screens he again found himself growing pensive the project was all but finished now his lifelong dream he silently counted their breakthroughs the new material being used for the leading edges and scramjet struts a proprietary titanium alloy coated with a ceramic skin had turned out to be much lighter than aluminum and eight times as strong fullscale sections of the leading edges of the wings and the engine struts had been subjected to ten minute blasts of degrees fahrenheit air at mach in the hightemperature tunnel with no deformation or structural failure then the turboramjetscramjets four meters in diameter and nine meters long had all been given fullscale static tests at the aeropropulsion facility in the south where they were operated to mach at temperatures ranging from minus to over degrees fahrenheit massive refrigeration units and gas heaters had been used to achieve the temperature range while liquefied air was pumped into the intakes to duplicate a complete hypersonic duty cycle maybe he thought they were ready for a fullscale test flight only one problem remained a hint of supersonic wave drag the lowtemperature helium wind tunnel had shown could develop behind the leading edges he had ordered the project director to run a computer simulation examining the performance of two new ceramic spoilers modified canard foreplanes and the preliminary results indicated the drag would be effectively damped still he was determined to test that design modification with a full runup here in number one the massive hypersonic tunnel that contained a tenmeter scale model of the vehicle as he sat thinking he neglected to acknowledge the arrival of the project director now advancing down the concrete steps that led from the steel entry door dobriy utro doktor androv taro ikedas goodmorning greeting was heavily accented kak pashaviatye khoroshau andrei petrovich androv nodded absently still engaged in his thoughts dobriy utro today i have more good news ikeda continued as he headed for the coffee urn my briefing included a report that during the night our tsukuba team completed a simulation of the aerodynamic performance of your suggested modification all the way to mach just as you envisioned leadingedge deformation and vortex bursts were reduced to values well within the acceptable envelope he looked back which makes me question whether we really need to proceed with this mornings run your sx only tells us how a fuselage performs if airflows are ideal androv replied at hypersonic temperatures and velocities air doesnt behave predictably like a perfect gas fluid dynamics models can only give us approximations of actual characteristics he glanced up from the video control panel his face determined it is my son yuri who will be in the cockpit of these vehicles and my experience is you never put your faith in simulations in the hypersonic regime computer simulations are just guesswork a shortcut not worth a drozhky drivers fart as you wish ikeda replied evenly taking his first sip of coffee in truth andrei androv did not dismiss simulations out of hand he knew their fujitsu supercomputer was truly a marvel capable of replicating the aerodynamic characteristics of a given fuselage component modifying it testing it over and over millions of times iterating to the optimum design in almost the twinkling of an eye in every respect the high technology available here was astonishing take their hypersonic wind tunnel its laser probes shone thin slices of coherent light through the swirling air currents revealing complexities otherwise hidden amid whorls of turbulence these data were then enhanced through holography which used the laser light to create colored d representations of the flow around the model finally those holograms were fed into the supercomputer and analyzed from all angles this project would have been impossible anywhere else on earth but here the foreign team had created a featherlight hypersonic airframe that used turboramjets for horizontal takeoff and then changed their geometry into fuelinjected supersonic combustion ramjets or scramjets which combusted fuel and atmospheric oxygen using an internal shock wave instead of conventional compressors to achieve orbital velocity mach it was his dream come true brief me again on the simulation androv turned back to ikeda you say you went all the way to our maximum design objective we ran through the entire flight profile in real time the other man replied there were no stability problems whatsoever either during the powerup or during the switchover to scramjet engine geometry at mach encouraging encouraging androv turned back to his video panel as the fans continued to accelerate the violins of the a minor quartet his favorite of all beethovens late works washed over the room all the same we must run a complete sequence here for any design alterations he then fell silent studying the screens mach that wasyesalmost seventeen thousand miles per hour a velocity greater than any existing missile and it was airbreathing their supercomputers revolutionary aerodynamic design had made it possible problem at velocities higher than mach unprecedented airflows were required due to heat buildup in the fuelinjection struts and the shortage of oxygen at rarified altitudes solution the entire underside of the vehicle had been shaped to serve as an extension of the intakes for the twelve massive scramjets the fuselage of the plane itself was going to act as a giant funnel scooping in air and it had appeared to work at least in the computer then finally the japanese engineers had perfected the liquidaircycle process permitting the cryogenic hydrogen fuel to be used to liquefy a portion of the incoming air and inject it under high pressure into the engine the final essential breakthrough andrei androv was both an idealist and a pragmatist in russia you had to be that education began almost half a century earlier when as a student he had been on hand to assist in the first free flight of a russianmade liquid fuel rocket at an army base just outside moscow he had experienced the exhilaration of a new frontier and plunging himself into the new science of rocketry he had become a selftaught expert who published theoretical works read and praised by men three times his age ironically therefore andrei petrovich androv had not enjoyed the luxury of being ignored as the american rocket pioneer goddard had been joseph stalin always paranoid decided that the rocket researchers fireworks were dangerous to the country consequently andrei petrovich androv was arrested interrogated at butyrskaya prison in moscow and dispatched on the transsiberian railroad to a convict coal mine on the pacific coast eventually the political winds shifted as a recognized rocket expert he was part of the soviet team that shipped german scientists and v launchers back to russia finally under khrushchev he rose to genuine prominence since that general secretary believed that only rockets not manned aircraft had the range to drop bombs on the us nikita s khrushchev put andrei androv in charge of all soviet rocketry and andrei androv put russia in space hed been in charge of constructing the sprawling baikonur cosmodrome near tyuratram in kazakhstan central asia still the worlds largest space center from it he orbited the worlds first satellite sputnik and the worlds first astronaut yuri gagarin he knew the byways of that topsecret facility almost better than he knew his own living roomthe gantry systems the fueling apparatus the clean rooms the rocket assembly areas the sectors where satellites were readied most recently in he had been in charge of the successful first test launch of the most powerful vehicle the world had ever seenthe energia propelled by liquid hydrogen engines capable of lifting a hundredton space platform into orbit also during that time his only son yuri andreevich had become the soviet unions leading test pilot yuri was rarely home and then nine years ago andrei androvs wife had died of pneumonia isolated in the long snowy nights at baikonur hed consoled himself with string quartets his studies of classical greek and his designs his dreams of the ultimate space vehicle but he knew russia would never be able to build it alone soviet computer and materials technology already was slipping behind those of the west he grimaced to think how his country had been brought to todays humiliating state of affairs reduced to bargaining with foreigners like arabs in a medina eventually though pragmatism had overruled all underlying this bizarre new alliance was one simple reality the ussr needed japanese high technology desperately and it needed that technology now it had begun two years earlier when the president himself had paid a surprise secret visit to the space complex at baikonur supposedly to review the energia launch schedule that however was merely the official excuse he actually had an entirely different agenda without saying why he had invited his old friend andrei petrovich androv to join him at the secluded hunting lodge where he was stayingto talk oneonone about the future of soviet science as that long snowy evening wore on wind whistling through the log walls and pine smoke clouding the air their conversation had turned to hard truths and blunt language in vino veritas by midnight the uniformed bodyguards outside were stamping their heavy boots to keep warm and andrei petrovich and mikhail sergeevich were both drinking vodka directly from the bottle had flung its tinfoil cap onto the roughhewn boards of the cabins floor by then too the revered andrei petrovich androv was boldly speaking his mind mikhail sergeevich time has run out for russia there is nothing to buy almost nothing to eat and prices are soaring there is so much corruption you will not leave a russian hospital alive unless youve bribed everyone right down to the drunken orderlies and those bribes cant be money who wants rubles they are worthless these days you have to bribe with vodka hed laughed sadly then picked up an old copy of pravda there by the fireplace waved it in the air and tossed it into the crackling flames when we start cooperatives they are immediately taken over by our new mafia russias ruble millionaires everything perestroika will succeed in time andrei petrovich the president had insisted perfunctorily still not having explained why they were meeting we are moving as rapidly as circumstances will permit the bureaucracy perestroika androv had roared back have you heard the latest joke from moscow perestroika is like a country where everyone is switching from driving on the left side to the right sidegradually our halfmeasure concessions to a market economy have produced the worst of both systems we now have a land with socialist initiative and capitalist conscience he paused to laugh again then sobered and soon very soon were going to find ourselves in the technological third world we need a vision even more we need hard currency and western technology now and we need massive amounts nothing less can save us that was when the president had nodded silently then lifted a topsecret document from his black leather briefcase he explained that it was a proposal from a consortium of foreigners he wanted andrei androvs honest assessment read this andrei petrovich he said passing it over and tell me what you think it may well be a terrible thing even to consider but i must know your view you my old friend are one of the few men i know i can trust this proposal can it work as he squinted by the flickering light of the fire andrei petrovich androv almost couldnt believe what he was reading among other things the dream he had dreamed so long was there his for the taking the dream of a bold venture in space achieved with a whole new level of technology along with it the soviet union would receive everything it needed the foreigners would provide billions and billions in longterm lowinterest loans and a flood of subsidized consumer goods to erase the pain of perestroika providing the president with the badly needed financing not to mention popular support he needed to bring it off but there were price tags several of them the first would be total access to all soviet space and propulsion technology that component would actually make sense technically but the others were higher much higher could it be done should it be done what do you think andrei petrovich the president had finally spoken his voice a whisper above the snap of embers and the howl of wind do we dare the room had fallen silent for a long moment was this some kind of trap he almost wondered like the old days no hed quickly concluded this time russia was different he would have to trust mikhail sergeevich most of all though he was holding his lifelong ambition in his hand at last he replied hope mingled with apprehension i think we have no choice he had looked up at the presidents troubled eyes you have no choice unfortunately i think you are right he had sighed and turned his gaze to the blackness outside the snow banked window ve tyomnuyu noch ya znayu yes andrei petrovich on this dark night i finally know what we must do after one final vodka they had set about devising the scenario that would change the world forever the airflow around the model continued to accelerate while laser holograms of its complex aerodynamics were now being converted by the computer into multicolored graphic art androv watched the wallsize liquid crystal display screen in the control room begin generating a vivid depiction of the streams whirling past the model simulating the incremental stages of hypersonic climb it was like watching a hallucination he thought as colors swirled around the fuselage of an object seemingly composed of d lines and curves we are now at mach comrade doktor androv the voice of a soviet technician interrupted his thoughts the laser data show that the supersonic wave drag peaks at mach then subsides your new canard foreplanes appear to be working at least for this portion of the flight envelope androv studied the screen noncommittal thus far it would appear to be so perhaps the sx was correct all the same at mach i want to switch on the enhancer then capture those data and analyze them to be doubly sure the hypersonic enhancer permitted windtunnel burst tests at far higher velocities than a conventional facility could achieve more high tech there could still be a problem androv continued when the vortex of air currents shed from the nose of the fuselage encounters the shock waves from the wings particularly around mach he turned to ikeda those vortexes have been responsible for significant damage to several american space shuttles during reentry phase i need to see the data as you wish the director walked to the thick glass window that looked out onto the model suspended in the airstream the crew of technicians hovered over the controls watching for any signs of vibration he studied the screens for a few moments then spoke quietly to the head of the technical team an intense young man in spectacles this lieutenant turned and passed the order to his colleagues who nodded gravely and stationed themselves at the switches above the roar a brilliant arc of electricity suddenly exploded just in front of the nose of the model adding an additional burst of pressure at mach to the velocity already passing across it was a blinding microsecond pulse that momentarily boosted simulated vehicle velocity to mach the lasers registered the data then passed it directly via microwave link into the memory banks of the powerful sx operating hundreds of miles away seconds later the turbulence data appeared in visual form on the liquid crystal screen above them as the colored numbers flashed a cheer went up from the normally somber technicians still no sign of any wave drag outside the theoretical envelope not even at mach the young headtechnician beamed just as we simulated ikeda noted quietly this time even the grave androv smiled i must congratulate all of you he was rising from his chair the central one facing the main controls then i will order the modification installed ikeda nodded if you formally authorize it authorized i think you are right perhaps we are ready for a hypersonic test flight androv reached to switch off his turntable i would like to go down to the hangar now myself in fact perhaps celebrate this moment with a glass of tea of course ikeda spoke quickly to his japanese technicians then followed the russian out the door the hallways were a connected maze of brilliantly lighted and scrupulously clean tunnels they moved down the main corridor to the central checkpoint then turned and entered the south quadrant passing the various assembly sections those sectors were mostly quiet now since the final work had been completed several weeks earlier androv said nothing as they walked toward the doorways connecting the south quadrant with the underground hangar he merely whistled a portion of the third movement of the a minor quartet beethovens hymn of thanksgiving in the greek lydian mode he recalled that the english writer aldous huxley had once suggested that particular movement was proof of gods existence was there a god he wasnt sure the only miracles he knew of on this earth were performed by men he was on the verge of performing one himself the history of space exploration had been played out entirely in his lifetime he himself had been the architect of much of that progress but putting a man into space remained an expensive and dangerous proposition launch vehicles still exploded with alarming regularity man was trapped on this planet god was still in the heavens mans hope of reaching god at will required a special creation one that could taxi off a runway just like a normal aircraft then accelerate to hypersonic speeds reaching lowearth orbit an airbreathing space vehicle its potential for the peaceful exploration of nearearth space defied imagination peace all his life andrei petrovich androv had worked in the shadow of war now at last he had created the ultimate symbol of peace the entry to the hangar was secured but when the guards saw dr androv and the project director approaching they saluted and punched in the codes on the locks moments later the heavy steel doors slid aside revealing the brilliant lights of the hangar it was cavernous over a hundred feet high with gantries now standing idle along the walls whitecoated technicians swarmed over the two prototypes checking the final seals while others were on twentyfoothigh trucks servicing the engines looming above them were what appeared to be two giant prehistoric birds streaks of gleaming silver over three hundred feet in length with pensharp noses that dipped rakishly downward androv paused to admire them a moment marveling in spite of himself the long sleek lines swept back in a clean curve without the interruption of a windshield the cockpit in fact was deep inside the nose where shock waves would not impact the computer guidance system from the nose its lines burgeoned into a sharp clean fan and beneath the two abbreviated wings were suspended twelve massive turboramjetscramjets they had already been certified at mach in ten days one of these vehicles would achieve the ultimate mach seventeen thousand miles per hour the americans had codenamed their fledgling design for a hypersonic space planestill at least a decade away the x but no such mundane designation would satisfy andrei petrovich androv devoted disciple of the ancients he had long believed the americans were hightech vulgarians with no poetry in their soul no sense of history across the towering tail assembly of both aircraft was an insignia that symbolized the joining of two of the worlds great superpowers a double ax and along their titaniumcomposite fuselage was lettered a single word in cyrillic characters andrei androv had insisted on that name in celebration of the first human ever to soar above the earth the dream of ancient man now he had declared four thousand years later there was another dream his dream a hypersonic vehicle that could loft man directly into space from anywhere on the planet he had dreamed that dream and the mino industries group had permitted him to pick the name for the creation that would realize it for the miracle that would master time and space the earth itself daedalus thursday am yuri androv stood at the far end of the floodlit hangar staring up at the underbelly of daedalus i and thinking this mornings runup in the centrifuge had gone well at last he was convinced there was no physiological barrier to hypersonic flight at least none he couldnt handle the scramjets had all been put through their paces at the aeropropulsion facility on the test stand at least they met their specifications yes he was thinking this plane just might do it he would ease through the mach barrier slowly then convert to scramjet geometry switch to liquid hydrogen and go full throttle it was scary sure but you only lived once fuck the danger the prospect was exhilarating and chilling he looked up again awed even for someone whod seen and flown them all this was an inspiring creation not only was it easily the most technologically advanced flight vehicle in the world it also was stunningly beautiful right now however there were two simple problems first without a hypersonic test flight nobody could really be sure it would do what it was supposed to second as of now both prototypes still belonged to mino industries and would continue to belong to mino industries until the final treaty and agreement were signed actually taking the daedalus hypersonic might be the least of the projects worries that was the part he knew how to handle the unknowns lay in another direction entirely the strategic direction strategically he still didnt trust russias new partner from what hed heard the conditions demanded in return for all their high technology had been heavy and that was just the shortterm price the longterm cost might be even greater was the soviet union about to become the financial and technological captive of a shadowy group of foreigners men whose identities remained even now shrouded in secrecy was this a faustian bargain just then he noticed the doors at the far end of the hangar slide open and two men in white lab coats enter perfect timing he thought even at that distance he knew immediately who they were the joint ventures two top technical officers his father andrei petrovich androv and taro ikeda the project director for the japanese team the men held equal authority supposedly but in fact all the real decisions on this project were being made by somebody else entirely the shots were actually being called from a skyscraper in tokyo by a mysterious ceo known as tanzan mino now ikeda and the elder androv were headed his way as he watched ikeda he felt himself involuntarily stiffen perhaps his unease about the man was his intuitive right brain working trying to tell him something but what all communications with the ceo were channeled through ikeda fair enough he told himself he was accustomed to secrecy maybe japanese industrialists were as careful about protecting their asses as the soviet nomenklatura were maybe it was just part of the landscape here too but still strastvitya yuri andreevich ikeda smiled extending his pale hand as he simultaneously bowed kak pashaviatye khoroshau spahcebo he shook ikedas hand then nodded toward his father if this is a good time id like to discuss the scramjet powerup sequence with dr androv for a few moments if its anything serious then perhaps we should all confer with the prime contractors ikeda responded smoothly right now in my office in fact i was just on the phone with no need to bring them in just a few technical items nothing more yuri andreevich ikeda smiled and bowed again his eyes trying to display a warmth they clearly did not possess every issue here is of importance to us all if not every nut and bolt he interrupted i just have some sequencing questions thats all ikeda bowed once more quickly you know we are all depending on you no one in japan has the experience to take up a plane like this at least not at this stage of the project so be aware that any matter weighing upon the success of your test flight or your safety he flashed another quick concerned smile is naturally of gravest concern to me and to the ceo then you should be glad to hear the powerup simulation in the centrifuge this morning took me right through mach with no problems which means the scramjet ignition sequence looks like a go congratulations ikeda nodded one last thing ill be sending a memo to engineering about a modification of the cockpit to permit more latitude in the seat nothing major i think we could still reduce vascular stress in the highg regime andrei androv noticed the look of concern on his sons face yuri you seem troubled this morning did anything of course send engineering your memo by all means ikeda interjected ill personally see its taken care of we want nothing to go wrong not even the smallest good thats all i want yuri turned and wrapped his arm around his fathers aging shoulders gently urging him in the direction of the trucks stationed beneath the silver nose of daedalus i he wanted to get rid of ikeda so he could talk after they moved a few feet he yelled back over his shoulder but wait on the decision till you read my memo as you wish ikeda nodded farewell ill be in my office until hours if we need contractor input which meant yuri knew that no further communication with him was permissible after that time technical consultations were only held during mornings afternoons he seemed to have other pressing matters to attend to yuri the runup in number one went well this morning i think weve finally eliminated the supersonic wave drag the elder androv was heading over to check the hydraulic lifts supporting the landing gear and its heavy ply retractable tires then he glanced back and smiled im beginning to believe in miracles we might just succeed if those damned scramjets up there he pointed skyward actually achieve ignition when theyre supposed to ive studied the statictest data carefully at the propulsion facility they routinely achieved ignition at mach the numbers were there and they looked all right temperature regime pounds thrust all the rest whats really happening yuri thought suddenly is theyve taken our engineering design and built it but what if were just being used somehow having our brains picked our expertise stolen then what he said nothing though just listened quietly as the older man continued also the new ceramic composite theyve come up with for the fuel injection struts was heated to thirtyfive hundred degrees fahrenheit and repeatedly stresstested those data were particularly impressive you know the struts have always been the achilles heel for a scramjet since the fuel has to be injected directly through them into the combustion chamber they have to withstand shock waves and thermal stresses far beyond anything ever encountered in a conventional engine nobody else has ever come up with a material that can do it not us not the americans not anybody but now their hightemperature materials and liquid air cycle have finally made the scramjet concept a reality the last roadblock is gone he looked up still marveling all we or the americans can do is make engineering drawings of those engines just pictures i hope youre right but when we switch over from jp to liquid hydrogen nobody knows what can happen its never been done before are you really worried the old man studied him damned right i am who wouldnt be he looked around at the milling japanese technicians then lowered his voice and ill tell you something else therere other things around here worrying me too maybe even more something about this project is starting to feel wrong what do you mean andrei stared im beginning to suspect i dont know so far its just a sense but yuri let me tell you a hard fact the elder androv interjected like it or not this project is the only chance the soviet union has to ever own a vehicle like this that may be true but if we remember the sad fate of the tu he went on the supersonic passenger plane we built based on some engineering drawings for the concorde we managed to get hold of we copied it but we got it wrong and in we had that horrible tragedy at the paris air show when it crashed in a ball of fire that was the end of it we failed and it was humiliating the soviet union couldnt even build a supersonic passenger jet the real truth is we didnt have the computers we needed to design it he looked up smiling but now all that humiliation will be undone yuri suddenly realized his father was being swept up in his dreams the same way he sometimes got lost in those damned string quartets or reading euripides in the original greek he was going off in his fantasy world again he couldnt see that maybe he was being used have you ever wondered where this project is going to lead where it has to lead it will lead the way to peace it will be a symbol of cooperation between two great nations demonstrating that the human spirit can triumph moi otyets it could just as well lead the way to something else entirely dont you realize whats happening here were giving away our thruster engineering russias leading technology its the one area where we still lead the world weve just handed it over for the price of one fucking airplane and even if we eventually get our hands on these prototypes we cant build more without begging the materials from them we cant fabricate these composite alloys in the soviet union but this is a joint venture everything will be shared he smiled again his face gnomelike beneath his mane of white hair it will also give us both a chance to overcome the lead of europe and america in commercial passenger transport in the next century thats what this is all about the future of nonmilitary aviation its right here do you really believe that he stifled a snort of incredulity dont you see what this vehicle really is let me tell you its the most deadly weapons delivery system the world has ever seen and were showing them how to build it even testing it for them to make sure itll perform the daedalus will never be a military plane i would never have participated if i thought exactly thats what they want us to believe but it sure as hell could be and mino industries will be the only company on earth that can actually build more of them he sensed it was useless to argue further nothing mattered to andrei petrovich androv except what he wanted to believe at this point nothing could be done to expose the dangers because nobody on the soviet team would listen or maybe there was something why not make a small revision in the test flight once he was aloft what was anybody going to do he would be up there alone if he could get around their flight computer he might just show the world a thing or two hed been thinking about it for weeks now all right he turned back if this thing is supposedly ready to fly then ill fly it but get ready for some surprises yuri what are you planning just a small unscheduled maneuver the hell with it he thought theyve got seven days and then i take it up and powerin the scramjets im ready to go tell ikeda to prepare to have liquid hydrogen pumped into the tanks but thats not how weve structured the test schedule andrei examined him startled yuri had always been fiery but never irrational we need ten fuck the schedule im going to take this vehicle hypersonic in a week or they can get themselves another test pilot he turned away reschedule or forget it we dont have much time left once all the agreements are signed yuri i dont like this his eyes were grave its not just tell them to get daedalus i prepped i think these bastards that call themselves mino industries have a whole agenda theyre not telling us about but im about to rearrange their timetable chapter six thursday am a very wet very annoyed michael vance rapped on the door of zeno stantopouloss darkened kafeneion hed walked the lonely back road into iraklion in the dark guiding himself by the rainbattered groves of plane trees olive and wild pear trying to figure out what in hell was happening to begin with members of the intelligence services of major nations didnt go around knocking each other off that was an unwritten rule among spooks very bad taste maybe you tried to get somebody to talk with sodium pentathol or scopolamine but guns were stupid and everybody knew it you could get killed with one of those things for godsake so this operation whatever it was was outside the system good that was the way he had long since learned to work there was a lot on his mind and the walk the isolation gave him a chance to think over some of the past in particular the austere cretan countryside brought to mind an evening five years ago when hed traveled this littleused route with his father michael vance sr that occasion autumn brisk with a first glimmering of starlight theyd laughed and joked for much of the way the old man occasionally tapping the packed earth sharply with his cane almost as though he wanted to establish final authority over the island and make it his once and for all finally the conversation turned serious michael dont tell me you never miss academic life his father had finally brought himself to say masking the remark by casually brushing aside yet another pale stone with his cane more and more your theory about the palace is gaining credence you may find yourself famous all over again its an enviable position maybe one turn in the snake pit was enough he smiled academia and i form a sort of mutual disrespect society well his father had gone on the choice is yours but you know ill be retiring from penn at the end of this term naturally therell be some vicious inhouse jockeying to fill my shoes but if youd like i could probably arrange things with the search committee vindicated at last hed realized it seemed the only sin in academia greater than being wrong was being right too soon but the smallminded universe of departmental politics was the last thing he wanted in his life these days he played in the big time im afraid ill have to pass i suppose university life is too limiting for you now the old man had finally said grudgingly but admiringly hed said that and nothing more two months later hed had a second stroke and retired permanently these days he grew orchids in darien connecticut and penned impassioned longhand letters to the times every day or so just to keep his capacity for moral outrage honed vance had definitely gone his own way first hed published a book that rocked the scholarly world then hed compounded that offense by walking out on the brouhaha that followed and going freelance starting his own business next hed become involved with the washington intelligence community and finally hed begun working with the association of retired mercenaries it was a universe so alien to his father it might as well have been on mars but if the old man was disappointed that michael vance jr hadnt turned out the way hed planned he still took pride in his son now though stuttgart and the restoration of phaistos would have to be put on hold till the latest game with novosty was sorted out the protocol it was still running through his mind could there be some sort of alliance cooking between the soviets and the japanese mob what in hell michael she is here a hoarse whisper emerged as the rickety wooden door of the kafeneion edged open zeno tugged down his nightshirt and carefully edged it wider squinting out at the street come in quickly before you are seen so his guess had been right she was avoiding the hotel good move smart and typical of eva she was handling this one exactly right he stepped through the door where is she now shes in back adriana gave her something to make her sleep zeno was pulling out a chair from one of the empty tables the room was shrouded in darkness and the stale odor of the kitchen permeated the air she was not herself michael what happened she claimed someone was trying to murder her at the palace did you two we tried throwing a party but it started getting crowded he looked around i could use some of that raki of yours i just had a close encounter with a guy you wouldnt sit down next to on a bus he refused to leave politely so i had to make him disappear bad scene you killed him he was shooting at eva and me very unsociable he glanced toward the back of the darkened room zeno our party guest tonight wasyoure not going to believe this a japanese hood tell me something is the yakuza trying to get a foothold in crete you know maybe buying up property thats their usual style its more or less how they first moved in on hawaii michael this country is so poor theres nothing here for gangsters to steal he laughed let me tell you a secret if a stranger came around here and tried to muscle me or any of my friends he would not live to see the sun tomorrow even the sicilian cosa nostra is afraid of us crete is still a small village in many ways in spite of the crazy tourists we tolerate strangers even open our homes to them if they are well behaved but we know each others secrets like a family so to answer your question the idea of a japanese syndicate coming here is impossible to imagine you know that as well as i do thats what i thought but i saw a kobun from the biggest yakuza organization in japan tonight i know because i had a little tango with their godfather a few years back anyway whats one of his street men doing here shooting at eva and me he paused as the implications of the night began to sink in this scene could start to get rough you did nothing more than anybody here would have done he looked pensive in the dim light years ago when the colonels and their junta seized greece i once had to he hesitated sometimes we do things we dont like to talk about afterwards but you always remember the eyes of a man you must kill you dream about them our party lighting was pretty minimal it was too dark to make out his eyes then you are luckier than you know he glanced away this was not somebody you knew from another job michael perhaps the mercenary group you sometimes never saw the guy before in my life swear to god anyway i think it was eva he really wanted but whatevers going on i have to get her out of crete now before whoever it is finds her again i agree he was turning toward the living quarters in the rear you should stay here tonight and then tomorrow we can get you both passage on the car ferry to athens off the island i will take care of everything tickets all of it he returned carrying two tumblers of raki after setting them on the table he continued i am very worried for her michael and for you we all make enemies but he took a sip from his glass by the way do you have a pistol not with me he reached for the glass wishing it was tequilastraight with a twist of limeand he was back on the ulysses trimming the genoa thats a mistake i may not make again soon then i will arrange for one like i said everything i have many friends do not worry he drank again by the way she asked me go to the hotel and get something for you she seemed to think it was important one of your modern american inventions she had it locked in the safe at the desk and she gave me money to pay for her room he sighed why would she waste money on a hotel when she could have stayed here with us what is it i think its a computer though its barely the size of a briefcase part of the new age that mercifully has passed us by i have it in back with the rest of her things his voice disappeared into the darkened kitchen moments later he reappeared carrying evas laptop with a worried look he settled it gingerly on the table do you have any idea why she had this with her i think she may have something stored in here he settled it on the table and flipped up the top then he felt along the side for the switch and a second later the screen glowed blue after the operating system was in place he punched up the files a long line of names filled the screen arranged alphabetically but nothing seemed right it was a stream of unclassified nsa memos and then a lot of personal letters he resisted the temptation to call them up and delve into her private life how many men stick to business save the fun for later wheres the file then he noticed the very first alphanumeric ackerman hold on he thought wasnt that the name of the nsa guy she said gave her the disk he highlighted the file on the screen and hit retrieve an instant later it appeared yep this one had to be it clearly an nsa document very carefully stored nscid no page of dept rlsigint classification top secret authorization depthod only analyst eva borodin init ekb encryption pesunknown reference classified daedalus protocol the union of soviet socialist republics ussr and mino industries group hereinafter referred to as the parties mindful of their obligation to strive

numbers filled three pages and then came article ii thus it went for ten articles as he scrolled up page after page he realized that the numbers continued for the rest of the document she was right outside of occasional repetitions there seemed to be no real pattern hed seen a lot of encryptions in the old days but this one didnt look like anything standard he sat staring at the screen mino industries group that explained the minogumi goon the godfather was planning his biggest play yet global but what was it what was in the deal this was something he had to see eva had said she tried the data encryption standard the des system and got nowhere which meant nsa had been foiled how had he done it des was a procedure whereby data were passed through a series of eight sboxes actually mathematical operations that when combined with a unique user key converted it into what appeared to be alphanumeric garbage the receiver also had a copy of the key which could be used in combination with the same set of mathematical operations to convert it back he knew that back when des was being invented by ibm the national security agency had purposely sabotaged big blues original plan to make it uncrackable nsa had insisted that the key a string of zeroes and ones be limited to bits rather than the proposed bits which would have made the system so complex it would have been safe forever the reason of course was that nsa didnt want an unbreakable cipher loose on the planet after all their primary business was reading other peoples mail ibm didnt know it at the time but the smaller key was already a pushover for nsas cray supercomputers which could try a trillion random keys per second and routinely crack any bit des encryption in the world in half a day anybody familiar with the intelligence business was well aware of that which was obviously why somebody had turned to nsa but eva said shed tried the usual randomkey procedure and got nowhere so what was the answer his head was buzzing from the raki now but he kept turning over in his mind the possibility that shed been looking in the wrong place trying to find the des key when in fact this encryption used some entirely different scheme he rubbed at his temples and tried to run the scenario backward project daedalus the more he thought about it the more zeno he looked up from the screen do you still have that copy of realm of the spirit hed sent the old greek an autographed first edition the week it came out your book michael of course i have it i treasure it its in the bedroom in back mind getting it for me i feel like a little light reading at four in the morning michael i think you know how it is when your mind gets filled up with garbage at bedtime you should be getting some sleep like eva tomorrow we have to i need to relax a little first and i need that book theres a chart in the appendix guaranteed to put anybody to sleep very well he sighed drank off the last of his raki and pulled himself erect sometimes you can be as headstrong as your father as quiet settled over the room vance continued to stare at the screen why did he have a hunch he was right on this one could he really crack a cypher with a portable when nsas cray supercomputers had bombed maybe stranger things had happened the samurai swordsmen said you needed to know your opponents mind here in the waning hours before dawn in the middle of crete he was feeling a curious oneness with whoever had devised this randomlooking string of numbers hed created number strings just like this himself back before the cia had come into his life here it is michael adriana said eva is still asleep i dont know what she gave her perhaps one of her old wives potions he chuckled quietly thats one of the reasons i love her so much when you get ancient like i am its good to be married to a nurse vance took the book and in spite of himself weighed it in his hand what was it maybe two pounds the glistening dust jacket unusual for a university book back in those days was still pristine he smiled realizing it was unread thanks he finally remembered zeno this should do the trick now why dont you go on to bed ill just stretch out here on a table when i get sleepy michael sometimes i think you are a madman he shrugged then turned to hobble back toward the bedroom just dont answer the door whatever you do get some sleep ill be doing the same then good night may god give you rest he was gone vance barely nodded since he was already turning to the appendix of the book and switching on the dim overhead light the volume brought back a world long lost for him now he wanted it back if only for a moment he flipped to appendix c there hed reproduced as a dutiful scholar should the standard numerical correlates for the syllabary of linear b mycenaen syllabary after ventris da qa sa je o ra ro za qo pu pte ka pa zo ti du ta qe the numbers continued on to ninety he checked the files and sure enough she had a lotus data management system on the hard disk he quickly structured a format for his matrix then began coding in the sounds the setup was simple but the next part would need some programming the numbers in the protocol had to be converted to sounds it looked easy but what if theyd been deliberately garbled somehow hed be no better off than before think positive as he finished coding in the grid he could hear the tentative stirrings of early morning iraklion outside trucks were starting up birds coming alive he began noticing the lack of sleep but he pushed it aside and took another sip of raki just keep going he told himself youre about to find out if great minds really do think alike darling what in the world are you doing with my computer the voice was like a whisper over his shoulder how about checking to see if youve got any video games he turned around startled in spite of himself what had woken her she was probably wired eva why did you take off tonight and what was that nonsense you were yelling at me maybe it wasnt nonsense alex said you were working for him he said you two were partners its not really true is it she slumped into a chair she was wearing a light dressing gown her hair tousled with a groan she rubbed at her eyes i dont need this you can forget about alex hes playing way over his head its always bad judgment to underestimate the other teams strengths he reached for her youve just got to decide who you trust you might start with zeno hes offered to help me get you out of crete and go where she moved against him michael they found me here theyll find me anywhere not if we turn this scene around and take the action to them but thats the next move right now you just have to be out of crete while i do a little checking how about flying to miami grabbing a plane down to nassau then youre going to get me on the ulysses or die trying arent you he decided to let the crack pass it was true however if she ever saw it he was sure shed start to understand you know she went on this afternoon i was merely worried now im actually frightened guess im not as brave as i thought im sorry about tonight running off like that not the first time ive had a woman give me the gate he laughed then reached out and stroked her hair missing the long tresses of the old days now you can help me out with something does the name yakuza mean anything to you what are you talking about she studied him puzzled i probably shouldnt tell you this maybe itll just upset your morning but that wiseguy who broke up our party last night was a japanese hood from the minogumi syndicate back home theyre numero uno they run tokyo and osaka and theyve got half the liberal democratic party in their pocket then theres the old cia connection from days gone by how do you know after you took off our friend dropped in again uninvited as usual thats when novosty finished him off with his uzi and i got a closer look alex killed my god that makes three by actual count hes gone a little trigger happy in his old age that or hes very very scared he rubbed at the scratch on his neck remembering what if its the japanese mob thats behind this they have the funding thats for sure among other things they run consumer loans in japan legalized loan sharking theyve got more money than god this is too much i dont know anything about she rose trembling ill go with you to nassau michael lets take the ulysses and just disappear in the middle of the atlantic its a deal he beamed but first weve got to answer some questions you say the yakuza are not part of anything you know about im only vaguely aware they exist and you dont know who runs mino industries never heard of it before its a bunch of nice cleancut mobsters problem is one of the owners kobun street men tried to kill us tonight maybe were finally getting a little light at the end of the tunnel he looked her over eva was always beautiful in the mornings there was something wanton about her this time of day come here a minute he took her and cradled her in his arms then brushed his lips against her brow you okay i think so she took a deep breath never knew you to quit just because things got tough he drew her around youre the cryptography expert why dont we try to find out what kind of phonetics ventriss numerical correlates for linear b would produce from these numbers what are you talking about she rubbed at her eyes you know in my travels ive discovered something a great mind often has a touch of poetry sometimes in order to think like the other guy you need to be a little artistic so i wonder about that cipher you mean just a crazy early morning idea he patted the keyboard of the laptop what if the mind behind it is using a system no computer in the world would ever have heard of theres no such thing believe me maybe yes maybe no he flipped open his book to the central section a glossy portfolio of photos hed shot them himself with an old nikon take a look at this and refresh your memory she looked down at the photo of a large minoan clay jar from the palace a giant pithoi once a container for oil or unguents or water for the bath along the sides were inscribed rows of wavy lines and symbols it was the minoan written language which along with cuneiform and hieroglyphics was among the oldest in the world you mean linear b language of king minos as you undoubtedly remember its actually a syllabary and a damned good one each of these little pictures is a syllable a consonant followed by a vowel come on this was your thing way back when look this wavy flag here reads mi and here this little pitchfork with a tail reads no he glanced up anyway surely you recall that linear b has almost a hundred of these syllable signs but ventris assigned them numbers since theyre so hard to reproduce in typeface for example this series here minotaro reads numerically as he checked the appendix run them together and minotaro reads and just like the early greeks the minoans didnt insert a space between words if somebody was using linear b via ventris system the thing would come out looking like an unintelligible string of numbers you dont really you say youve tried everything else nsas crays drew a blank maybe you were looking for some fancy new encryption system when it was actually one so old nobody would ever think of it almost four thousand years old to be exact darling thats very romantic youre improving in the romance department she gazed at him a second then flashed a wry smile but i cant say the same for the goodsense arena no offense but thats like the kind of thing kids write to us suggesting nobody employs anything remotely that simple these days i knew youd think i was crazy youre not the first he rose but humor me just slice those number sequences into pairs and see what they look like phonetically something to take your mind off all the madness around here well all right she sighed then settled unsteadily into the rickety chair hed just vacated make you a proposition sweetie get me some coffee nice and strong and ill forget i have good sense and play with this a little youre a trooper he turned and headed for the kitchen i remember that about you not to mention great in bed we strive for excellence in all things just as he reached the doorway the kitchen light flicked on it was adriana in blue robe and furry slippers now reaching up to retrieve her coffee pan while eva was typing away behind him he leaned against the doorframe in his stillwet clothes to watch a greek grandmother shuffle about her private domain preparing a traditional breakfast he suspected no male hand had ever touched those sparkling utensils the old world had its ways yesterday and forever while he drowsed against the doorjamb the aroma of fresh greek coffee began filling the room sarakin that was the japanese name for their homegrown loan sharks the socalled salarymen financiers he knew that the yakuzas four largest sarakin operations gave out more consumer loans than all of japans banks combined if you added to that the profits in illegal amphetamines prostitution bars shakedowns of businesses protection rackets the usual list and you were talking multi multibillions the major problem was washing all that dirty money they routinely invested in respectable but losing propositions abroad on the sound theory that one dollar cleaned was worth two unlaundered was that what the soviet scam was all about money from the japanese mob being laundered through loans to the ussr what better way to wash it nobody would ever bother asking where it came from but there was one major problem with that neat scenario politically the yakuza were ultrarightist hardliners so why would they expose their money with the soviets laundered or not particularly now with so much political instability therehardliners reformers nationalists somehow it didnt compute michael come here a second the voice had an edge of triumph what he glanced around groggily just come here and take a look at this she was staring at the screen he turned and walked over still entranced by the heady pungent essence of fresh greek coffee now flooding the room is it anything just look at it and tell me what you think she leaned back from the screen and shifted the zenith toward him the iceblue letters cast an eerie glow through the dull morning light the color reflected off his eyes matching them you did it already i started with a onetoone replacement of numbers with letters but its sequenceinverted which means i had to anyway what do think so far am i a genius or what he drew a chair next to the screen and started to examine it but at that moment adriana set a tray of coffee down beside the computer steaming and fresh together with dark figs and two bowls of yogurt kafe evropaiko she commanded then thrust a cup into his hand malista efcharisto he absently nodded his thanks took a sip of the steaming brew then returned his attention to the screen at first he thought he was just groggy his vision playing tricks but then the string of letters began to come into focus incredible okay what about this part here he asked pointing to the fourth line where the letters turned to nonsensical garbage and then down here again thats what i was talking about the interlacing switches there it happens every hundred numbers they started by taking the second fifty digits and interlacing them back into the first fifty then they switched the algorithm and interlaced the third fifty digits ahead into the fourth fifty but backwards then it repeats again you figured all that out just fooling around with it darling i do this for a living for godsake after a while you have good instincts she tapped her fingers nervously on the wooden table then remembered the coffee and reached for a cup nice little trick standard but nice every so often you fold the data back into themselves somehow that way there are no repetitions of number sequencesfor words that are used a lotto give you away but once youve played with this stuff as much as i have anyway its always the first thing i check for congratulations tell me the truth she looked at him sipping her coffee can you really still read this its been years memory like an elephant though you may have to help me along now and then he pointed look i think that words modern greek theyve mixed it in where theres not an old word for something he pushed around the computer want to run the whole data file through your system clean it up my pleasure she was clearing the screen i cant believe it just fell apart like this the reason our crays didnt crack it was its too simple by half he reached for his coffee feeling a surge of satisfaction his hunch had been dead on whoever came up with this idea for an encryption must have been a fan of ancient greek history and a knowledgeable one what better cipher for project daedalus communiques than the language daedalus himself used theyd taken that fourthousandyearold tongue an archaic forerunner of ancient greek and then scrambled it using a mathematical algorithm mino industries was communicating with the soviets using an encoded version of minoan linear b it was absolutely poetic it also appeared upon first examination to be very naive yet upon reflection it turned out to be brilliant you convert a totally unheardof language to numbers throw in a few encryption tricks and the result is something that would drive all the hotdog desoriented supercomputers crazy all those chips would be trying trillions of keys when there actually was no key yes you had to admit it was inspired except the daedalus crowd was about to experience a problem a small headache make that a major headache because their secret protocol was about to become headlines he figured that ought to go a long way toward stopping any more shooting okay its humming she reached for her yogurt this time around all the garbage will be gone she took a bite then burst out laughing you know this is wonderful working with you darling ive just decided lets do something together maybe live on the ulysses for a while i might even get to like it it sounds romantic im still looking for the romance in life well love youve found it its me she leaned over and kissed him on the lips end of quest thought id never hear you say that but first you have to help me translate this im over a decade out of date my modern greeks a little rusty too and a lot of the technical terms in this look to be transliterated no sweetie thats not the first thing we have to do the first thing is to make sure youve got a separate copy of anything youre working with not in the computer ill spare you my horror stories about erased files hard disks going down all the rest she was rising energized cardinal computer rule number one always dupe anything youre working on no matter how sure you are nothing can go wrong believe me sounds good he looked up what are you doing i need that disk i showed you tonight we can use it for the backup its in my purse which i now realize i left in the car when i came in i was slightly crazy at the time she was turning god it seems like ages look why dont you let me you dont know where i parked it my secret hiding place maybe we ought to send zeno or adriana just sit tight only be a minute she wrapped her coat about her and before he could protest disappeared out the door humming she was a marvel everything hed remembered are you still awake zeno was trudging into the room still wearing his frayed nightshirt we just solved the riddle of the sphinx old friend except now we have to translate it you should be sleeping michael go now catch an hour or so i will start making arrangements get tickets for you both on the car ferry to athens a pistol maybe new passports if you want we have work to do he reached and took the cup of coffee adriana was urging on him all right as soon as she gets back what he froze then looked toward the back what do you mean i thought she was still asleep she went out to the car wherever it is i wish she had asked me i would have been happy you know how she is theres no stopping her when she gets rolling this is not good he turned and called to adriana to bring his trousers and shoes we must find her youre right it was stupid damned stupid he was getting up lets do it together chapter seven thursday am the morning air was sharp and she wished shed grabbed one of adrianas black knit shawls before going out could she pass for one of those stooped greek peasant women she wondered not likely she shivered and pulled her thin coat around her the rain was over now leaving the air moist and fragrant but the early morning gloom had an ominous undertone theyd found the key to open the first box but the message inside still had to be translated what was it what could possibly be in the protocol that would make somebody want to kill her she stared down the vacant street leading away from the square a mosaic of predawn shadows and tried to think alex novosty was the classic middleman that much was a given but then shed known that for years yes shed known about alex novosty all her lifehis work for the kgb his laundering of techmashimport funds she knew about it because they were second cousins fortunately their family tie was distant enough not to have made its way into nsas security file but around the russian expatriate dinner tables of brighton beach and oyster bay alex was very well known indeed he was the romanov descendant whod sold out to the soviets an unforgivable lapse of breeding but for all that he wasnt an assassin for him to do what hed done tonight could only mean one thing he was terrified very out of character but why the answer to that wasnt hard he must be mixed up in project daedalus whatever it was right up to his shifty eyeballs but what about michael what did alex want from him the answer to that could go a lot of ways when she first met michael vance jr shed been smitten by the fact he was so different always kidding around yet tough as steel when anybody crossed him a wasp street fighter she liked that a lot he was somebody she felt she could depend on no matter what she still remembered her first sight of mike as though it were yesterday she was taking notes on etruscan pottery in a black notebook standing in a corner of the yale art gallery on chapel street when she looked up andno it couldnt be she felt herself just gawking hed caught her look and strolled over with a puzzled smile is my tie crooked or then he laughed names mike vance i used to be part of this place how about you vance shed just kept on staring still not quite believing her eyes my thesis adviser at penn was you look just like him and he did the same sharp chin the same twinkle in the blue eyes even when he was angry as mike certainly had been that day he seemed to be having fun thus it began at first they were so right for each other it seemed as though shed known michael vance for approximately a hundred years give or take shed been one of his fathers many ardent disciples and after finishing her masters at penn shed gone on to become a doctoral candidate at yale where shed specialized in the linguistics of the ancient aegean languages shed known but forgotten that michael vance sr had a son who was finishing his own doctorate at yale writing a dissertation about minoan crete that day in the museum he was steaming declaring hed dropped by one last time as part of a ritualistic formal farewell to archaeology the decision was connected with the hostile reception being given a book hed just published a commercial version of his dissertation as of that day hed decided to tell academia to stuff it hed be doing something else for a living thered been feelers from some agency in dc about helping trace hot money in the brief weeks that followed they grew inseparable the perfect couple one weekend theyd scout the new england countryside for oldfashioned inns the next theyd drive up to boston to spend a day in the museum of fine arts then come back and argue and make love till dawn in her new haven apartment during all those days and nights she came very close to talking him out of quitting university life close but she didnt he had put off everything for a couple of months and they had traveled the worldlondon greece morocco moscow once their parents even met at count sergei borodins sprawling oyster bay home it was a convocation of the russian nobility association with three hundred guests in attendance and the air rang with russian songs and balalaikas michael vance sr who arrived in his natty bowler scarcely knew what to make of all the slavic exuberance shortly after that the intensity of michael became too much for her she felt herself being drawn into his orbit and she wanted an orbit of her own the next thing she knew hed departed for the caribbean her father had died and shed gone back to work on her own doctorate michael he was driven obsessive always determined to do what he wanted just as she was but the tension that likeness brought to their relationship those many years ago now made everything seem to click why she wondered maybe it was merely as simple as life cycles maybe back then they were just out of synch hed already survived his first midlife crisis even though he was hardly thirty when they split up shed been twentyfive and at the beginning of a campaign to test herself find out what she could do well she thought shed found out she was good very good so now what she was relieved to see the car was still parked on the side street actually a little alley where shed left it thinking more clearly now she realized shed been a trifle careless stashing the car in the first location she could find and then running for zenos as she headed down the alley in between the white plaster houses she suddenly felt her heart stop someone was standing next to the saab a dark figure waiting she watched as it suddenly moved briskly toward her alex novosty what she couldnt believe her eyes budetya ostorozhyi he whispered the warning as he raised his hand and furtively tried to urge her back kak shto she froze how did you find the car the hotel they directed us to a kafeneion near here but then i noticed your car i thought he moved out of the shadows quickly still speaking in russian just tell me where you have the copies of the protocol quickly maybe i can still handle it handle what thats when she saw the two other men in dark overcoats against the shadow of the building the situation his eyes were intense they want it back all copies ive tried to tell them that killing you wont solve anything but he glanced back with a small shiver you must tell them michael has a copy stall them its true he does no then say theres a copy back in your office just let me try and alex im not going to play any more of your games please he continued in a whisper dont contradict anything i say let me do the talking ill youre in it with them arent you she tried to push past well you can tell your friends were onto their project if anything happens to me michael will track them down and personally take them apart tell them that you dont understand he caught her arm one of their people was killed tonight the one trying to shoot michael and me you mean she was trying to calm the quaver in her voice he was killed by the kgb i had nothing to do with is that what you told them thats the way it happened there was an argument over what everybody wants you its the protocol his look darkened eva they are in no mood for niceties neither am i she noticed the two men were now moving toward them one was taller and seemed to be in charge but they both were carrying what looked like smallcaliber automatic weapons the protocol whatever it was was still in code she didnt know what she didnt know how could she bargain it was too late to think about it now their faces were hard and smooth with the cold eyes of men who killed on command my god she thought what had michael said about the minogumi the japanese mob the taller man she was soon to learn was kazuo ina gawa who had been a londonbased kobun for the minogumi for the past decade he had a thin pasty face and had once been first kobun for their entire osaka organization in charge of gambling and nightclub shakedowns even in the early dawn light he wore sunglasses masking his eyes the shorter one was takahashi takenaka whose pockmarked face was distinguished by a thin moustache an aquiline nose and the same sunglasses alex she realized must have lied to them covering up what really happened out at the palace now he was bluffing for his life you can just tell them i dont know anything about it she felt the cold air closing in eva thats impossible they know you were given the protocol now where is it he clearly wanted her to say it was somewhere else but why bother its in the car in my purse she pointed why dont they just go ahead and take it by the way its still encrypted she fumbled in her pockets heres then she realized shed left the key in the car there it dangled inside the locked door her purse rested on the seat across from the drivers side get it inagawa commanded his lieutenant takenaka bowed obediently then turned and tried the door handle without success so he frowned inagawa muttered a curse and brutally slammed the butt of his automatic against the curved window the sound of splintering glass rent the morning air quickly novosty stepped forward and reached through to unlock the door then he pulled it open and leaned in why is he doing it she wondered easy answer hes trying to keep control of the situation whose side is he really on then he backed out and handed her the brown leather purse while he tried to catch her eye she took it snapped it open and lifted out the gray computer disk there she said as she handed it to inagawa whatevers on it youll have to figure it out for yourself that cant be the only one novosty sputtered surely there are other copies thats it sweetheart inagawa turned it in his hand then passed it to takenaka and said something in japanese the other man took it then barked hai and bowed lightly are you sure this is the only copy inagawa asked the only one he nodded to his lieutenant who began screwing a dark silencer onto the barrel of his automatic oh my god she thought theyre going to finish the job wait novosty reached for his arm shes lying this is a disk from a computer there must be other copies yes she was finally coming to her senses there are plenty of other copies in my computer in where is it inagawa looked at her itsits at the hotel the galaxy she was trying desperately to think and then i left another youre lying we have been there they said a tavern keeper came and took all your luggage he was staring down the street toward zenos place they also told us where he could be found we will go there now my friends novosty interrupted again it would be most unwise to attempt any violence on a greek national here the consequences could be extremely awkward for all of us we must retrieve it but why not do it the easy way he tried to smile theres another man here traveling with her we should work through him i know he will deal hes a professional who is he an american if we hold her keep her alive we can use her to make him bring it to us we can offer a trade no we will just find him and take it inagawa started to move now hes armed my friends novosty continued evenly hes also experienced there would be gunfire i promise you if that happened you could have the entire street here filled with rifles in a minute you do not know these people as i do they still remember world war two and the resistance killing unfriendly foreigners became a way of life some of them have yet to forget alex is bluffing she thought again michael doesnt have a gun does zeno who knows let me try and talk to him novosty continued surely something can be worked out you will stay here with us inagawa seized his arm then turned and began a heated exchange with his partner again takenaka bowed repeatedly sucking in his breath and muttering hai at last they seemed to arrive at a consensus though it was the taller man whod actually made the decision whatever it was she comes with us oh no i dont she looked at novosty who seemed defeated then back at the japanese she suddenly realized she was on her own novosty had played all his cards if i dont reappear in washington day after tomorrow youll have the entire us national security agency looking for me people know im here so think about that that is not our concern inagawa reached for her we do not work for the american government then he turned to novosty tell your friend that this woman will be released when we have all copies of the protocol all do you understand but how can i tell him if you wont let me that is your problem perhaps perhaps we should just leave a message here novosty sputtered im sure hell find the car alex im not going anywhere with these animals she drew back dont worry ill take care of everything no im not that was all she could say before a hand was roughly clapped against her mouth her body shoved against the broken window mike vance and zeno stantopoulos searched for over half an hour before they found the saab when they did the lefthand window was broken and evas purse was missing she was missing too the only thing remaining was a hastily scrawled note from alex novosty chapter eight saturday pm vance the portly balding desk clerk studied his computer screen at the athenaeum intercontinental here in this teeming marble lobby the new world met the old dr m vance yes we have your reservation good novosty had done exactly what he said the play was going down welcome back the man looked up and smiled his eyes mirroring the green numbers on the screen as he looked over vances shoulder our records show you were just with us four days ago we still have your old room if you like that would be fine he was back in a city renowned as much for its hospitality as for its mindnumbing brown haze of smog it was also said to be the safest city in europe with a miniscule crime rate however michael vance did not feel safe as he stood in the lobby of athenss most luxurious hotel were you on a bus tour of the peloponnisos perhaps the clerk continued with a pale smile his voice trying for perfunctory brightness the mycenean ruins in the south are always business vance tossed his passport onto the counter they both knew he didnt look anything like a candidate for a fourday chat package tour on a bus but the man seemed nervous anxious to make conversation ill be needing a car in the morning early is that in your reservation file too no problem the clerk ignored or missed his impatient tone we have a hertz outlet now just over there he pointed next to the travel desk im sure they will be happy to arrange for it vance tossed his amex card onto the counter then reached for the slate clipboard holding the registration slip dusk was falling outside but here in the warm glow of chandeliers the moment felt like sleepwalking his mental bearings kept shifting nothing was real he wanted to think it was merely routine like checking into a thousand other streamlined international hotels something hed done more times than he cared to count but that was wrong danger lurked somewhere nearby his senses were warning him he kept thinking about eva was she serious about getting back together sailing on the ulysses maybe he didnt know her as well as he thought which was troubling for a lot of reasons not the least being that right now he needed to be able to think exactly the way she did theyd have to work as a perfectly coordinated team tomorrow with no rehearsals may i have someone take your bag the clerk glanced down at the new leather suitcase sitting on the floor then reached to ring for a bellhop no vance lunged to stop his hand whoa he lectured himself chill out keep the lid on why not just let it happen here maybe you want them to do it here why wait the clerk tried to hold his composure as you wish of course you know your room i can find it he tried to smile then thumbed over his shoulder youre busy anyway the tour coming in yes the clerk was shoving across the heavy brass key you remember our schedule breakfast is served until ten over there in the dining room eleven in your room thanks he picked up the bag heavy and turned the rental car desk was across the lobby past the tour group now pouring through the revolving doors they clearly were just off a paris flight chattering in french brandishing tour badges and quarreling about luggage with gallic impatience i need a car for tomorrow early the darkhaired woman at the desk looked up as he began fishing for his credit card and drivers license her hertz uniform was unbuttoned down the front to display as much of her bosom as greek propriety perhaps even the law would permit a heavy silver chain nestled between her ample breasts our pleasure she swept back her hair as she mechanically shoved forward a typed sheet encased in smudged cellophane we have some new austin subcompacts or if you want a fullsize whats the best car youve got it would be a long drive over uncertain greek roads he wanted to take no chances we do have an alfa sir only one a milano she absently adjusted the vneck of her uniform for vips i should warn you its expensive she bent forward to whisper to tell you the truth ine poli akrivo its a rip off she leaned back proud of her new american slang take my advice and can you have it here out front at six in the morning i can check she sniffed then reached for the battered phone a quick exchange in greek followed then she hung up they say it just came in there should be no problem he glanced around the lobby once more as she picked up the charge card and license to begin filling out the form there was still no sign no indication and yet the whole scene felt wrong something something was warning him thats what it was the man standing across the lobby at the far side next to the elevators he had a newspaper folded in his hand but he wasnt reading he was speaking into it hotel security not a chance for one thing he wasnt greek although he was too far away to see his face something about the way he stood gave him away where the hell was novosty this wasnt supposed to be the drill he suddenly found himself wondering how much clout alex had left maybe novosty was out of the play maybe the rules had changed could you please hurry that along he turned back to the darkhaired girl you said you wouldnt be needing the car until tomorrow sir formal now abrupt i just changed my mind id like it tonight right now as a matter of fact do you want the insurance it will be an extra no yes look i dont care just let me sign that damned thing and give me the keys well give me a chance she petulantly turned the form toward him and shoved it across the desk if youll just initial here and here she was pointing with her pen and sign there and did you say you wanted the car now immediately im afraid thats not possible she retrieved the form what its just then give me something else he glanced toward the man still speaking into his newspaper then back they would make their move any second now whats the problem with the car im trying to tell you it just came in our people will need at least half an hour to clean it go over the checklist so if youd like to have a cup of coffee in the dining room ill call you when where is it now they said its just been returned its probably parked somewhere outside she gestured toward the glass revolving door across the street thats where they usually an alfa thats right dark blue but like i said its not give me the keys theyre probably still in it our people thanks he reached down for the suitcase your card sir and your license she pushed the items across with a tight smile clearly happy to be rid of him as he reached for them out of the corner of his eye he saw the first movement the man had stuffed the newspaper and walkietalkie into his trench coat and was approaching across the marble lobby just as vance expected the garb was polyester the hair a slickedup punchperm but he still couldnt make out the face he didnt need to he knew who they were the encounter at knossos flashed through his mind they know ive got a copy of their protocol and until that gets iced theres always a chance their secret is no longer a secret but they cant know weve cracked the encryption unless she told them which she never would no they couldnt know that yet which meant he still had the bargaining chip hed need except for one problem they were about to try and break the rules just like the old days maybe theyd forgot he knew how to break rules too as he pushed through the milling crowd of french tourists suitcases and knapsacks piling up near the entrance he sensed the man was gaining but only a few feet more and hed be at the revolving door halfway home this wasnt going to be easy thered be a backup probably just outside at the entrance as he reached for the rubber flange of the revolving door he knew the man was just behind him maybe two steps just right he turned to see a hand emerge from the polyester suit jacket grasping a heckler amp koch ka machine pistol a cutdown version of the mp the barrel was rising the hard face closing in but it was the suitcase he wanted so why not give it to him here he jammed his foot into the revolving door leaving a small opening then wheeled around hoisting the case the quick turn brought just enough surprise to break his attackers momentum as the man involuntarily raised his left hand vance caught his right wrist just back of the pistols grip and shoved it forward into the door then he brought up his elbow and smashed it into the attackers jaw as the man groaned he caught his other wrist and shoved him around now he rammed his shoulder against the revolving door closing it and wedging the gun inside lets keep this simple okay no muss no fuss he threw his full weight against the mans body bending him back around the curved metal and glass of the door there was a snap and a muted groan as the wrist bones shattered the machine pistol clattered to the marble floor inside the circular enclosure sorry about that before the attacker could regain his balance he kneed him into the next revolving partition and rammed it closed only one foot remained outside kicking at an awkward angle across the floor now wheres the other one he glanced around as he drew away theres sure to be two somebody was on the other end of that radio novosty did he set this up he swept up the suitcase and shouldered his way through the auxiliary door on the side odd but the scuffle had gone unnoticed amid the din of the arriving tour or maybe parisians werent ruffled by anything so everyday as an attempted murder now what as he emerged onto the street he saw what he was looking for the other assailant was waiting just across the wide entryway past the jumble of bellboys taxi drivers and the last straggle of tourists coming off the bus their eyes met and the mans right hand darted inside his dark suit jacket use the crowd vance thought enough handtohand heroics these guys mean business since the pile of luggage coming off the bus separated them he had an advantage now if only for a second or so without thinking he seized the straps of a canvas knapsack sitting on the sidewalk with his free hand and flung it with all his strength it caught his attacker squarely in the chest breaking his rhythm and knocking him back half a step it was only a moments reprieve but it was all vance needed to disappear around the rear of the bus which was pouring black exhaust into the evening air blocking all view of the avenue maybe he could move fast enough to just disappear as he dashed into the honking traffic headlights half blinding him he surveyed the street opposite looking for the alfa there no there a pair of headlights swerved by inches away accompanied by honking and a cursing greek driver only a few feet more now and hed be across there a blue alfa it had to be the one but it was already moving its front wheels turning inward as the hertz attendant backed it around to begin pulling out he wrenched open the door and seized a brown sleeve the arm inside belonged to a young greek barely twenty his uniform greasecovered and wrinkled he looked up surprise in his eyes and grabbed for the door handle change of plans vance heard the alfas bumper slam against the car parked behind as the startled attendants foot brushed against the accelerator den katalaveno out vance yanked him around and shoved him toward the asphalt pavement and stay down now the bus had begun pulling out from the entryway across the street although traffic still clogged the avenue he was a clear target he threw the suitcase onto the seat then slid in and reached to secure the door as he pulled it shut he heard the ping of a bullet ricochetting off metal somewhere next came a burst of automatic fire that seemed to splatter all around him the young greek pulled himself up off the pavement and reached down vance waved him away as he shifted the transmission into drive at that moment a slug caught the young attendant in the shoulder spinning him around he gave a yelp of surprise then stumbled backward but now he was out of the way clear with what was probably only a flesh wound vance shoved his foot against the accelerator ramming the rear fender of the car in front then again knocking it clear another spray of bullets spattered through the back window as he pulled into the flow of traffic your time will come friend he told himself tomorrow by god we finish this little dance he finally became aware of the pumping of his own heart as he made his way north up syngrou avenue trying to urge the traffic forward by sheer will the thing now was to get out of athens take leoforos athinon west then head up the new highway toward the mountains lose them in the country find some place to spend the night his final destination was only about two hundred kilometers away he just had to be fresh and ready tomorrow with everything in place but at least he now knew the game had no rules maybe knowing that gave him an edge and so far his timing was still intact hed handled it maybe not too well maybe with too much risk but hed handled it novostys note had said there would be a straight swap but the other team clearly had no intention of bothering with niceties fine that cut both ways sunday am the place was delphi the location novosty had specified heading warily up the sacred way vance paused for a moment to take in the view from where he stood the vista was majestic overwhelming humanitys puny scale hed always loved it toward the north the sheer granite cliffs of the phaedriades mountains towered almost two thousand feet skyward to form a semicircular barrier while down below the river pleistos meandered through mile after mile of dark olive groves it was an eyeful of rugged grandeur craggy peaks encircling a harsh plain that stretched as far as the eye could see greece in the midday sun austere timeless his destination the ancient temple of the delphic oracle farther up the hill overlooked this panorama row center in a magnificient natural amphitheater the greek legends told that the great god zeus had once dispatched two eagles one flying east and one flying west to find out where they would meet they came together at the center of the earth delphi whose main temple the sanctuary of apollo contained the domelike boulder omphalos thereafter named the navel of the world here east and west met hed parked the alfa on the roadway down below and now as he stared up the mountainside past the conical cypress trees he could just make out the remains of the stone temple where almost three thousand years ago the priestess the delphic oracle screamed her prophesies she was a pythia an ancient woman innocent of mind who lived in the depths of the temple next to a fiery altar whose flame was attended night and day there perched on a high tripod poised over a vaporous fissure in the earth she inhaled intoxicating gases chewed laurel leaves and issued wild frenzied utterances those incoherent sounds were translated by priests into answers appropriate to the queries set before her delphi he loved its remote setting its sacred legends those stories in fact told that the god apollo had once summoned priests from crete the ancient font of culture to come here to create this holy of holies was he about to become a priest too after sending off a telegram to the stuttgart team notifying them of a delay in his schedule hed journeyed from that island back to athens via the anek lines overnight car ferry from iraklion not at all godlike but it had a wellworn forward section it called first class and it was a lowprofile mode of travel requiring no identity questions hed ended up in the bar of the tourist section for much of the trip stretched out on a stained couch and napping intermittently during the twelvehour voyage it had cleared his mind then from piraeus the port of athens hed taken a cab into the city after that the hotel and the car as he stared up the hill he had in his possession a wallet with nine hundred american dollars and eighty thousand greek drachmas the suitcase and a spanish mm automatic from zeno he also had a translated version of the opening section of the protocol his anger still simmering he continued up the cobbled path of the sacred way toward the exposed remains of the oracles temple situated halfway up the hill nothing was left of the structure now except its stone floor and a few columns that had been reerected standing bare and wistful in the sunshine in fact the only building at delphi that had been rebuilt to anything resembling its original glory was the small marble treasure house of the athenians a showplace of that citys wealth dating from bc today its simple white blocks glistened in the harsh midday glare while tourists milled around speaking german french english or dutch even in the simmering heat of noon delphi still attracted visitors who revered the ancient greeks as devoutly as those greeks had once worshipped their own adulterous gods and goddesses so where the hell was novosty noon at the temple of apollo his note had said he searched the hillside looking for telltale signs of another ambushmovement color anything but there was nothing although tourists wandered about the temple ruins seemed abandoned for thousands of years their silence almost palpable even the sky was empty save for a few swooping hawks if alex is here waiting he asked himself where would he be then he looked again at the treasure house of course probably in there taking a little respite from the blistering sun it figured the front its columns and porch were open and the interior would be protected conveniently the wide steps of the stone pathway led directly past a natural rendezvous in his belt under his suede jacket was zenos mm llama it was fully loaded with fifteen rounds in the magazine plus one up the tube he reached into his belt and eased off the safety holding it beneath his coat he continued on up the cobbled pathway toward the front of the treasure house as he moved into the shade of the portico he thought for a moment he heard sounds from inside he stopped gripping the llama and listened no nothing slowly carefully he walked up the steps when he reached the top he paused then gingerly stepped in through the open doorway it was cool and dank inside and empty his footsteps rang hollow on the stone floor maybe novostys dead by now he thought fleetingly maybe his luck finally ran out he turned and walked back out to the porch then settled himself on the steps in the valley below beyond the milling tourists the dark green olive groves spread out toward the horizon the protocol the mindboggling protocol something was afoot that would change the balance of world power hed translated the first page of article i but it had raised more questions than it answered all the same hed taken action today he was ready novosty had to know the score had to but now vance knew at least part of the story too he glanced down at the suitcase it contained evas zenith turbo of course which undoubtedly was why it was such a popular item but it also had a hard copy of the scrambled text of the protocol courtesy of a printer zeno had borrowed from a newspaper office in iraklion as well as a photocopy of vances partial translation they didnt know it yet but there was another full copy which hed transmitted by datanet to his office computer in nassau it was waiting there in the silicon memory quite a document twentyeight pages in length it was the final version of a legally binding agreement that had been hammered out over a long period of time from the page hed translated he could recognize the style the text referred to the rights and obligations of two distinct entitiesthe union of soviet socialist republics and mino industries group as he seated himself beneath a lone almond tree and took a last look at the olive groves down below he was tempted to pull out the translation and reread it one more time but that was unnecessary hed memorized it right down to the last comma article i for the full and complete compensation of one hundred million american dollars to be deposited in the shokin gaigoku bank of tokyo on or before may mino industries group will legally transfer to the ussr full ownership of one operational prototype this transfer to be executed on the agreed date may mayday at the time of this transfer the prototype will satisfy all technical performance criteria enumerated in document a specifications the ussr may thereafter at its discretion contract for production models at the price specified in document j upon the ussr having satisfied the terms stipulated in article ii mino industries group will extend the ussr financial credits in the amount of five hundred billion american dollars such credits to be provided in increments of one hundred billion dollars annually for a period of five years these credits will be arranged through vneshekonombank the bank for foreign economic affairs article iv within one year of the satisfaction of all formalities pursuant to the abovedesignated credits the ussr will thats as far as hed translated the rest was still in minoan linear b he took a deep breath again trying to digest what it meant in the grand scheme of global strategic alliances most importantly what was the prototype something was about to appear on the planet that would make its owner unassailable but what evas stumbled onto dynamite mayday that means it explodes in less than a fortnight no wonder mino industries wants her out of the way among the clusters of tourists on the road below a white limousine was pulling to a stop followed by a gray saab he watched as novosty emerged from the saab and glanced up the hill then started the climb nobody got out of the limo vance watched as he slowly made his way along the cobbled path leading up the hill puffing he was almost out of breath by the time he reached the top michael im so glad you could manage to make it he heaved a sigh as he trudged up the last remaining steps it was the lure of your scintillating company im sure he looked around is eva down there shed damned well better be she is safe novosty sighed again it was most unwise for her to have gotten involved in all this michael she is making matters difficult for us all too bad he removed the llama from beneath his coat by the way congratulations on your new clients mino industries thats a yakuza front partner guess you know the ceo was a class a war criminal these days he owns the ldp and runs japan alex you asshole youre way over your head here mino industries is owned lock stock and hardware by the japanese godfather his kobun make your kgb look like a boy scout troop michael please and here i was thinking youd finished consorting with the criminal element decided to live clean then the next thing i know your clients gorillas are trying to kill eva and me me your new partner things like that tend to inspire mistrust and just when we were starting to hit it off so well he finally stood up holding the llama novosty was lounging nervously in the sunshine fishing for a cigarette wheres your uzi you just may need it michael all this has nothing to do with me his eyes were weary im operating independently this time cash and carry maybe you should just post your prices like a cheap cathouse i prefer to think of myself as an expediter but this time i encountered more difficulties than reasonably could be anticipated which is why i need your help now to straighten it out what the whole shoddy scene looks like the kgbs hot on the trail say maybe about two feet in back of your ass or is it your client who youre about to try and screw out of a hundred million dollars incidentally thats probably a serious miscalculation healthwise the situation has grown awkward of course that touching fable about returning the hundred million to moscow was just the usual disinformation you are perfectly correct it will not be returned but any thought i might have had of keeping it now also seems out of the question he sighed instead im afraid we must we now thats what i call balls of brass he laughed surely even a fevered imagination like yours cant suppose michael i told you i would split the commission i took for cleaning it that offer still holds fiftyfifty i might even go sixtyforty what more can you want but those funds must be delivered given the new situation not by me be a realist my friend i no longer have freedom of movement so now you are my only hope if those funds arent transferred within the week id prefer not to reflect on the consequences the consequences to your own neck you mean vance stared at him by the way just out of curiosity whats the prototype thats the one thing i cannot possibly discuss michael novosty caught his breath but what if the contract for it is abrogated because of those funds not being delivered what then what if the ussr just makes a move to seize it i fear there could be war my friend bang the apocalypse he flicked his lighter even worse though as you say both parties to the agreement would probably spend a week devising the most interesting way possible for me to depart this earth if the kgb somehow locates and freezes the embezzled funds before you can finish transferring them it could scuttle the whole deal mino industries would probably be very annoyed not to mention certain parties back home precisely you can see we are on a knife edge here but first things first you must return evas pirate copy of the protocol please i beg you it must disappear i have promised them that as an act of good faith im afraid the participants in tokyo are near to losing patience with me and what about her shes with them now he pointed down the hill to the long white limousine unfortunately they have taken over the situation better buckle your seat belt pal its about to be a bumpy afternoon she is safe dont worry they have assured me it is only the protocol they care about the matter of security they know you have her only other copy in the computer now please let me just give whatever you have to them then lets all try and forget she ever had it you know those hoods down there tried a little number on me last night in athens he hadnt moved it took the edge off my evening michael i tried to tell them that was imprudent but they are very concerned about time just be reasonable my friend and im sure everything can be straightened out he sighed again you know these tactics of kidnapping and such are very distasteful to me as well but when she told them she didnt have all the material that you still had a copy they decided that taking her into their custody was the best way to ensure your cooperation they dont know me very well he looked down the hill tell your buddies they can go take a jump nobody blackmails me nobody i plan to hang on to this little suitcase till shes out of danger thats how were going to work things tell them its her insurance they release her right now or ill personally blow their whole deal sky high tell them yourself michael im just here as an observer he gestured toward the white limo parked below nestled in among the line of tourist automobiles and busses and while youre doing that perhaps you should ask her if thats her wish as well they refuse to release her until they recover the materials she had they are calling it protection he stared down youve got a hell of a nerve all of you alex when this is over please lets just get this ghastly protocol affair sorted out he rubbed at his beard then we can all concern ourselves with whats really important the money right i almost forgot he scanned the hillside was everything set hed seen no sign but then thats how it was supposed to be the other problem was the tourists everywhere complicating the play but maybe the tourists would be a help would make it start out slow think how can you use them clearly the other side had hoped for an abandoned place in the middle of nowhere they had to be off balance now too he hesitated a moment then decided go for it he had the llama just settle it here and now he took one last look at the temple as he rose the delphic oracle thats what eva had been all along shed somehow divined the outlines of the story but after the disappearance of her old lover at the nsa she didnt dare speak it directly everything was coded language so what better place than here on this mountain to finally have a little plain talk as they passed down the last stone steps leading to the roadway he found himself thinking about mino industries did they really have half a trillion dollars lying around not likely to come up with that kind of money even in japan youd have to be deeply plugged into legitimate financial circlespension funds insurance companies brokerage houses banks all the rest but still the minogumi had connections that went wide and deep everywhere their oyabun tanzan mino had been in the game for a long long time now as he approached the limousine one of its white doors slowly began to open then a japanese emerged dressed in a black polyester suit he wore dark sunglasses and his right wrist was in a cast the eyes were very familiar also one of his little fingers was missing but vances gaze didnt linger long on the hands his attention was riveted on what was in them yep hed seen it right last night it was a heckler amp koch machine pistol one of those could lay down all thirty rounds in an eight inch group at thirty yards worldclass hardware it figured the minogumi was known everywhere as the bestrun yakuza syndicate of them all hardened criminals they considered themselves modernday samurai upholding some centuriesold code of honor it was a contradiction only the japanese mind could fully accommodate heavyduty connections vance told himself the very best which meant novosty was in even bigger trouble than he probably imagined the latest rumor in the world of hot money was that tanzan mino and his yakuza had through dummy fronts just bought up half of hawaii if that were true it meant he laundered real money these days who the hell needed a smalltime operator like alex then the man reached in and caught evas arm pulling her into the midday glare thank god he thought she still looks vaguely okay will she be able to stay on top of this once it gets moving he noticed she was wearing a new brown dress but her short hair was tangled her face streaked with pain the bastards they must have worked her over trying to find out everything she knew there were two representatives novosty had said so the other man was still in the limo in the drivers seat covering in case there was trouble good move because there was definitely going to be trouble a lot of it tanzan minos goons were about to have all the trouble they could handle michael oh christ she finally recognized him thank god just give them can you understand whats going on here he raised his hand these guys are kobun professional hit men they have a very sick sense of humor they also have no intention of please they have given me their word novosty interrupted him then glanced back you can see she is well she didnt look well at all she seemed drugged standing shakily in the brilliant sunshine a glazed stare from her eyes hands twisting at her skirt eva eva he thought what did they do to you whatever it was it worked you look defeated helpless michael just let them have the computer she spoke again her voice quivering they say its all they want then theyll eva its all a lie the big lie so just lighten up and enjoy this were not giving them so much as the time of day until they let you go first tell me how badly did they rough you up i want to know michael please you will be happy to learn that dr michael vance is a specialist in international finance novosty interrupted addressing the tall japanese he has kindly offered to serve as my agent in completing the final arrangements for the transfer of funds from london he will resolve any remaining difficulties as i said he is my agent and it is important that he not be harmed alex back off i havent agreed to anything vance turned to the japanese hows the arm hope the damage wasnt permanent where are the nsa materials the man ignored vances question his voice was sharp and his english almost perfect that is our first order of business right here he lifted the suitcase i assume were all going to deal honorably for a change eva first then we talk about this im sure dr vance has brought everything you want novosty added quickly glancing over perhaps if he gave the materials to you now the woman could be released then he and i can proceed immediately with the matter of the funds you are not involved the japanese snapped back we have been authorized to personally handle this breach of security he stared at novosty the funds in fact were your sole responsibility they were to have been transferred to shokin gaigoku bank in tokyo over a week ago you demanded an exorbitant commission and you did not deliver consequently you will return that commission and our london oyabun will handle it himself the minogumi probably should have handled it in the first place vance thought fieetingly alex was definitely out of his depth just a couple of days more novosty went pale i thought i had explained your explanations are not adequate the man cut him off then pointed to the suitcase in vances hand now give us that why not he settled the brown leather case onto the asphalt its good business always to check out the merchandise make sure its what youre paying for she said it was a portable computer the man walked over then cradled the h ampk automatic in his bandaged arm while he reached down to loosen the straps next he pulled the zipper around and laid open the case what is this he lifted out the pile of printed paper guess she forgot to tell you we cracked the encryption i thought maybe youd like to have a printed version so i threw one in for free he stared at it a second almost disbelieving then looked up this is a photocopy where is the original original you mean thats not vanced looked at it gee my mistake guess i must have left it somewhere sorry you had to drive all the way out here from athens for nothing jesus michael eva blurted dont start playing games with them theyll i need all the copies the mans voice hardened menacingly where are they i dont remember precisely tell you what though you put her on a plane back to the states and maybe my recollection might start improving we are wasting time the door by the steering wheel opened and the second kobun emerged also carrying an automatic he was shorter but the punchperm hair and polyester suit appeared to have come from standard issue just like the sunglasses he gestured his weapon toward vance there is a simple way to improve your memory you have exactly ten seconds my friend be reasonable novosty interrupted his voice still trying for calm there are people here he motioned toward the crowd of gathering tourists from their puzzled stares they seemed to be thinking they were witnessing a rehearsal for some greek gangster film the first man motioned his partner back then turned to vance you realize we will be forced to kill her right now if you dont produce all originals and copies dont really think you want to do that vance stared at him because if anything happens to her youre going to be reading about your prototype all over the american newspapers i can probably even swing some primetime tv time for you ill take care of it personally no one will believe you dont think so my guess is the washington post will run your entire protocol on page one ill see they get a very literal translation into english then you wont need this you can just buy all the copies you want he picked up the laptop and walked over to where eva was standing here take this and get back in the car now i think these guys have got an attitude problem so screw them michael she reached for the computer get in that one he pointed toward alexs gray saab and take the next plane out of greece that place we talked about anywhere just go were getting nowhere the second man barked again then he leveled his automatic at vances right knee and clicked off the safety there was a gasp from the gawking tourists and the crowd began stumbling backward for cover we have ways of extracting information oh shit he thought whoa the mans voice suddenly trailed off while a quizzical expression spread through his eyes and a red spot appeared on his cheek next his head jerked back and his automatic slammed against the car door then clattered across the asphalt not a second too soon vance thought no eva screamed whats happening she lurched backward then turned and stumbled for the saab carrying the computer the first kobun glanced around then raised the h ampk in his left hand trying to get a grip hell hit the ground and roll vance thought like any pro under fire and he did exactly that with a quick motion over onto his back and then to his feet again clicking off the safety as he came up you want to kill us both vance was holding his llama now trained on the sunglasses that had been crushed by the roll momentarily distorting the mans line of fire then go for it he squeezed the trigger the walnut stock kicked slightly but he just kept gripping the satin chrome trigger now the gunmans automatic came around its muzzle erupting in flame the crowd scattered shouting in half a dozen languages terrified vance just kept firing dull thunks into the figure stumbling backward as the h ampk machine pistol erupted spasmodically into the hot dry air kill him michael oh god yes the bastards eva was still yelling as she slammed shut the door of the saab yelling cursing screaming less than a second later the motor roared to life now novosty was diving across the pavement toward the open front door of the limousine michael weve got to split up get out he yelled over his shoulder ill have to go to london now theres nowhere left theyre going to come for the money vance scarcely heard him as he held the llama steady and kept on squeezing until the magazine was empty and only vacant clicks coursed through his hand the screech of tires brought him back he looked up to see the white limousine careening along the edge of the road barely avoiding the ditch its door still open novosty at the wheel eva was already gone he noticed that theyd removed the plates from the limousine just as hed done on his rented alfa there would be nothing but terrified tourists and two illegally armed very dead japanese hoods here when the greek police finally arrived the story would come out in a babel of languages and be totally inconsistent christ he thought it was supposed to be over by now and instead its just beginning when word of this gets back to tokyo lifes going to get very interesting very fast the minogumi knows how to play for keeps weve got to blow this thing across on the hot asphalt the two japanese were sprawled askew sunglasses crumpled one body was bleeding profusely from the chest the other from a single perfect hole in the cheek the kobun who had come within moments of removing his kneecaps now lay with a small hole in front of one ear and the opposite side of the face half missing what a shot but why did he wait so long we had them in the clear i see now why the greek resistance scared hell out of never look at the eyes michael the voice sounded from the boulders of the hillside above where the muzzle of a world war ii german carbine oiled and perfect glinted remember i told you it gives you very bad dreams book two chapter nine monday am the massive hulk of daedalus i was being towed slowly through the hangar doors now open to their full foot span as it rolled out the titaniumcomposite skin glistened in the fluorescent lights of the hangar then acquired a ghostly glow under the pale moonlight first came the pensharp nose containing the navigational gear radar and video cameras for visible light and infrared next the massive ramjetscramjets six beneath each sweptback blunt wing and finally the towering tail assembly twin vertical stabilizers positioned high and outboard to avoid blanketing from the fuselage the towtruck drivers and watching technicians all thought it was the most beautiful creation they had ever seen this would be yuri androvs last scheduled test flight before he took the vehicle hypersonic in four more days he wore a full pressure suit and an astronautstyle lifesupport unit rested next to him as he finished adjusting the cockpit seat he monitored the rollout on his liquid crystal helmet screens calling up the visual display that provided pretakeoff and lineup checks of the instruments not surprisingly the numbers were nominalall hydraulic pressures stable all temperatures ambient as usual the japanese technicians had meticulously executed their own preflight prep poring over the vehicle with their computerized checklists everything was in the green all the same this moment always brought a guttightening blend of anticipation and fear this was the part he dreaded most in any test flightwhen he was strapped in the cockpit but without operational control he lived by control and this was one of the few times when he knew he had none it fed all the adrenaline surging through him pressed his nerves to the limit he flipped a switch under his hand and displayed the infrared cameras on his helmet screens then absently monitored the massive white trucks towing him onto the darkened tarmac the landing lights along the runway were off they would be switched on only for final approach when guided by the radar installation their focused beams would be invisible outside a hundredyard perimeter of the nose cameras the asphalt beneath him swept by the freezing winds of hokkaido was a special synthetic carefully camouflaged he knew it well two nights earlier hed come out here to have a talk with the project kurirovat ivan semenovich lemontov the lean and wily soviet officerincharge formerly that post had belonged to the cpsus official spy but now party control was supposed to be a thing of the past so what was he doing here whatever it was the isolated landing strip had seemed the most secure place for some straight answers as they strolled in the moonlight the harsh gale off the straits cutting into their skin hed demanded lemontov tell him what was really going on by the time they were finished hed almost wished he hadnt asked yuri andreevich on this project you are merely the test pilot your job is to follow orders lemontov had paused to light a russian cigarette cupping his hands against the wind to reveal his thin foxlike face he was a hardliner left over from the old days and occasionally it still showed strategic matters should not concern you i was brought in late only four months ago after the prototypes were ready for initial flight testing but if im flying the daedalus then i want to know its ultimate purpose the truth nobodys told me anything the only thing im sure of is that all the talk about nearspace research is bullshit which means im being used he had caught lemontovs arm and drew him around the officers eyes were half hidden in the dark now dammit i want to know what in hell is the real purpose of this vehicle lemontov had grunted then pulled away and drew on his cigarette finally he spoke yuri andreevich sometimes its wiser to leave strategy to the professionals you do your job and ill do mine yuri remembered how hed felt his anger boil hed begun to suspect that certain cpsu hardliners like lemontov together with the military or the kgb had their own plans for the vehicle but what were they up to look im doing my job so how about a little openness a little glasnost this is not supposed to be like the old days lemontov had drawn a few paces ahead on the tarmac walking briskly with the quick energy that had brought him to his powerful party post finally hed slowed and waited for yuri to catch up he had made a decision and he had made it quickly that was characteristic yuri andreevich in a way you represent part of our technology exchange with mino industries you have an indispensible role to play here this whole program depends on you im well aware of that however it hadnt answered his questions then you should also be aware of something else this undertaking is a small but highly crucial part of something much larger nothing less than the fate of the soviet union in the next century rests on whether project daedalus succeeds what do you mean yuri had watched him walk on feeling his own impatience growing lemontov had turned back again brusquely this hypersonic spacecraft is the symbol the flagship of a new soviet alliance with the most technologically advanced nation on earth even a flyboy like you should be able to grasp that through this alliance we eventually will find a way to tap all of japans new technology the world of the futureadvanced semiconductors robots biotechnology superconductivity all of itis going to be controlled by japan and we must have access to it yuri had listened in silence once more feeling he was being fed halftruths then lemontov lowered his voice yuri andreevich by forming what amounts to a strategic alliance with mino industries we will achieve two objectives we will gain access to japanese technology and capital to rejuvenate soviet industry and placate our people and we will strike a preemptive blow against the peril of a new china on our borders in the next century china yuri had studied him startled my friend dont be fooled by summits and talks of reconciliation neither we nor china care a kopeck about the other think about it in the long run china can only be our nightmare if america had to look across its canadian border and see china they too would be terrified china has the numbers and soon the technology to threaten us its the worst nightmare you or i could ever have lemontov had paused to crush out his cigarette grinding it savagely into the asphalt we must prepare for it now the hardliners have just found a new enemy yuri had realized the cold war lives like it or not lemontov had continued and just between us im not sure i do like it we have no choice but to turn to japan in order to have an ally in asia to counter the new frightening specter of a hostile china rising up on our flank so how does daedalus figure into all this as i said it is the first step in our new alliance from now on our space programs will be united as one he had sighed into the icy wind it will be our mutual platform for nearearth space exploration with only peaceful intent yuri had tried to study his eyes but the dark obscured them ive told you all you need to know a match had flared again as he lit another cigarette in the tiny blaze of light he gave a small wink even though the daedalus could easily be converted to a firststrike platform we naturally have no intention of outfitting these prototypes or later production models for any such purpose the japanese would never agree what had he been saying that the hardliners were planning to seize the vehicles and retrofit them as first strike bombers maybe even make a preemptive strike against china were they planning to doublecross the japanese what they didnt seem to realize was that these vehicles didnt need to be retrofitted daedalus was already faster and more deadly than any existing missile it couldnt be shot down not by americas yettobebuilt sdi not by anything and speed was only part of the story what about the vehicles other capabilities he switched his helmet screens momentarily to the infrared cameras in the nose and studied the runway infrared pure military and that was just the beginning there also was phasedarray radar and slitscan radar both equipped for frequency hopping and squirt emissions to evade detection and how about the radar altimeter which allowed subsonic maneuvering at low altitudes on the deck or the auxiliary fuel capacity in the forward bay which permitted longdistance sustained operation no space platform needed all this radarevasive weaponssystems management capability or a hyperaccurate inertial navigation system kick in the scramjets and daedalus could climb a hundred thousand miles straight up in seven minutes reenter the lower atmosphere at will loiter over an area kick ass then return to the untouchable safety of space there was enough cruise missile capacity to take out fifty hardened sites it could perform troop surveillance deploy commandos to any firefight on the globe in two hours you name it he also suspected there was yet another feature even more ominous which he planned to check out tonight while the soviet military was secretly drooling to get its hands on this new bomber sending the cream of soviet propulsion engineers here to make sure it worked they already had been outflanked typical idiocy what theyd overlooked was that these two planes still belonged to mino industries and only mino industries had access to the hightemperature ceramics and titanium composites required to build more tanzan mino held all the cards he surely knew the capabilities of this plane everything was already in place mino industries now owned the ultimate weapon they had built or subcontracted every component was lemontov such a dumb party hack he couldnt see that all the more reason to get the cards on the table and soon so far the plan was on track he had demanded that the schedule be moved up and ikeda had reluctantly agreed in four days yuri androv would take daedalus into the region of near space using liquid hydrogen the first full hypersonic test flight and thats when he intended to blow everybodys neat scenario wide open he felt the fuselage shudder as the trucks disengaged from the eyelets on the landing gear then the radio crackled this is control daedalus i do you read daedalus i preflight nominal verified engine oil now heated to thirty degrees celsius begin ignition sequence check daedalus i starting engines he scanned through the instrument readings on his helmet screens then slipped his hand down the throttle quadrant and pushed the button on the left he could almost feel the special lowflashpoint jporiginally developed for the highaltitude american sr blackbirdbegin to flow from the wing tanks into the twelve turboramjets priming them then the ground crew engaged the engines with their huge trolleymounted starters as the rpm began to surge he reminded himself he was carrying only pounds of fuel and it would burn fast he switched his helmet screens to the priorityone display and scanned the master instrument panel white bars showing engine rpm fuel flow turbine inlet temperature exhaust temperature oil pressure hydraulics then he cut back to the infrared cameras and glanced over the tarmac stretching out in front of him since the american kh satellite had passed twenty minutes earlier flight conditions should now be totally secure for tonights program he was scheduled to take the vehicle to mach then terminate the jp feeds in the portside outboard trident and let those three engines unstart after which he would manually switch them to scramjet geometry all the while controlling pitch and yaw with the stability augmentation equipment that would be the easy part the next step required him to manually switch them back to turboramjet geometry and initiate restart at sixtythree thousand feet forty minutes later he was scheduled to have her back safely in the hangar chocks skin cooling nothing to it he flipped his helmet screens back and looked over the readouts one final time fuel pressure was stable engine nozzle control switches locked in auto alpha configuration flaps and slats set to fifteen degrees for max performance takeoff he ran through the checklist on the screen fuel panel check radar altimeter index set throttle quadrant auto lock the thrust required to take daedalus i airborne was less than that needed for a vertically launched space shuttle since lift was gained from the wings but still he was always amazed by the gforces the vehicle developed on takeoff the awesome power at his fingertips inspired a very deceptive sense of security chase cars in place yuri youre cleared for taxi ne puzha ne pera he started to respond thinking it was the computer but this time there was no computer hed deliberately shut it down if he couldnt get this damned samolyot off a runway manually he had no hopes for the next step the voice was merely sergei in flight control power to military thrust he paused toes on the brakes and relished the splendid isolation the pure energy at his command as daedalus began to quiver multibillions at his fingertips the most advanced fuck it this was the fun part brake release in full unstick he rammed the heavy handles on the throttle quadrant to lock commanding engines to max afterburner and grinned ear to ear as the twelve turboramjets screamed instantly to a million pounds of thrust slamming him against the cockpit supports sunday pm we are now cruising at twentynine thousand feet however the captain has requested all passengers to please remain seated with their seat belts fastened the female voice faltered as the plane dropped through another air pocket we may possibly be experiencing mild turbulence for the next hour michael vance wanted a drink for a lot of reasons however the service in first class was temporarily suspended since attendants on the british airways flight to london were themselves strapped into the flipdown seats adjacent to the s galley the turbulence was more than mild what lay ahead in the skies and on the sea below was nothing less than a major storm why not he sighed everything else in the last four days had gone wrong hed been shot at hed killed a mobster and eva had been kidnapped furthermore the drive back to athens then down to the port of piraeus to put zeno onto the overnight ferry to crete had been a rainswept nightmare yet another storm had blown up from the aegean engulfing the coast and even the mountains when they finally reached the docks at piraeus the old greek had just managed to slip onto the boat as it was pulling out his german rifle wrapped in a soggy bundle of clothing michael i must hurry he kissed vance on both cheeks be safe you too he took his hand then passed him the llama half glad to be rid of it and half wondering whether he might need it again here take this and lose it its final resting place will be in the depths of our wine dark sea my friend zeno pocketed it without a glance no one will ever know what we had to do not even adriana but we failed she is still gone dont worry ill find her and thank you again for saving my life you would have done the same for me now hurry the airport perhaps theres still time to catch her with a final embrace he disappeared into the milling throng of rainsoaked travelers the downpour was letting up but the trip still took almost an hour when he finally pulled in at the aging eastern terminal hed left the car in the first space he could find and raced in it was bedlam now with flights backed up by the storm but he saw no sign of eva where was she had she even come here planes had just started flying again according to the huge schedule board over the center of the floor the first departure was a british air to heathrow leaving in five minutes there was no chance of getting through passport control without a ticket so hed elbowed his way to the front of the british airways desk that flight boarding threeseventyone i want a seat im sorry sir but youll have to wait just sell me a ticket dammit the harried agent barely looked up im afraid thats out of the question now if youll just take theres a woman who may be on it he lifted up the empty leather suitcase and she left this at the hotel the equipment is already preparing to leave the gate he glanced at the screen then turned to a pile of tickets he was methodically sorting so if youd please let me check the manifest hed stepped over the baggage scale nudging the agent aside to make double sure shes aboard maybe i can try and locate her in london sir the young englishman paled youre not allowed to just take a second vance ignored his protest and punched up the flight on the computer it was a completely full and there she was in seat a second cabin thank god shed made it while the outraged british airways agent was frantically calling for airport security he scanned more of the file alex novosty was aboard too in the very last row christ hed even used his own name his mind must be totally blown did she know did he know what now with the ticket agent still yelling hed quickly disappeared into the crowd having no choice but to pace a departure lounge for an hour and a half then take the only remaining london flight of the evening all right hed thought after cooling down novosty wants to use you maybe you can use him but now he suspected things werent going to be that simple he remembered the two kgb operatives alex had shot and killed at knossos theyd been there to find eva which meant they knew she had something now he realized that wasnt all they knew across the aisle in first class sat a tall willowy woman who radiated all the selfconfidence of a seasoned european traveler she was also elegantly beautifulwith dark eyes auburn hair and pursed red lipsand she carried a large brown leather purse florentine she could have been a french fashion model a highpaid american cosmetics executive a spanish diplomats mistress the problem was vance knew she was none of those things the french passport hed seen her brandish at the greek behind the glass windows at emigration control was a forgery she was neither french nor american nor spanish she was an executive vice president with techmashimport the importing cover for tdirectorate kgb vera karanova was always a prominent presence at western trade shows but there was no trade show in london now no new hightech toys to be dangled before the wondering eyes of techmashimport which routinely arranged to try and obtain restricted computers surveillance gear weaponssystems blueprints so whys comrade karanova on this flight off to buy a designer dress at a sloane street boutique catch the latest west end musical how about the simplest answer of all shes going to help them track alex novosty to earth or grab eva or both theyre about to tighten the noose so the nightmare was still on the kgb must have had the airport under surveillance and somebody spotted novostyor was it evagetting on the british air flight to london now they were closing in does she know me vance wondered my photos in their files somewhere surely but shed betrayed no hint of recognition so maybe not hed always worked away from the limelight as much as possible once more it had paid off as the plane dipped and shuddered from the turbulence he watched out of the corner of his eye as she lifted the fake french passport out of her open leather handbag now nestled in the empty seat by the window and began copying the number onto her landing card very unprofessional he thought you always memorize the numbers on a forgery first rule tdirectorates getting sloppy these days he waited till shed finished then leaned over and ran his hand roughly down the arm of her blue silk blouse etesvous aller a londres pour du commerce he deliberately made his french as americanaccented as possible comment she glanced up annoyed and removed his hand excusez moi que ditesvous daffaires he grinned and craned to look at the front of her open neckline business oui yes she switched quickly to english her relief almost too obvious get over there often he pushed from time to time no fooling lady youve been in london four times since by actual count setting up phony thirdparty passthrough deals just business huh he grinned again then looked up at the liquor service being unveiled in the galley the turbulence had subsided slightly and the attendants were trying to restore normality at least in first class what do you say to a drink she beckoned the approaching steward hoping to outflank this obnoxious american across the aisle vodka and tonic please same as the ladys having pal he gave the young englishman a wink and a thumbsup sign then turned back by the way im booked in at the holiday inn over by marble arch great room service almost like home you staying around there no she watched the steward pour her drink sorry to hear that i was wondering maybe we do these business trips of yours include taking some time off let you in on a secret just between you and me i know this little club in soho where they have live he winked i got a membership tell you one thing theres nothing like it in chicago im afraid ill be busy too bad he drew on his drink then continued long stay this trip if youll excuse me mr warner william j warner friends call me bill mr warner ive had a very trying day so if you dont mind id like to attempt to get some rest sure you make yourself comfortable now he watched as she shifted to the window seat as far as possible from him and stationed her leather handbag onto the aisle side just then the plane hit another air pocket rattling the liquor bottles in the galley maybe well catch up with each other in london he yelled most unlikely she glared as she gulped the last of her drink then carefully rotated to the window and adjusted her seat to full recline her face disappeared good riddance after that the flight went smoothly for a few minutes and michael vance began to worry but then the turbulence resumed shutting down drink service as their puny airplane again became a toy rattle in the hands of the gods thirty thousand feet over the mediterranean buffeted by the powerful unseen gusts of a spring storm for a moment he found himself envying zeno who had only the churning sea to face almost hesitantly he unbuckled his seat belt and pulled himself up balancing with one hand as he reached in the air to grapple drunkenly with the overhead baggage compartment sir the steward yelled down the aisle im sorry but you really must remain take it easy chum i just need to another burst of turbulence slammed the wings tossing the cabin in a sickening lurch to the left now he lunged backward flinging his hand around to catch the leather purse and sweep it upended onto the floor with a clatter the contents sprayed down the aisle comrade karanova popped alert reaching out too late to try and grab it her eyes were shooting daggers ho sorry about that damned thing just here let me try and he bent over blocking her view as he began sweeping up the contents off the carpeted aisle cosmetics keys and documents the name in the passport was helena alsace inside the boarding packet was a hotel reservation slip issued by an athens travel agent the savoy well well well looks like tdirectorate travels first class everywhere these days learning the ways of the capitalist west here you go never understood why women carry so much junk in their purse he was settling the bag back onto the seat sure am sorry about that maybe i can buy you dinner to make amends or how about trying out that room service i told you about that will not be necessary mr warner she reached for the bag well just in case im in the neighborhood what hotel you staying at the connaught she answered without a blink great ill try and make an excuse to catch you there please just let me she leaned back again arms wrapped around her purse and firmly closed her eyes the savoy he thought again just my luck thats where always stay monday am michael i cant tell you how happy i am to hear from you old man we must have lunch today the voice emerged from the receiver in the crisp diction of londons financial district the city even though the speaker had been born on the opposite side of the globe vance noticed it betrayed a hint of unease are you by any chance free around noon we could do with a chat i think i can make it he took a sip of coffee from the strand palaces cheap porcelain cup on the breakfast cart and leaned back hed known the london financial scene long enough to understand what the invitation meant lunch in the private upstairs dining rooms of the citys ruling merchant banks was the deepest gesture of personal confidence it was a ritual believed to have the magical power to engender trust and cooperationcementing a deal stroking an overly inquisitive journalist soothing a recalcitrant labor politician we had him to lunch often substituted for a character reference in the city a confirmation that the individual in question had passed muster superb kenji nogami was trying hard to sound british what say you pop round about oneish ill make sure my table is ready ken can we meet somewhere outside today anywhere but at the bank pleasure not business michael but thats how business works in this town remember it masquerades as pleasure we new boys have to have our perks these days just like the old boys he laughed well then how about that ghastly pub full of publicschool jobbers down by the new leadenhall market know it we could pop in for a pint nobody you or i know would be caught dead drinking there across from that brokers club right thats the one its bloody loud at lunch but we can still talk another laugh matter of fact i might even be asking a trifling favor of you old man so youd best be warned whats a small favor between enemies see you at one on the dot as he cradled the receiver and poured the last dregs of caffeine into his cup he listened to the blare of horns on the strand and wondered what was wrong with the conversation that had just ended simple kenji nogami was too quick and chipper which meant he was worried why these days he should be on top of the world hed just acquired a controlling interest in the westminster union bank one of the top ten merchant banks in the city after an unprecedented hostile takeover was the new venture suddenly in trouble not likely nogami had brought in a crackerjack japanese team and dragged the bank kicking and screaming into the lucrative eurobond business the issuing of corporate debentures in currencies other than that of a companys home country eurocurrencies and eurobonds now moved in wholesale amounts between governments central banks and large multinational firms the trading of eurobonds was centered in london global leader in foreign exchange dealing and they represented the worlds largest debt market in addition nogami had aggressively stepped up westminster unions traditional merchant bank operations by financing foreign trade structuring corporate finance deals and underwriting new issues of shares and bonds he also excelled in the new game of corporate takeovers none of the major london merchant bankersthe rothschilds schroders hambros barings had originally been british so maybe kenji was merely following in the footsteps of the greats vance did know he was a firstclass manager a paragon of japanese prudence here in the new booming gogo london financial scene this town used to be one of michael vances sentimental favorites a living monument to british dignity reserve fair play but today it was changing fast after the big bang london had become a prisoner of the paper prosperity of its money changers whod been loosed in the temple thanks to them the city that square mile comprising londons old financial center would never again be the same after the big bang the city had become a bustling beehive of brash ambitious young men and women whose emblem fittingly seemed to be the outrageous new headquarters lloyds had built for itself a monstrous spaceship dropped remorselessly into the middle of greek revival facades and victorian respectability it was to his mind like watching the new money give the finger to the old the staid headquarters of the bank of england up the way that grand old lady of threadneedle street now seemed a doddering dowager at a rock concert all the same he liked to stay near the city close to the action the savoy a brisk tenminute walk from the financial district was his usual spot but since that was out of the question this time hed checked into the refurbished strand palace just across the street today he had work to do he had to get word to the minogumi to back off and he was tired of dealing with lieutenants and enforcers kobun the time had come to go to the top the tokyo oyabun the game of cat and mouse had to stop tokyo knew how to make deals it was time to make one kenji nogami he figured was just the man nogami a wiry executive with appropriately graying hair and a smile of granite was a consummate tactician whod survived in the global financial jungle for almost three decades when the japanese finally got tired of the british financial club playing school tie and bowler hats and old boy with them shutting them out theyd picked nogami to handle the hostile takeover of one of the pillars of londons merchant banking community japan might still be afraid to go that route with the americans who loved to rattle protectionist sabers but england didnt scare them a whit in years gone by such attempts to violate british class privilege were squelched by a few of the eton grads of the city chipping in to undermine the hostile bid these days however nobody had the money to scare off japan the game was up and after the deregulation of big bang wholesale pursuit of profit had become the citys guiding principle unfortunately that turned out to be a game kenji nogami and his shokin gaigoku bank could play better than anybody in the world nogami saw himself as an advance man for the eventual japanese domination of the globes financial landscape maybe he was michael vance knew him from a wholly different direction now almost another life in years gone by nogami had traveled with equal ease in two worldsthat of straight money and that of hot money hed always maintained the cover of a legitimate banker but insiders knew hed made his real fortune laundering yakuza amphetamine receipts and importing smallcaliber weapons it was that second career that now made him the perfect pipeline for a message that needed to be delivered fast vance finished off the last of the coffee in his cup then rose and strolled to the window to gaze down on the bustling strand the weather looked murky typical for london where was eva now he wondered what was she doing maybe shed managed to lose novosty and get back to thinking about the protocol well he had some pressing business of his own but the first thing was to try and find her maybe she was wondering right now how to get in touch with him what places here had they been together back in the old days maybe there was some location the v ampa st pauls or how about a restaurant what was that one shed loved so much the place the ira shot up a few years back at that moment the white phone beside his bed interrupted his thoughts with its insistent british double chirp he whirled around startled who knew he was here if it was the kgb or the japanese mob they wouldnt bother ringing for an appointment finally after the fifth burst he decided to reach for it probably just the desk calling about the breakfast things the voice was the last one he expected hello darling eva he almost shouted where the hell are you you really must stop shooting people you know she lectured youre getting to be a horrible menace to society what michael the voice hardened christ what a mess are you okay yes i think so she paused to inhale but im literally afraid to move i think kgb got alex there in terminal four at heathrow he was trying to bluff them though so maybe he pulled it off anyway they were so tied up i just slipped past the hell with him where are i dont dare take a step outside this room now lets meet tonight besides i want to work on translating you know i rang a scholarly bookshop i used to order from and theyre delivering one of ventriss books maybe i can make some headway i already did a bit of it i saw that in the files a whole page she laughed congratulations give me a break its been ten years well it looks like youre still able to fake the scholar bit but just barely thanks what do you think of it so far scary very scary but we have to do more enough so we can go public exactly look ive got to do a couple of things today can you thats fine because i want to work on this she sounded businesslike again her old self something to while away the empty hours the saga inside my little zenith has got to be the ticket out of this madness maybe but we need to put some more spin on the scenario just to be safe what not on the phone can you just sit tight play your game and let me take a shot at mine it better be good that remains to be seen who knew how it would go but if it proceeded as planned the whole thing could be turned around now where the hell are you the place we always stayed of course figuring youd come here but you stood me up naturally same old michael so this morning i started calling around you mean youre at the savoy sweetie our love nest of happy times past right across the street chapter ten monday pm tanzan mino was dressed in a black threequarter sleeved kimono staring straight ahead as he knelt before the sword resting in front of him his hands were settled lightly on his thighs his face expressionless then he reached out and touched the scabbard bowing low to it inside was a twelfthcentury katana a fivefootlong razor created by swordsmiths of the mino school from the town of seki near gifu in the heart of old honshu it was he believed a perfect metaphor for japanese excellence and discipline the sword had now been reverenced next he would use it to test his own centering at this moment his mind was empty knowing nothing feeling nothing as his torso drew erect he grasped the upper portion of the scabbard with his right hand its tip with his left and pulled it around to insert it into the black sash at his waist he sat rigid for a moment poised then thrust his right foot forward as he simultaneously grasped the hilt of the sword with his right hand the upper portion of the scabbard with his left in a lightning move he twisted the hilt a halfturn and drew the blade out and across his right foot moving into the attack stance the whip of steel fairly sang through the empty air as the sword and his body moved together it was the chudan no kamae stroke the tip of the blade thrust directly at an opponents face an exercise in precision balance rising to a half kneel he next lifted the sword above his head his left hand moving up to seize the hilt in a powerful twohanded grip an instant later he slashed downward with fierce yet controlled intensity still holding the hilt at arms length it was the powerful jodan no kamae stroke known to sever iron finally holding the hilt straight in front of him he rotated the blade ninety degrees then pulled his left hand back and grasped the mouth of the scabbard as he rose to both feet he raised the sword with his right hand and touched its tsuba handguard to his forehead in silent reverence even as he shifted the scabbard forward then in a single motion he brought the blade around and caught it with his left hand just in front of the guard still holding the scabbard with ritual precision he guided the blade up its full length until the tip met the opening of the sheath and then he slowly slipped it in this weapon he reflected with pride was crafted of the finest steel the world had ever seen created by folding and hammering heated layers again and again until it consisted of hundreds of thousands of paperthin sheets the metallurgy of japan had been unsurpassed for eight hundred years and now the daedalus spaceplane had once again reaffirmed that superiority building on centuries of expertise he had succeeded in fashioning the heretoforeun known materials necessary to withstand the intense heat of scramjet operation the remaining problems now lay in another direction entirely the difficulty was not technology it was human blundering lack of discipline discipline the news he had just received had only served to assure him once again that discipline was essential in all of life as he turned and stationed the sword across his desk he surveyed his penthouse domain and understood why heads of state must feel such isolation such impotence you could have the best planning the best organization the tightest coordination and yet your fate still rode on luck and chance and on others overall however the scenario possessed an inescapable inevitability a lifetime of experience told him he was right he glanced at the sword one last time again inspired by it and settled himself at the desk tanzan mino was known throughout japan as a kuromaku a man who made things happen named after the unseen stagehand who pulled the wires in japanese theater manipulating the stage and those on it from behind a black curtain the kuromaku had been a fixture in japanese politics since the late nineteenth century he fit the classic profile perfectly he was an ultranationalist who coordinated the interests of the rightwing underworld with the onstage players in industry and politics in this role he had risen from the ruins of world war ii to become the most powerful man in asia it had been a long and difficult road hed begun as an osaka street operator in the late thirties a fervent nationalist and open admirer of mussolini who made his followers wear black shirts in imitation of the italian fascists when the pacific war began he had followed the japanese army into shanghai where under the guise of procuring strategic materials for the imperial navy he trafficked in booty looted from chinese warehouses and operated an intelligence network for the kempei tai the japanese secret police after japan lost china and the war the occupying supreme commander for the allied powers scap labeled him a class a war criminal and handed him a threeyear term in sugamo prison the stone floors and hunger and rats gave him the incentive to plan for better things the ruins of japan he concluded offered enormous opportunity for men of determination the country would be rebuilt and those builders would rule thus it was that while still in sugamo he set about devising the realization of his foremost ambition to make himself oyabun of the tokyo yakuza his first step he had decided would be to become japans gambling czar and upon his releasehe was thirty years old at the timehe had made a deal with various local governments to organize speedboat races and split the take on the accompanying wagering it was an offer none chose to refuse and over the next forty years he and his minogumi yakuza amassed a fortune from the receipts while still in sugamo prison he had yet another insight that to succeed in the new japan it would be necessary to align himself temporarily with the globes powerful new player america accordingly he began cultivating connections with american intelligence and upon his release he landed a job as an undercover agent for the occupations g section intelligence hed specialized in black bag operations for the kempei tai in shanghai during the war so he had the requisite skills when scaps era of reconstruction wound down he thoughtfully offered his services to the cia volunteering to help them crush any new japanese political movements that smacked of leftism it was love at first sight and soon tanzan mino was fronting for the company putting to good use his minogumi yakuza as strikebreakers with tanzan mino as kuromaku the yakuza and the american cia had run postwar japan during the early years keeping it safe for capitalism then as prosperity returned new areas of expansion beckoned when goods could again be bought openly the black market long a yakuza mainstay began to wither away but he had converted this into an opportunity stepping in to fill the new japanese consumers need for cash by opening storefront loan services known as sarakin although his yakuza charged interest rates as high as percent the average japanese could walk into a sidestreet office and minutes later walk out with several thousand dollars no questions asked unlike banks he didnt bother with credit checkshe had wellproven collection techniquesand before long his sarakin were handling more consumer loans than all japans banks combined his success was such that foreign bankers wanting to gain a foothold in japan soon started coming to him bank of america bankers trust chase manhattan american express bankall began placing capital wholesale through the yakuzas sarakin when the cia bankrolled the corsican mob as strikebreakers in marseilles in the fifties they were merely financing heroin labs for the french connection but when they and americas leading banks hired on with tanzan minos yakuza they were furthering the career of the man destined to become the worlds richest rightwinger the cia arrangement had lasted until a midlevel field consultant blew the whistle the score for that had yet to be settled he shrugged away the thought with a glimmer of anger and turned to study the column of green figures on the computer screen atop his desk mentally running a total the numbers at least pleased him capitalization for the first year was ready to be issued the dummy corporations were in place their paperwork impeccable none of the financing packages was likely to raise eyebrows the plan was as flawless as human ability could make it as the pale light of dusk crept through the blinds laying faint shadows across his silver hair he reached over with a smile and touched the white stingrayskin binding on the swords hilt yes the plan was brilliant a third world war one of economics had begun but none of the other combatants fully realized it the european trading nations of were banding together also bringing in the new capitalists of eastern europe to create a trade monolith at the same time japan had through strategic planning achieved its own pacific trade bloc finally realizing its aim during the war a greater east asia coprosperity sphere now only one final target remained the new consumers of the soviet union who represented the worlds largest untapped market for goods technology investment the europeans the americans all the capitalists were fighting for that prize but tanzan mino was within a whisker of seizing it for japan and mino industries the soviets would have no choice he reached down to stroke neko the snow leopard who slept beside his desk and reflected on the scenario the soviets had bought into it with eyes open the plan was turning out to be absurdly easy at the moment all he needed was the cleanly laundered payoff money the political risks the financial risks everything had to be covered the powers in the liberal democratic party feared going out on a limb for such a risky strategic objective they required encouragement and certain prominent japanese bankers who would have to assist in the scenario also needed inducement but the money had to be cash and totally untraceable no more recruitstyle fiascos where was it he pushed that worry aside momentarily as he studied the gleaming model of the daedalus poised like a greek statue in the center of his office to think that the soviets would agree not only to the hard financial and territorial terms he had demanded but actually were willing to help mino industries develop the most advanced airplane the world had ever seen their plight was fully as desperate as hed assumed it was a game where he won everything yes the daedalus was as important as all the rest combined it would leapfrog japan to the undisputed ranks of the major powers erasing forever the distinction between civilian and military technology still though there were problems always problems first the news he had just received the laundered funds still had not been delivered then there was the matter of the nsa cryptographer who had been given an intercepted copy of the protocol three men had been lost attempting to retrieve it but she remained at large that was unacceptable it had to be reclaimed no matter the cost lest there be a premature exposure of the plan timing was everything added to that was the puzzling matter of the soviet test pilot on whom the fate of the entire project hinged hed begun making outrageous demands insisting on moving up the first hypersonic flight to friday why hed once spent time in the united states as an exchange pilot could he be fully trusted tanzan mino had finally reluctantly approved the schedule change though his instincts told him to beware his instincts rarely failed but it was better not to appear too inflexible too soon at this stage the test pilot had become the crucial component of the project sometimes you had to bend to get what you wanted and instincts be damned as if all that were not enough hed just heard an unsettling rumble out of london concerning kenji nogami a minogumi kobun for thirty years a man hed made rich he turned his attention back to the computer screen and studied the numbers once more however he could not concentrate the problems he felt his anger rise unbidden he was too old for problems surmounting human incompetence was a young mans game he had he told himself struggled enough for a dozen men and now having dedicated himself to fashioning japans twentyfirst century ascendancy he no longer really cared about money no what mattered now was the triumph of the japanese people the emperor the yamato spirit his countrymen he had always believed shared a noble heritage with another race one distant in time and place but brothers still both the modern japanese and the ancient greeks had pursued a mission to refine the civilizations around them offering a powerful vision of human possibilities they both were unique peoples chosen by the gods he wanted more than anything for the entire world to at last understand that with a sigh he turned and gave neko a loving pat on her spotted muzzle then touched the buzzer on his desk time to start solving the problems monday pm michael im terribly glad you could make it kenji nogami smiled and reached for his pint of ambercolored lager his tailoring was savile row via bond street his accent cambridge his background well concealed in a business where appearances counted for much he had all the careful touches that separated the players from the pretenderscheeks sleek from a daily workout at his club eyes penetrating and always alert hair graying at the temples today he stood out like a beacon in the mob of chatting brokers and jobbers in the paneled gloom of the pub his aloof bearing and dark pinstripe suit proclaiming insider as clearly as neon a japanese to the core he still looked as though he had belonged there for a hundred years by the way congratulations on the takeover vance caught the pint of ale sliding across the beersoaked mahogany then lifted it i hear you scared hell out of the big players here in the city heres to going straight hope it doesnt take all the fun out of life it had to happen eventually michael he nodded with innocent guile and raised his glass tankard in return cheers to your health and wealth vance joined him in a sip it was warm and bitter the way he liked it no more intrigue well he winked and drank again blowing back the foam we bankers still thrive on intrigue old man and secrecy otherwise somebody else would start making the money the young brokers laughing smoking and drinking in the pub all looked as though they made buckets of money outside the ochertrimmed doric columns of the refurbished leadenhall market looked down on the lunchtime crowds of the financial district almost all men in white shirts and dark suits the modern uniform of the money changer trouble with secrets thoughvance settled his mug onto the wet bar and looked upis that eventually the word gets out nogami studied him are you hinting at something something i should know maybe im just thinking out loud but what if a guy like me came across some proprietary information sort of by accident and consequently an old friend of ours back home in tokyo was very unhappy if that friend is who i think you mean hes not someone either of us wants to see unhappy do we he sipped solemnly at his beer speak for yourself vance replied and drank again but to continue what if this hypothetical guy had decided to try and simplify the situation get news back to tokyo about a way to solve everybodys problem then hed need an information conduit one thats tried and true nogami reached for a tray of peanuts took a small handful and shook them in his fist before popping one into his mouth he chewed for a second then smiled one way might be to have a drink with an old shall we say acquaintance in hopes he might be able to help with some communication sounds like were making headway here he paused say this hypothetical guy wants to talk a deal what sort of deal nogami chewed on more peanuts his eyes noncommittal for instance if tokyoll lay off hell see what he can do about some laundered funds our friends been waiting for hes in a position to make it happen but if they keep on with the muscle the deals off in other words no play no pay supposing i know the individual in tokyo you mean as things stand now youve quite possibly come to the wrong man he sighed this isnt the old days my friend im not wired in like i used to be times have changed thank god im out i run an honest merchant bank at least as honest as you can in this new day and age and i like it that way ken dont start the runaround vance tried to keep his tone easy youre not talking to some bank examiner now in japan connections last forever we both know that you were never more correct nogami examined his lager obligations remain even though influence wanes which is in fact one of the reasons i wanted to see you today michael if i do you this favor could you perhaps do one for me in return is it legit i suppose that depends he laughed look of course id be more than happy to send a secure telex if thats all you want heaven knows i owe you that much he paused to sip from his mug but ill sound rather a fool if i dont know the first thing about the situation cant you at least give me some idea tokyoll understand and the less you know the better for everybody all right but my position right now is well i may not be able to help as much as id like i dont like the sound of that its the problem i mentioned to you that individual is calling in favors with me now not the other way around so this could be a trifle awkward if you see what i mean ken have you forgot i took care of you once remember the toshiba millingmachine sale to the soviets all the posturing back in the us it could have been a lot worse for your team politically afterwards you said you owed me one yes and i still appreciate what you did tipping me off about the french the fact theyd already sold such machines to the soviets years ago it helped us dampen the fires of moral indignation on capitol hill he took another sip i got a lot of points with the right people in the ldp i just got fed up with all the bullshit no harm done he leaned back but now its your turn fair enough he gazed around the crowded smoke filled pub michael i dont know if we really should be talking here care to take a walk down to the thames get a bit of air maybe hope for some sunshine all right vance tossed down a fivepound note and reached for his overcoat draped across the stool next to them weathers nice at least for london nogami nodded as they pushed through the crowded doorway and into the street dont say what youre thinking dont say you cant imagine why i moved here never crossed my mind vance took a breath of the fresh air expelling the residual smoke from his lungs the lunchtime mob elbowed them from every side you know the reason as well as i do its all part of our overall strategy japan is a world player now michael im part of the vanguard thats going to do to financial services worldwide what we did to semiconductors and electronics you just watch and see i already believe it he did japans dominance of the world money scene was just a matter of time they navigated their way through the midday throng on every side lunchtime shoppers were munching sandwiches lining up for knickknacks to take back to the office they strolled past the rear of the tubularsteel lloyds building then headed down a cobblestone side street toward the river but we had to come here and buy our base in order to be part of the financial game in europe nogami continued not missing a beat we expect to be major players before long id say youre already one when the plaza accord sliced the greenback in half it doubled the value of japans bankroll every yen you had was suddenly worth twice as many dollars as if by magic we cant complain he paused to inhale the gray heavy air of course the locals here in london are constantly enlisting their old boy regulators to make up new rules to hamper us but tokyo invented that little ploy it almost makes this place feel like home word is you play all the games i hear westminster union now handles more eurodollar deals than anybody we pull our weight he smiled and dodged a red doubledecker bus as they crossed lower thames street you name a major currency well underwrite the debt offering lots of action there is indeed sometimes perhaps too much which is why i wanted to talk down here by the river shall we stroll out onto london bridge sounds good spread before them now was the muddy gray expanse of londons timeless waterway shakespeare had gazed on it handel had written music to accompany fireworks shot over it today a few tugs were moving slowly up the center channel and a sightseeing boat was headed down to greenwich cranes of the new docklands development loomed over the horizon downriver so whats the problem vance turned to study his face there was worry there and pain michael that individual you spoke of he has in the famous phrase made me an offer i cant refuse he wants me to handle a debt issue corporate debentures bigger than anything this town has ever seen anything europe has ever seen you should be ordering champagne not this time he turned back to study the river the whole thing stinks whore the players its supposedly to raise capital for the mino industries group ive been asked to underwrite the bonds then unload them with minimal fanfare and keep a low profile he looked back but its almost fraud michael i dont think theres anything behind them at all nothing the beneficiaries are just phony mino industries shadow corporations only nobody will know it you see the bonds are zerocoupons paying no interest till they mature ten years from now so it will be a full decade before the buyers find out theyve acquired paper with no backing wont be the first time the sheep got sheared by a hustler michael im not a hustler he snapped and theres more theyre socalled bearer bonds which means theres no record of who holds them just one more trick to keep this thing below the radar typical bearer bonds always sell like hotcakes in hightax locales like the benelux countries that mythical belgian dentist can buy them anonymously and screw the tax man yes thats part of what makes eurocurrency ideal for this all that homeless money floating around over here no government is really responsible for keeping track of it in fact every effort has been made to ensure that these debentures appeal to greed their yield will float pegged at two full points above the thirtyyear british government bond the gilt as lead underwriter ill have the main responsibility but im also supposed to form a syndicate of japanese brokerage houses herenomura daiwa sumitomo the othersto make sure the offering goes off without a hitch but that precaution will hardly be necessary at those interest rates they should practically fly out the door he sighed which is a good thing because because michael the amount im being asked to underwrite is a hundred billion dollars and thats just for the first year right nogami looked up startled how did you know call it a lucky guess he took a deep breath so thats where the funding stipulated in the protocol was going to come from european suckers my god he thought the play is superb michael nobody could float an offering like that and have it covered with real assets nobody taken all together thats enough money to capitalize a dozen worldclass corporations he paused of course i wont be offering it all at once the debentures will dribble out over the period of a year and then the next year it starts all over again for five years so youre supposed to raise five hundred billion dollars in the eurobond market over five years not impossible but its a tall order especially since the ratings will be smoke and mirrors it is in effect an unsecured loan he looked away down at the swirling brown surface of the thames you know what it really means he wants me to sell junk bonds and i cant refuse his voice came close to a quaver just when i was well into earning the esteem of the european banking community im suddenly about to become the drexel burnham of eurobonds ill be operating the investment equivalent of a shell game ken why are you telling me all this vance had never seen him this upset because i have to find out what this is all about what the moneys going to be used for i take it the tokyo oyabuns not talking michael no one dares question him you know that his voice grew formal its the yakuza way well youre in london now a free man its not that simple you may not knowits a very wellkept secretthat he capitalized my takeover of the westminster union bank here he put together a consortium of private financiers for me a lot of the money was actually his the whole thing had to be low profile since none of our banks dared have its name associated with a hostile takeover in london our institutions are still squeamish about such things they all cheered me on in private but in public they didnt know anything about it maybe he had this little return favor in mind all along to tell you the truth ive since wondered that myself anyway now hes calling in my obligation we japanese call it giri i have to play but either way im ruined if i do it ill become a pariah in the european banking community if i dont well the consequences are almost unthinkable ken i dont know how to say this but theres a chance this whole scenario is bigger than anything you can imagine nogami turned to stare what do you know lets just say i hear things but first we need to strike our deal of course as i said ill send a telex from my secure trading room for what good it may do but youve got to help me too please he turned back to the river you know michael i like my life here more and more even given all thats going on here these days the pace is still much more civilized than tokyo for all our prosperity back home i think weve traded something very valuable call it our soul perhaps here i feel almost free from the old days part of a real legitimate world i hated all the money laundering the shady deals these days i can look myself in the face i was temporarily changing professions myself until about a week ago then this problem came up he waved to a pleasure boat slowly motoring up the river it was only a thirty footer but the lines reminded him of the ulysses it made him suddenly homesick for real sunshine and real air michael whats going on we need to work together ill just say this i think the godfathers got a big surprise cooking maybe were both caught in the middle he smiled if thats true we can help each other out though i cant push too hard he took a deep breath and gazed at the murky london sky but still ill tell you the truth im very seriously thinking i may just refuse to touch the whole thing tanzan minoyes why not name names hes even made vague threats against my family the man has pushed me too far this time somewhere it has to end youre a brave man he still runs some very persuasive muscle better have your life insurance paid up im well aware but i dont want to jeopardize everything ive built here my whole new life so thats why i need you if you could find out whats behind all this i could decide whether i should risk everything and go ahead with the offering or just stand up to him at last otherwise whats the timing i have to list the first offering with the issuing house association day after tomorrow weve already put together the paperwork just in case pretty tight michael ill see what i can do about your problem and if theres anything else you know ill try my best depending on whether my message gets through i could be needing somebody to handle some cash a reasonably substantial sum maybe as part of our little quid pro quo you could arrange it is this money he paused awkwardly well you understand my question its laundered clean as a hounds tooth where is it now dont worry vance smiled its liquid and the sum hang on to your bowler hat its around a hundred million us is that all he laughed that figure is barely a blip on the screen these days for a minute there i thought you were talking real money seems a reasonably substantial sum its scarcely more than walkingaround money in our business as you well know over two hundred billion passes through the foreign exchange markets every day a large amount of it right here in london well there could be a small complication if the kgb gets into the action kgb he pulled up sharply what in bloody hell do they its a long story but why would soviet intelligence be involved theyre supposed to be keeping a lower profile these days rumor has it they let this one get past them the money left home without a passport and now they look like fools for letting it happen i see he grew silent then glanced at his watch and pulled his overcoat tighter well perhaps i should send that cable now before tokyo tucks in for the night the sooner the better and the matter of concern to me let me think it over vance spoke slowly but in the meantime id strongly advise you to hold off with the offering youre not telling me what you know is that fair no but who said the worlds got to be fair theres a play about to go down i know about part of it not all but before im through well lets just say that when somebody starts using muscle on me i sort of lose my sense of proportion is it that bad his stare carried alarm what am i supposed to do sit tight on the offering dont say yes or no just find a way to postpone it and send that telex ill dictate it for you after that you can reach me at my hotel strand palace the strand palace michael you he smiled hardly up to your usual standards i dont do as much freelance these days as i used to so i have to learn to live closer to my means ill believe that when i see it he said with a laugh youre not telling me the truth about anything youre right and its for your own good you just stall on the offering and let me play this my way if things arent straightened out in a day two tops were both in a lot of trouble two days it has to happen by then too much is going on now youre really starting to make me alarmed you should be because if this isnt settled in two days he thought somebodys probably going to be dead chapter eleven monday pm she checked her watch then took a last look around the spacious room it was time her bag lay on the bed packed and waiting to be sent later the part of her luggage that mattered was the vinyl flight bag by the door containing the zenith with a sigh she rose threw on her light tan raincoat and grabbed the bag this was the part shed been dreading and shed done her best to try and look inconspicuousa dressy beige outfit and a few silver accessories shed also washed her hair which always made her feel better the carpeted hallway was clear as she closed the door tugged to be certain it was secure then took a deep breath turned and headed toward the elevator she hadnt been outside the room for almost twentyfour hours this she told herself must be what house arrest feels like it was about to be over all she had to do now was make her way through the savoy lobby walk diagonally across the strand then through another lobby another elevator and shed be with michael the more she allowed herself to think about the whole situation the angrier she got at all the beancounters at nsa who wouldnt listen to her at the entire american intelligence establishment how could everybody have missed what was happening maybe she thought the air outside would help cool her off she definitely needed to get out of the savoy if only to counter the claustrophobia stretch your legs sweetheart and think the elevator chimed and the doors slid open the crisp shiny expensive fashions greeted her the iridescence of diamonds the night people of london were headed out for dinner and the clubs a cross section of the jet set and the bored rich nobody seemed to be having fun she looked at them as she stepped in wondering what they would think if they knew what was in her vinyl bag michael used to say the only thing people like these were interested in was impressing headwaiters he was probably dead right the lobby light flashed above the doors and they slid open to reveal muted wood paneling english antiques and sparkling mirrors graysuited bellboys carrying baggage and opening elevator doors mingled with the bustling evening throng it was a world unto itself not pausing she strode past the pink marble columns and glowing chandeliers then headed for the glassed entrance outside the traffic on the strand the glitter of london at night all of it beckoned being in crete again had really made her think about a lot of things mostly though shed thought about michael vance jr exarchaeologist exspook ex god knew what still shed seen plenty worse the paunchy assistantthis and vicethat all divorced and paying alimony and whining but in this manshort time with hungry divorcees flocking the bars they didnt have to bother keeping up appearances middleaged decay was their inalienable right mike whatever else you said about him still looked as good as he had a decade ago he was showing some mileage sure but on him it didnt look half bad maybe it was the tequila could they start over again that new beginning hed hinted about maybe it was at least worth a try she moved on through the milling mob in the lobby trying to be casual to blend hed said she should get out of the savoy as soon as possible just send her things and move in with him but why didnt he come over and stay with her shed asked the savoy was more romantic more like the old days thats when hed abruptly switched the subject saying they couldnt discuss it on the phone probably he had something working well she had a few surprises too shed spent the day hacking away at the protocol and shed learned a lot more it was even worse than shed imagined as she pushed through the revolving doors and into the driveway the clackclack of london taxi motors and the rush of cold air brought back all the adrenaline of that moment in iraklion when she had first seen alex she grasped the flight bag more firmly and moved on down the lefthand sidewalk past the national westminster bank at the corner and toward the street almost there just across waited the strand palace and safety in her rush shed missed an important event mingled in among the lobby crowd was a couple shed failed to notice theyd been over on her left by the desk the man in a rumpled brown jacket was haggard with bloodshot eyes his beard was untrimmed but it did disguise the bruises on his face unseen by eva hed suddenly raised his hand and pointed at her nor did she see the woman with him dark coiffure elegant makeup oscar de la renta cocktail dressthough she wouldnt have recognized her in any case only moments after eva borodin walked up the savoy driveway the woman was speaking into the radio shed had in her shiny evening purse monday pm he glanced at his watch then looked out his smudgy hotel window and down at the strand two more minutes and there should be a knock on the door would she believe him that hed set up the play maybe he couldnt quite believe it himself but still they had the biggest share of poker chips now they were about to take control of the game it was almost almost time to relax then he saw her moving briskly across the strand while furtively looking left and right good after he watched her disappear into the lobby down below he turned back from the window and walked to the bar time to crack open the sauza tres generaciones tequila anejomexicos wellaged contribution to the wellbeing of all humankind hard enough to come by anywhere it was virtually unobtainable here in london but his search had succeeded he lifted it out of its tan box admiring the coal black bottle then gave the cork a twist and sniffed the fragrance fresh as nectar before settling it back on the bar next he removed a bottle of rare stolichnaya starka vodka from the freezer and stationed it beside the sauza this he knew was evas favorite made with water from the niva river and flavored with pear leaves and crimean apples as well as a touch of brandy and a dash of port a few moments later he heard a light knock on the door and with a feeling of relief he stepped over michael the voice was a muted whisper hurry he swung it inward and there she was without a word she moved into his arms are you okay he touched her face then lifted her lips to his they were cold tight yes i i think so god what a day i kept wanting to call you darling i was out i assumed that i cant wait to show you my translation hey slow down he kissed her again lets have a celebration drink first just you and me michael dont talk nonsense weve got to think i got a bottle of your native wine a little tequila anejo for me never hurt the mental processes come on what do you say he turned and headed for the bar she was unzipping the vinyl flight bag how can you then she caught herself and laughed it better be frozen like icecold syrup cold as siberia it should go down well with the latest news item weve now got a deal on the table with tokyo what kind of deal she glanced over i told them if theyll call off the gorillas ill see about lightening up their money problems the alex novosty imbroglio youre not really going to do it he laughed what do you think darling whatever youre planning its not going to stop them why dont we wait and see ive seen enough already stay mellow he was handing her a tall thin glass of clear liquid already frosting on the sides make any progress on the protocol nobody in the world is going to believe it this is just too big i almost wonder if a newspaper would touch it at least until we have more than we have now shed set down her drink and was opening the flight bag out came the zenith and moments later a text was on the screen how much farther did you get only another page or so this is tougher going than i thought but here look this section picks up from where you left off mother russias practically giving away the store within one year of the satisfaction of all formalities pursuant to the abovedesignated credits the ussr will renounce sole proprietorship of the kurile islands and the soviet oblast of sakhalin those territories will thereafter be administered as a freetrade zone and joint protectorate of the ussr and japan with exclusive economic development rights extended to all designated corporations comprised in mino industries group mig mig is hereby granted full rights to engage in capital investment and manufacturing development in the ussr which capital investment may comprise all or part of the financial credits specified in item mig will be permitted to hold or greater interest in all joint industrial facilities and the operation and control of those facilities will rest solely with managers designated by mig unless otherwise mutually agreed within two years of the date of this agreement the soviet ruble will be declared a freemarket currency convertible to yen and other western currencies at rates governed solely by the established world currency exchanges furthermore from that time forward japanesemanufactured durables and consumer goods may be purchased directly in rubles at prevailing rates of exchange upon ratification of this protocol by the japanese diet and the supreme soviet of the ussr the japanese selfdefense forces will have full access for purposes not hostile to the sovereign security of the ussr to all military installations on sakhalin and the kurile islands including facilities now used exclusively by the soviet navy and soviet air force the security of the far eastern oblast of the ussr will henceforth be a joint obligation of the ussr and the japanese selfdefense forces he looked up his eyes narrowing so its just what we thought a global horsetrade tokyo supplies moscow with half a trillion in loans and financing over the next five years the money they need for restructuring and the soviets cede back the territory they took after the war the kurile islands and sakhalin that perennial thorn in the side of the japanese right not to mention which japan also gets a whole new target for all that excess capital burning a hole in its pocket as well as first crack at sakhalins oil reserves michael put it together and you realize japans about to wrap up what shes been angling for ever since the wartotal economic dominance of the far east russia and all right he thought but which russians are making this secret deal could it be the hardliners whore lining up a new military alliance is that what the prototype is all about by the way did you look closely at the early part the bit i translated he walked over and checked the traffic on the strand below theres some kind of surprise package under the tree i dont think its christmas chocolates you mean the prototype bothers me too she took another sip of her freezing stoly what do you think it is my wild guess would be some kind of advanced weapons system if the soviets are planning to give back territory theyd better be getting some goodies well any way you look at it this whole thing is brilliant synergistic everybody comes out with something they want world geopolitics is about to become a whole new ball game but that other bit the prototype seems to be a really important part of it therere specifications a hard delivery date the works thats where the quid pro quo starts getting kinky it does sound like some entirely new kind of weapon she agreed who knows whatever it turns out to be though its something they had to develop together which probably means hightech but were going to find out you and me he studied the street below where traffic was a blaze of headlights then turned back tell me again about those satellite photos you mentioned out at the palace you mean the ones of hokkaido the japanese island up north right what exactly was in them you said it looked like a runway i said thats what i thought it was but nobody at nsa is authorized to be interested officially in what goes on in japan so the oversight committee wouldnt spring for a real analysis an infrared overlay or anything the budget cuts et cetera which is exactly what whoever planned this figured on right if you had some military surprise cooking what better place to hide it than in the wilds of northern japan where nobody would bother to pay attention well the location couldnt be more perfect for a joint project hokkaido is right across the straits from sakhalin all nice and convenient she stared at her vodka as the room fell silent maybe if we finished the translation somehow i doubt its going to spell out the details the socalled prototype hasnt been described so far at least as far as weve got probably a deliberate omission our problem is without the full text nobodys going to take our word for all this she finished off her stoly with a gulp then got up to pour another maybe theres a way he caught her and pulled her into his arms but first things first why dont we forget about everything just for tonight she stared at him incredulously darling get serious right now there are people out there wanting to make us disappear because we know too much theyve already tried thats very real look thats being handled why cant you trust me he hugged her again i think its time we had an evening just for us so how about a small intimate reunion tonight right here dinner for two while we wait for the fish to bite i dont believe im hearing this well both slip into something comfortable have the greatest meal in the world sent up along with about a case of wine then retire to that plush bed over there and spend the rest of the evening getting reacquainted youre serious arent you she studied his eyes they had a lascivious twinkle of course she hesitated then thought why not call his bluff all right if you can be insane then i can too but if were going to do it then lets go all the way im sick of living off room service she slapped down her glass know what i really want i want to go out somewhere expensive and splashy with you i want to do london great he was beaming whoops he hadnt been bluffing i dare you she rose and threw her arms around him suddenly it was all too wonderful to forgo well put this zenith in the hotel safe and act like real people for an evening then well come back here and youll get totally ravished thats a promise sweetheart i sort of had it figured for the other way around oh yeah well see and may the best ravisher win she clicked off the computer and shoved it into the flight bag then turned back how about that wonderful restaurant we went to way back when you know that night we both got so drunk and you almost offered to make an honest woman of me an offer you saw fit to refuse in advance he looked her over but i assume you mean that place up in islington what was it the wellington or something right it was sort of out of the way down a little alley she threw her arms around him that night was so wonderfully romantic like a honeymoon it almost was he smiled remembering lets call for a reservation and just go darling are we acting insane she looked up eyes uncertain im half afraid dont be he touseled her hair before thinking nobodys going to touch you believe me ive nailed the bastards all of them monday pm it was flawless they dined in a gothic ivycovered greenhouse in the garden of a maitre nineteenthcentury inn where waiters scurried the maitre d hovered and the wine steward nodded obsequiously every time he passed their table it was even better than their first visit after a roulade of red caviar eva had the ragout au gratin vance the boeuf a la ficelle his favorite for dessert they shared the house specialty tulipe glacee aux fruits after which they lingered over stilton cheese and a world war i bottle of lisbon port and they talked and laughed and talked they both tried to focus on the good times trips theyd taken places theyd shared what theyd do nexttogether she even agreed to spend august helping him sail the ulysses over to crete his latest plan the gap in time began slowly to drop away it was as though theyd been reborn everything felt new fresh and full of delight who said you couldnt start over neither wanted it to end but finally reluctantly he signaled for the check after a round of farewells from the staff they staggered out into the brisk evening air where to now he was helping her into a black london taxicab after drunkenly handing the uniformed doorman a fiver god im so giddy i cant think she crashed into the seat and leaned her head against his shoulder yanks the driver glanced back with a genuine smile he wore a dark cap and sported a handlebar mustache of dickensian proportions been to new york myself you know with the missus two years back dont know how you lot can stand the bleedin crime though worse every year vance nodded so wherell it be my lords and ladies he hit the ignition how about heading down to the thames say victoria embankment gardens around in there lovely spot for a stroll private like if you know what i mean he winked then revved the engine and started working the vehicle down the narrow street headed toward the avenue thing about the states youd be daft to walk in a park there after dark he glanced back so how was it what the wellington mate you know i take plenty of arabs there bleedin wogs them and their fine soho tarts we made do if youve got the quid why not thats what i always say he smiled above his mustache guess you know ira bombed the front room about ten years back bloody bastards lobbed one right through the big window we were hoping theyd never hit the same place twice with those bloodthirsty micks you never know mate you never know only good thing about the states no bleedin ira he made a right turn off goswell road onto clerkenwell road even at this late hour the traffic was brisk black taxis side by side michael i love victoria gardens eva reached up and bit his ear can we dance in the moonlight why not i think its romantic as hell he drew her closer probably shouldnt tell you this but back in my youth when i was living in london one summer i used to take a plump little irish hotel maid down there i confess to a series of failed assaults on her wellguarded catholic virtue maybe this time your luck will change she giggled and she bit him again ill never be seventeen again but im willing to give it one more try he turned to study the traffic behind them had the play started already yep there it was a dark car was following them had pulled out right behind as they left the restaurants side street it was trailing discreetly but it was in place pretty much on schedule he told himself they must have found out by now darling i want to make you feel seventeen all over again she snuggled closer im starting to feel good again id almost forgot you could do that for me thank you he kissed her then leaned forward and spoke through the partition see those headlights behind us i think they were waiting outside at the restaurant noticed them there now they look to be going wherever youre going the burly cabbie glanced into his side mirror friends of yours in a manner of speaking i think weve just revised our destination make it the savoy instead the main entrance there on the strand whatever you say forget the park youve got it and try not to lose them just make sure they dont know that you know figure it out having some sport with your friends eh work on it oh christ eva revolved to look michael what is it my guess is somebody found out something and theyre very upset she grasped his hand why not try and lose them in the traffic they probably know where were staying whats the point i do hope you know what youre doing trust me the savoys a nice friendly place for a drink well ask them in maybe drop by the american bar there on the mezzanine why did we go out she threw her arms around him i knew it was a risk and still relax he kissed her were just headed home after a lovely dinner and when we get there maybe well ask them in for a nightcap who do you think it is this is a friendly town why dont we just wait and find out right im dying to know who wants to kill us now she turned to stare again at the headlights after all its been almost a day and a half since somebodys hey weve had a great evening nobodys going to spoil that this will just top it off he looked back again then leaned forward as the driver turned onto the strand be sure and take us all the way down the driveway whatever you say he flipped on his blinker then checked the mirror seems your friends are coming along thats the idea vance passed him a tenpound note as they rolled to a halt nice job by the way anything for a yank he checked the bill then tipped his hat many thanks govnor michael eva froze im not getting out come on he reached for her hand this is going to be the most fun weve had all night he looked up at the grayuniformed savoy doorman approaching trust me the other car a black mercedes had stopped just behind them and now its doors swung out on both sides the first to emerge were two surly men in heavy bulging suits next came an expensively dressed darkhaired woman and the last was a bearded man who had to be helped he seemed weak and shaky vance waved to him and beckoned him forward alex what a surprise glad you brought your friends i was starting to worry we might miss each other this time michael his voice faltered as he walked past the others limping we must talk now great idea lets ask everybody in for a drink the woman was staring cold as ice while the two men flanked her on either side waiting vance smiled and greeted her vera talk about luck and ill bet you were worried we wouldnt manage to meet up in london small world the woman was trying to ignore him as she addressed eva you have in your possession classified soviet materials if i do thats your problem she glared back no ms borodin the woman moved forward carrying a leather purse it is your problem well now looks like were all ready for a nightcap vance took evas hand nodded at the doorman and led her through the lobby doors over his shoulder he yelled back i honestly recommend the american bar upstairs terrific view michael please wait novosty limped after him through the doorway then grasped his arm we need to talk first about what you know very well the money michael the game is up cant you see ive got to return it all of it and face the consequences god help me i have no choice they you know alex thats probably a good idea things were getting too rough this was a hustle you should have left to the big boys i tried to tell you that back in athens the other morning just give it back what are you saying he went pale just return the money try and make them see it was a misunderstanding how were you supposed to know it was embezzled you were just following orders right they can probably cover the whole thing over as just some kind of paperwork shuffle michael dont play games with me he was clenching vances sleeve his voice pleading hey were partners remember ill back you all the way he urged eva on past the gaggle of bellmen and into the marbled lobby the chandeliers sparkled and the room still bustled with bejeweled evening people now were all just going to have a very civilized drink the possibility of that seemed to be diminishing however the two men clearly kgb chauffeurs had now moved alongside menacingly you will come with us vera karanova was approaching eva both of you a car is waiting at the entrance on the river side down by the park vance kept urging eva across the lobby toward the staircase leading up to the bar funny thing we were just talking about the embankment gardens vera nodded toward the empty tearoom and the steps beyond which led down toward the river side then spoke quietly in russian to the two men they shouldered against vance the one on the right reaching for evas arm easy with the muscle hero he caught the mans paisley tie and yanked him around spinning him off balance then kneed him onto the floor michael wait novosty stepped between them then took vances arm and drew him farther ahead about the money youve what about it he looked puzzled just return it like i told you novostys eyes twitched above his beard michael the entire sum was withdrawn from the moscow narodny bank at eleven oclock this morning the whole hundred million its vanished sounds like a problem now how do you suppose a thing like that could have happened you know very well his voice was almost a sob it was authorized right after the bank opened someone requested that the funds be converted into eurodollar bearer bonds and open cashiers checks all small denominations which were then picked up by a bonded courier service his voice cracked again i dont know what to do the bank claims they have no more responsibility legally i guess thats right theyre probably in the clear michael you must have arranged it using the account numbers and identification i gave you prove it but how i have to return the funds or theyll kill me i told them only you could have done it but they dont believe me interesting thing about bearer bonds and open cashiers checks theyre same as cash everybodys favorite form of hot money very liquid and totally untraceable for all we know your hundred million could be in geneva by now taking in the view of the lake he turned and pecked eva on the cheek ready for that nightcap novosty caught his arm and tried to pull him back you wont get away with this im warning you youre a dead man you know i sort of look at it the other way around i figure whoever copped that cash this morning got a hundredmilliondollar insurance policy because you see if tdirectorate wants to kiss their hundred million do svedania the best way possible would be to keep up with the muscle here tonight that could make it just disappear forever thered be a lot of explaining to do probably make a very negative impression on certain people back at dzerzhinsky square vera here might even have to turn in all her gold cards what are you saying now comrade karanova had moved closer is it really true you have the embezzled funds she examined vance with a startled look then glanced at novosty as though to confirm his eyes were defeated as he nodded you should check the desk here more often vance pointed toward the mahogany reception photocopies of the open cashiers checks were dropped off for you at nine oclock tonight so maybe its time everybody talked to me he thumbed back at her two bodyguards for starters how about losing those two apes send them down to the park for a stroll then maybe we can talk over a drink the vanguard of the proletariat sits down with the decadent capitalists could be theres a deal here yet east meets west tell me what you want vera karanova said without noticeable enthusiasm for starters how about some protection if these incompetents of yours can manage it from whom look theres a deal cooking and i think theres more to it than meets the eye i do know theres a very smart individual on the other side of the globe whos got some very definite plans for eva and me as well as for mother russia i would suggest it might be in your interest to help us stop him while we still can hes never played straight and i dont think hes about to start now i have my responsibilities too just return the money and we will handle the situation after that the best thing you can do right now is stay out of the way ive seen too many screwups out of dzerzhinsky square to turn this thing over to moscow dr vance you are playing a dangerous game if you want to see the money again its the only game going now do we play or what chapter twelve monday pm when did you receive this tanzan mino glanced over the cable message once again then looked up although the time was near midnight the aide had found him still behind his black slate desk the lights in his penthouse office were turned low muting the already dull earth tones of the walls neko paced across the expanse fronting the wide picture window flicking her tail and anticipating her evening dinner of water buffalo tartare fifteen minutes ago minosama he eyed the leopard nervously it was logged in on the eleventh floor over the secure telex i was reluctant to bother you at this late hour when you live to my age you no longer have the patience for sleep there is so much to do and so little time two or three hours are all i allow myself now he tossed the paper onto his desk then rose strolled to the darkened window and gently pushing neko aside gazed down below the neonlighted streets of tokyos ueno district blazed in a way this news is welcome perhaps the money is no longer in the hands of an incompetent i have always preferred doing business with a professional you would consider dealing with him the subordinate in dark suit and crisp white shirt tried to mask the surprise in his voice the oyabun had never let himself be blackmailed you seem startled he smiled then walked over and extracted a raw steak from the cooler in the corner neko dropped to her haunches as he tossed it to her dont be ive spent a lifetime in negotiation that much his subordinate knew was true tanzan mino had seen more deals than most men would in a hundred lifetimes the most important ones had been the backroom kind for thirtyfive years hed funneled vast chunks of laundered cash to the ruling liberal democratic partys leading politicians and as a result he enjoyed final say over all its major decisions dictating the choice of cabinet ministers even prime ministers he was the undisputed godfather of japans kuroi kiri black mist the unseen world of political deal making the subordinate also admired tanzan minos discretion after his ascension to kingpin of the ldp us interests had funneled over million in cash bribes through him to japans most powerful political figures much of it handled by the lockheed corporation in return that corporation received over billion in sales to japans government and civilian airlines while the cia got to sleep easy knowing americas interests were receiving the close attention of japans decision makers but then when newspapers finally broke the story that lockheeds american money had reached the highest levels of the ldp tanzan mino arranged for a rival kuromaku yoshio kodama to take the fall as befitted a true professional he escaped without a hint of scandal it was a deft move that brought him much prestige among those in the circles of power besides with a yakuza income in the billions he certainly needed none of the lockheed money himself his perennial concern as everyone also knew was what to do with all his cash by the late fifties mino industries group already owned real estate shipping lines construction companies trucking concerns newspapers baseball teams film companies even banks eventually when japan couldnt absorb any more investment hed expanded abroad opening luxurious offices in other southeast asian cities including new digs in manilas makati the wall street of asia in hong kong in singapore a favorite yakuza town for recruiting prostitutes in taipei and on and on but still there was the money and more money kenji nogamis predecessor had finally suggested the perfect solution to tanzan minos cash dilemma the safest most welcome haven for mino industries excess money was just across the pacific on the island of hawaii where his investments could be protected by the american fleet at pearl harbor in the early sixties he opened a branch of his shadow investment company shoshu kagai in honolulu and today he was through dummy corporations the largest landowner in the state having long since solidified his ties with former militarists and prominent rightists in the japanese business community tanzan mino turned abroad in the early seventies offering deals and support to pacific rim strongmen such as chiang kaishek syngman rhee ferdinand marcos all of it however had merely been preparation for this his final objective he was about to reclaim japanese territory lost in the war open soviet asia for japan and pillage the worlds leading space programall in one synergistic strike best of all he was going to do it using foreign gaijin money any yakuza understood well the truth of that classic banking precept if a man owes you a hundred dollars you have power over him if he owes you a million dollars he has power over you tanzan mino his subordinate knew had no intention of handing over half a trillion dollars of yakuza capital to the soviet union japans longtime military adversary only a fool would risk that kind of financial exposure and tanzan mino was no fool which was why he had arranged to tap into the most freewheeling capital pool of them all eurodollars the money would be raised in london from thousands of anonymous investors through a standard baitandswitch then passed through tokyo banks no one least of all the stupid soviets would have the slightest idea what was going on the scenario was brilliant japanese financial industrial and technological muscle used in concert to realize the ultimate strategic global coup his lieutenants were unanimous in their admiration the mans name is vance tanzan mino asked hai minosama michael vance we ran his name through the computer on the eleventh floor and the printout showed that he once was with the cia the open file ended almost exactly eight years ago however and all information subsequent to that vance cia he felt a sharp pain in his chest a wrench hai minosama the file says he was involved in some difficulties that arose over a clandestine funding arrangement but the rest of our data here are restricted to be accessed only by your opening his file will not be necessary tanzan minos voice boomed from the shadows as you wish the kobun bowed to the silhouette of his back still puzzled in any case we have reason to believe he is connected to the nsa cryptographer he continued nervously disturbed by the oyabuns change of moodthe woman we have what he snapped back from his reverie his voice still part of the shadows from the window we suspect that the terms he wants to discuss in exchange for the funds may involve her in some way when our people questioned her in greece she claimed that a man named vance had a duplicate copy of the protocol at the time we had no idea and now you think this is the same man his steely eyes narrowed again hai so deshoo it does lend credibility to his claim he has access to the funds if he is involved in both our problems he has been involved in my problems before at last he thought this was going to be more poetic than hed realized if he knows where the protocol is then then he thinks he is dealing from a position of strength tanzan mino allowed himself a tiny smile i would like to contact him directly through the secure facilities at westminster union hai minosama the man bowed again i can so inform nogamisan in london below in the blazing streets of ueno the traffic continued to flow time time was slipping away authorize it he turned back his silver hair backlighted from the window once we have him perhaps both problems can be solved at once and he told himself i can finally settle an account that has been outstanding far too long but i want this solved now no more delays and bungling the sharpness in his voice momentarily startled neko who growled her readiness for another steak then dropped into a defensive crouch hai minosama a sharp crisp bow i will transmit your wishes to nogamisan immediately what news do we have of the woman we know she is in london our people there have located the hotel where she is staying then dont waste any more time already two attempts by my london oyabun to recover the protocol have been mishandled he sacrificed three men two of them were like sons to me now im beginning to think vance was responsible we still do not know what happened in greece the darkeyed kobun watched with relief as neko returned her attention to the window tail switching authorities there advise that all our men were found shot one in crete and two at delphi they have an investigation underway but they only will say that different weapons were used in each case they will be avenged tanzan mino flexed his knuckles together thoughtfully feeling his resolve strengthen i am sending four kobun to london tonight my personal boeing is being fueled and readied as we speak tell them i will radio initial instructions after they are in flight further orders will be channeled through the docklands office but the man vance if the woman is part of the deal he wants in order to forward the funds then that is all his dark eyes had grown strangely opaque as soon as ive completed my arrangement with him they will kill her tuesday pm the meeting was in the north quadrant of the hokkaido facility in the senior staff briefing room the project kurirovat ivan semenovich lemontov was at the head of the table as comoderator flanked on his left was petr ivanovich gladkov the youthful director of aeronautics felix vasilevich budnikov robust director of flight control systems and andrei petrovich androv director of propulsion systems on lemontovs right was the other comoderator the japanese project director taro ikeda seated across the metal table facing them all was yuri andreevich androv we will begin todays agenda by reviewing monday mornings test flight ikeda began speaking in russian he was chairing the meeting as though by mutual consent soviet booster technology and aerodynamic knowhow might be what made the project go but when all was said and done it was the money that talked and the project financing was japanese the pilots report will be our first item yuri nodded and glanced at the notes on the table before him make this quick he told himself im happy to report that once again the handling characteristics of the vehicle correlated closely with our upandaway simulation in the fujitsu sx on takeoff the vehicle rotated very nicely into a liftoff attitude of six point five degrees my target attitude was seven point five degrees and once id captured that i accelerated out to seven hundred knots then climbed to fortynine thousand feet for the first series of maneuver blocksthe roll maneuvers pitch maneuvers and yaw maneuversintended to verify handling characteristics and control activity at high altitude as on all other flights the directional stability was excellent with a very large restoring moment in the yaw maneuvers one rudder kick gave me an overshoot but the vehicle immediately steadied and the pitch maneuvers again showed that her actuating system enhances stability very fast in fact all maneuvers matched our simulations within acceptable limits i also did some banks up to fifty degrees to get the stick force as i pulled back the turn performance matched specifications with very little control activity required i also carried out some bankto bank maneuvers to get the roll rates the block included quarter stick half stick and threequarter stick very stable the augmented controls did not move out that is move around a lot he paused for breath stealing a glance at the room just bury them in data overload he thought dont give them time to ask questions before anyone could speak he pressed on i also took the vehicle through the prescribed block of throttle maneuvers remember that in ramjet mode the engines are fancontrolled with all controls in the initial stage as scheduled i pulled all the throttles to idle and then took them all the way up to rated thrust and as always they were very responsive and didnt have to hunt for their setting good ikeda said but the main reason exactly as scheduled at hours i terminated jp feed to the portside outboard trident causing an unstart with asymmetric thrust i expected adverse yaw as in the roll maneuver but the control system stabilized it immediately i also assumed thered be some sideslip so i put rudder in but then i realized handling was going to be feet on the floor this vehicle is a dream he paused to smile anyway i then initiated restart at hours he shoved forward the documents piled by his side these charts indicate that rpm achieved ninety percent nominal within eleven seconds all the ive already reviewed those ikeda interrupted not looking down we are pleased with the results of your maneuver blocks major androv and also the vehicles turboramjet restart characteristics he cleared his throat however there was another maneuver last night that does not please us here it comes yuri thought the fucker wants to know what happened get your story ready as you are undoubtedly aware ikeda continued the japanese space program has an advanced spacecraft tracking center at tsukuba science city with two facom mr primary computers the center is linked to a tracking antenna at katsura near tokyo as well as to one at the masuda station near our spacecraft launch pads on tanegeshima he glared at the younger androv you are cognizant of that are you not i am he met ikedas gaze we engage those tracking stations for your test flights because of the altitudes involved when daedalus is airborne all their other assignments are temporarily shunted to our deepspace tracking facility on okinawa in the south he paused again as though to control his anger in other words we have arranged it so that the stations at katsura and masuda are dedicated to your flights whenever you take her aloft you are aware of that as well of course yuri started to smile but stopped himself then we are puzzled major androv how do you explain the following events at hours you shut down your airtrafficcontrol transponder that was proper since you were scheduled to switch to classified frequencies but you did not report immediately on those frequencies as specified in the mission flight plan for approximately twelve minutes we had no navigational information from you whatsoever also radio and computer linkages were interrupted an inadvertent mistake yuri said shifting we thought so at first in fact both our tracking stations automatically performed a computerized frequency scan thinking youd switched to the wrong channels by accident but you had not you deliberately terminated all communications we want to know why i was pretty busy in the cockpit just then i guess yes we assumed you would be since you insisted on shutting down the navigational computers ikeda continued his voice like the icy wind whistling across the island we find your next action particularly troubling at that time we still had you on tracking radar and we observed that as soon as the transponder was turned off you altered your heading one hundred forty degrees south over the japan sea then you performed some unscheduled maneuver perhaps a snaproll and immediately began a rapid descent at that moment we lost you on the radar with no radio contact we feared it was a flameout that youd crashed the vehicle but then at exactly hours you reappeared on the katsura radar ascending at thirty eight thousand feet at that time radio contact also was resumed ikeda paused trying to maintain his composure what explanation do you have for this occurrence and for what appeared to be an explicit radarevasion maneuver i dont know anything about the radar i just wanted to check out handling characteristics under different conditions it was only a minor addon to the scheduled maneuvers which is why i didnt which is why you didnt include it in your flight report ikedas dark eyes bored into him is that what you expect us to assume the soviet team was exchanging nervous glances they all knew yuri androv was sometimes what the americans called a cowboy but this unauthorized hotdogging sounded very irresponsible none of them had heard about it until now an oversight there was so much major androv ikeda interrupted him you are on official leave from the soviet air force no one in this room has the military rank to discipline you but i would like you to know that we view this infraction as a very grave circumstance youre right it was stupid time to knuckle under he thought let me formally apologize to the project management here and now it was a grave lapse of judgment on my part yuri andreevich i must say im astonished the elder androv finally spoke up i had no idea you would ever take it into your head to do something like this to violate a formal test sequence he smiled weakly i just well i always like to try and expand the envelope a little see what a new birds got in her and he told himself i did just now i found out two things first i can evade the bastards tracking stations by switching off the transponder then going on the deck i can defeat their network and disappear i needed to find out if it could be done and now i have great ikedas other little slip merely confirms what id begun to suspect this fucking plane is designed to major androv this unacceptable behavior must not be repeated ikedas eyes were filled with anger and his tone carried an unmistakable edge of threat do you understand never this project has far too much at stake to jeopardize it by going outside stipulated procedure i understand yuri bowed his head do you the project directors voice rose uncharacteristically if any such reckless action is ever repeated i warn you now that there will be consequences very grave consequences bet your ass therell be consequences yuri thought because the next time i do it im going to smoke out mino industries whole game plan therell be consequences like you never dreamed of you smoothtalking scheming son of a bitch tuesday pm what does it tell you yuri shaded his eyes from the glare of the hangar fluorescents and pointed directing his fathers gaze toward the dark gray of the fuselage above them the old man squinted and looked up can you see it the underside is darker and its honeycombed the air scoops even the engine housings everywhere very faint but its there andrei androv stared a moment before he spoke interesting odd i hadnt noticed it before but i assume thats just part of the skin undersupport wrong just beneath the titaniumcomposite exterior is some kind of carbonferrite material deliberately extruded into honeycombing but you almost cant see it in direct light he placed his hand on his fathers shoulder now come on and let me show you something else he led the elder androv toward the truckmounted stair gleaming steel that led up into the open hatch just aft of the wide wings lets go up into the aft cargo bay thats where its exposed the japanese technicians and mechanics were scurrying about paying them virtually no heed as they mounted the steel steps and then disappeared into the cavernous underbelly of the daedalus the interior of the bay was lighted along the perimeter with highvoltage sodium lamps have you ever been inside here yuris voice echoed slightly as he asked the question then waited he already suspected the answer of course the propulsion staff all had a quick tour several months ago back before just what i suspected a quick walkthrough now i want you to see something else im going to perform an experiment on this aluminum strut he extracted a pocket knife and quickly opened it this frame looks like metal right but watch he rammed the blade into the supporting ibeam that ran along the side of the cargo bay yuri what it had passed through almost as though the beam were made of styrofoam its not metal its a layered carboncarbon composite just like the flaps a damned expensive material even for them for the leading edges maybe even all the exterior it makes sense because of the skin temperature in the hypersonic regime but why in here inside why use it for these interior structural components perhaps it was to economize on weight i dont know the old man wrinkled his alreadywrinkled brow wrong again now look up there he directed his fathers gaze to the ceiling of the bay notice how the lining is sawtoothshaped ive seen this kind of design before weights not the reason so what are you saying the old mans confusion was genuine youre out of touch with the real world he smiled grimly maybe youve been buried at baikonur too long with your head in string quartets and classical greek this carboncarbon composite is used for all the structural elements theres virtually no metal in this plane at all and the shape of the fuselage all those sweeping curves and streamlining its probably smart aerodynamic design sure but it serves another purpose too this vehicle has been well thought out what do you mean dont you get it radar the shape of the fuselage is deliberately designed to diffuse and deflect radar and all that honeycombing on the underside is radarabsorbing then this in here the carboncarbon composites used for this airframe and that sawtoothing up there will just absorb what radar energy does get through he turned back this vehicle is as radardefeating as the us stealth bomber maybe more so some of our experimental planes use the same techniques but why i dont understand theres no reason youre right about that theres no need for all this radarevasive design all these special materials unless he paused then checked below to make sure that no technicians were within earshot last night when i took her down i maintained the yaw at ninety degrees making sure their tracking antenna at katsura could only see the underside of the fuselage and guess what the real story slipped out there at the meeting this plane just vanished off their radar screens disappeared but now ikeda knows i know the elder androv stared at him for years people had told him his son was too smart to be a jet jockey they were right all these years hed never given him enough credit i think im beginning to understand what youre saying for a space platform to have exactly the underside of this vehicle has an almost nonexistent radar signature probably about like a mediumsized bird all youd have to do is darken it some more and its gone now what the hells the purpose the elder androv didnt respond immediately he was still puzzling over the staff meeting hed never seen the project director so upset admittedly yuri had violated procedures and violated them egregiously but still ikedas flare of anger was a side of the man not previously witnessed by anybody on the soviet team also he continued to wonder at their sudden rush to a hypersonic test flight pushing it ahead by months had created a lot of fasttrack problems why was mino industries suddenly in such a hurry and now this mystery yuri was right an airbreathing orbital platform for nearspace research didnt need to evade radar the world would be cheering it not shooting at it very puzzling and troubling yuri youve got a point none of this makes any sense damned right it doesnt and theres more you should see the ecm equipment on this thing the electronic countermeasures for defeating hostile surveillance and defense systems its all state of the art andrei androvs dark eyes clouded why wasnt i informed of any of this your propulsion team your aeronautics specialists all your technical people have been given green eyeshades and assigned neat little compartments nobodys getting the whole picture besides i dont know anybody here whos really on top of the latest classified stealth technology well the truth is none of us has had time to think about it the old man had never seemed older let me tell you a secret yuri lowered his voice to something approaching a whisper lemontov has thought about it our little project kurirovat that cpsu hack thinks hes going to take this plane back home and copy the design to build a fleet of hypersonicwhatever you want to call theseinvisible death machines maybe he hinted as much to me about four nights ago i absolutely wont hear of it andrei androvs eyes were grim with determination my dear father yuri used the affectionate russian diminutive you may not have a damned thing to say about it im convinced lemontov or whoever gives him his orders has every intention of trying to convert this vehicle into a weapons delivery system and mino industries i also now believe has already built one right here its ready to go but whichever way space research is way down everybodys list so the real question is whos going to try and fuck who first i guess the last person able to answer that question is me the old mans eyes were despondent as he ran his fingers through his long mane of white hair yuri laughed and draped his arm around his father once again well nobody else around here seems to know either or care but what are we going to do ive got a little plan cooking i dont want to talk about it now but lets just say im going to screw them all count on it chapter thirteen tuesday am when michael vance walked into the thirdfloor trading room of kenji nogamis westminster union bank it had just opened for morning business computer screens were scrolling green numbers traders in shirtsleeves were making their first calls to paris and zurich the pounds and dollars and deutsche marks and yen were starting to flow nogami in a conservative charcoal black suit nervously led the way his glassedin office was situated on the corner close to the floor action with only a low partition to separate him from the yells of traders and the clack of computers it was his japanese style of handson management a oneness with the troops england the land that virtually invented class privilege had never seen anything remotely comparable with this but there was something ominous about his mood as he rang for morning tea vance noticed it the openness of the previous afternoon was gone replaced by a transparent unease a uniformed japanese office lady brought their brew dark and strong on a silver service with thin wedgewood cups vance needed it his nightcap with eva at the savoy had lasted almost two hours but when it was finished part of the play was in place first thing this morning still recovering from last nights encounter they had shared a pot of english breakfast and then shed gone back to work on the translation of the protocol he was still waking up michael i received a reply all nogamis synthetic british bonhomie had evaporated i think he is willing to talk however there are terms and his people want to see you he also mentioned all parties i take it others are involved there is someone else his hangover was dissipating rapidly now thanks to the tea but i think shes had all the contact shes going to have with his people nogami glanced up sharply i dont know what this is about but the meeting could be held on neutral ground i assure you there would be nothing to fear tell him he can forget it youre free to telex back your own conditions he shrugged then tried to smile im merely the messenger here i have no idea what this is about and i dont think i really want to know ill try my best to keep you out of it but that may not be entirely possible michael ive handled my part of our bargain ive set up the dialogue nogamis voice was barely audible above the din of traders what about yours im still working on it there isnt much time his brow wrinkled some kind of preliminary offering has to be scheduled tomorrow the day after at the latest well why not get rolling doing that should help smoke out an answer for you for everybody what do you mean if the bonds are reallybut first lets see what tokyos got to say is there a deal or not perhaps his reply will give you some idea he removed a shiny sheet of paper from a manila envelope and passed it over its why i rang you so early it was telexed here using our secure lines during the night see what you make of it i must admit i find it a trifle cryptic as vance took the sheet it reminded him fleetingly of the paper alex novosty had given him that morning atop the acropolis the heading was exactly the same yep he thought weve hit paydirt across the top was one line of type bold and assertive the daedalus corporation advisory received hours ceo has reviewed and requests direct contact with all parties immediately the money must be received by shokin gaigoku no later than close of business tomorrow tokyo time authorize reply through secure facilities at westminster union no other communication channel acceptable looks like he went for it vance handed back the sheet if you want to reply you can use our telex here just as he asks ken how good is his word if he agrees to lay off will he stick to it or should i be expecting a double cross you know his style of operation pretty well what do you think for my own part ive always been able to trust him he has a reputation for doing what he says maybe thats all about to change hes always played for big stakes but this time its a whole new level its global and ive got a feeling hes not going to let niceties stand in the way it could be his last big score and the eurodollar debentures he wants me to underwrite nogami studied him you already know what theyre for dont you i think i might have a rough idea i suspected as much he sighed all right then how do you want to handle this to begin with no direct contact everything goes through third parties you can send the reply im not going to start out using his rules bad precedent and i want him to know that if anything happens to either of us he gets nailed the protocol goes to the newspapers the protocol nogamis brow furrowed again hell know what i mean we just need to use the word as you wish and the message that if hell keep his end of the bargain and lay off then he can access the money but part of the deal is i plan to keep a line on it at least for the time being what do you mean to start out its going to be handled in the triedand true hotmoney way the hundred million will be used to purchase british gilts which will then be held here at the bank and used as collateral for a loan the standard laundry cycle nogami smiled almost makes me nostalgic for the old days its only going to be standard up to a point after that the setup gets a twist the loan will then be used to acquire a special hundredmillion first issue of those mino industries corporate debentures youre supposed to float to be bought entirely by me and thus he gets his funds all freshly laundered and clean and untraceable nogami nodded approvingly style michael style you always yes and no you see i never really let go instead of ten year zerocoupons those debentures are going to be a little uniquetheyll be redeemable at any time by the holder on twentyfour hours notice and youll be the holder nogami suddenly seemed considerably less pleased only indirectly ill assign powerofattorney to a third party if any unfortunate accidents happen to me or to another individual ill specify the bonds will be redeemed immediately and if he defaults doesnt pony up the full hundred million on the spot he can kiss the rest of his big scheme goodbye because a default by mino industries would make the front page of the financial times he wont be able to give away the rest of that bogus paper hes instant history in this town michael nogamis frown deepened ive never heard of he gets his money all right but i retain a firm grip on his cojones those are pretty rugged terms i doubt hell agree its the only way we play he gets his money cleaned but i come away with a hundredmilliondollar insurance policy i hope we can do business because otherwise hell never see those funds period guaranteed then if youll word the language the way you want it ill transmit it he paused but i can tell you right now he will not be happy this is very irregular also im not sure i want to start issuing those mino industries debentures no matter what their maturities once on that road how will i ever turn back youre putting me on the spot here youll be taken care of look ken we cant stop the man from selling phony mino industries paper to european suckers nobody can if you back away hell just make an end run around you and arrange it some other way we both know that so what am i supposed to do set up what i want to get me some leverage ill take it from there its not just the hundred million hell have hanging over his head theres also the protocol i mentioned i want him to know im in a position to go public with it if he doesnt lay off that together with the threat of exposing his plan to defraud eurodollar tax dodgers should be enough to keep him in line whatever you say he looked dubious but im convinced nothing is going to go forward without a meeting therell be no getting around it lets just send that telex and find out tuesday pm and well be doing it using mino industries debentures novosty listened startled corporate bonds the black mercedesheavily tinted bulletproof windowswas parked on the side street behind the savoy just above victoria embankment gardens vance and alex novosty were in the front seat vance had the keys it was part of the deal thats going to be our collateral were going to put them up as surety with one of the gogo japanese banks here and borrow back the hundred million if i understand this right the moneys going to be in two places at once michael its smoke and mirrors what do you care if the japanese banks here wont lend on bearer bonds from mino industries what the hell will they do youll have your cash clean and be over the hill before the whole thing goes down the drain i have to do this dont i he sighed i have to front the street action both this and the other part its give and take alex nobody in this cars a virgin youve done worse besides think of it this way in a couple of days youll have your hundred million back and maybe you can go home again in one piece im saving your twotiming russian ass for chrissake so i expect a little gratitude i suppose i should be thankful but somehow he was lighting a cigarette after the black lighter clicked shut he peered through the cloud of smoke but what about you where can you go when this house of cards collapses you know it will it has to eva and ill both be out of here too god willing he paused his mind racing okay now tell me what else you know about this prototype novostys voice was weary you guessed correctly ive been afraid to talk about it to anybody but now youre right its an advanced airplane thats all i know for sure the word i hear is that its faster than anything the world has ever seen much faster a marvel of high technology we suspected that from the runway he glanced out the tinted windows the late morning above the thames was still only a glimmer through the misty haze exactly how fast is it supposed to be many many times the speed of sound ten maybe even twenty who knows i think the project is at least a decade ahead of the us or europe its almost ready for a first full test flight or so i understand needless to say its supposedly intended for peaceful uses space research but get serious tanzan mino plays for keeps all the way and you were laundering the seed money for the deal when i got involved i had no idea novosty drew on his cigarette i swear it when viktor fedorovich volodin asked me to help he said it was merely part of a secret trade agreement the hardliners were being kept out of it now i realize he probably didnt know the real story either right it was only later that i pieced together the rest about the prototype and its capabilities figure it out mino industries is about to become the ultimate arms supplier to the world sole retailer of the newest musthave weapon and the soviets and the americans get to join each other neckandneck in a debt race buying them up your military is just like ours they never saw a new weapons system they didnt like inevitably he was trying to keep his composure but i dont see how you can stop it were going to start by nailing the godfather in his tracks and youre part of the team so youve got to keep yourself together remember our agreement last night what you have to do michael tanzan mino is running out of time i hear that the prototype cant be unveiled or the protocol brought before the diet for a vote until the powers in the liberal democratic party are well placated this time its not just insider stock trading info hes giving out its laundered cash since the moneys still here in london hes very upset you say you think the whole thing is scheduled to go forward in less than a week vance studied him but its possible only if the hundred million is there in hand bribes my friend or as they call it kosaihi all the way up and down the line he smiled wryly and rubbed at his beard michael you of all people should know how things work over there very little has changed really from the old days when the cia was running half of japans politicians its an honorable tradition to take care of the right people but the timing is crucial no kosaihi payoffs no deal thats what i hear everybody knows the diet is a rubber stamp everything is decided at the top a consensus among the leaders of the liberal democratic party but the behindthescenes powers in the ldp refuse to endorse such a controversial prospect a partnership with russia unless its worth their while at least thats what i hear so the payoff money must be distributed in tidy untraceable bundles with fancy giftwrappings and bows its the traditional way michael the dictates of proper etiquette you know the system then it shouldnt be too hard to deal with the man at the top hes in a bind i seriously doubt he will be in a mood for compromise this time hes used to getting what he wants no questions asked novostys dark eyes were knowing i shouldnt think that would be news to you considering how you it has a familiar ring but this time maybe itll be different michael im in a hopeless position you know that if the funds arent delivered to tokyo and soon god only knows what will happen but if i dont return the money to moscow i am also a dead man i dont see any realistic way out of this either way im finished there is no way a hundred million dollars can be in two places at once smoke and mirrors like you said smoke and mirrors he shoved the key into the ignition and the engine roared to life look were dealing with perceptions now and a tight schedule when this thing explodes the moneys going to be the least of anybodys problems youre right theres also the matter of the protocol if its leaked before the treaty is formally announced ill be blamed well be blamed he will track us to the ends of the earth you know it and i know it its a poker game to win you just have to keep up the bluff the problem michael is that hes not bluffing tuesday pm as you can see its all just numbers eva was speaking in russian as she pointed to the screen thats how i received it and the nsa cray supercomputer i ran it through couldnt find the des key interesting vera karanova studied the lines of ice blue numbers then turned and gazed out the hotel room window the late morning traffic blared on the strand but i know what must be in it it is a sellout otherwise our intelligence service would have been informed youre free to make any assumptions you like im still trying to find something that will crack it vera studied her with dark unbelieving eyes we know you are the best there is i find it hard to believe that well take it or leave it eva switched off the computer and turned around im still working on it i havent given up yet with a sigh comrade karanova eased herself gracefully onto the plush couch in the sitting area then she exhaled impatiently we know something will happen any day now are you sure you did not break any part of the encryption she looked up no dates no deadlines nothing eva poured more cold tea into her china cup she did not bother offering seconds to her russian guest the time was approaching noon and shed only gotten two hours of translating done the day was slipping away and her head still hurt from the dregs of alcohol then you have nothing to tell me we are all wasting time vera declared finally rising michael will keep his end of the bargain dont worry moving money is his specialty so im told but if he does not return the embezzled funds by the end of the week if he said hell handle it hell handle it eva handed her the fur coat that had been tossed across their rumpled bed it was real sable the genuine article she used to have one too now if you dont mind as we agreed i have arranged for an individual from our embassy to be here outside your door around the clock the first shift came this morning with me and is here now inconspicuous he is wearing a tradesmans uniform how about the lobby i have also arranged for one of our people to be there as well we havent informed the hotel staff for obvious reasons so we will rotate our people downstairs to avoid suspicion is that the best you can do its the best i intend to do her voice was cold getting even this much for you was not easy none of this is happening officially i had to pull strings its appreciated ill know the extent of your appreciation when the embezzled funds are returned naturally eva said and opened the door as promised there was indeed an overweight russian security man standing there wearing an illfitting telephone repairmans coveralls his looks wouldnt have deceived anybody but maybe that was the point she waited till vera karanova disappeared into the elevator and then she turned back flashing a thin smile at her new bodyguard he didnt look very competent but he was probably better than nothing probably unless he wasnt there to protect them unless he was there to make sure they didnt check out and disappear okay back to work she closed the door and locked it then she took a deep breath clicked on the zenith and called up the active file the part of the protocol shed translated this morning had begun expanding on the elements of the pending deal the soviets were agreeing to open their space program completely to the japanese effectively making it a joint venture in return mino industries and the japanese government would join with the ussr to create a new trade bloc comprising all the asian economic dynamos that currently were allies of the united states russia shared some islands along with its space expertise and in return it got bottomless financingand a trading axis with japan that would eventually totally undermine americas hegemony in the pacific the new economic alliance an orwellian eastasia would have the ussr as one superpower cornerstone japan the other within sixty days of the formal delivery of the prototype the ussr will provide representatives of mino industries group with full and unrestricted access to all facilities at the baikonur cosmodrome the space program of the ussr will be integrated with that of japanall personnel equipment and launch facilities being operated thereafter as a single unified entity future costs of the combined space program will be borne equally by japan and the ussr japanese satellites and japanese astronauts subsequently will be launched from either the baikonur cosmodrome or the tanegeshima space center as schedules mandate although the level of japanesesoviet trade is currently twice that between the united states and the soviet union it accounts for only percent of total japanese overseas trade through joint ventures arranged by mino industries group this amount will be increased over the ensuing fiveyear period to a sum representing not less than ten percent of all japanese foreign trade all tariff barriers between the ussr and japan will be phased out over the same fiveyear period as part of an asian trade and diplomatic initiative the ussr will join with mino industries croup to begin governmental and private steps toward establishing a pacific basin tarifffree trade zone encompassing the ussr japan south korea north korea taiwan vietnam hong kong singapore and indonesia all offices contracts and trade agreements currently held by mino industries croup will henceforth be reopened to encompass the representatives and interests of the ussr it boggled evas mind the alliance might be partly military but the japanese and the soviets were no fools they realized full well that the real battleground of the next century would be an economic struggle with the ultimate aim of every country being to surpass the united states she stared at the blue screen mesmerized this secret protocol was a detailed battle plan whereby the soviets and the japanese provided each other exactly what theyd need to emerge as the dominant superpowers of the twentyfirst century synergism in hightech control of space a trade bloc a defense allianceall of it was there but governments werent that smart they usually had to be dragged into doing what was sensible strategically which meant that this whole scenario had to be the brainchild of some private genius only one man in japan according to michael had the money and clout to put a deal like this together his name was tanzan mino a yakuza godfather incredible what other bombshells did the protocol hold she wondered what was left the answer to that last remaining question was the prototype it had to be the weapon to end all weapons great but did the soviets really know what they were getting into the euphoria of the night before was rapidly dissipating there were too many chances for the plan to slip up mike always figured he could play these things close on the wind tempt fate but he hadnt always been lucky sometimes his luck ran out and somehow she had a feeling this was about to be one of those times tuesday pm satosama ohayo gozaimasu kenji nogami rose then bowed low as jiro sato and his darksuited bodyguard were ushered into the westminster union banks upstairs dining room the walls were ice gray with a goldleafed momoyama screen depicting a fierce eagle perched on a pine branch mounted on one side on the other was a modern oil painting an impressionistic rendering of the rising sun of the japanese flag both were symbols intended to impress nogamis city guests with japans new financial power ohayo jiro sato nodded lightly in return signifying his superior rank in the floortoceiling mirror at the far end of the room his lightgrey hair had turned to blue steel in the subdued lighting it now matched the hardness of his eyes jiro sato born in osaka sixty years ago was the mino gumis london oyabun the man in charge he had lean cheeks and wore a pinstriped suit and dark sunglasses that further camouflaged his already expressionless eyes his dark felt hat almost looked like a bowler although that traditional city headwear was no longer de rigueur in londons financial district had it been he most certainly would have worn one blending in was what he was all about nogami waited until his guest had settled into one of the molded birch chairs at the end of the long oak table then he seated himself and clapped for sake the bankers personal chef a licensed artisan he had stolen from tokyos exclusive edo club was already preparing raw fugu the sometimeslethal blowfish to be served with scorching wasabi on rare shino ware it was a japanese power lunch jiro satos career and that of kenji nogami had been entwined for thirty years they had always been in charge of tanzan minos financial matters had never worked at street level no tattoos no missing finger digits they were part of the brains not the brawn of the minogumi although they both knew that a certain bond issue of a hundred billion eurodollars was the purpose of the luncheon they gave no hint as their traditional small talk began with saucers of sake and a learned discussion of the momoyama screen on the wall thought to have been commissioned by the shogun toyotomi hideyoshi at the end of the sixteenth century from there their chat expanded to the glories of momoyama art then the nightingale floors of shogun hideyoshis kyoto palacebeveled boards designed to announce silent intrudersand finally to hideyoshis betrayal at the hands of ieyasu tokugawa the oblique topics were standard the japanese way of beginning a business meeting jiro satos official position was ceo of the londonbased nippon shipbuilding company in that role he supervised the minogumis london interests with an iron hand as was expected by those who served him and by his superiors in tokyo nippon shipbuilding built no ships nor had it for twenty years instead it laundered tanzan minos hot money funds flashed daily over the satellite link from tokyo and investments ranged from real estate to british gilts to the most arcane products of the financial markets money laundering was but the latest enterprise of the yakuza an ancient brotherhood rooted in over three hundred years of japanese history the kana symbols for the syllables yakuza were the same as those for the numbers eight nine and threea total of twenty which was a losing number in japanese gaming the losers that was what the japanese underworld with ironic humility had chosen to call itself in earlier centuries the yakuza were carnival operators gamblers fastmoving purveyors of questionable wares they also took it upon themselves to be a kind of private militia protecting a defenseless citizenry from the predations of aristocratic warlords they were in their own minds at least robin hoods who championed the common man while also not incidentally catering to his penchant for entertainment excitement and sin these days the yakuza considered themselves the last heirs of the samurai but they still supplied escapism be it in the form of nightclubs gambling or amphetamines and in so doing they had grown fabulously rich jiro satos job in london was to reinvest and clean a portion of that wealth nippon shipbuilding was headquartered in an eight story building in the new docklands redevelopment yet another expensive architectural nonentity in that multibilliondollar new city on the banks of the thames downriver from the financial district it was in many ways the perfect location for a yakuza beachhead unlike the older parts of london docklands was readymade for the parvenu since everything there was new and anonymous yet it stood only minutes away from the citythe best of both worlds the london operation was going well and with the recent construction of their new docklands financial complex at a cost of fifty million pounds sterling matters were on a solid footing jiro satos relations with kenji nogami had until today been conducted within the strict social dictates of yakuza etiquette as the london oyabun he had in fact bent the rules in journeying into the city for their meeting today convention required that nogami should have come to him however a recent turn of events necessitated a new concern with discretion a muckraking series in the telegraph two months before had accused the nippon shipbuilding company of being an organizedcrime front consequently he now had to take pains not to connect his own operations with the workings of westminster union it was better all around if kenji nogami were not seen entering the docklands office by some snooping newspaper hack nogami was a useful asset who needed to be kept above press speculation also jiro sato was beginning to wonder if the banker would actually have come kenji nogami was rapidly losing touch with the old ways none of this would ever have been known from the light talk at lunch it was only when the meal was over and the staffers had discreetly absented themselves with deep bows that things finally got down to matters at hand but even then as tradition required the opening was japanese and indirect nogamisan sato jiro said as he leaned back and reached for his fifth go of sake do you recall the famous story comparing the three great shoguns who ruled during that unsettled period surrounding the momoyama the tale says they each were once asked what they would do if they had a nightingale who refused to sing nogami nodded and sipped from his sake saucer of course he knew the story every japanese did you doubtless recall that ieyasu tokugawa replied i will merely wait until it does sing he was a patient man toyotomi hideyoshi by contrast said he would prefer to try and reason with the bird hoping to convince it to sing he paused and smiled sometimes gentle persuasion does work but the great warlord oda nobunaga declared he would just ring the wretched creatures neck he had no patience with disobedience perhaps ieyasu tokugawas answer was the wisest satosama the bankers eyes were defiant he also enjoyed the luxury of time nogamisan i suppose the pace of affairs was more leisurely back then sato set down his black raku sake saucer and lit a peace cigarette the unfiltered japanese brand these days events do not always allow us such luxuries no matter how much we might wish it sometimes it is necessary to proceed forcefully there is always a problem when the bird finds the song is unsuitable nogami again sipped from his own saucer meeting satos gaze when the notes are discordant jiro sato listened thoughtfully appreciating nogamis indirect and poetic answer then the banker went on ninjo satosama for over three centuries ninjo has been what made our brotherhood unique are we to forget that now they both knew what he meant ninjo was uniquely japanese because no other people in the world had japans sense of tribal unity the western terms chivalry or compassion carried only a superficial sense of ninjo it was the inborn golden rule of japanese culture that surfaced daily in expressions of racial togetherness support and cooperation it also was a deepseated part of the yakuza tradition great oyabun of the past liked to point out that the yakuzas honoring of ninjo was what set their brotherhood apart from the american mafia the yakuza have historically served the people nogami went on yakuza do not run dishonest gambling tables even if the victims are to be gaijin it is not the yakuza way to perpetrate fraud which is what the ceos eurobond issue amounts to jiro sato did not offer to refute the assertion instead he replied from a different direction his voice soft there is ninjo nogamisan and there is giri which do you respect more he knew he had just presented nogami with a hopeless dilemma giri it was a word no gaijin could ever entirely comprehend the closest a foreign language or a foreign mind could manage was duty but that pale concept missed entirely the reverberations of moral obligation in giri one could never fully repay such indebtedness even with ones life a japanese called it the burden hardest to bear a yakuzas foremost expression of giri was to honor and obey his oyabun the great oyabun of japans leading yakuza syndicates were more than merely godfathers they were confucian elders patriarchs wisdom figures who embodied all the traditions of the clan their authority was absolute and unquestioned kenji nogami owed as much giri to tanzan mino as any man could the tokyo oyabun had made him everything he was it was an obligation he could never fully discharge one look at his face told how his heart was torn but as jiro sato studied nogamis pained eyes he was torn as well tokyo was near to losing confidence in him the ceo had just announced by telex that a team of kobun had been posted to london to assist but if the oyabuns tokyo people had to step in and solve the problem a lot more would be lost than finger digits finally nogami spoke his voice firm perhaps you will be pleased to learn satosama that i am prepared to make certain preliminary accommodations an initial offering of eurobonds will be formally issued tomorrow that is a wise decision jiro sato tried to disguise his surge of relief beneath a mask of unconcern nogami was going to go along after all it will be for one hundred million eurodollars the banker continued and it is already fully subscribed in advance only one hundred million sato felt his iron facade crack what purpose it will provide the immediate funds i understand are now needed after that we can discuss further steps further steps sato thought yes the tokyo oyabun would definitely see to it that there were further steps his bird would sing or else kenji nogami was acting as though obligation giri had ceased to exist but such things were not possible giri lasted forever did nogami think the old ways no longer counted for anything the debentures will be purchased by an american investor nogami went on his voice cutting through the silence his name is vance i have heard of him already sato felt his anger boil vance he knew had the oyabuns hundred million and was trying to hold the entire scenario ransom what he hadnt known until this instant was that kenji nogami was helping him well he thought perhaps the two problems can be solved simultaneously an example is going to be made of vance an example that will also serve to provide a certain recalcitrant bird a needed refresher course in giri yes jiro sato thought the ceos kobun from tokyo are going to arrive to find their work has been done enough face has been lost not to mention three men the situation is intolerable the only way to regain the london offices tattered honor to avenge its disgrace is to resolve the vance situation immediately chapter fourteen tuesday pm its the best i can manage michael nogamis voice was apologetic nobody knows i keep this place not even my wife afternoon business conferences you catch my meaning he smiled and walked on up the sandstone steps the townhouse was in the quiet residential south kensington section of london from the outside it looked to be the perfect safe house so thats how the situation stands now the banker continued tanzan mino has agreed to your terms he even seemed to like the idea of laundering the hundred million one last time through a purchase of mino industries debentures now well see if he sticks to his word youve got leverage at the moment he was fishing for his keys incidentally i should tell you i broke the news to his london oyabun here this afternoon about postponing the rest of the issue he was not pleased its been a bad week for him are you planning to make this break with the organization permanent vance knew it was not something a yakuza would do lightly im still not sure his voice was pained i dont even know if i can the long arm of the tokyo oyabun plenty of reach its not just that nogami was inserting a large key into the front door white with georgian decorations and a leaded glass transom above you understand the kind of obligation we japanese must bear for past favors its onerous but all the same its very real we cant just say thanks for the memories giri vance nodded the burden ah you know yes its called giri and theres nothing we can do about it he was switching on the hall light giri rules our lives vance noticed the floor had a pristine carpet in conservative gray a polished mahogany staircase led to the upper floors nice ken very nice the quintessential bankers pad i have the entire building my little indulgence i keep a few antiques here some of my art you know special things unfortunately i dont have a chance to use it much these days the friend i used to meet here well her husband was transferred back to osaka and i havent had time to come up with a replacement first things first ken you should always make time for living one of my few rules in life you never get another shot he laughed and opened the door leading from the hallway into the parlor suite it smelled slightly musty from disuse im better at giving advice than taking it too old man touche vance shrugged then looked around the spacious drawing room it was furnished in standard english style with overstuffed chairs a victorian fireplace an oak tea caddy and bar but the nineteenthcentury appointments werent what concerned him was it safe michael we both may need this place if your plan doesnt work i dont know where else i can go he walked to the bar a collection of bottles on the bottom tray of the caddy and selected a flask of cognac now could you repeat that story again about the protocol i must confess im dazzled in the limousine driving up from westminster union vance had finally told him the real purpose of the bond issue what the money was going to be used for the banker had listened in silence stunned well to make a long story short youre being used in whats probably going to be the biggest shell game in history tanzan mino steals unsecured billions from european tax evaders and uses it to finance the opening of russias markets for mino industries youre right to bail out now if he pulls it off hell look like a genius but if it backfires and the truth comes out youll get full credit not exactly a terrific downside i didnt get this far exposing myself unnecessarily and i dont intend to start now not for him or anybody then well proceed with plan a this reminds me a lot of the old days he laughed and poured a snifter for each of them heres to the end of giri and the beginning of a new life vance clicked their glasses then took a sip now we need to get our coordination synchronized everything is ready at my end tomorrow morning ill issue the zerocoupon debentures youre going to purchase and youll make the trade after that ill wire your hundred million to tokyo and tanzan mino is taken care of ive simultaneously arranged with sumitomo bank to accept that paper as collateral for a loan youll get the money from them on the spot by the way how do you want it just park it in gilts through the trading desk at moscow narodny bank the new branch on saint swithins lane done nogami nodded now how about the debentures that are sumitomos security and mine whos holding them we japanese still act like gentlemen michael at least up to a point theyve agreed to let me hold them until we close our books at the end of the month i did them a similar favor last year he sipped at his brandy with satisfaction so you can still call them anytime if god help us it comes to that youll have your leverage and tanzan mino will know it if you should have to call them and he defaults hell then have to answer to sumitomo and he wouldnt dare i happen to know they hold a fortymillion dollar mortgage on his new office building down in the docklands theyd eat him and not even blink theres some bad blood between them though i dont know exactly what it is okay so far so good vance looked around the room youre absolutely positive nobody knows about this place its been my little secret for four years now i paid cash and i dont even report the expenses on my tax forms which gives you some idea how i value my privacy so theres absolutely no way anybody could know about it you never came here in your limo only if i came without a driver the way we did today then it sounds clean this place is the least of your worries michael he settled into a chair after my meeting this afternoon i have an idea that the london oyabun jiro sato has every intention of taking things into his own hands to try and break me hes going to push the pacein swordsmanship its called mukatsu kasuru to iu koto hes lost too much face he cant let you get away with this and still control the organization after the debacle in greece hes near to becoming a laughing stock among his own kobun cant tokyo manage him theoretically but the organization is getting a little farflung these days i dont know my instincts tell me hes going to undertake some facesaving on his own just temporarily overlook any agreement you may have with the front office he rose and splashed some more brandy into his glass its going to get rough thats all i know for sure so the sooner you proceed with the rest of your plan the better everythings ready then i suppose its time we wished each other well and got going nogami finished off his brandy and dug the keys from his pocket he jangled them a moment in his hand then tossed them over take them now you might as well secure the place as we leave and start getting used to that tricky front door lock there wont be any time to practice heres to you ken vance saluted him with the snifter then drained it and many thanks if you ever owed me any giri consider it paid that works both ways im doing myself a favor too i had to make a break if this financing double cross of his backfires it could turn into a worldwide scandal id be ruined not to mention westminster union which the regulators here would probably padlock with scarcely concealed glee it would merely confirm what everybody here wants to think about those winatanycost japanese these days well i appreciate it i mean that im sorry we didnt get to know each other better over the years vance tried locking the front door it was difficult as nogami had warned but finally it clicked securely outside the evening air was brisk with a few of nogamis neighbors stoically walking large dogs and pretending to enjoy the ambience of londons chilly dusk if we both live long enough maybe we can try youre one of the few westerners ive known who ever really understood japan i had a crash course several years back so i understand he smiled as he opened the limo door vance would drive which is one of the reasons i wonder if this arrangement is going to be as simple as wed hoped tanzan mino has a long memory michael he doesnt forgive or forget im sure he still remembers you were responsible for shutting down his cozy cia arrangement i thought it was time the company cleaned up its act but hell that was almost eight years ago thats a mere snap of the fingers in japanese time as you well know well fuck him if he cant take a joke a joke is the one thing he cant take my friend he never smiles unless theres a camera around look you say hes agreed to deal lets assume for now he means it but in the meantime we proceed as planned you trust your mother but you cut the cards nogami settled into the seat and shut the door then he looked down quizzically whats this i didnt notice it before he reached down and picked up a black leather sachel off the floor testing its weight somehow ive got a feeling its not a new tie from harrods as it happens thats a little housewarming gift from the soviet embassy part of my deal along with the car its registered and legal or so they tell me my god he settled it back on the floor i must be getting old hardware terrifies me these days im not used to working this close to the street anymore its only till we take care of business you handle your end tomorrow and were both clear at least for now if it was really that simple you wouldnt need this the point is not to need this my friend if jiro sato breaks rank and moves on us were going to need twenty of these and more tuesday pm a kgb security squad was posted at the hotel around ten oclock this morning satosama they are armed saaa he hissed an exhale of displeasure and leaned forward an unlit cigarette in his mouth one of the blacksuited kobun immediately stepped up and flicked a lighter he inhaled then leaned back id hoped this could be handled without any fuss but we still must proceed your decisions are always correct satosama the second kobun bowed but perhaps it might be wise to discuss the possibility of waiting for the backup team from tokyo if only to convince ourselves they are not needed this office lost much face because of our problems in greece theres only one way to regain it we have to act now worst of all ive lost face too jiro sato reminded himself among my own kobun an oyabun has to lead the minute he shows weakness hes through buddha only knows what would happen if i lost control here theres no turning back an example has to be made of the american meddlers if only to make nogamisan understand the organization still means business the tokyo oyabuns daring project is going to succeed in the long run its inevitable the problems now are shortterm but if anything else goes wrong with this offices responsibilities the kobun five in all bowed respectfully they understood his thoughts as clearly as if they had been projected in neon across the back wall the office had already lost three men face was at stake this problem could not be solved from tokyo it was time to draw together the operation was scheduled to begin at pm sharp the five kobun had already synchronized their digital watches and stashed their h ampk automatics in the two gray fords now waiting in the buildings underground garage no flashy limousines tonight the operation would be lowest of low profiles three more of their team were already at the hotel with walkietalkies monitoring the entrances the kgb security in the lobby would be quietly diverted and then neutralized the guard upstairs would simply be overpowered or taken out with a silencer if the situation got out of hand since they were professionals however matters rarely went that far the time had come to move all five lined up in front of jiro satos massive oak desk and bowed to the waist then one by one they filed out tuesday pm it was going to be a simple operation that much he was sure of no violence no bloodshed the bottle should take care of the situation all the same he had a mm automatic in a shoulder holster life had taught him that when something could go wrong chances were good that it would after this one last job he was going to disappear the situation had deteriorated far past where any reasonable man would want to touch it the time had come to bail out and let the chips fall one more day that was all standing now at the side entrance of the strand palace the small alleyway named burleigh that curved around the rear of the hotel and met the main avenue he pulled his overcoat tighter and glanced down at his piaget it read time to get started everything was synchronized down to seconds hed already made sure the service entrance was unlocked hed taped the latch on the metal door during the comings and goings of the staff during the evening shift change now all he had to do was slip through and the rest should go like clockwork in he went the neonlit hallway was empty again according to plan this was a slow time for all the staff except room service and the kitchen he slipped off his overcoat and threw it into a large laundry hamper parked halfway down the hall underneath he was wearing the uniform of a strand palace security man he checked his watch sixtyfive seconds at that moment the door of the service elevator opened and a tall irishman stepped off he was wearing the same uniform it was a strand palace security guard a real one the worst possible luck the moment seemed frozen in time however one thing was certain the security guard wasnt fooled for an instant by the intruder he automatically grabbed one of his trouser legs and knelt with a practiced move reaching for the holster strapped to his ankle the intruder was quicker as the guard dropped down his knee came up slamming against the mans square jaw the irishman toppled back against the side of the elevator with a groan but not before his fist lashed out aimed for the groin it was a glancing blow and it was too late the intruder chopped down against his neck disabling his left arm then slammed his head against the steel strut running down the center of the elevator wall he groaned and twitched backward should i just break his neck he wondered just kill him now one twist would do it no he lectured himself be a professional instead he rammed the irishmans head against the steel strut a second time and a third till he felt the body go fully limp not good enough he told himself and reached into his pocket for the bottle the ether was going to get more use than hed planned he doused the heavy cloth hed brought along and shoved it against the fallen figures nostrils he continued to hold it on the ruddy face as he closed the elevator door and pushed the button that would take him up as the lift rose he checked his watch and smiled to see that his timing was perfect ten seconds to go tuesday pm you bastard eva screamed as she slapped vance with all her might knocking him against the door of their room the thin walls shook dont ever do that again he drew up and swung for her missing and crashing against a chair get away from me youre drunk she shoved him farther into the room her voice trembling with anger then she wrenched open the hotel room door and stumbled into the hallway pomogethya mnye their kgb guard igor borisovich was already running down the hall shto help me she seized his arm and pulled him in mike vance was standing in the middle of the room weaving shakily now grasping a letter opener in his right hand get the hell out of here he started moving on the russian brandishing the weapon but stumbled and had to pause to collect his balance he drank half a bottle of tequila and went crazy she was shouting in russian do something igor nodded knowingly he came from a land where alcoholism easily edged out soccer as the national pastime what is problem the hulking soviet moved forward gingerly trying to retrieve the letter opener from vances hand get away from me vance shoved him off then stumbled back no you must give me knife the russian demanded we want no trouble nobody noticed but the time was exactly the room was brought up sharp by the sound of the door slamming and a click of the lock they turned to see a figure wearing a black ski mask and the uniform of a strand palace security guard in his right hand was a mm automatic who the hell vance yelled drunkenly igor whirled to stare his hand started for his shoulder holster but then he thought better of it and instead he backed slowly against the wall silently glaring where is it the hooded figure demanded as he brandished his pistol toward eva fuck you whoever you are vance tried to move toward him still grasping the letter opener shut up the intruder shoved him backward sending him sprawling onto the couch then he turned to eva wheres the computer almost at that moment he saw it on the writing table by the window without waiting for an answer he moved quickly and seized it by the handle after hed stationed it next to the door he waved the weapon at eva again and barked get your things and all copies of the protocol listen you son of a bitch vance sputtered as he drew himself up and moved again on the intruder shes not going anywhere now get out of here before i ram that goddam the intruder slammed the pistol across his face sending him crumpling to the floor but now his back was turned to igor borisovich who lunged the intruder saw the movement reflected in the tall mirror above the dressing table he easily sidestepped the lumbering russian then brought the pistol hard against his skull igor borisovich groaned and staggered sideways flailing for balance the hooded figure seemed prepared his hand plunged into a pocket and out came a bottle whose stopper had been replaced by a wadded rag he flung the contents of the bottle across the russians face then shoved the soaking rag against his mouth and nostrils igor borisovich struggled and clawed limply at his face for a few moments before lapsing unconscious you fucker vance pulled himself up off the floor muttering problem the intruder glanced at him one small one yeah you damned near broke my jaw this is the theater of the real my friend alex novosty laughed as he pulled off the ski mask if youre going to be kidnapped it has to look authentic im a professional i never do these things by halves any problem downstairs eva was already collecting her scant belongings yes one very big problem i had a small misunderstanding with one of the hotels security people the natives here are not friendly hes on the service elevator now sound asleep like this one where did you park it she opened the room door and looked up and down the hall it should still be on this floor i put it on emergency stop but hes going to wake up any time now and sound the alarm then weve got to finish here and get out fast she slammed the door and turned back they went to work quickly turning over chairs ripping curtains leaving evidence of a violent struggle belongings were strewn across the bed and floor as though thered been a hasty search it was done quietly and efficiently and took about a minute novosty thoughtfully positioned his black ski mask in the middle of the floor just one more clue in what they hoped would be signs of an abrupt forced departure then they grabbed what they needed including the zenith turbo locked the door and made their way down the hallway the strand palace security guard was still on the service elevator unconscious but beginning to stir what do you propose we do with him novosty gave the irishman a shake how about a little more ether eva suggested she was clasping the zenith next to her and then lets get out of here he obligingly gave the man a final dose from the almost empty bottle leaving the rag across his face by the time he finished the elevator had reached the service area in the basement their soviet limousine was parked in the alley ready in seconds they were in it and gone tuesday pm michael vance eva borodin and aleksei novosty were luckier than they knew when they emerged the japanese guard jiro sato had stationed at the burleigh entrance had momentarily been called away by radio to confer at the strand corner since the alleyway was curved slightly as london alleys invariably are the huddled yakuza team saw nothing but the tinted windows of a limousine with diplomatic license plates speeding past they paid it no heed watches were checked one more time and then the darksuited men fanned out the guard stationed down burleigh returned to his post while the five who had been in the docklands office made their way into the teeming lobby on the strand while two started up the fire stairs the other three converged on the kgb guard disarmed him discreetly and then informed him that he had pressing business outside he was shoved into one of the waiting fords gagged and handcuffed to the steering column it took less than a minute to neutralize him then the three returned to the lobby and got on the elevator on the eighth floor they met the other two who had come in from the stairway at the opposite end of the hall together they swept the corridors the kgb guard was nowhere to be seen perhaps they pulled the security on this floor one of them said or he has gone into the room to piss out some vodka another suggested this will be easier than we thought a third was heard to observe together they converged on the room registered in the name of michael vance and then they stood aside as one knocked when there was no answer they elected to shoulder it in as they rushed the room they were met by a fusillade of automatic pistol fire from a boiling mad kgb security agent nursing a headache and crouched just inside the bathroom door chapter fifteen wednesday am darling do you think theyll figure out it was a ruse who knows he looked up from stoking the fireplace where nothing but embers remained tanzan mino may be a genius but the rest of his yakuza hoods are not exactly rocket scientists ditto tdirectorates flunkies with any luck both sides will think the other ones kidnapped us and theyll go after each other thats the idea at least well were pretty vulnerable she kicked off her shoes and leaned back on the couch look after tomorrow tanzan mino wont dare send his goons after us unless hes got something up his sleeve we dont know about thats just itshe sighed if he manages to find us why mince words if he decides to try and kill us again what then will this japanese banker friend of yours stick with us whose side is he on i mean really well were here arent we nobody knows about this place not even alex they had ditched novosty three blocks down the strand trust had its limits except of course your japanese banker friend he knows the only player we can rely on now is ken and hes the only oneparticularly after novosty gets his moneywhos got the slightest incentive to hang tough im wondering whats the best way to break the story weve got to make sure it doesnt get away from us get lost he looked up from the fireplace ive already told you what i think i say we just go see an editor friend of mine at the financial times give him a big scoop concerning a forthcoming mino industries eurobond offering we point out theres no collateral at all behind the debentures and well also hint theres more to it but that angle we save for the times of london which will get a nicely translated copy of the protocol we hit the godfather with a onetwo press expose then make ourselves scarce and let investigative journalism do its thing believe me nobodys going to ignore what could be the biggest story of the decade after that starts snowballing tanzan minoll have too much on his plate to bother eating us well be out of it michael she sighed youre a dreamer you dont really think its going to be that easy he rose and joined her on the couch slipping his arm around her shoulders maybe not but we wont be a sitting target well keep on the move why dont you come and join me on the boat i may have to postpone visiting with the stuttgart team down at phaistos but well find something itll be simple sounds really simple all great ideas are basically that way well if lifes as simple as you make out then why did you insist on alexs friends at the soviet embassy lending you that thing she pointed to the black leather satchel stationed next to the fireplace guess im nervous he grinned weakly you mean youre scared cut the bull im scared too she got up walked over and picked up the leather bag now i want you to show me how to work this what he didnt like the idea you sure absolutely were in this together she settled the bag down on the carpet unzipped the top and drew out an object whose black mattesatin finish glistened in the soft glow of the coals this is an uzi right the tried and true major uziel gals contribution to the mayhem of the world he reached over and took it you know this is an instrument of sudden death do you really want your finger on the trigger sweetheart just tell me what i need to know she met his gaze okay here goes he still hated the thought for a lot of reasons the mere sight of an uzi reminded him of things in the past he preferred to forget but there clearly was no stopping her a quick runthrough of the care and feeding of your classic assault machine good she reached and took it tugging at the collapsed metal stock a second before turning back to him by the way is it loaded no but it probably should be you can take care of that yourself in just a second but first things first he pointed down see this thumb button right here on the left top of the grip notice therere three positionsall the way back is the safety next is semiautomatic fire and all the way forward is fullauto theres also a backup safety here at the top rear of the pistol grip the action stays locked unless its depressed which happens when you squeeze down to deliver a round two safeties dont knock it this baby fires ten rounds a second on fullauto weve only got five magazines how many rounds in a magazine i insisted on the enlarged thirtytworound version instead of the usual twentyfive but still with that little button forward on fullauto you can empty a magazine in about three seconds its a good way to get the attention of everybody in the room can you actually hold your aim in fullauto well enough the recoils surprisingly minimal remember to fire in short bursts and youll do okay he pointed down now the cocking handle is this knurled knob here on the top notice its got a slot cut in it so it doesnt block the sights you yank it back to ready it and dont forget always use your left hand to cock the action and change magazines and your right to operate the safetyselector switch got it okay now youre ready to load he picked one of the black rectangular metal cases out of the leather satchel on the floor this is a charged magazine always cock the action and set the thumb switch to safety before you insert one she pulled the knob back firmly then pushed her thumb against the switch now feed the magazine into the bottom of the pistol grip she shoved it in with a click and it was secured youre ready to party thumb off the safety and its a go project how do you take the magazine out when its empty she aimed into the fireplace for a second he thought she was going to take out a few halfburnt logs theres a release catch on the bottom left side of the pistol grip just depress it and what about the stock should i bother he reached and took it back you push the butt downward to release it and then you pull it back like this till its fully extended and locks he clicked it into place a hard sound in the silence of the london night to retract it you just depress this locking button here on the left front and fold it back under again okay let me try she said taking it back she folded and unfolded it twice think ive got the hang of it but do i need it use it if you want to ive always thought that when they switched over from the original wooden stock to this metal contraption they positioned the damned thing too high you have to bend your head down low to align the sights my guess is god forbid you should ever have to use this you wont have time to bother with it speaking of aiming is this what i think it is she retrieved a small boxlike object from the bag ls compact laser sight probably useless for our purposes but i figured what the hell he reached out for her hand for now lets just think of all this hardware as life insurance something youd as soon never use he took the gun and laid it on the tea trolley in the meantime why dont we have one last nightcap and go on up to bed thought youd never ask she kissed him deeply the fourposter upstairs was canopied the mattress downy as a cloud they were both hungry for each other exhausted but deliriously free perhaps it was the same relish with which a condemned prisoner consumes his last meal the delight in every taste every nuance if tomorrow brings the prospect of death then how much sweeter is life in the short hours before dawn wednesday am kenji nogami wandered alone through the bondtrading floor of westminster union bank staring at the blank computer screens his bank was a member of globex a twentyfourhour worldwide trading network for currency futures but tonight hed ordered all his traders to square their positionsneither short nor longand take the night off then he had dismissed the cleaning crew he wanted to have the space entirely to himself to think and to reflect time was growing short he settled in one of the traders empty chairs withdrew a stubby cuban montecristo a thick no from the breast pocket of his coat clipped the pointed end with a monogrammed implement and swept a wooden match against the floor and up to the tip with a single gesture if were going to have a showdown he thought i might as well die with a good cigar in hand then from another pocket he took out the telex from tokyo that had come through just after midnight the tokyo oyabun was in a rare frenzy tanzan mino had never been thwarted like thiswell only once before when a certain michael vance jr had blown the whistle on his cia connections tanzan mino was demanding compliance somebody had to give in the obvious question whod be the first to blink the worst he can do is kill me nogami thought and he cant do that yet if something happens to me tonight he wont get his hundred million tomorrow but then what youve gone this far knowing full well the consequences he told himself so dont back down now youre spitting on giri and yet and yet its the first thing youve ever done in your life thats made you feel free its exhilarating did michael arrive safely at the south kensington flat hed toyed with the idea of calling but had decided against it they wouldnt answer the phone in fact he never answered it himself when he was there thinking about it now he wondered why hed ever bothered to have one installed in the first place he drew on the montecristo then studied its perfect ash waiting waiting nogamisan sumimasen the voice sounded down the empty room almost an echo theyd arrived finally why had it taken so long kombanwa he replied without moving the cigar remained poised above his head as he continued to examine it it is an honor to see you there was no reply only the sound of footsteps approaching he revolved in his chair to see jiro sato flanked by two of his kobun i see you are working late jiro sato said examining the cigar as he nodded a stiff formal greeting i deeply apologize for this inconvenience i was expecting you nogami replied nodding back please allow me to make tea thank you but it is not required jiro sato stood before him gray sunglasses glistening in the fluorescents one of my kobun was shot and killed tonight nogamisan and two more wounded i want to know where to find vance and the woman now were they responsible with deepest apologies that need not trouble you he stood ramrod straight with deepest apologies satosama it troubles me very much nogami examined his cigar this entire affair is very troublesome in times past i remember a certain prejudice in favor of civility on the part of tokyo have things really changed that much the moment for soft words is past tonight ended that nogami drew on his cigar assuming you locate vance what action do you propose taking we have one last chance here to deal with this problem tomorrow the oyabuns people arrive and then they will be in control the decisions will no longer be ours tonight i attempted to salvage the situation and failed surely you know what that means for us both but if you will give me vance perhaps we can both still be saved if you refuse to cooperate the oyabun will destroy you as well as vance we both know that i am offering you a way out with deepest gratitude i must tell you it is too late satosama which i am sure you realize nogami said drawing on his cigar and taking care not to disturb the ash so with due respect i must inquire concerning the purpose of this meeting i need to locate this man vance before the kobun from tokyo arrive if you care about his wellbeing then you should remember that his treatment at my hands will be more understanding than when do they arrive as i said we received word that they will be here tomorrow nogamisan with respect you have befriended a man who is attempting to blackmail the tokyo oyabun that is a career decision which i assure you is most unwise it is made and i am aware of the consequences so it would appear we both know all there is to know about the future perhaps not entirely someone has attempted to make us think vance and the woman were kidnapped that they are being held somewhere beyond our reach perhaps it is true perhaps it is not but if the transaction for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow then he must appear here the oyabuns people may be here by then if they are not we will be but if he has been kidnapped nogamis brow furrowed as he studied his cigar its ash still growing then there could be a problem with the transaction who do you suppose would want him besides the tokyo oyabun that i could not speculate upon the kgb seems to have a great interest in his activities perhaps they are guarding him in some more secure place or perhaps something else has happened he bowed again you must forgive me for this rude intrusion it is important for you to be aware that the situation is not resolved that you still have a chance to save yourself the ceo will receive his hundred million if there is no interference that much i have already arranged for when that is completed i will consider my responsibilities discharged your responsibilities will never be discharged nogamisan giri lasts forever his voice was cutting the sooner you realize that the better after tomorrow it will be over satosama he stretched out his arm and tapped the inchlong ash into a trash basket beside the desk tomorrow jiro sato bowed it only begins wednesday am yuri andreevich androv stood facing the bulkhead that sealed the forward avionics bays feeling almost as though he were looking at a bank vault as in all highsecurity facilities the access doors were controlled electronically since the final retrofits were now completed the japanese maintenance crews were only working two shifts nobody was around at this hour except the security guards hed told them hed thought of something and wanted to go up and take a look at the heavyduty en turbo pumps which transferred hydrogen to the scramjets after it was converted from liquid to gaseous phase for combustion hed been worrying about their pulse rating and couldnt sleep hed gone on to explain that although static testing had shown they would achieve operating pressure in twenty milliseconds if they were fully primed in advance that was static testing not flight testing and hed been unable to sleep wondering about the adhesive around the seals it was just technical mumbojumbo although maybe he should be checking them he thought grimly but he trusted the engineering team he had to besides the pumps had been developed specially for the massive energia booster and theyd functioned flawlessly in routine launchings of those vehicles at the baikonur cosmodrome of course at baikonur they always were initiated while the energia was on the launch pad at full atmospheric pressure on the daedalus theyd have to be powered in during flight at sixty thousand feet and miles per hour but still the latenight security team had listened sympathetically they had no objection if androv wanted to roll a stairtruck under the fuselage of daedalus then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in the dead of night everybody knew he was eccentric no make that insane youd have to be to want to ride a rocket theyd just waved him in after all the classified avionics in the forward bays were secured he smiled grimly to think that hed been absolutely right hangar control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the big test it always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping in and out that also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic access cards for all the sealed forward bays just as hed figured the mechanics were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they kept in their lockers in the changing room time to get started there was naturally double security with a massive airlock port opening onto a pressure bay where three more secure ports sealed the avionics bays themselves the airlock port was like an airplane door double reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space and in the center was a green metallic slot for a magnetic card he began trying cards slipping them into the slot the first the second the third the fourth and then payoff the three green diodes above the lock handle flashed he quickly shoved down the grip and pushed the door eased inward then rotated to the side opening onto the pressure bay the temperature inside was a constant degrees celsius kept just above freezing to extend the life of the sensitive electronic gear in the next three bays the highvoltage sodium lamps along the sides of the fuselage now switched on automatically as the door swung inward he fleetingly thought about turning them off then realized they werent manually operated through the clouds of his condensing breath he could see that the interior of the entry bay was a pale military green the color definitely seemed appropriate given what he now knew about this vehicle he quickly turned and after making sure the outer door could be reopened from the inside closed it behind him when it clicked secure the sodium lights automatically shut off with a faint hum just like a damned refrigerator he thought but the dark was what he wanted he withdrew a small penlight from his pocket and scanned the three bulkhead hatches leading to the forward bays the portside bay on the left contained electronics for the multimode phased array radar scanner in the nose radar processors radar power supply radar transmitters and receivers doppler processor shrouded scanner tracking mechanism and an rf oscillator he knew hed checked the engineering diagrams he also knew the starboard equipment bay the one on the right contained signal processors for the inertial navigation system ins the instrument landing system ils the foreplane hydraulic actuator the structural mode control system smcs station controller and the pilots liquidoxygen tanks and evaporator the third forward bay located beneath the other two and down a set of steel stairs was the one he needed to penetrate it contained all the computer gear flight control navigation and most importantly the artificial intelligence ai system for pilot interface and backup he suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought since no airbreathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic every component in this plane was in a sense untested to his mind though that was merely one more argument for shutting down the damned ai systems override functions before he went hypersonic if something did go wrong he wanted this baby on manual he only needed the computer to alert him to potential problems the solutions hed have to work out with his own brain and balls after all thats why he was there as he walked down the steel steps he thumbed through the magnetic cards praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access the computers then he began inserting them one by one into the green metallic slot trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold finally one worked the three encoded diodes blinked and a hydraulic arm automatically slid the port open next the interior lights came on an orange highvoltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls this third bay like the two above it was big enough to stand in as he stepped in he glanced back up the stairs then quickly resealed the door off went the lights again so he withdrew his penlight and turned to start searching for what he wanted directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of toggle switches electrical power controls communications controls propulsion system controls reactioncontrol systems okay thats the command console which was preset for each flight and then monitored from the cockpit now wheres the damned onboard ai module he scanned the bay the ai system was the key to his plan he had to make certain the computers artificial intelligence functions could be completely shut down disengaged when the crucial moment came he couldnt afford for the onboard systemoverride to abort his planned revision in the hypersonic flight plan his job tonight was to make sure all the surprises were his not somebody elses there wouldnt be any margin for screwups everything had to go like clockwork he edged his way on through the freezing bay searching the banks of equipment for a clue and then he saw what he was looking for there along the portside bulkhead it was a white rectangular console and everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted he studied it a second trying to decide where to begin at that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly how hed ever gotten into this crazy situation maybe he should have quit the air force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had wanted right now he had to admit a little electrical engineering would definitely come in handy he took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing the ai consoles faceplate a bronzed rectangle eight screws later he lifted it off and settled it on the floor the penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat sections of plasticcoated wires somewhere in this electronic ganglia there had to be a crucial node where he could attach the device hed brought it had taken some doing but hed managed to assemble an item that should take care of his problem beautifully when the moment came it was a radiocontrolled electrically operated blade that when clamped onto a strand of wires could sever them in an instant the radio range was fifty meters which would be adequate the transmitter no larger than a small tape recorder was going to be with him in his flight suit the instant he switched the turboramjets over to the scramjet mode he was going to activate it and blow their fucking ai module out of the system permanently he figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team came looking to see what he was doing hed timed this moment to coincide with their regular tea break even the japanese didnt work around the clock now holding the penlight and shivering from the cold he began carefully checking the wires carefully so very carefully he didnt have a diagram of their computer linkages and he had to make sure he didnt accidentally interrupt the main power source since the one thing he didnt want to do was disconnect any of the other flight control systems he wanted to cut in somewhere between the ai modules power supply and its central processor the power source led in here and then up the side over to there a highvoltage transformer and then out from there just after the stepup transformer and before the motherboard with the dedicated cpu and io that should avoid any shorting in the main power system and keep the interruption nice and localized the line was almost half an inch thick doublestranded copper grounded with a coaxial sheath but there was a clear section that led directly down to the cpu thats where hed place the blade and hope itd at least short circuit the power feed even if it didnt sever the wires completely he tested the radio transmitter one last time making sure it would activate the blade then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto the wire tightening it with thumb screws when it was as secure as he could make it he stood back and examined his handiwork if somebody decided to remove the faceplate theyd spot it in a second but otherwise quickly hands trembling from the cold he fitted the cover back on the module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver it wasnt magnetized a deliberate choice so the small screws kept slipping between his bulky fingers a problem made more acute by the numbing cold three screws to go then he heard the noise footsteps on the aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above shit he kept working as fast as he could grimly holding the screws secure and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing fingers only one more above he could hear the sounds of someone checking each of the equipment bays methodically opening and then resecuring them first the starboard side bay was opened and closed then the portside bay now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to the computer bay they were five seconds away from discovering him the last screw was in he tried to stand and realized his knees were numb he staggered backward grabbing for something to steady himself and the light came on yuri andreevich so this is where you are what are you doing here it was the gravel voice of his father he felt like a child again caught with his hand in his pants what should he do tell the truth imim checking over the consoles passing the time i couldnt sleep dont lie to me andrei androvs ancient eyebrows gathered into the skeptical furrow yuri knew so well youre up to something another of your tricks yuri stared at him a moment how had he known a sixth sense moi otyets why are you here you should be getting your sleep im an old man an old man worries i had a feeling you might be in here tonight tinkering with the vehicle you told me you were planning something i think the time has come to tell me what it is yuri took a deep breath and looked him over no it was too risky for them both his secret had to be ironclad its better if you dont know as you wish the old man sighed but if you do something foolish i damned sure intend to try he met his fathers steely gaze so did you do it andrei androv examined him his ancient face ashen beneath his mane of white hair did you manage to sabotage the ai module he caught himself laughing out loud whatever else his father was no fool hed been a russian too long to believe anything he heard or half of what he saw intrigue was a way of life for him lets go theyll come looking for us soon this is the wrong place to be found youre right go back to the west quadrant listen to a string quartet he opened the port and waited for his father to step out then he followed closing it behind them theres no reason for you to be involved heads are going to roll but why should yours be one of them andrei petrovich androv moved lightly up the metal stair the spring in his step belying his age at the top he paused and turned back youre acting out of principle arent you yuri for once in your life i guess you could say that he smiled then moved on up the steps someday the russian people will thank you someday though i may not live to see it andrei androv stopped his ancient eyes tearing as his voice dropped to a whisper of all the things youve ever done my son nothing could make me more proud of you than what you just said ive thought it over about the military uses for this vehicle and i think the future of the world is about to be rewritten here you must stop them youre the only chance we have left chapter sixteen wednesday am the limousine had already left the savoy and was headed down the strand when alex novosty broke the silence he leaned forward pushed the button on the twoway microphone linking the passenger compartment to the driver and spoke in russian igor borisovich theres been an alteration in our plans we will not be going to westminster union take us to moscow narodny bank the trading branch on saint swithins lane shto ve skazale igor still nursing his head from the kidnapping glanced into his rearview mirror the banks main office is on king william street we always just do as youre told novosty cut him off then killed the mike vera karanova stared at him her dark eyes flooding with concern but you said the transaction was scheduled for westminster union bank this morning at tenthirty that was merely a diversion novosty leaned back the actual arrangement is turned around for security reasons i dont like this her displeasure was obvious and mounting there is no reason its better i assure you he withdrew a white tin of balkan sobranie cigarettes from his coat snapped it open and withdrew one made of fine turkish yenidje tobacco they were what he always smoked on important days this was an important day as he flicked his lighter and drew in the first lungful of rich smoke he thought about how much he hated the darkhaired woman seated beside him dressed in a gray armani business suit sable coat cartier jewelry the bad blood between them traced back over five years beginning with a tdirectorate reshuffle in which shed moved up to the number three slot cutting him out of a welldeserved promotion the rumor going around dzerzhinsky square was that shed done it by making the right connections so to speak it was the kind of inhouse screw job alex novosty didnt soon forget of forgive their black limo was now passing the royal courts of justice on the left headed onto fleet street ahead was cannon street which intersected the end of saint swithins lane just a few blocks more after today he fully intended never to see her again weve arranged for the transaction to take place through mnbs bond trading desk novosty continued almost as though to nobody in particular michael and i have taken care of everything who approved this change she angrily gripped the handrest i did novosty replied sharply were in charge he masked a smile pleased to see her upset the morning traffic was now almost at a standstill but they would be on time after all he still has the money and for all you know he may be in brazil by now perhaps thats the reason he and the woman disappeared last night with the help of an accomplice who assaulted igor borisovich michael will be there novosty said have no fear hes not going anywhere till this is finished after this is completed she said matteroffactly he will be finished i hope you have planned for that novosty glanced over wondering what she meant had all the surprises been covered he hoped so because this deal was his gateway to freedom the two million commission would mean a new beginning for him wednesday am kenji nogami sat upright at his wide oak desk waiting for the phone to ring how would michael play it admittedly it was smart to keep everything close to the chest but still he would have felt better if michael vance jr had favored him with a little more trust on the other hand keeping the details of the operation under wraps as long as possible was probably wise it minimized the chance for some inadvertent slipup yes it was definitely best because he was staring across his desk at four of tanzan minos tokyo kobun all dressed in shiny black leather jackets theyd arrived at the docklands office just after dawn announcing they were there to handdeliver the money to tokyo jiro sato had directed them to westminster union the four all carried black briefcases which did not contain business papers they intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means necessary jiro sato the london oyabun had not been invited to send his people along with them this morning he was now humiliated and disgraced officially removed from the operation on tokyos orders the regional office had failed so tokyo had sent in a minogumi version of the delta force they clearly had orders concerning what to do with michael vance he didnt like this new twist for everything to go according to plan violence had to be kept out of it there was no way he and michael could go head to head with street enforcers if michael was thinking of doing that the man was crazy he glanced at his gold omega noting that it read ten nineteen in eleven more minutes hed know how michael intended to run the scenario but whatever happened he wasnt going to be intimidated by these kobun hoods dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding those days were over michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start building a new life he didnt care if all hell was about to break loose wednesday am polovena decyat she examined him with her dark eyes da novosty nodded they will be here at tenthirty that is the schedule he was feeling nervous which was unusual and he didnt like it whenever he got that way things always started going off the track they were now in the paneled elevator heading up to the sixth floor of the moscow narodny bank the hundred million had been held overnight in the vault of victoria courier service limited which was scheduled to deliver the satchels this morning at tenthirty sharp the location for the delivery however was known only to him and to michael vance he wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money he also would have much preferred being without the company of vera karanova one thing you had to say for michael hed arranged the deal with great finesse he didnt trust anybody until he notified victoria courier this morning nobody knew where the money would be taken not even the japanese banker nogami still the instruments were negotiable leaving the possibility of trouble if the timing went sour he intended to make sure it didnt the planning had been splitsecond up until now this was no moment to relax his guard yes it was good he was here as he studied comrade karanova he realized that something about her was still making him uneasy so far it was merely a hunch but his hunches had been right more often than he liked to think he tried to push the feeling aside probably just paranoia she obviously was here today for the same reason he was to make sure the soviet money was returned safely she probably was also still worried about the protocol but that problem was hers not his from today on the kgb would have to work out their infighting back home the best way they could the ground rules were changing fast in moscow besides dzerzhinsky square was about to become part of a previous life for him if he could just clear this up get his commission hed be set forever enough was enough maybe hed end up in the caribbean like michael drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis the elevator door opened facing them were michael vance and eva borodin glad you could make it vance glanced coldly at vera right on time the money arrives in exactly seven minutes she nodded a silent greeting pulling her sable coat tighter as she strode past the bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her with nervous awe even in london tdirectorate brass had clout they moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the counting room on this floor everything was highsecurity with uniformed guards at all the doorways negotiable instruments werent handled casually wednesday am an armoured van with vcs ltd lettered on its side pulled up to the black marble front of moscow narodny banks financial trading branch on saint swithins lane everything was on schedule theyre here eva was watching from the narrow window saint swithins lane down below virtually an alley was so narrow it could accommodate only one vehicle at a time across was banque worms its unicorn insignia staring out its lobby chandeliers glowing nobody there even bothered to notice just another armored truck interrupting the view then three blueuniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached the rear doors from both sidess in unsnapped holsters mr vance they had better have the money all of it vera stepped over to the window and followed evas gaze down itll be there for your sake i hope so she replied as she turned back just hang around and watch vance said just one more day he told himself one more lousy day well have enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow the press package ready then we drop it on the papers and blow town from the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the elevator opened a private lift that came directly up from the lobby when he heard the heavy footsteps of the couriers accompanied by mnb guards he stepped over and quickly glanced out the two bluesuits were each carrying a large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist obviously the third had stayed downstairs guarding the van this way the heavyjowled director of the mnb bond trading desk stepped out and motioned them in the play was on kenji nogamis issue of mino industries debentures had been registered with the issuing house association the previous day this morning they would be acquired by vance using a wire transfer between the moscow narodny bank on saint swithins lane and westminster union banks bond desk after that there would be a second transaction whereby sumitomo bank limited would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one hundred million dollars to be wiretransferred back to westminster union and from there to moscow narodny bank everything had been prearranged the whole transaction would require only minutes unless there was a glitch vance had fully expected that tanzan mino would send a welcoming committee to nogamis premises which was why hed arranged for the money to be delivered here at moscow narodnys sidestreet branch he figured the soviets at least would play it straight kgb wanted its file closed then too eva still had the protocol their backup insurance policy mr vance vera karanova watched as the two security men unlatched their satchels and began withdrawing the bundles of open cashiers checks and bearer bonds i want to recount these securities now therere doublecounted tallys already preparedhe pointed toward the bundlesyesterday by the main branch of moscow narodny the printouts are attached that was their count she replied i intend to make my own before we go any further which means time lost he thought doesnt she realize weve got to get this cash recycled those bonds purchased and in place before tanzan minos kobun have a chance to move on us if the deal to acquire kens new mino industries debentures doesnt go through giving us something to hold over the godfathers head shes literally playing into his hands the instruments are all here all negotiable and all ready to go he said stealing a quick glance toward eva one look at her eyes told him she also sensed trouble brewing now were damn well going to move and move fast we credit the funds here then wire them to westminster union and by god we do it immediately mr vance you are no longer giving the orders she replied sharply im in charge here now as a matter of fact i have no intention of wiring the money anywhere there will be no purchase of debentures as far as im concerned it has now been returned she paused for emphasis but first we will count it vera my love eva said cutting her off if you try and doublecross us youre making a very big mistake you seem to forget weve got that protocol what we didnt get around to telling you is that weve deciphered it you thats right as it happens i dont think youre going to like what its got to say but you might at least want to know the story before you read about it in the times day after tomorrow alex novostys face had turned ashen michael tanzan minos people are probably headed here by now unless they go to the main office on king william street first he was nervously glancing out the window were running out of time the games about to get rough vance thought better take charge but before he could move novosty was gripping a ruger p a lightweight mm automatic pulled from a holster under the back of his jacket hed worn it where the mnb guards would miss it the two victoria couriers were caught flatfooted bankers werent supposed to start drawing weapons they stared in astonishment as he gestured for them to turn and face the wall michael he said as he glanced over would you kindly give me a hand and take those twos we really must get this party moving vera karanova was smiling a thin smile i dont know how far you think you will get with this we seem to be working toward different objectives novosty answered michael has a solution to everybodys problem i regret very much youve chosen not to help facilitate it the only problem he solved was yours she shot back mr vance devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme you two planned to perpetrate fraud youre nothing better than criminals both of you and i intend to make sure you havent also given us a short count comrade fraud is a harsh word vance interjected you are not as amusing as you think she replied humor makes the world go round this is not a joke the negotiable instruments in this room are soviet funds i intend to make sure those funds are intact there will be a full and complete count now shes gone over the edge he told himself shes definitely going to try and screw us either wittingly or unwittingly but who in the room is going to help her that huddled group of russian bankers now staring terrified at novostys mm not damned likely shes improvising on her own but her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship the two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of the wall legs apart he walked over and reached into the leather holsters at their hips drawing out their revolvers they were snubnosed smith amp wesson bodyguards caliber he looked them over cocked them and handed one to eva how about covering the door i think its time we got down to business and traded some bonds with pleasure she stepped over and glanced out it was clear what do you think alex vance turned back words going around theres a hot new issue of mino industries zerocoupons coming out today what do you say we go long in for a hundred just take the lot i heard the same rumor this very morning he smiled youre right my instincts say its a definite buy fine vance turned to mnbs jowled branch chief wed like to do a little trading here this morning mind getting the bond desk at westminster union on the line tell nogami were good for a hundred in mino industries debentures the new issue at par michael it was evas voice suddenly alarmed what weve got company they look like field reps good god novosty strode to the door and looked out a group of four leatherjacketed japanese were headed down the hallway two disarmed mnb guards in front also with them was kenji nogami turning back he looked imploringly at vance what do we do figure they came prepared he waved toward eva better lose that put it on the table for now maybe we can still talk this thing through she nodded then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of securities vance took one last look at the smith amp wesson in his own hand and did the same even exarchaeologists could do arithmetic all this time vera karanova had said nothing she merely stood watching the proceedings with a detached smile finally she spoke now we can proceed with the counting she said calmly maybe you dont fully grasp the situation here comrade vance stared at her those gorillas arent dropping in for tea weve got to stand together she burst out laughing mr vance you are truly naive no youre worse you actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new global alliance of the twentieth century her dark eyes were gradually turning glacial it will not be allowed to happen believe me my god he realized thats why she wanted to get her hands on the protocol to deepsix it shes been biding her time stringing us along and today she managed to stall us long enough for minos boys to figure out the switch shes no longer working for tdirectorate shes part of tanzan minos operation all this time shes been working with them the negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered to their rightful recipient by his personal jet she continued today over my dead body he found himself thinking it might well be true no mr vance not exactly your contribution will be more substantial than that he was speechless for the first time the russian bankers in the room were taken totally by surprise doubledealing kgb games had always been part of the landscape but this was confusing in the extreme whose money was it anyway michael novostys voice was trembling this cannot be allowed to happen i agree weve definitely got a situation here he glanced around to see the four minogumi kobun poised in the doorway all with h ampk automatics now out of their briefcases kenji nogami was standing behind them his eyes defeated novosty still looked stunned the range of options was rapidly narrowing to none vera indicated his ruger you would be wise to put that away now if they take these securities my lifes not worth a kopeck novosty seemed to be thinking out loud what does it matter it wasnt a question it was a statement remembering it all later vance could barely recall the precise sequence of events he did remember shoving eva back against the wall as the fireworks began novostys first round caught the lead minogumi kobun squarely between the eyes as he pitched backward arms flailing he tumbled against the others giving novosty time to fire again with deadly accuracy he caught another in the chest kenji nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet safely avoiding the fusillade the russian bankers too had all hit the floor along with the mnb guards and the two couriers then came a shot with a different soundthe dull thunk of a silencer novosty jerked in surprise pain spreading through his eyes the silencer thunked again and again it was vera karanova she was holding a small caliber walther pp with a specially equipped silencer and her aim was flawless novosty had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he even realized what was happening he collapsed forward never knowing whose hand had been on the gun shes probably wanted to get rid of him for years vance thought fleetingly she finally got her golden opportunity the doublecrossing bitch he briefly considered grabbing back one of thes and avenging alex then and there but he knew it would be suicidal alex no evas voice sobbed both of you hands on the wall comrade karanova was definitely in charge michael eva said turning to comply what happened to our welllaid plans looks like too little too late he stretched beside her what did she mean just now about our contribution probably the protocol my guess is she wants to see it destroyed lets hope thatll be the end of it the godfathers got his money and alexs problem is solved permanently now kenji nogami was entering the room an island of zenlike calm amidst all the bedlam michael im so sorry he stepped over when the money didnt show up as scheduled they called jiro sato and he suggested they try here there was nothing i could do vance nodded thats how i figured itd be played we didnt move fast enough on this end it was my fault too bad we came close he sighed but im not going to underwrite the rest of those bogus debentures hell have to kill me and hell probably do just that the hell with it you tried we all tried now it looks like tanzan minos scam is going to go through whether we play or not you might as well save your own skin with any luck we can still sort out our end but youyoure going to have to be dealing with that bastard for years to come think about it im still deciding he said finally lets wait and see how things go alex opted for suicide you shouldnt follow his lead im not suicidal he stepped back as vera proceeded to pat them down i think very carefully about my options get the money she was directing the two remaining minogumi kobun toward the table gonna just rob the bank now comrade vance turned and looked at her then at the three bodies strewn on the floor the kobun seemed to consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war the dead men received almost no notice pretty costly little enterprise wouldnt you say not a very propitious start for your new era of world serenity you would be advised to shut up she responded sharply i feel personally violated by all this nogami had turned to her and his voice was like steel as of this moment you can put out of your mind any illusion i might cooperate further this outrage is beyond acceptability we did what had to be done vera said we still expect your cooperation and i do not think we will be disappointed then your expectation is sadly misplaced he replied icily his eyes signified he meant every word we will see she dismissed him as she turned her attention to the money the two kobun had carefully removed their shiny black leather jackets now and laid them on the table underneath they wore tightly tailored white shirts complete with underarm holsters containing mm llamas the automatics were back in their briefcases positioned by the door stripped down for action they were quickly and professionally tallying the certificates one handling the open cashiers checks and the other the bearer bonds guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details vance thought well screw them weve still got the protocol weve got some leverage left but he was having trouble focusing on the future he was still in shock from the sight of novosty being gunned down in cold blood alexs abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional if sometimes dubious career hed really wanted novosty to make this one last score the man deserved it he was an operator who lived at the edge and vance had always admired players who put everything on the table no matter which side well he told himself the scenario had come close damned close but maybe it was doomed from the start you only get so many chances to tempt the fates today everybodys number came up alexs for the last time rest in peace aleksei ilyich then vera turned back to them now i want the computer we know it was moved to the house in kensington but our search this morning did not locate it so they were on to us from the start vance realized looks like youve got a problem he strolled over and plopped down in one of the straightbacked chairs along the opposite wall too bad no you have a problem she examined him confidently because if those materials are not returned to us we will be forced to take actions you may find harsh give it your best shot he went on glancing at eva and hoping they could keep up the bravado because weve got a few cards in our hand too forget the moneythats history nowbut we could still be in a position to blow your whole project sky high you two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the protocol that knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther dont be so sure for all you know weve already stashed a copy somewhere left word that if anything happens to either one of us the package gets sent to the papers made public think what some premature headlines would do for your little project we have thought about it mr vance that contingency has been covered well if i dont know what the other players got i tend to trust my own cards but why play at all he suddenly found himself musing fold this hand and go for the next move before leaving crete hed transmitted a copy of the protocol still in its encrypted form to his office computer in nassau at the time itd merely seemed like prudence now it might turn out to be a lifeline one phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very afternoon the magic of satellites in space knock out another quick translation and theyd only have lost one day what the hell use that as a fallback position time thats all it would take just a little more time but what does it matter the games up anyway he nodded toward vera then turned to eva sending her a pointed signal what was it shakespeare said about discretion and valor she concurred understanding exactly what he was thinking the man knew when to fish and when to cut bait true enough shall you tell them or shall i you can do the honors she walked over and picked up her briefcase you didnt really think wed leave it did you comrade so just take it and good riddance a little gift from the nsa who says americas getting stingy with its foreign aid comrade karanova motioned for the two kobun to take the case see if its there as they moved to comply vance found himself wondering if this really was going to turn off the heat somehow it no longer seemed adequate hai so he grunted through his teeth as he lifted it something is here vance noticed that two digits of the little finger on his left hand were missing along with another digit on his ring finger good thing ken was never a street man he thought fleetingly guess bankers get to pay for their mistakes with something besides sections of finger then take it out vera commanded we are running out of time youve got that right lady vance thought three men were just killed that personal boeing of tanzan minos better be warming up its pratt amp whitneys right now londons about to get too hot for you one of the kobun withdrew the zenith he placed it on the mahogany table then unlatched the top and lifted it up only to stare at the blank gray screen unsure what he was supposed to do next vera knew she reached for the switch on the side and clicked it on then stood back and turned to eva call up the file i want to see if you have really broken the encryption the way you said truth time she laughed then punched up the translation project daedalus and there it was comrade karanova studied it a moment as though not quite believing her eyes but she plainly had seen it before congratulations we were sure no one would be able to break the encryption not even you she glanced around you are very clever okay vance interjected im sure we all have better things to do this morning so why dont you take the damned thing and get out of here its what you wanted just go and well all try and forget any of this ever happened she flipped down the computers screen then turned back unfortunately nothing is ever that simple im sorry to have to tell you two that we havent seen the last of each other she paused then continued in fact we are about to become much better acquainted what do you mean you once told me back when we met on the plane from athens you would welcome that you should be happy that your wish is now about to be granted you both are going to be our guests thats kind of you he stared at her startled but we can probably bear up to the separation no i must insist you were right about the difficulties your death now would be awkward for a number of reasons alex will be trouble enough to explain but that is purely an internal soviet matter moscow narodny can cover it however eliminating you two would raise awkward inquiries on the other hand you represent a security risk to the project consequently we have no option surely you understand he understood all too well this was the one turn he hadnt figured on almost eight years it had been that long ago but what had ken said the tokyo oyabun never forgot what this really meant was that tanzan mino wanted to settle the score first hand what did he have planned vance had a sudden feeling he didnt want to know it was going to be a zerosum game everything on the table and winner take all the uzi the goddam uzi why hadnt they brought it it was still back in kensington where theyd stashed it in the false bottom of a new suitcase but if the minogumi had been searching only for a computer maybe theyd missed it so tanzan minos hoods could still be in for a surprise just make an excuse to go back vera was aware an uzi had been part of their deal for the limo but maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind what with all the important things she had to think about or maybe shed assumed alex had kept it or maybe she thought it was still in the car whatever she thought things were moving too fast now i get the picture he said rising from his chair with a carefully feigned nonchalance he strolled over to the table guess its time we got our toothbrushes you wont have to bother mr vance vera continued your suitcases were sent to the plane an hour ago we found them conveniently packed dont worry everything has already been taken care of okay scratch the uzi looks like its now or never settle it here he shot a glance at eva then at ken trying to signal them they caught it and they knew she began strolling in the direction of vera who was now standing in the doorway as though readying to depart we appreciate the snappy service vance said he looked down at the computer then bent over when he came up it was in his right hand sailing in an arc he brought it around with all his might aimed for the nearest japanese kobun he was on target catching the man squarely in the stomach with a startled disbelieving look the japanese stumbled backward crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table the other kobun instantly reached for his holstered llama but by then kenji nogami had moved seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a powerful embrace for her own part eva had lunged for vera and her purse to neutralize the walther she carried comrade karanova however had already anticipated everything she whisked back the purse then plunged her hand in what she withdrew though was not a pistol but a shiny cylindrical object made of glass it was three against three a snapshot of desperation weve got a chance vance thought keep him down and get the llama as the kobun tried to rise gasping vance threw himself over the upturned chair reaching to pin the mans arms with a bearlike embrace he had him the body small and muscular in his arms out of the corner of his eye he saw kenji nogami still grappling with the other kobun the computer now lay on the floor open and askew wheres eva he tried to turn and look for her but there was no sound to guide him then the kobun wrenched free one arm and brought a fist against the side of his face diverting him back to matters at hand hold him down just get the gun he tried to crush his larger frame against the others slim body forcing the air out of him focus but the wiry man was stronger than he looked with a twist he rolled over and pinned vances shoulders against the carpet vance felt the shag soft against his skin and couldnt believe how chilly it felt but now he had his hand on the kobuns throat holding him in a powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster cut off his oxygen dont let him breathe the old moves were coming back the shortcuts that would bring a more powerful opponent to submission he pressed a thumb against the mans windpipe shutting off his air a look of surprise went through the kobuns eyes as he choked letting his hold on vances shoulders slacken now he shoved the mans arm aside and reached for the holster then his hand closed around the hard grip of the llama the japanese was weaker now but still forcing his arm away from the gun preventing him from getting the grip he needed he rammed an elbow against the mans chin then tightened his finger on the grip of the llama he almost had it with his other hand he shoved the kobuns face away clawing at his eyes and again they rolled over with the japanese once more against the carpet but now he had the gun and he was turning he felt a sharp jab in his back a flash of pain that seemed to come from nowhere it was both intense and numbing as though his spine had been caught in a vise then he felt his heart constrict his orientation spin he rolled to the side flailing an arm to try and recover his balance but the room was in rotation his vision playing tricks the one thing he did see was vera karanova standing over him a blurred image his mind tried vainly to correct her face was faltering the indistinct outlines of a desert mirage was she real or was he merely dreaming now the room was growing serene a slowmotion phantasmagoria of pastel colors and soft muted sounds he tried to reach out but there was nothing instead he heard faint music dulcet beckoning tones the world had entered another dimension a seamless void he wanted to be part of its emptiness to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion lifting him up a perfect repose was drifting through him a wave of darkness he heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a bloodred mist he was floating on a journey he had long waited to take to a place far far away book three chapter seventeen thursday pm the hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled tanzan mino said quietly now that all the financial arrangements have been completed the coordinating committee of the ldp has agreed to bring the treaty before the diet next week a delay is unthinkable the problem is not technical minosama taro ikeda the project director continued his tone ripe with deference it is the soviet pilot perhaps he should be replaced he looked down searching for the right words im concerned i think he has discovered the stealth capabilities of the vehicle probably accidentally but all the same im convinced he is now aware of them two nights ago he engaged in certain unauthorized maneuvers i believe were intended to verify those capabilities so deshoo tanzan minos eyes narrowed but he has said nothing no not a word at least to me then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically it would not be the first time the maneuvers they were too explicit ikeda continued as i said two nights ago on the last test fight he switched off the transponder then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a power dive all the way to the deck it was intended to be a radarevasive action the project director allowed himself a faint ironic smile at least we now know that the technology works the vehicles radar signature immediately disappeared off the tracking monitors at katsura it met the specifications ikeda nodded yesterday i ordered a computer analysis of the data tapes the preliminary report suggests it may even have exceeded them tanzan mino listened in silence he was sitting at his desk in the command sector wing of the north quadrant at the hokkaido facility although the sector was underground like the rest of the facility behind his desk was a twentyfootlong window with periscope double mirrors that showed the churning breakers of la perouse strait his jet had touched down on the facilitys runway at am and been promptly towed into the hangar tanzan mino intended to be in personal command when daedalus i went hypersonic in just nineteen hours the video monitors in his office were hardwired directly to the main console in flight control replicating its data displays and all decisions passed across his desk leave the pilot to me he said without emotion revolving to gaze out the wide window which displayed the midafternoon sun catching the crests of whitecaps far at sea what he knows or doesnt know will not disrupt the schedule once again he thought ive got to handle a problem personally why because nobody else here has the determination to make the scenario succeed first the protocol and then the money i had to intervene to resolve both but he reflected with a smile it turned out that handling those difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend as you say minosama ikeda bowed i merely wanted to make you aware of my concern about the pilot he should be monitored more closely from now on which is precisely what i intend to do tanzan minos silver hair seemed to blend with the sea beyond there is an obvious solution when he takes the vehicle hypersonic he will not be alone what are you suggesting no one else merely a simple security precaution if he is not reliable then steps must be taken two of our people will be in the cockpit with him you mean the scientists from tsukuba the cockpit was designed to accommodate a threeman crew but miti hasnt yet designated the two researchers no i mean my personal pilot and copilot from the boeing then if androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way they will be there ready to take immediate action the problem is solved he revolved back from the window that will be all ikeda bowed then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door he didnt like lastminute improvisations but the ceo was now fully in command preparations for two additional lifesupport systems would have to be started immediately after tanzan mino watched him depart he reached down and activated a line of personal video monitors beside his desk thursday pm vance recognized the sound immediately it was the harplike plucking of a japanese koto punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime without opening his eyes he reached out and touched a hard textured surface it was he realized a straw mat and from the firmness of the weave he knew it was tatami then he felt the soft cotton of the padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon the air in the room was faintly spiced with mahayana buddhist temple incense im in japan he told himself or somebody wants me to think i am he opened his eyes and found himself looking at a ricepaper lamp on the floor next to his futon directly behind it on the left was a tokonoma art alcove built next to a set of sliding doors a small round shoji window in the tokonoma shed a mysterious glow on its hanging scroll the painting an ink sketch of a zen monk fording a shallow stream then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors with a giant brush he struggled to focus and finally grasped that it was the minoan double ax logo of the daedalus corporation jesus he lay a minute nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember what had happened all he could recall was london money eva eva where was she he popped erect and surveyed the room it was traditional jap anese the standard fourandahalf tatami in size bare and spartan a classic but the music it seemed to be coming through the walls the walls they all looked to be rice paper he clambered up and headed for the fusuma with the doubleax logo he tested it and realized that the paper was actually painted steel and it was locked the room was secure as a vault but across opposite the tokonoma was another set of sliding doors as he turned to walk over he noticed he was wearing tabi light cotton stockings split at the toe and he was clad in a bluepatterned yukata robe cinched at the waist hed been stripped and redressed this door was real and he shoved it open a suite of rooms lay beyond and there on a second futon still in a drugged sleep lay eva he moved across bent down and shook her she jerked away her dreaming disrupted and turned over but she didnt come out of it wake up he shook her again the party just got moved waitll you get a load of the decor what she rolled back and cracked open her bloodshot eyes then she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room it was appointed identically to his with only the hanging scroll in the tokonoma different hers being an angular threelevel landscape my god welcome to the wonderful world of tanzan mino i dont know where the hell we are but its definitely not kansas or london my head feels like i was at ground zero when the bomb hit my whole body aches she groaned and plopped back down on the futon what time do you think it is havent a clue how about starting with what day he felt for his watch and realized it was gone what does it matter anyway nobody has clocks in nevernever land satisfied she was okay he stood up and surveyed the room then he saw what hed expected there in the center of the ceiling integrated into the pattern of lightcolored woods was the glass eye of a video camera and the music still the faint music he walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another set of sliding doors also painted with the doubleax insignia he found himself looking at a third large space this one paneled in raw cypress it was vast and in the center was a cedar hot tub sunk into the floor the water was fresh and steaming and two tiny stools and rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking it was a traditional ofuro one of the finest hed ever seen youre not going to believe this he turned back and waved her forward in the soft ricepaper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly disheveled japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking our host probably figured wed want to freshen up for the festivities check it out what she was shakily rising pulling her yukata around her all the comforts of home too bad they forgot the geisha she came over and stood beside him i dont believe this want to see if its real or just a mirage she hesitantly stepped onto the decking then walked out and bent down to test the water feels wet she glanced back so what the heck i could use it im ready he kicked off his tabi and walked on out she pulled off his yukata then picked up one of the pails and began filling it from a spigot on the wall okay exalted male she laughed im going to scrub you thats how they do it right she stood up and reached for a sponge and soap they know how to live here let me he picked up a second sponge and began scrubbing her back in turn how does it feel maybe this is heaven hope we didnt have to die to get here but hang on ive got a feeling the fun is just beginning he splashed her off with one of the pails then watched as she gingerly climbed down into the wooden tub michael where do you think we are she sighed as the steam enveloped her this has got to be japan but where got a funny feeling i know he was settling into the water beside her but if i told you youd probably think im hallucinating above the tub he suddenly noticed yet another video camera as they lay soaking the koto music around them abruptly stopped its poignant twangs disappearing with an electronic click are you finding the accommodations adequate the voice was coming from a speaker carefully integrated into the raw cypress ceiling all things considered wed sooner be in philadelphia vance looked up im sorry to hear that the voice continued no expense has been spared my own personal quarters have been placed at your disposal mind telling me whos watching me bathe eva splashed a handful of water at the lens you have no secrets from me dr borodin however in the interest of propriety i have switched off the monitor for the bath im afraid my people were somewhat overly zealous installing one there in the first place the voice chuckled but i should think youd know i am ceo of the daedalus corporation an organization not unfamiliar to you all right she said so where are we why you are in the corporations hokkaido facility as my guests since you two have taken such an interest in this project i thought it only fitting you should have an opportunity to see it first hand mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda vance leaned back we need to plan our day quite simply i thought it was time you and i got reacquainted dr vance its been a long time eight years yes eight years there was a pause if you would excuse me a moment i must take a call the speaker clicked off michael ive got a very bad feeling about all this she was rising from the bath her back to the camera what do you think hes going to do hes going to kill us vance realized after hes played with us a while its really quite simple i dont know he lied then the speaker clicked on again please forgive me there are so many demands on my time however i was hoping you dr vance would consent to join me this afternoon for tea we have some urgent matters to discuss ill see if i can work it into my schedule given the hectic goingson here at the moment perhaps a quiet moment would be useful for us both he paused again speaking to someone else then his voice came back shall we say four oclock what time is it now please forgive me i forgot your world is not regimented by time whereas mine regrettably is measured down to seconds it is now almost three in the afternoon i shall expect you in one hour your clothes are in the closet in your room now if you will allow me affairs and the voice was gone michael are you really going to talk with that criminal wouldnt miss it for the world theres a game going on here and we have to stay in everybodys got a score to settle were about to see who settles up first thursday pm zero minus eighteen hours yuri andreevich androv stared at the green screen its numbers scrolling the computerized countdown eighteen fucking hours as he wheeled around gazing over the beehive of activity in flight control he could already feel the adrenaline beginning to build everything depended on him now the vehicle was as ready as it was going to be all the wind tunnel tests all the computer simulations even the supersonic test flightseverything said go daedalus i was going to make history tomorrow morning except he told himself its going to be a very different history from the one everybody expects major yuri andreevich androv please report to hangar quadrant immediately the stridency of the facilitys paging system always annoyed him he glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time then shrugged and checked his watch who wanted him well a new planeload of soviet vips reportedly had flown in yesterday though he hadnt seen any of them yet he figured now that everything looked ready the nomenklatura were flooding in to bask in triumph maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the officials in project management theyd sobered up and realized they were expected to file reports so they were finally getting around to talking to the people who were doing the actual work theyd summon in a few staffers who had handson knowledge of the project and commission a draft report which theyd then file unread under their own names typical he reached for his leather flight jacket deciding on a brisk walk to work off the tension the long corridor leading from the east quadrant to the hangar quadrant took him directly past checkpoint central and the entry to west quadrant the soviet sector which also contained the flight simulator and the main wind tunnel or number one both now quiet as he walked he thought again about the new rumor hed heard in the commissary at lunch gossip kept the soviet staff goingan instinct from the old daysbut this one just might be true some lowerlevel staffers even claimed theyd seen him the chief word was tanzan mino himselfnone other than the ceo of the daedalus corporationhad flown in this morning together with his personal bodyguards and aides the story was he wanted handson control of the first hypersonic test flight wanted to be calling the shots in flight control when daedalus i made history finally the big man has decided to show his face yuri andreevich just a minute slow down he recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see nikolai vasilevich grishkov the portly soviet chief mechanic just emerging from the west quadrant his bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of siberian muskox horns above his gleaming dark eyes have you seen her grishkov was shuffling toward him seen who he examined the mechanics spotless white coveralls jesus even the support crews on this project were all sanitized hightech the new woman kracevia moi droog ochen kracevia beautiful beyond words and she is important you can tell just by looking nikolai theres never been a woman in this facility he laughed and continued on toward security its worse than a goddam troop ship youve finally started hallucinating from lack of pezdyonka yuri andreevich shes here and shes soviet the chief mechanic followed him some believe she arrived this morning with the ceo but nobody knows who she is one rumor is shes vera karanova who the name was vaguely familiar tdirectorate like i said no one knows for sure but thats what weve heard impossible he halted and turned back frowning thats just it yuri andreevich he sighed those kgb bastards are not supposed to even know about this project that was everybodys strict understanding we were to be free of them here but now he caught the sleeve of androvs flight jacket and pulled him aside out of the flow of pedestrian traffic in the hallway my men were wondering maybe you could find a way to check her out you have better access everybody wants to know whats going on kgb it doesnt make any sense if shes really i just talked to the project kurirovat ivan semenovich and he told me karanovas now number three in tdirectorate well theres nothing we can do now so the hell with her he waved his hand and tried to move on weve both got better things to worry about just keep your antenna tuned my friend thats all let me know if you can find out anything is she really karanova because if she is we damned well need to know the inside story nikolai if i see her ill be sure and ask he winked and if shes the hot number you say maybe ill find time to warm her up a little get her to drop her guard if you succeed in that moi droog he said as his heavy eyebrows lifted with a sly grin youll be the envy of the facility youve got to see her i cant wait he shrugged and moved on toward the hangar security station at the end of the long corridor when he flashed his alevel priority id for the two japanese guards he noticed they nervously made a show of scrutinizing it even though they both knew him perfectly well before saluting and authorizing entry that nails it he told himself out of nowhere we suddenly have all this rulebook crap these guys are nervous as hell no doubt about it the big nachalnik is on the scene great let all those assholes on the soviet staff see the expression on his face when the truth comes out thats the real history were about to make here as he walked into the glare of neon the cavernous space had never seemed more vast more imposing hed seen a lot of hangars flown a lot of experimental planes over the years but nothing to match this still he always reminded himself daedalus was only hardware just more fancy iron what really counted was the balls of the pilot holding the flight stick thats when he saw them clustered around the vehicle and gazing up he immediately recognized colonelgeneral of aviation anatoly savitsky whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in soviet military review major general igor mikhailov whose picture routinely graced the pages of air defense herald and also colonelgeneral pavel ogarkov a marshal of the soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the general secretary what are those air force neanderthals doing here theyre all notorious hardliners the bomb first ask questions later boys and daedalus is supposed to be for space research right guess the bullshit is about to be over were finally getting down to the real scenario and there in the middle clearly the man in charge was a tall silverhaired japanese in a charcoal silk suit he was showing off the vehicles as though he owned them and he carried himself with an authority that made all the hovering soviet generals look like bellboys waiting for a tip well yuri andreevich thought for the time being he does own them theyre bought and paid for just like us tovarisch major androv kak pazhavatye came a voice behind him he turned and realized it belonged to general valentin sokolov commander of the mig wing at the dolinsk air base on sakhalin sokolov was three star top man in all the soviet far east flanking him were half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels comrade general sokolov he whipped off a quick salute brass brass everywhere shit what in hell was this all about now the project director taro ikeda had broken away from the soviet group and was approaching yuri andreevich thank you for coming he bowed deferentially you are about to receive a great honor the ceo has asked for a private conference with you yuri stared over ikedas shoulder at the manincharge all this rightwing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing he was the one calling the shots who was everybody kidding now the ceo looked his way sizing him up with a quick glance yuri androv assessed him in turn it was one look but they both knew there was trouble ahead then tanzan mino patted a colonelgeneral on the shoulder and headed over yuri andreevich androv i presume he said in flawless russian bowing lightly a genuine pleasure to meet you at last theres a most urgent matter we have to discuss thursday pm at the precise hour the tokonoma alcove off vances bedroom rotated ninety degrees as though moved by an unseen hand and what awaited beyond was a traditional japanese sandandstone garden it was of course lit artificially but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be thriving on the fluorescents through the gardens grassy center was a curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular curves and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean waves the rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in chinese sung landscape paintings vances attention however was riveted on what awaited at the end of the stony walkway it was a traditional teahouse set in a grove of flowering azaleas and standing in the doorway was a silverhaired figure dressed in a formal black kimono he was beckoning did i neglect to tell you i prefer japanese chanoyu to the usual british afternoon tea tanzan mino announced it is a ritual designed to renew the spirit to cleanse the mind it goes back hundreds of years i always enjoy it in the afternoon and i find it has marvelously restorative powers this seemed the ideal occasion for us to meet and chat dont want to slight tradition vance slipped on the pair of wooden clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path my feelings entirely the ceo continued smiling as he watched him approach you understand the japanese way dr vance which is one reason we have so much to discuss he bowed a greeting as vance deposited his clogs on the stepping stone by the teahouse door together they stooped to enter a light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into the tatamimatted floor but otherwise the room was caught in an ethereal silence the decor was more modern than most teahouses with fresh cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary reed bark and bamboo tanzan mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he immediately began the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop then elevating the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially wiping it all the while his eyes were emotionless betraying no hint of what was in his mind after the utensils were ceremonially cleansed he wordlessly scooped a portion of palegreen powdered tea into the bowl then lifted a dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in finally he picked up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture continuing until it had acquired the consistency of green foam authority control andabove alldiscipline those things vance knew were what this was really about as was traditional and proper not a word was spoken this was the zen equivalent of high mass and tanzan mino was silently letting him know he was a true masterof himself of his world then the oyabun reached over and formally presented the bowl placing it on the tatami in front of his guest vance lifted it up rotated it a half turn in his hand and took a reserved sip as the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth he found himself thinking this was probably intended to be his last supper he hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right he sipped one more time then wiped the rim formally repositioned the bowl on the tatami and leaned back perfectly done tanzan mino smiled as he broke the silence im impressed he nodded toward the white bowl incidentally you were just handling one of the finest pieces in all japan shino ware mino region late sixteenth century remarkably fine glaze considering those kilns had just started firing chawan you have a learned eye dr vance he smiled again glancing down to admire the rough cracked surface of the rim the experts disagree on the age some saying very early seventeenth century but i think your assessment is correct in any case just handling it always soothes my spirit the discipline of the samurai is in a chawan like this and in the chanoyu ceremony itself its a test i frequently give my western friends to see if they can grasp its spirituality im pleased to say that you handled the bowl exactly as you should have you understand that japanese culture is about shaping the randomness of human actions to a refined perfection thats what we really should be discussing here this afternoon not the world of affairs but im afraid time is short i often think of life in terms of a famous haiku by the poet shiki hirahira to kaze ni nigarete cho hitotsu sounds more like your new airplane vance observed then translated a mortal butterfly fluttering and drifting in the wind a passable enough rendering if i may say though i dont necessarily accept your analogy he reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed sake from beside the brazier by the way i know you prefer tequila one of your odd quirks but there was no time to acquire any perhaps this will suffice he set down two black raku saucers and began to pour now alas we must proceed post time vance thought dr michael vance he lifted his saucer in a toast a scholar of the lost aegean civilizations a former operative of the central intelligence agency and finally a private consultant affiliated with a group of mercenaries i had your file updated when i first heard you were involved i see you have not been entirely idle since our last encounter you havent done too bad yourself vance toasted him back this new project is a big step up from the old days has a lot of style it does indeed he nodded im quite proud of our achievement here you always thought big vance sipped again at his sake warm and soothing its kind of you to have remembered mino drank once more then settled his saucer on the tatami and looked up of course any questions you have i would be okay hows this what do you expect to get out of me he laughed why nothing at all our reunion here is merely intended to serve as a tutorial to remind you and others how upsetting i find intrusions into my affairs then how about starting off this tutorial with a look at your new plane vance glanced around guess i should call it daedalus daedalus i and ii there actually are two prototypes although only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic regime yes i expected the daedalus would intrigue you you are a man of insatiable intellectual appetite im not sure thats necessarily a compliment it wasnt necessarily meant to be sometimes curiosity needs to be curbed but if we can agree on certain matters i shall enjoy providing you a personal tour to satisfy that curiosity you are a man who can well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic coup the old boys finally gone off the deep end vance told himself megalomania incidentally by strategic coup i suppose youre referring to the fact youve got them exactly where you want them the soviets what do you mean his eyes hardened slightly you know what i mean they probably dont realize it yet but youre going to end up with the soviet far east in your wallet for the price of a hot airplane you get to plunder the region theyre even going to be thanking you while you reclaim sakhalin for japan this daedalus spaceship is going to cost them the ranch have to admit its brilliant along with financing the whole scheme by swindling benelux tax dodgers you are too imaginative for your own good dr vance he said a thin smile returning nobody is going to believe your interpretation of the protocol youve got a point nobody appreciates the true brilliance of a criminal mind or maybe they just havent known you as long as i have really id hoped we would not descend to trading insults he reached to refill vances sake saucer its demeaning instead id hoped we could proceed constructively why not well then perhaps youll forgive me if im somewhat blunt im afraid my time is going to be limited over the next few hours i may as well tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the daedalus tomorrow morning we will take her to mach seventeen thousand miles per hour a speed almost ten times greater than any airbreathing vehicle has ever before achieved the skys the limit he whistled quietly alex hadnt known the half of it this was the ultimate plane impressive i think youll agree mino smiled and poured more sake for himself congratulations thank you that ought to grease the way in the diet for your deal and the protocols financial grab ought to sail through the supreme soviet you prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your profits so i would like to think he nodded of course one never knows how these things will eventually turn out so when do i get a look at it why that all depends on certain agreements we need to make then i guess its time i heard the bottom line most assuredly he leaned back dr vance you have just caused me considerable hardship nor is this the first occasion you have done so yet i have not achieved what i have to date without becoming something of a judge of men the financial arrangements you put together in london demonstrated i thought remarkable ingenuity there could be a place for you in my organization despite all that has happened between us i dont work for the mob if thats what youre hoping dont be foolhardy those days are well behind me he went on calmly despite the flicker of anger in his eyes the completion of this project will require financial and strategic skills well beyond those possessed by the people who have worked for me in the past all those petty criminals and hoods you mean i will choose to ignore that he continued whatever you may wish to call them they are not proving entirely adequate to the task at hand you bested my european people repeatedly and brought me a decided humiliation speaking of which vance found himself suddenly wondering a thought out of the blue whats happened to vera shes been european point woman for this whole scam wheres she now mino continued therefore i must now either take you into my organization or he paused its that simple which i wonder will it be vance studied him a lot depends on what happens to eva the fate of dr borodin depends largely on your decision so perhaps i should give you some time to think it over he leaned back or perhaps some inducement vance didnt know what he meant at first then he turned and looked behind him there waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three of tanzan minos personal kobun two of whom he recognized from london the ceos instructions to them were in rapidfire japanese but he needed no translation as they moved forward thursday pm yuri andreevich was mad as hell after his oneonone with tanzan mino he knew hed been screwed sticking a couple of pilots from mino industries in the cockpit it was just the old gru trick surveillance under the specious guise of support hed seen it all before but hed had an idea a flash what about the woman nikolai had seen the one he said was tdirectorate a knockout thats what nikolai had claimed so she shouldnt be hard to track down hed been methodically working the crowded corridors of the north quadrant checking every open doorway although the facility was huge and sprawling he figured shed probably be somewhere here close to command sector where the hell could she be one thing was sure tanzan mino was as sharp as all the rumors said the bastard had been onsite for less than a day and already hed suspected that something was brewing so hed made his own preemptive strike the problem now was how to outsmart him this tdirectorate operative had to be the way after he got her into a receptive mood hed lay out his case point out he had enough to worry about in the cockpit without playing flight instructor to a couple of mino industries greenhorns hed never flown an experimental plane with civilian copilots and he damned sure wasnt going to start now especially now govno where the hell was she he continued methodically checking the north quadrant offices just down from the command sector hoping somebody there had seen her the whole place was getting hectic now lastminute briefings right and left whenever hed spot a friendly russian face hed collar its owner to inquire about her fortunately he had an alevel pass so all he had to do was flash it to the security stiffs at each sector checkpoint and theyd wave him past hed just talked to a couple of flight engineers coming out of a briefing room who claimed theyd spotted her in the hallway no more than half an hour ago but why was she here at all it made no sense unless shed defected gone to work for mino industries which was exactly the kind of thing youd expect from one of those opportunistic kgb bastards konyechnaya there she was shapely ass and all just in front of him headed for sector control and flanked by two japanese security types they were striding close by probably showing her around maybe she was worried about safety here with all these sexstarved engineers odd but her walk wasnt exactly what hed expected seemed a little too knowing guess thats what happens when you spend too much time in the decadent capitalist west he decided to just make his move right there in the hall truthfully she did look like a hot number nikolai wasnt kidding this was going to be more interesting than hed figured zadroka a piece thursday pm strasvetye came a voice behind eva kak pazhavatye she whirled around moving in fast was a tall andadmit itnot badlooking soviet major ya yuri andreevich androv he declared with a light debonair bow his russian was cultivated moscow they tell me you just got here thought we should meet youve probably heard of me i have no idea who you are she heard herself saying where the hell did they take michael she was wondering right after he met with tanzan mino hed disappeared and now she was being moved she didnt know where but she did know one thing all the phony politeness was over things had gotten very rough very fast she was being relocated to a secure location in the soviet section or so she suspected but she figured project management mainly just wanted to keep her out of the way right now though she had an agenda of her own im a servant of the people the major who called himself yuri androv winked like you im frequently asked to try and kill myself in their behalf i dont know she tried to answer but the japanese guards were roughly pulling her on im the test pilot for the vehicle he finally announced how lovely she glared at him i hope its going to be a smashing success im about to find out tomorrow morning right now all i want to do is try and get back in one piece which is why i need to talk to you he caught her arm temporarily blocking the two uniformed mino industries guards then he continued on in russian ive got a problem weve got a problem i was hoping you could help me out when the two security men tried to urge her on he flashed his alevel at them and told them to lay the fuck off in explicit russian startled they froze thats when it finally dawned on her this idiot must think im vera now he was withdrawing a white packet of english cigarettes and offering her one instinctively she reached out so how can i help you major androv eva flashed him a smile as he lit her english oval with a match its the test flight tomorrow nobody should be near that cockpit who hasnt been certified to at least ten gs in the simulator i tried to tell him but he wouldnt listen ten gs she was trying to keep him talking thats damned dangerous but we need it to bring the scramjets up to rated thrust at least the first time theyve never been tested in flight we just dont know and nobody else here has been certified she wasnt even sure exactly what certified meant but she tried to look concerned exactly now all of a sudden he wants to stick a couple of his nips in the cockpit there with me probably cropduster screwups from mino industries he finally lit his own cigarette with a suggestive flourish christ she thought why do all soviet pilots think theyre gods gift to women i tell you its idiotic he exhaled through his nose youve got to help me make him see that before its too late she glanced sideways at the two impatient japanese from their blank faces she realized they hadnt understood a word well she thought right now ive got nothing to lose what youre saying major is very disturbing perhaps we should have a word with the ceo right away we both know times getting short she glanced down the hall toward the wide doors at the end command sector why dont we just go in together and see him shed noticed the majors alevel which seemed to carry clout maybe you can deal with these flunkies she indicated the minogumi kobun posing as her guards since i neglected to bring my pass they have no idea who i really am he laughed guess a few assholes around here are in for a surprise no kidding she thought mainly you flyboy god nobody can strut like a soviet air force pilot hard currency stores scotch from scotland american cigarettes french porno videos they think they own the world bad luck romeo youre about to have tanzan mino all over your case maybe youll end up so rattled tomorrow youll crash and burn he turned and waved his pass at the two guards minosan wa important business desu then he seized her arm and pushed the guards aside come on maybe you can get these fuckups fired after were through ill see what i can do she smiled again by the way youre confirming that the big test flight is still on in the morning she paused still not sure exactly what the test was all about ohninethirty hours all the way he was leading the way briskly down the crowded corridor and youre going to take her hypersonic mach straight to the edge brush the stars and believe me ive got to be alone i cant be running a flight school he was striding ahead of her now talking over his shoulder which is why youve got to help me talk some sense into that old fucker excuse me he said grinning in mock apology the ceo the guards at the wide double doors leading into tanzan minos suite just gaped as yuri andreevich androv flourished his alevel at them and then shoved his way past oblivious to the clamor of japanese shouts now trailing in his wake minosan pazhalsta he said to the figure standing in the anteroom scarcely noticing it was a woman and too expensively dressed for a receptionist eva watched vera karanova lunge for a button on the desk as he pushed open the teakwood door leading into tanzan minos inner office the first thing she noticed was the wide window behind the desk opening on a stunning view of the straits the setting sun glancing off the tips of the whitecaps seated behind the desk monitoring a line of computer screens was a silverhaired executive so thats what he looks like she thought perfect central casting couldnt have done better yuri andreevich what he glanced up glaring at eva i see youve met one of our american guests american androv stopped then looked at her puzzled better make this fast she told herself in about five seconds comrade karanovas going to take this soviet heros head off listen you bastard she was storming the desk if you so much as lay a finger on michael or me either one of us the national security agency is going to close you down so fast youll think an hbomb hit this fucking place i want to see the american ambassador and i want my belongings returned everything is being taken care of dr borodin vera karanova answered from the doorway eva glanced back and saw a platoon of eight minoguchi kobun minos personal bodyguards all with automatics you will come with us androv was staring blankly at her now his swagger melting like springtime georgian snow youre american national security they kidnapped us in london theyre going to screw you everybody we found out we my name is eva borodin im director of soviet sigint for the national security agency in washington and mike vance cia is here too god knows what these criminals are doing to him right now but theyre about to take you apart too hotshot so have a nice day and while youre at it tovarisch androv you have just done a very foolish thing veras voice was frigid i dont think you realize how foolish dr borodin mino finally spoke you are even more resourceful than id expected resourcefulness however is not prudence dr vance is currently reviewing a proposal i made him you should be hoping he will accept as for the national security agency they believe you are still on holiday after tomorrow it will not matter nothing you can do will interfere with our schedule well see about that trust me he smiled then his look turned grave and shifted major androv you will kindly remain after they have taken her away chapter eighteen friday am the room was cold just cold that was the first thing hed noticed when they shoved him in it still was for nine hours hed been sitting on a hard canvascovered soviet cot shivering the place was no larger than a small cell with a tile floor ice gray concrete walls and two bare fluorescent bulbs for lighting no heat there was a slight vibrationit seemed to be part of the room itselfemanating from the walls and floor hed tracked it to a large wall duct ventilation system could use adjusting hed thought fan housings loose somewhere they also could turn up the damned heat he was wearing only what hed had on in london and this definitely was not london hokkaido was a much colder part of the planet the room had the feeling of a quick slappedtogether job but it also looked like it could withstand a mediumsized nuclear detonation one thing was sure though it wasnt built with comfort in mind the door was steel the same dull hue as the rest it was bolted from the outside naturally but if isolation and cold were tanzan minos idea of how to break his spirit to see how tough he was the man was in for some disappointment what the mino industries ceo had unwittingly accomplished by moving him here however was to enlighten him about the layout of the place as he was being escorted down the crowded facility corridors by the three leatherjacketed kobun hed passed a projection video screen suspended over the center of a main intersection the location seemed to be some sort of central checkpoint and the screen displayed a schematic of the whole facility hed faked a stumble and used the recovery time to quickly scan its essential features he leaned back on the cot and ran through one more time what hed seen on the screen trying to imprint it in his memory insight number one the facility was organized into four main quadrants with a layout like a large x some of the writing was japanese but mostly it was russian cyrillic characters he massaged his temples and visualized it again the first thing hed focused on was something called the north quadrant whose russian designation was komendant it looked to be the command center with a redcolored area labeled in both japanese and russian next to that were a lot of little rooms probably living quarters or barracks kanji ideograms identified those so that section was probably where the japanese staffers bivouacked that command section hed realized was where he and eva had been theyd been quartered in a part of tanzan minos private suites the belly of the beast it got even more interesting the other three quadrants were where the real work was going on on the right side of the screen was east quadrant whose label was komputer kommunekatseon which meant it contained the computers and communications setup flight control and the south quadrant the assamblaya consisted of a lot of large open bays probably where the two prototypes had been assembled those bays connected directly to a massive sector labeled angar the hangar but the bays also had separate access to the runway probably for delivery of prefabricated sections from somewhere else the west quadrant appeared to house test facilities the one label he could read was laboratoraya probably materials labs next to a configuration that could have been a large wind tunnel made sense that quadrant also had more small rooms with russian labels hed studied the screen a second longer and bingo hed realized he was being moved into the soviet sector probably the barracks and laboratory area this had to be the least used location in the facility now he told himself all the wind tunnel testing of sections and the materials research was probably wrapped up meaning this area was history yesterdays news so the ceo had shunted him to this obscure lockup in the west quadrant the soviet section what better spot to discreetly dispose of somebody for a while time to brush up your russian problem washe grimaced at the realizationthere wasnt a heck of a lot left to brush hed had a year at yale just enough to let him struggle along with a dictionary and squeak around some standard language requirement that was it hed never given it a second thought afterward instead hed gone on to his real loveancient greek then later in cia days the action had been asia at one time hed ended up doing some consulting for langleys far eastern intel desk helping coordinate american and japanese fieldwork he could swing the japanese but the russian tanzan mino probably knew that yet another reason why hed decided on this transfer thered be fewer people here to communicate with smart the labyrinth of king minos brainchild of daedalus thats what he felt trapped in but theseus the greek prince who killed the monster got some help from minoss daughter ariadne a ball of string to help him find his way out of the maze this time around though where was help going to come from maybe the first job here was to kill the monster then worry about what came next partly to generate a little body heat he turned and braced himself at an angle against the door starting some half pushups with his hands on the door he also could sense some of the activity in the hallway outside he figured it had to be after midnight by now but there were still random comings and goings activity but nothing he felt a tremor then heard a loud scraping and the sound of a bolt being slid aside he quickly wheeled and flattened himself against the wall looking futilely for something to use as a weapon aside from the cot though there was nothing okay this would be hand to hand he could use the exercise besides he was mad enough the gray steel door slowly began to swing inward then a mane of white hair tentatively appeared followed by a rugged ancient face as the visitor turned to stare at him through heavy glasses strasvitye the man said finally uncertainty in his gravelly voice ya doktor andrei petrovich androv friday am would the idea work yuri still didnt know as he walked between the vehicles the hangars wide banks of fluorescents glaring down on the final preflight preps for daedalus i he was sure of only one thing at this point the revised plan was the only option left would the american help the woman the bitch was no fool an insight hed come by the hard way but maybe the cia guywhat had she said his name wasvance how the hell did he get here however it had happened he was being kept in the west quadrant it had been no trick to find him he was a godsend his help would make the scenario possible now it merely required splitsecond timing he glanced up at the big liquid crystal display screen on the far wall noting it read zero minus eight hours ten minutes he should be back in the west quadrant now catching some sleepif taro ikeda knew he was here in the hangar thered be hell to paybut time was running out tanzan mino had listened icily to his renewed arguments against additional personnel in the cockpit then declared that the viability of the program depended on having backups merely an essential precaution end of discussion bullshit as soon as the political games were played out the ceo was planning to get rid of him probably by some accident well screw him and thats where the american came in the thing to do was just appear to be proceeding with the countdown normally keep everything innocent then at the last minute he stared up at daedalus i one last time watching as the maintenance crews finished the last of the preflight scramjet preps and he shook his head in amazement that andrei androv and all his damned propulsion engineers could create a genuine technological miracle and still be total bumblers when it came to what in hell was really happening these technical types thought they were so brilliant but if it had taken them all this time to realize theyd been fucked by mino industries then how smart could they really be made him wonder how the baikonur cosmodrome ever managed to get so much as a turnip into orbit now these same geniuses had to get daedalus ii flight ready in just a few hours and had to do it without anyone suspecting what they were doing finally they had to be ready to roll into action the instant the accident happened no trial runs he checked his watch and realized his fathers propulsion team was already gathering at number one the final meeting the question now was could they really deliver the american was the key friday am your name vance the russian voice with its uncertain english was the last thing hed expected who are you for this vehicle i am director propulsion system he replied formally and with pride pulling at his white lab coat i must talk you please vance stepped away from the wall and looked the old man over more closely then it clicked andrei petrovich androv was a living legend ten years ago the cia already had a tech file on him that filled three of those oldtime reels of halfinch tape these days god knows what they had hed been the ussrs great space pioneer a hero whod gone virtually unrecognized by his own country no order of lenin nothing nada but maybe hed preferred it that way liked being a recluse nobody least of all the cias soviet specialists could figure him and now he was here in the wilds of northern hokkaido building a spaceplane theyd sent over no less than the grand old man to handle the propulsion this project was top priority a s it deserved to be but the immediate question was what was the dean of soviet rocket research doing here visiting him sorry i cant offer you a cup of tea no samovar he looked out the open door one last time several soviet staffers were glancing in as they walked by obviously puzzled why the famous doktor androv himself had come around to talk with some unknown civilian shto ya ne ponemayu i not understand tea chai he shrugged just a bad joke he reached over and shoved the door closed then gestured toward the cot in the wrong language please sit thank you the old man settled himself i did not come for chai his hands were trembling i want abruptly he hesitated as though searching for words and then his mind appeared to wander your name is vance mike vance and you are with american cia whats going on he wondered how did these soviets find out uh right he glanced away thats correct mr vance my son is test pilot for the daedalus he continued running his gnarled hands nervously through his long white hair his name is yuri andreevich pozdravleneye vance nodded congratulations yuri andreevich is about to make the cover of newsweek you should be proud we have serious problem mr vance he seemed not to hear that is why i am come i am very worried for my son vance looked him over more closely yes he did appear worried his severe penetrating eyes were filled with anguish got a problem with the ceo guess the godfather can be a hard man to warm up to even for his new allies mr vance i do not know you but there is very small time he continued with a shrug not understanding so please i will tell you many things in very few minutes vance continued to study him go ahead you may not realize but this project is to be giant leap for our space program many of our best engineers are here this vehicle a reusable nearearth space platform would save billions of rubles over many years it is airbreathing vehicle that would lift research payloads directly into space but my son never believe that its real purpose perhaps i was idealist because i believe i always think he was wrong but more and more of things i have learned about its electronicsthings we had nothing to do withmake me now believe he is right and yesterday when certain chelovek of the soviet air force come the worst he paused his voice beginning to betray barely concealed rage i have work all my life for peaceful exploring of space and now i have been betrayed the engineers i bring with me here have been betrayed i also believe mr vance that the soviet people have been betrayed and along with them mikhail sergeevich himself this is part of a plot to i dont know what secretly is plan but i am now convinced this plane must be destroyed before it is too late and the world must be warned that is why then why dont you warn somebody vance interrupted him matter of fact theres a lot more to this setup than an airplane but why do you think i am here talking to you the facility now is completely sealed i would warn mikhail sergeevich what is happening but no communication is possible he hesitated again painfully they want to put my son in the airplane tomorrow with guards he has been made prisoner like you he does not want to fly the vehicle for tomorrows test but the ceo is forcing him to do it he looked up his eyes bleary and bloodshot mr vance i think he will be killed as soon as this plane is certified hypersonic they no longer trust him what about you they probably wont think youre very trustworthy either if they find out you came to see me that is correct but the time has come for risks so what do you want from me he stood back and looked the whitehaired old man over one last time was he telling the truth were the soviet engineers actually planning a mutiny we are going to stop it tomorrow morning just before the test flight it must be done good luck mr vance you are with american intelligence we are only engineers we know nothing about the kind of things necessary to do you have any weapons nothing the guards here are all from the corporation he lowered his voice frankly most of them look like criminals they are vance laughed in spite of himself i dont understand i know you dont understand if you did but thats beside the point then will you help us his wrinkled face was fixed in determination do you know anything about explosives enough but are you really sure thats the way you want to go he paused theres a lot that can go wrong in a big facility like this without anybody knowing what caused it all the sensitive areas are under heavy security now they are impossible to penetrate terrific vance thought by the way how does your son the test pilot figure into all this all along he was planning to i dont know he refused to tell me but it doesnt matter now that two mino industries guards are being put in the cockpit with him whatever he was planning is impossible so we have to do something here on the ground well where is he he is in the hangar now ill need to see him for one thing vance thought he probably knows how to use a gun all soviet pilots carry an automatic and two sevenround clips for protection in case they have to ditch in the wilderness somewhere our first order of business is to jump some of these minogumi goons whore posing as security men and get their weapons by the way do you know where theyre keeping the american woman who was brought here with me the old mans eyes grew vague i believe shes somewhere here in the west quadrant i think she was transferred here around eighteen hundred hours and then a little later her suitcase arrive from hangar her bag his pulse quickened delivered by the facilitys robot carts the plane that brought you was being made ready for the ceos trip back to tokyo where was it left i dont know i only okay later right now maybe youd better start by getting me out of here that is why i brought this he indicated the brown paper package he was carrying it was the first time vance had noticed it i have in here an air force uniform it belongs to my son the parcel was carefully secured with white stringa methodical precision that came from years of engineering you will pose as one of us the old man continued you do not speak russian maybe enough to fool the minogumi but nobody else he was watching as androv began unwrapping the package then just let me do all talk he shrugged if anybody wonders who you are i will be giving you tour of the west quadrant you should pretend to be drunk it would surprise no one you will frown a lot and mumble incoherent questions to me we will go directly to my office where i will tell you our plan now andrei androv was unfolding a new formfitting uniform intended for yuri andreevich the shoulder boards had one wide gold chevron and two small rectangles signifying the rank of major in the soviet air force also included was a tall lambswool cap the kind officers wore vance took the hat and turned it in his hand hed never actually held one before nice seems i just got made air force major and ive never flown anything bigger than a lear jet he slipped off the shirt hed been wearing in london happy to be rid of it and put on the first half of the uniform not a bad fit the trousers also seemed tailormade then he slipped on the wool topper completing the ensemble you would make a good officer i think andrei androv stood back and looked him over with a smile but you have to act like one too remember to be insulting after the hours in solitary freezing confinement he wasnt sure he looked like anything except a bum but hed have no difficulty leading doktor andrei androv along in the middle of the night and bombarding him with a steady stream of slurred russian shto eto ve chom sostoet vasha rabota how did the soviets find out he was here he wondered must have been eva shed got through to them somehow which meant she probably was still all right that at least was a relief after andrei androv clanged the steel door closed and bolted it they headed together toward the old mans personal office where he had smuggled drawings of the vehicles cockpit the hallways were lit with glaring fluorescents bustling with technicians and full of soviets in uniform vance returned a few of the crisp salutes and strutted drunkenly along ahead they wanted him to help blow up the plane he was a little rusty with good old c but hed be happy to brush up fast after that itd be a whole new ballgame friday am will he help yuri androv surveyed the eleven men in the darkened control room the wall along the left side consisted entirely of heavy plate glass looking out on number one that wind tunnel the video screens the instrument panels everything was dormant now aside from a few panel lights the space was illuminated only by the massive eightfootbytwentyfoot liquid crystal screen at the far end now scrolling the launch countdown green numbers blinking off the seconds except for nikolai vasilevich grishkov the soviet chief mechanic all those gathered were young engineers from andrei androvs propulsion design team grishkov however because of his familiarity with the layout of the hangar was the man in charge i just spoke with doktor androv and he believes the american will cooperate grishkov nodded he will bring him here as soon as he has been briefed i still wonder if i shouldnt just handle it myself it would be too dangerous for you yuri andreevich he knows about explosives besides you have to be ready to fly the other plane daedalus ii right after the explosion nobody else can take it up he laughed steal it you mean yuri andreevich we have made sure its fueled and we will get you into the cockpit after that we will know nothing about one other thing he interjected i want it fueled with liquid hydrogen impossible grishkovs expression darkened his bushy eyebrows lifting i categorically refuse i dont care i want it absolutely out of the question the engines on daedalus ii havent been certified in the scramjet mode you cant attempt to take it hypersonic it would be too risky he stopped then smiled dont worry you can still outrun any chase plane on earth with those twelve engines in ramjet mode i tell you i want to go to scramjet geometry yuri andreevich insisted his eyes determined if i cant do what i planned he told himself nobodys going to believe me ive got to take one of those vehicles hypersonic tomorrow morning ready or not impossible theres no way we can fuel daedalus ii with liquid hydrogen the mino industries ground crews would suspect something immediately its out of the question i forged some orders and had it fueled with jp late last night at hours thats the best i can do chort yuri thought well maybe i can fake it push it out to mach with jp and still and the two pilots from mino industries he turned back what about them if the american plays his part they will never suspect grishkov flashed a grin unless somebody here screws up he said gazing around the room again studying the white technicians uniforms the innocent faces therell be a lot of confusion when we start pumping liquid hydrogen into daedalus the site will be pandemonium grishkov continued all you have to do is get into the cockpit of the other plane it would be a horrible accident but accidents happened theyd all heard whispered stories about the tragedy at baikonur in october when almost a hundred men were killed because nikita khrushchev wanted a spectacular space shot while he was visiting the united nations when a giant rocket a mars probe failed to achieve ignition instead of taking the delay required to remove the fuel before checking the malfunction the technicians were ordered to troubleshoot it immediately tech crews were swarming over it when it detonated then i guess were ready yuri andreevich sighed we are grishkov nodded and reached for the phone beside the main console quickly punching in four numbers he spoke quietly for a few moments then replaced the receiver theyll be here in five minutes doktor androv has just completed his briefing on the cockpit configuration all right im going now just get the hangar doors open the runway cleared and the truckmounted starters ready this is going to be tricky so make sure everybody thinks were merely taking daedalus ii onto the runway as a safety precaution after the explosion yuri gazed over the group of engineers one last time would they do it whatever happened he had to get out of there and start checking the cockpit of daedalus ii before the mornings preflight crews arrived good luck by hours i want everything set he gave the room a final salute out of habit and headed for the security doors in moments hed disappeared into the corridor and was gone let me do the talking grishkov said turning back to the others and let doktor androv translate also remember he has no idea yuri andreevich is going to steal the other plane the men stirred and nodded their assent from here on they all were thinking the less they had to do with this plot the better then the door opened standing next to dr andrei petrovich androv was a tall man dressed as a soviet air force major as grishkov looked him over he had the fleeting impression that yuri andreevich had unexpectedly returned so similar was the american poseur to andrei androvs own son in height and build the resemblance was nothing short of miraculous this was going to be easier than hed dared to hope put the american in a pressure suit complete with flight helmet and he could easily pass he has agreed to set the explosives andrei said in russian as he gestured toward the man standing beside him in a tightfitting uniform meet major yuri andreevich androv friday am the room appeared to be the quarters of a highranking member of the soviet staff now returned to the ussr it was comfortably if sparely appointed and even had a computer terminal a small nec shed switched it on tried to call up some files but everything required a password she could use it however as a clock as she watched the time flashing on the corner of the screen she tried to remember what the soviet major had said about the schedule the first hypersonic test of the daedalus was scheduled for that was only an hour and a half away she was wearing her london clothes again but where the hell was her bag she walked over and sat down on the side of the single bed thinking if she could get her hands on the suitcase the uzi might still be there thats when she heard the sound of muted but crisp japanese outsidethe changing of the guard the minogumi kobun were keeping a strict schedule a precision that seemed perfectly in keeping with everything else about the facility life here was measured out not in coffee spoons but in scrolling numbers on computers the door opened and one of the new kobun showed his head at first she thought it was merely a bed check but he stared at her mutely for a moment then beckoned she rose and walked over this new goon black suit and all was armed with a mm walther p automatic in a shoulder holster outside the other minogumi motioned for her to come with them thats when she noticed her bag sitting just outside the door there goes my chance she sighed they want to keep me moving make sure im not in one place long enough for anybody to get suspicious this way ill seem to be just another guest without a word they were directing her along the hallway toward checkpoint central all tanzan minos kobun seemed to have free run of the facility because the uniformed security staff didnt even bother to ask for a pass they may have been new and alien visitors from outside this closed world but they represented the ceo carte blanche now they were moving down the crowded corridor leading to the south quadrant the walls were still gray but this was a new area one she hadnt yet been in no sign this time however of the soviet major named androv guess he wasnt kidding about an important test flight coming up something was definitely in the wind the pace of activity was positively hectic so why was she being moved right in the middle of all this chaos it didnt make sense she looked up ahead and realized they were headed toward two massive heavily guarded doors what could this sector be once again the japanese security guards merely bowed low and waved her minogumi escorts past the wide doors opened onto yet another hallway and she was overwhelmed by a blast of sound motors were blaring voices were shouting escaping gasses were hissing the din the racket engulfed her and then she realized the reason there was no ceiling even the offices along the side were merely highwalled cubicles that had been dropped here in the entryway of some vast space it was the hangar the actual entry at the end was sealed and guarded but instead of passing through they stopped at the last door on the right whoever had summoned her it wasnt tanzan mino his array of personal kobun werent lined up outside in fact there were no guards at all the leatherjacketed escorts pulled open the door and one entered ahead of her one behind inside was a large metal desk equipped with banks of phones and rows of buttons sitting behind the desk was vera karanova did you sleep well she glanced up then immediately signaled for the kobun to absent themselves did you eva looked her overthe severe designer suit black topped off with a string of gray mikimoto pearls it was a striking contrast to the shorthaired engineers bustling outside what riveted her attention however was resting on the desk next to the banks of phones and switches a zenith we have some time this morning vera ignored the response as she brushed at her carefully groomed dark hair i thought we should use it productively lots of luck comrade it is not in either of our interests to be at cross purposes she continued still speaking in russian it was a startling change in tone from the evening before you and i have much in common we both have worked at high levels in the security apparatus of our respective countries consequently we both understand the importance of strategic thinking that sets us apart she reached out and touched the laptop computer now to begin i would very much like for you to show me how you managed to break the encryption for the protocol the ceo was most impressed if he wants to know he can ask me himself she helped herself to a metal chair he is very busy at the moment vera continued occupied elsewhere this is a setup eva was thinking she wanted to get me down here for some other reason but it was hard to concentrate given the din of activity filtering in from the open ceiling above them banks of floodlights were creating heavy shadows around the office and out there somewhere she realized was the prototype why dont you tell me whats really on your mind comrade or better yet why you decided to throw in your lot with all these yakuza criminals vera karanova laughed you are a director with the national security agency you obviously are very competent and yet you and the rest of american intelligence seem completely blind oblivious to the significance of what is happening around you in case you hadnt noticed the soviet military is being stripped practically dismantled in the interest of economic restructuring high time if you ask me that is a matter of opinion the cold war whether we liked it or not maintained a predictable structure in the world both east and west went out of their way to support and stabilize third world countries in order to keep them out of each others camp but with the cold war slackening theres disintegration everywhere demilitarization is leading to political and economic anarchy worldwide right eva thought but you left out one other interesting fact japan got rich while the superpowers were out there stabilizing everybody squandering resources on matching sets of military toys instead of investing in their own infrastructure theyd love to keep it going this plane vera went on can be used to serve the ultimate cause of restoring world order she paused then continued but only if it is in the hands of our air force from today forward purge the new thinking the soviet union is on the verge of economic disaster perestroika has plunged our country into chaos the time has come to admit revisionism has failed wheres good old uncle joe when you need him she smiled stalin made the gulag trains run on time our restructuring has gone too far vera continued there are limits beyond which a society can no longer endure change eva stared at her i take it kgb and your military right wingers are planning to try and stage a coup there still are responsible people in the soviet union dr borodin who believe our country is worth saving my god eva thought their hardliners are planning to take control of this plane and use it to reenflame the cold war just like the race for the hbomb itll rejuvenate the soviet military this is our last chance vera continued as she reached down and flicked on the computer however if we are to succeed the terms of the protocol will require certain revisions do you really think you can get away with this thats where you come in vera went on but first perhaps i should show you something she reached down and pushed a button on the desk causing the set of blinds along the side of the office facing the hangar to slowly rise id like you to see the daedalus she pointed out the window perhaps then you will better appreciate its significance through the glass was a massive hangar engulfed in white vapor as cryogenic liquid hydrogen created clouds of artificial condensate cold steam that poured over the army of milling technicians above the haze however she could just make out two giant aircraft their wings started almost at the cockpit then widened outward to the planes full length terminating abruptly just before the high tail assembly positioned side by side they looked like huge gliders except that beneath the wings were clusters of massive engines larger than any shed ever seen before so thats the prototype the vehicle specified in the protocol they were stunningly beautiful maybe all highperformance aircraft looked sexy but these possessed a unique elegance the childs vision of the paper airplane reincarnated as the most powerful machine man had ever created i thought you would like to witness the final preparations for our first hypersonic flight vera proceeded thus far one of the planes that one there on the left she pointedhas been flown to mach todays test will take it to the hypersonic regime over fifteen thousand miles per hour theyve leapfrogged the west eva was suddenly realizing its the x spaceplane america dreams of building in the next century except its here now from the looks of things id say youre on schedule vera clicked something on the desk and a blinking number appeared at the top of a video screen it was the countdown liftoff was less than an hour away yes so far there has been no hold even though today is overcast with a low ceiling we dont experience weather delays like the american space shuttle in fact this plane is virtually weatherproof since it leaves from a runway just like a normal passenger jet no wonder the test pilot androv was swaggering eva thought this must be a flyboys wet dream one more question why are you showing me all this i told you theres something i need she paused and in the silence eva listened to the increasing clamor of preparations in the hangar outside after the test flight this morning the prototype is scheduled to be transferred to the supreme soviet however that cannot be allowed to happen consequently there will need to be alterations in the protocol she clicked on the laptop computer it hummed lightly as the hard disk engaged and then the screen began to glow those revisions need to be kept out of the system computers here at the facility for now so your copy of the text would be an ideal place to prepare a first draft youre going to pull a fast one eva stared at her youre going to tinker with the terms of the deal and turn this plane over to your air force very inventive that is correct and you are going to help me dr borodin you are going to call up your text and print a copy for me sweetie you are a piece of work why bother printing it again sorry to tell you but ive already run off a copy its in my suitcase we searched your bag theres nothing there you didnt look hard enough maybe this was her chance send some of your thugs to fetch it very well she reached for a button on the desk eva turned to look out again through the white mist something was going on now a motorized cart was pulling up and two men in pressure suits were getting off must be the pilots the first to step off the cart was already waving his hands imperiously at the japanese technicians he had to be the soviet pilot androv yep it was him swagger and all then the second pressuresuited figure stepped down that one she assumed must be one of the mino industries recruits androv had been complaining about guess he didnt get very far with his demand to be in the cockpit alone the walk memories of a longago skindiving trip to cozumel flooded back they were off the northern reefs wearing oxygen tanks admiring the multicolored banks of coral then later as they staggered up the beach shed laughed at his frogfooted waddle michael chapter nineteen friday am as vance stepped off the motorized cart the hangar around him was shrouded in white vapor the swirling cloud on the ground the eerie chiaroscuro of the lights the amplified voice that ticked off the countdownall added to the otherworldliness of the scene and above the turmoil two giant spaceplanes loomed silver monoliths that seemed to hover atop the pale mist chariots of the gods he thought gazing up the russian technicians had carefully suited him exactly as yuri androv right down to his boots next to his skin was the darkblue flight suit and cottonlined leather cap issued to all soviet pilots and over these came a pressurized gsuit fabricated from a heavy synthetic material it felt like a mixture of nylon and teflon this was topped off with the flight helmet complete with a removable reflecting visor which conveniently prevented anyone from seeing his face although the helmet restricted his peripheral vision he still could hear clearly through headphones miked on the outside although they did make the din of the hangar sound tinny and artificial a velcrobacked insignia of the minoan double ax adhered to his chest he was posing as a mino industries pilot for all its unfamiliarity however his gear felt very much like the rubber wetsuit he donned for scuba diving at depths the two hoses fastened to his abdomen could have been connectors for compressed air tanks and his helmet the oxygen mask he felt equally uncomfortable only the damned flippers were missing since his rx gsuit was designed for highaltitude flight intended to do doubleduty as an emergency backup in case of cockpit decompression he had to carry along his own personal environmentalcontrol unit a white batterypowered air conditioner the size of a large briefcase it hummed lightly as it cooled and dehumidified the interior of his suit keeping his faceplate moisturefree the recycled air he was breathing smelled stale and vaguely synthetic the most uncomfortable part of all however not to mention the most nerveracking had to be the six sticks of c plastic explosive and their radiocontrolled detonators now secured against his chest since the soviet engineers had suited him up in a separate room avoiding any contact with the mino industries doctors whod been giving androv his preflight physical hed yet to see yuri andreevich androv clearly he had a partner and he hadnt even had a good look at him yet the other mi pilot will be arriving in a few minutes androv was announcing to the whitejacketed japanese technicians standing by the personnel module he was delayed in the briefing for their benefit he was speaking english which to vances surprise and relief was almost perfect they nodded as he continued well just go on up in the module i want to check over the cockpit one last time make sure therere no lastminute glitches the personnel module resembled a small mobile home except its pneumatic lift could elevate it sixty feet straight into the air permitting direct access to the cockpits side hatch it was worlds away from the fourteenfoot metal ladder used to access a mig cockpit flight deck he was speaking through his helmet mike as he pointed up understand cockpit then he turned and motioned for vance to follow as he stepped in hai vance nodded gravely japanese style wakarimasu lets hope the haze keeps down visibility he was thinking this place is sure to have video monitors everywhere and this fancy elevator is probably bugged too intelligence from command central was that tanzan minos two yakuza pilots were receiving a lastminute briefing from the ceo himself still they were certain to show up soon this was no time to dawdle the technicians closed the door of the module then activated the lift controls as it began gliding upward androv glanced over and gave vance a silent thumbsup he flashed it back then set down the heavy airconditioning unit and shifted his weight from foot to foot still trying to get the feel of the suit maybe he told himself this test pilot game is easier than it looks but only so long as you never actually have to leave terra firma then its probably more excitement than the average person needs the upward motion halted with a lurch and the module door automatically slid open at first glance the open cockpit of the ussrs latest plane made him think of the inside of a giant computer nothing like the eyesoothing green of a mig interior it was a dull offwhite in color and cylindrical about ten feet in diameter and sixteen feet long three futuristic gseats equally spaced down the center faced a bank of liquid crystal video screens along one wall and lighting was provided by pale orange sodium vapor lamps integrated into the ceiling the real action was clearly the middle gseat which was surrounded by instrument consoles and situated beneath a huge suspended helmet white enamel and shaped like a bloated moth everything about the controls bespoke advanced design philosophy instead of the usual flight stick placed between the pilots knees it had a multiplecontrol sidestick covered with switches and buttons situated on the pilots right something only recently introduced in the ultramodern american f falcon although the throttle quadrant was still located on the lefthand console in standard fashion it too had a grip skillfully designed to incorporate crucial avionics the multiple radars identificationfriendorfoe iff instrumentation instrument landing system ils and tactical air navigation tacan he realized theyd utilized the new hotas concepthands on throttle and stickthat located all the important controls directly on the throttle and flight stick enabling the pilot to command the instruments and flight systems purely by feel like a virtuoso typist even the thin rudder pedals looked futuristic the whole layout in severe blacks and grays was sleek as an arrow in the end however maybe it was all redundant according to andrei androv this vehicle incorporated an advanced control system called equipment vocal pour aeronef it could be flown entirely by voice interface with an artificial intelligence computer all flight and avionics interrogations commands and readouts could be handled verbally you just talked to the damn thing and it talked back the twentyfirst century had arrived the other two gseats in the cockpit intended for research scientists were positioned on either side of the pilot about four feet away with no controls whatsoever all this baby needed was androv and his computer there was more the space was cylindrical which could only mean one thing it was designed to be rotated again probably by the computer adjusting the attitude or inclination of the pilot continuously to make sure the gforces of acceleration and deceleration would always be acting down on him like gravity securing him into that special gseat and why not since there was no windscreen the direction the pilot faced was irrelevantup down or even backward who cared and the helmet that massive spacemoth intended to be lowered over the pilots head from the briefing he knew that the screens inside were how the pilot saw through voice command to the central computer he could summon any of the three dozen video terminals along the walls and project them on the liquid crystal displays before his eyes so far so good androv said stepping in and down vance followed then reached back to secure the hatch it closed with a tight reassuring thunk the silent blinking of computer screens engulfed them by the way its up there vance said quietly shifting his head toward the newly installed video camera positioned just above the entry hatch androv glanced up nodded and together they turned away from it then without further conversation they each ripped off their velcrosecured insigniasandrovs the soviet air force red star bordered in white vances the double axand exchanged them how much time androv whispered just give me ten minutes he held up his heavy wristwatch together they checked and synchronized good luck androv nodded and gave another thumbs up sign then clasped him in an awkward russian hug vance braced himself for the traditional male kiss but thankfully it didnt come do svidania moi droog he said finally standing back and saluting then he grinned and continued in accented english everything will be aokay without another word he swung open the hatch passed through and stepped into the personnel module vance watched him depart then turned back to examine the daedalus cockpit more closely it was a bona fide marvel screens banks of screens all along the wallalmost like a tv stations control room everything was there looking across left to right he saw that the engine readouts were placed on top white bars showing power level fan rpm engine temperatures core rpm oil pressure hydraulics complete powerplant status the next row started on the navigation and avionics the radar altimeter the airspeed indicator the attitudedirector indicator aid for realtime readings of bank and dive angle the horizontal situation indicator hsd for actual heading and actual track and on and on all the electronics modules were already operating in standby modethe slitscan radar the scanners the highresolution doppler other screens showed the view of the hangar as seen by the video cameras on the landing gear now switched over from their infrared mode to visible light the avionics all digital were obviously keyed to the buttons and switches on the sidestick the throttles and the two consoles those controls he realized upon closer inspection could alter their function depending on which display was being addressed thereby reducing the clutter of separate buttons and toggle switches on the handgrips the cockpit was not overdesigned the way so many modern ones tended to be instead it had been entirely rethought there were probably two hundred separate system readouts and controls but the pilots interface was simple and totally integrated it was beautiful a work of pure artistry which made him sad hed always been an aviation buff and the thought of obliterating a creation this spectacular provoked a sigh on the other hand hbombs were probably beautiful too this was another vengeful shiva destroyer of worlds ridding the planet of its first hypersonic weapons delivery system would be a public service to all humankind but first things first he had no intention of allowing his next moves to be on tv the newly installed monitor part of the retrofit was about to get a small adjustment strolling back toward the entry hatch he quickly detached the reflecting outer visor that was designed to drop down over the front of his flight helmet then he reached up and wedged the silvered portion against the lens the camera would continue to operate relaying back no malfunction signals but it would be sending a picture of the ceiling next he unzipped his flight suit and carefully unstrapped the package riding against his chest inside were the six taffycolored bars of c plastic explosive each an inch square and six inches long all wrapped in clear cellophane they almost looked like candy but they could blow this entire plane through the hangars roof the charge had to be set before the two minogumi pilots were delivered by the personnel module when they arrived hed simply pretend to be yuri androv and say they all had to go back down for a final check of their pressuresuit environmental systems the moment they were clear hed activate the radio and detonate then the fun would begin there the two consoles on either side of the central gseat thats where hed wedge the charges it was the perfect place the central nervous system after one last wistful look at the banks of video displays along the wall he set to work friday am do you understand tanzan mino asked it sounded more like a command they were in the mino industries prep section a preflight briefing room that led directly into the hangar the faceplates of the two pilots flight helmets were raised allowing him to see their eyes any deviation from the prescribed maneuver blocks will signal a problem hai minosama both men nodded grimly they had come here in the cockpit of his personal boeing and they were not happy with their new assignment neither had the slightest desire to risk his life in the service of the oyabun s megalomania the command to serve as lastminute copilots in the daedalus however was an offer they could not refuse should anything happen you will radio flight control immediately and we will use the planes artificial intelligence system the ai module to bring it back and land it hai they nodded again you will not be expected to take the controls he went on the computer can override all commands from the cockpit you will merely ensure the prescribed flight sequence is adhered to he paused intending to collect his thoughts but an oddity on the newly installed cockpit monitor caught his notice he cursed himself for not having kept an eye on it hed been too busy briefing the pilots and now something about the picture was strange the perspective had changed he reached over and with the push of a button transferred the image to the large liquid crystal screen on the side wall yes it was definitely wrong he couldnt quite tell had someone jostled the camera there was still a full half hour before something had happened in the cockpit the prep crews were scheduled to be finished by nowhe glanced at a screen and confirmed that the checklists had already been punchedso no one had permission to be inside the plane from this point on only the pilots were authorized to be there androv where was he he was supposed to be in the soviet flightprep sector now across the hangar he turned to taro ikeda who was monitoring a line of video screens check with flight prep has the soviet pilot completed his preflight physical has it been signed off let me see he moved immediately to comply after he tapped a keyboard a number matrix appeared on his computer screen showing the status of all the preflight sequences quickly he called up the pilot sequence his physical has been completed minosama everything is checked off he logged out fifteen minutes ago then where is he ill try and find out he reached for a phone and punched in the main number for the flight prep sector the conversation that followed was quick and as it continued caused a look of puzzlement to spread over his alreadyworried face hai domo arigato gozaimashta he said finally and hung up as he turned back he was growing pale minosama i think there may be a problem they say he has already left the sector but all right then where has he gone sector security says he left with one of your pilots minosama headed for the hangar the room grew ominously silent they were both now staring at the two mino industries pilots standing directly in front of them there must be some mistake tanzan mino inhaled lightly are you sure you understood correctly its obviously impossible i agree then whats going on whatever it is i think wed better find out immediately he motioned for the two pilots to accompany him as he rose and headed for the door stay close by were going to the hangar taro ikeda briskly followed after them into the corridor if anything went wrong now he would be the one held responsible some vandal tampering in the cockpit was the last thing he needed everything had gone smoothly with the countdown so far this morning he shuddered at the prospect of a lastminute hold ahead of him tanzan mino was striding down the hallway kobun bodyguards in tow headed directly for the wide hangar doors friday am she was still having trouble thinking clearly michael was in the hangar was actually in one of the planes what was he doing here she barely noticed when a kobun walked in and settled her suitcase on the metal desk he glanced at it said something in japanese and disappeared out the door the case was heavy leather acquired from a little sidestreet shop by victoria station it looked just as it had when she and michael stashed the uzi back in london theyd deliberately bought a case heavy enough to conceal a weapon inside had minos people gone through it discovered the automatic is this it vera was asking thats the one she reached down no vera said staying her hand i will open it myself with a quick motion she pulled around the zipper then flipped back the heavy leather top there lay a battered map of crete under it michaels book on the palace piles of rumpled clothes this isnt how its supposed to happen she was thinking the automatics down in the bottom in a separate section but if vera probes a little shell find it ive got to make her theres no printout here comrade karanova finished digging through the clothes and looked up but then there never really was was there dr borodin perhaps what youd hoped to find was this she pulled open the top drawer of the metal desk and lifted out a shiny black automatic it was an uzi you didnt really think you could do something as amateurish as smuggle a weapon into this facility she shoved it back into the drawer congratulations youve done your homework so much for surprising vera karanova apparently that wasnt something easily managed now we will print a new copy of the protocol she said shoving the suitcase over to one corner of her desk i dont want to waste any more time right time is money so now it was up to michael maybe if she could stall vera long enough whatever he was involved in would start to happen glancing out again at the vaporshrouded floor of the hangar she fleetingly wondered if maybe shed been seeing things no she was certain that walk that funny walk he always had when he didnt feel in control she knew it all too well she knew him all too well hed arrived on the hangar floor riding on that little motorized cart together with the soviet pilot and theyd both entered the hydraulic personnel carrier and been raised up to the cockpit then the carrier had come back down and disgorged the soviet pilot whod immediately disappeared into the haze which meant michael still had to be up there what was he doing had he somehow thrown in his lot with the soviets he certainly wouldnt work for tanzan mino so that meant there had to be a revolt brewing the thing now was to link up join forces it was hard to figure oh shit coming through the wide hangar doors headed for the same personnel transporter vance had taken was tanzan mino and a host of his kobun bodyguards followed by two more men in pressure suits he looked as though he had every intention ofyes now he was saying something to the operators of the personnel carrier they all were going up whatever michael was doing minosan wasnt going to be pleased the whole scene was about to get crazy did mike have a weapon even if he did he wouldnt stand a chance friday am take it up tanzan mino was marching up the steps of the personnel module accompanied by six kobun in black leather jackets and the mi pilots the operators glanced at each other then moved to comply one japanese pilot had just come down and disappeared into the haze now two more had arrived along with the ceo were there three japanese pilots things were starting to get peculiar but then this was no ordinary flight it was the big one the door clicked shut with a quiet pneumatic whoosh and the module began its ascent as they rode tanzan mino reflected that in less than an hour this vehicle would be setting new records for manned flight the world would hear about it from a press conference he would hold in tokyo carried live around the globe that press briefing would also announce a new alliance between japan and the soviet union it would be a double coup the planets geopolitics would never again be the same the module glided to a halt and its door opened hed been right the cockpit hatch was sealed which meant somebody was inside the soviet pilot must be up to something but what then unbidden the pressure hatch started opening slowly swinging back and around and standing there just inside was a man in a pressure suit there was no reflecting visor on his helmet now to hide his face friday am vance stared at the small army facing him including tanzan mino and his two pilots this definitely was not the drill something had gone very very wrong had some of the soviet ground crews lost their nerve and talked whatever had happened things were headed off the track the c explosive was set but this was hardly the moment to activate the detonators and blow the place how did you get here the ceos eyes narrowed to slits i decided to take you up on that tour what do you think youre doing planning a vacation checking out the transportation very amusing dr vance he said staring at a length of c a glass and metal detonator shoved into its side wedged next to the sidestick but who else is part of your scheme you didnt arrange this unassisted why would anybody else be involved i just thought itd be fun to kick off todays celebration with a bang im afraid you will have to be disappointed he turned to the kobun clear the cockpit sweep it and then he glanced up after dr vance replaces the visor on his flight helmet we will escort him to my office for a very brief and undoubtedly very illuminating interview friday am whats happening vera had turned to watch through the white haze as the last kobun dismounted from the personnel module following tanzan mino and the three pilots maybe theres been a glitch in the countdown after all eva was trying to sound casual vera couldnt know the tall pilot in the middle the one being helped along by tanzan minos musclemen was michael looks like major androv has got himself into some trouble she could tell vance was mad as hell theyd probably roughed him up a little there in the cockpit just to get started and now they were intending to really go to work on him but he must be part of a group so where was everybody else androv has to fly the plane today we have everything scheduled why are they taking him away vera turned and stalked for the door this cannot be permitted whatever the problem is it has to be solved right here now the flight must go forward too much is riding on it eva watched her stride out into the white haze of the hangar she wanted to follow but then she thought of something better friday am he was wondering when to try and make a break but how far could he get encumbered with the pressure suit wheres the backup are they going to let me just twist in the wind the original scenario had fallen apart but that didnt mean the game was over the soviet engineers hed seen clearly wouldnt be any help in a crisis but the test pilot androv was another story hed surely try to pull something back together where was he probably still up in the other cockpit getting daedalus ii ready so now thats when he saw her coming out of an office whose doorway was only half visible through the clouds of mist it looked like vera karanova she was striding directly toward them intercepting tanzan minos small procession where are you taking him she pointed toward vance glancing at his red star insignia as she addressed the godfather in english are you attempting to interfere in my affairs now too tanzan mino demanded as he paused to stare i just want to know what it is youre doing she replied i am handling a problem he said coldly as he examined her there is a traitor or traitors among the soviets i intend to find out whos involved what do you mean an edge of nervousness entered her voice vance was coming up sorry i screwed up vera he said in english so close yet so far somebody must have blown the whistle youre not she stared as he lifted the visor of his flight helmet but what the hell he went on we gave it a shot nothing ventured nothing we she examined him puzzled i suspected all along you could not be trusted tanzan minos calm facade seemed to crack as his face flushed with anger but i had no idea you would actually betray the entire project sabotage the vehicle i dont know anything about sabotage she clearly was startled attempting to maintain calm in her voice if vance has it appears im surrounded by treachery and traitors his voice quavered as he stepped over to one of the kobun then reached in and withdrew the mm walther automatic from the mans shoulder holster when he turned back his eyes were opaque with anger and paranoia hed clearly snapped lost it mr vance i want to know the names of everyone who was involved in this plot everyone if i am satisfied you are telling the truth then perhaps i will consider sparing your miserable life otherwise he turned back to vera she was staring at the gun her face ashen not letting herself believe what her eyes were telling her the white mists of the hangar swirled around them creating ghostly shadows across the expressionless faces of the kobun you made a very grave error in judgment he was saying to her i dont yet know precisely what you were expecting to accomplish but whatever it was i can assure you i am not a man who tolerates disloyalty his expression was strangely distant as he raised the pistol and fired one precise round a dull thunk barely audible above the din of the hangar vance watched in dismay as vera karanova stumbled backward her dark eyes uncomprehending it was a ganglandstyle execution quick and preemptory the timehonored way no appeals or due process hed been hoping merely to gain some time for androv not cause her to be murdered on the spot now tanzan mino turned to him still gripping the pistol his face was distorted in irrational fury perhaps i made a mistake just now dr vance what do you think probably a pretty serious one yes now that i reflect on it im inclined to agree the culprit we seized redhanded was you you are the one i should be making an example of he was raising the walther again it began so quickly he almost didnt realize it was happening from out of the swirl of mist that engulfed daedalus s landing gear a whitehaired old man appeared grasping a pistol tanzan mino turned to stare just in time to hear him yellingin russian release him release my son i order you he was closing on the group about twenty feet in front of them brandishing the weapon uncertainly vance couldnt make out what caliber it was but he doubted it mattered andrei androv clearly had no idea how to use it his was an act of desperation then another realization clicked he said my son he thinks im yuri before anybody could move a white pressure suit materialized out of the distant haze around daedalus ii it was yuri androv running toward his father shouting nyet dont release him i tell you andrei androv didnt hear him as he continued to move menacingly on tanzan mino the outcome was inevitable vance ducked and rolled for the personnel module just as the kobuns line of h ampk automatics flared andrei androv lurched gray hair flying and managed to get off two rounds but instead of hitting a kobun he caught one of the mino industries pilots visor up directly in the face comrade doktor andrei petrovich androv dean of soviet propulsion technology chief designer of the daedalus died instantly his eyes still fixed in determination however tanzan minos kobun werent tidy one of them squeezed off a couple more rounds just as yuri androv ran up and leaned over his fathers crumpled body with a groan he spun around and staggered against the huge ply tires of daedalus s starboard landing gear it still wasnt over as vance scrambled against the personnel module he caught a glimpse of something that faintly visible through the clouds of cryogenic fog apparently was escaping everybody else another woman was standing in the door of the office where vera karanova had been holding an uzi how had she managed to get her hands on that not a second too soon she can sweep the floor just get out of the way and give her an opening maybe theres still time he began scrambling for the base of the personnel module now the white mist was obscuring everything and tanzan mino seemed to have enveloped himself in it he was nowhere to be seen however his presence was not missed by his kobun who were still taking care of business the next agenda item vance realized was himself as he tried to roll under the module one was turning raising his automatic now eva was yelling michael stay down the kobun all whirled back but she was ready stock extended full auto jesus he thought that hood in the back is holding enough c to clear a small arena if she hits one of the detonators it was either a lucky or an unlucky shot after eight rounds less than a seconds worth a blinding ball of fire erupted where the kobun had been sending a shock wave rolling through the open space of the hangar knocking over technicians almost a hundred feet away as vance was slammed under the personnel module out of the corner of his eye he saw eva being thrown against the doorframe of the office the air blossomed with the smell of deadly c like acrid sterno not for nothing did the us military swear by it now yuri androv was peeling himself off daedalus iis landing gear his flight suit blackened and smudged blood from a bullet wound was running down the right sleeve theyll be coming for us all vance thought tanzan minos probably somewhere radioing for more guards right now eva was stalking through the smoke still grasping the uzi michael are you all right hell of a morning he was pulling himself out from under the personnel module awkwardly trying to straighten his flight helmet you took out the palace guard everybody but mr big congratulations and i thought cia had a patent on that kind of operation already emergency alarms had begun a highpitched whine blaring through the cavernous hangar everything around them was chaos you know she yelled above the noise hes going to kill us immediately theres no way hes going to i figure weve got about two minutes to think of something he yelled back and pointed check on the pilot his name is androv i know i met him last night she turned and stared we had a small misunderstanding well lets see if hes still in any condition to fly you mean how else you got any better ideas id like to hear them yuri androv had worked his way through the carnage of the explosion the scattered remains of tanzan minos phalanx of kobun to again bend over the form of his father once more the cloud of obscuring mist was flowing over the scene blanking it at that moment however a pale glow laid itself around them the murky light of overcast dawn vance realized the soviet technicians had thrown open the hangar doors and were scrambling out onto the tarmac good let them we might just follow suit now yuri andreevich androv was approaching clasping his right arm weve got to get him fixed vance said briskly looking him over put on a tourniquet think he can still fly i say we make him fly with his left hand androv peeled back his helmet visor and kissed eva spacebo he said in russian you did what i would have done if id had a weapon but now i dont know what hows your arm vance cut in weve got to make a decision right now when the reinforcements arrive its game over one little uzi wont handle their firepower androv frowned can you fly never handled anything bigger than a lear vance replied and then only as copilot it didnt seem to matter androv glanced at the open door of the personnel module and motioned to them then come on lets hurry now he was searching the hangar finally he spotted the man he wanted pavel he yelled in russian have the starter trolleys been engaged yet da came the reply then prepare daedalus i for powerup and get the hell out were go for rpm what do you mean the tow trucks havent even been forget the tow trucks its going to be afterburners right here get the rest of your people in the clear afterburners were rings of nozzles that sprayed fuel into the superheated exhaust gases of a jet engine creating a burst of power in military aircraft they were used to produce surges in thrust during takeoff and dogfights afterburners in the hangar yuri all the hydrogen storage tanks could blow youd destroy daedalus ii just incinerate it thats the idea he was already mounting the steps of the personnel module not looking back theres only going to be one plane left the one i take the computer eva had started up the steps but then she froze and turned back handing vance the uzi i have to get it theres no time he reached for the weapon its muzzle still hot weve got michael i didnt come this far just to let the protocol slip through our fingers she was running past him now back down only take a second he knew it was pointless to argue and besides maybe she was right who knew where theyd end up now androv had faltered and was leaning shakily against the open doorway of the module the right sleeve of his pressure suit covered in blood vance took advantage of the ticking moments to step up and examine it you need a bandage he started tearing away the synthetic cloth or better yet a tourniquet no androv glanced at his arm and grimaced theres not youre going on adrenaline right now my friend but when the shock wears off he looked around the interior of the module but there was nothing to cut with so he just ripped away a large portion of androvs sleeve and parted the material a savage furrow was sliced across his bicep i dont want you to pass out he tore a section of the sleeve into a strip and then struggling with his heavy gloves began binding it above the wound the hangar was still bedlam people running and yelling on every side alarms sounding as he was finishing the tourniquet eva came bounding up the metal steps carrying her zenith they were ready androv quickly secured the door and activated the controls through a smokesmeared window they watched the bloody hangar floor disappear into the haze the world suddenly turned dreamlike an unreality highlighted by the soft whoosh of the pneumatic lift beneath them then the module lurched to a halt vance led the way through the open hatch looks like somebody forgot and left the lights on pavel told me the starter trolleys were engaged androv said in russian as he climbed through then stepped down he continued in english petra can initiate powerup petra vance turned back you mean the our copilot he pointed toward a large liquid crystal screen at the far end of the cabin now blank i want to try and use her to override flight control for the rest of the sequence short circuit the countdown ive never done it but he walked over and reached down to flip a square blue switch on the righthand console lets see if shes awake this morning he glanced up as the screen blinked on and a large blackandwhite doubleax logo materialized set against the red and white of a japanese flag next he pushed a button on the sidestick and spoke petra report countdown status all preflight sequences nominal the eerie mechanical sound of a womans voice speaking russian filled the space do you acknowledge affirmative he answered back you will now initiate ignition sequence bypass remaining countdown procedure that is an override command please give authorization code code p systems emergency the countdown is now t minus nineteen minutes twentyeight seconds all systems are nominal therefore code p is not a valid command shit he whispered under his breath petra verify p with flight control he paused for a split second then pushed a button on the console and commanded abort instruction another pause then repeat verify abort command for n equals one over zero what was that eva was wedging her laptop under the lefthand gseat i think i hope i just put her commandmonitor function into an infinite loop shell just continuously start and stop the verification procedure maybe itll render that subroutine incapable of blocking the other system functions youre going to confuse her head good luck he settled himself in the central seat then reached up and began unlatching the huge flight helmet as he did his eyes were suddenly flooded with grief they killed him he paused for a moment and just stared vance thought hed finally become befuddled from the shock but then he choked back his emotion and continued were going on the deck under their goddam radar what did you say vance strained to catch his words the english was slurred he seemed to grow faint his consciousness wane but he finally revived as he finished yanking the giant helmet down over his head vances headphones came alive as he heard the russian daedalus i to control do you read i am now bringing up core rpm for starboard cluster outboard trident a second later he continued we have so ignition yuri came a startled radio voice what in hell is going on you cant portside cluster outboard rpm up he continued in russian his voice halting we have po ignition yuri you cant starboard cluster inboard bringing up portside cluster inboard androv for godsake have you gone mad sergei i told them to clear the hangar im taking her to full power the liquid hydrogen tanks are in there you could blow the whole hangar to hell if you use afterburners you must be crazy the bastards gunned him down sergei he caught a sob it was my fault i should have warned what are you talking about gunned who down but yuri androvs mind was already elsewhere drifting into a griefobsessed dream state engine start complete he continued beginning pretakeoff sequence will he be able to get this thing off the ground vance was wondering hes shot up and now hes falling apart guess were about to find out the fuselage cameras are showing an empty hangar everybodys run for cover eva want to take that seat ill take this one no free drinks in this forward cabin section he was speaking through his upraised helmet visor as he eased himself into the righthand gseat and buckle up for safety she settled herself in the left lets just hope he can still manage this monster its a saturn v with wings hes got his talking computer if shell still cooperate do me a favor and translate now and then machines are supposed to translate for people not the other way around were in space warp i believe it as he pulled down the overhead seat straps he found himself wondering what daedalus would feel like in full afterburner mode those turboramjets made a boeing s massive jtds look like prime movers for a mediumsized lawnmower power to military thrust androv was easing forward the twin throttles spooling them up past threequarters power daedalus had begun to quiver shaking like a mighty mountain in tectonic upheaval prepare for brake release the screens on the wall above reported fuel consumption edging toward three hundred pounds of jp a second yuri the radio crackled dont pavels got his men out of the hangar sergei i can see on my screen im going cold mike now no distractions just wish me luck there was a click as he switched off the communications in his helmet he missed a new radio voice by only a second it was speaking in english dr vance what is going on hes just cut his radio link with flight control hes deranged i order you to halt the flight sequence he could destroy both planes by going to afterburners in the hangar i demand this be stopped vance glanced up at the tv monitors an auxiliary screen showed tanzan mino standing at the main flight control console surrounded by more kobun who had muscled aside the russian technicians he also noticed that a lot of soviet brass were there too looks like youve got a problem im warning you i will shut you down i can activate the automatic ai override three minutes after takeoff the plane will return and land automatically three minutes is a long time vance wondered if it was true or a bluff well take our chances youd leave me no choice may the best man win petra brake release yuri androvs voice sounded from beneath his helmet acknowledged vance looked across to see his left hand signal a thumbsup sign then reach down for the throttle quadrant the vehicle was already rolling through the wide doors of the hangar so if there were an explosion now at least theyd be in the clear androv paused a second mumbled something in russian then shoved the heavy handles forward to lock commanding all twelve engines to max afterburner the jp fuel reading whirled from a feed of three hundred pounds a second to twentyone hundred and an instant thereafter the cockpit was slammed by the hammer of god as the monitor image of the hangar dissolved in orange chapter twenty friday am one small step for man vance felt his lungs curve around his backbone his face melt into his skull he didnt know how many gs of acceleration they were experiencing but it felt like a shuttle launch he gripped the straps of the gseat and watched the video feed from the landinggear cameras which showed the tarmac flashing by in a stream of gray the screen above him had clicked up to knots and in what seemed only a second the daedalus was a full kilometer down the runway then the monitors confirmed they were rotating to takeoff attitude seven degrees they were airborne next the screens reported a hard righthand bank five gs the altimeter had become a whirling blur as attitude increased to twenty degrees held just below stallout by petras augmented control system when the airspeed captured knots the landing gear cameras showed the wheels begin to fold forward then rotate to lie flat in the fuselage next the doors snapped closed behind them swallowing them in the underbelly and leaving the nose cameras as their only visual link to the outside the screens displayed nothing but gray storm clouds landing gear up and locked came petras disembodied voice acknowledge gear secure androv said quieting a flashing message on one of the screens no abort so far vance thought maybe were about to get away with this the airspeed had already passed knots accelerating a tenth of a mach number about knots every five seconds thats when he noticed they were still receiving wideband video transmissions from the flight center the screen showing tanzan mino remained clear and crisp surely not for much longer but now at least the uplink was intact and the ceo was returning the favor monitoring their liftoff via a screen of his own vance watched as he turned to some of the soviet brass standing next to him and barked orders what was that about for now though the bigger question was what do we do androv was still busy talking to petra issuing commands vance realized they were assuming a vector north by northeast out over the ocean they also were probably going to stay on the deck to avoid radar tracking with only passive systems so that no em emissions would betray their heading he glanced up at the screens and realized he was half right they were over the ocean now at a breathtaking altitude of only five hundred meters but androv had just switched the phasedarray radar altimeter over to start hopping frequencies using squirt emissions pure stealth technology no conventional radar lock could track it dr vance i am giving you one more opportunity to reconsider tanzan minos voice sounded through the headphones he was still standing at the main flight control console though his image was finally starting to roll and break up you must return to base the consequences of this folly could well be incalculable why dont you take that up with the pilot vance answered into his helmet mike his receiver has been turned off its impossible to communicate with him hes clearly gone mad i will give you another sixty seconds before i order the onboard guidance computer switched over to the ai mode flight control here will override the onboard systems and just bring the vehicle back and land it again vance wondered if he really could then a screen flashed an emergency strobe and petra was speaking the russian was simple enough he could decipher it systems advisory you are too low pull up acknowledge pull up androv tapped the sidestick lightly and boosted their altitude a hundred meters michael the voice was evas coming through his headphones sheitwhoever said i figured it out but did you hear the other news minosan just advised hes going to override petra were about to find out whos really flying this baby no androv was raising his flight helmet and gesturing his wounded arm urging at something in his right pocket please take do it quickly and then vance unstrapped his gseat harness rose and moved over to the central console androv had raised his hydraulic helmet all the way up now and was trying to unzip the right side of his flight suit vance reached down and helped him not sure exactly what he needed there yuri was trying to point the radio please you must the english began to fail him again whats this vance took out the transmitter the size and shape of a small calculator the answer was in russian complex and garbled something about computer hes wired something into the onboard computer michael eva began translating the radio will perform brain surgery on petra disabling her ai functions its supposed to prevent flight control from overriding i didnt quite get it but he wants you to help vance glanced up at the line of video screens daedalus was now skimming rapidly over the straits banking in the direction of the archipelago known as the kurile islands and the image of tanzan mino was breaking up almost gone had he heard maybe it didnt matter the allotted sixty seconds was ticking away and he could just make out the image of tanzan mino holding a microphone preparing to give orders by the clock on the screens he saw that fortyone seconds had already passed dr vance we are preparing to initiate total systems override the ceos voice sounded through his headphones you have fifteen seconds remaining to acknowledge the code androv was saying it is onenineninenine vance stared at the small device in his flight glove it had a number keypad and a liquid crystal display you have ten seconds tanzan mino said the image was ghostly but the voice still rang loud and clear he began fumbling with the device but the numbers kept eluding him slipping around the thick fingers of his gloves finally he caught the above him the screens were still scrolling eight seconds suddenly the cockpit seemed to sway an air pocket that even the daedalus advanced structural mode control system couldnt damp out entirely now androv was talking to petra going for a sliver more altitude seven seconds michael eva was watching her face still drawn from the acceleration is it its the gloves the damned gloves im then he punched in the first in the back of his mind he noted that the cockpit was adjusting as daedalus rotated increasing attitude he got another but his grip on the calculator was slipping pressing toward the floor as the gforces of acceleration weighed against him he checked the screens again and saw that three seconds remained now androv was grappling to keep control of the throttle while issuing instructions to petra am i about to disable her he wondered if i do can he manage this nightmare manually what if mino was only bluffing two seconds a final bright green appeared on the liquid crystal readout alert ai system malfunction it was the toneless voice of petra she sounded vaguely annoyed something had happened two of the screens on the wall above had just gone blank but daedalus continued to climb dr vance we are now going to recall the plane we have ordered a wing of fighterinterceptors scrambled from the dolinsk airbase on sakhalin they will escort you back whoops so that was what he was telling the soviet brass to do get up some hardware fast this could well be the shortest flight since the wright brothers then he heard androvs helmet mike click on this is daedalus i do you copy me major you mino began copy this you bastard fuck you repeat fuck you ive disabled your fucking ai module you disabled it thats a roger do you read me you murdering sonofabitch fuck you he clicked off his mike vance was moving slowly across the cockpit headed back to his own gseat as he settled himself and reached for the straps he glanced up at the screens to check their flight dataaltitude speed vector gforce fuel consumption they were still on the deck with an airspeed just under a thousand knots about eleven hundred miles per hour not quite mach but already it was risky and their vector was with coordinates of degrees latitude degrees longitude what now daedalus had all the active radar systems known to modern avionics looking at the screens he saw forwardlooking radar sidewayslooking radar a fourbeam multimode pulsedoppler lookdown radar terrainfollowing radar radar altimeter mapping and navigational radar and a host of highpowered ecm jammers the problem was they all emitted em electromagnetic radiation switch on any of those and theyd become a flying radio beacon broadcasting their position the next row of screens however provided readouts of their passive nonemitting receivers and analyzers that clearly was what they would have to use to monitor the threat from sakhalin scooping up any em for lightningfast computer processing surely petra could spit out a fingerprint of everything in the skies to begin with there were the basic radar warning receivers rwrs located aft on the tailplanes as well as infrared warning receivers irwrs positioned high on the outboard stabilizers the screens showed she could analyze basic frequency operating mode pulse repetition frequency amplitude of pulse time of arrival direction of arrivalthe full menu if its true theyve scrambled the base at dolinsk it probably means the new mig s androv was now busy switching on all the passive systems just the way vance figured he would we have to decide what to do but first i want to take her up and do a quick recon buckle in the latest foxhound has a multimode pulsedoppler lookdown shootdown capability thats as good as any in the world vance heard himself saying were the biggest target in the skies and were unarmed wed be a sitting duck for one of their aa active homing missiles theyre launchandleave lets check it out before we get too worried androv replied but this has to be fast youre about to see a mach immelmann dont try this in a he laughed then began lowering his hightech helmet i hope i can still manage it there was a surge of acceleration as he shoved forward the throttles then yanked back on the sidestick the daedalus seemed to kick straight up and up and up the instruments showed they were traveling skyward in a thin arc as though sliding up the curve of an archers bow now the altimeter was spinning and in eighteen seconds they had already reached twenty thousand feet but still androv kept the stick in and during the next five seconds as daedalus continued tracing the archers curve they almost began to fly upside down at the last moment he performed an aileron halfroll and righted them the immelmann had in effect taken them straight up and headed their powerful forwardlooking ir detectors and radar in the direction of sakhalin vance glanced at the screens and realized theyd climbed thirty thousand feet in twentyseven seconds theyd just waxed the standing fortyeightsecond timetoclimb record of the usaf f eagle and daedalus wasnt even breathing hard even though androv had now chopped the power they still were cruising at mach effortlessly no wonder he loves this bird the only downside was the fuel reading showed theyd burned twentythree thousand pounds of jp during the climb out petra androv said into his helmet mike take vsd to standby and give me infrared laser petras interrogation revealed a wing of eight mig interceptors flying in formation at twentyfive thousand feet and closing at mach friday am ya ponemaiyu colonelgeneral gregori edmundovich mochanov said into the secure phone the pride of dolinsks command central i ordered a wing of the fifteenth squadron scrambled at hours fortunately we were planning an exercise this morning he paused for the party at the other end general valentin sokolov on a microwave link from the hokkaido facility da if androv maintains his altitude below six hundred meters then he will probably have to keep her near mach the vehicle as i understand it is not designed for that operating regime so with the mig s on full afterburner we can make up the distance but we need his vector he paused and listened yes they are fully armed aas a kill perimeter of he listened again of course active homing radar and infrared on the underfuselage he was impatiently gripping the receiver da but i cant work miracles i must have a vector he paused again da but i dont want to accidentally shoot down another kal i must have a confirmed target im not going to order them to fire without it he listened a second longer then said good and slammed down the phone friday am guess wed better start playing hideandseek in earnest vance observed stealth my american friend androv replied the hostile radar signature of this fuselage is almost nothing and we can defeat their infrared by taking her back on the deck so the engines are masked from their lookdown ir back we go well pull out at five hundred meters but itll mean about three negative gsblood to the brain a redout very dangerous be ready then he shoved the sidestick forward and daedalus plunged into a mach power dive the infrared cameras showed the sea plunging toward them the dive took even less time than the climb with the altimeter scrolling suddenly the voice of petra sounded pull up warning pull up pilot must acknowledge or autooverride will commence a ton of empty space slammed into them as petra automatically righted the vehicle pulling out of the dive at an altitude of four hundred meters vance looked over and saw yuri andreevich androvs bandaged arm lying limp on the sidestick lightly hemorrhaging hed passed out from the upward rush of blood friday am he has disappeared from the katsura radar again minosama i think he has taken the vehicle back on the deck ikedas face was ashen as he typed in the computer ai override command one last time still hoping the flight control operations screen above him was reading system malfunction while the engineers standing behind were exchanging worried glances who was going to be held responsible the master screen above the one with the katsura radar no longer showed the daedalus androv had taken it to thirty thousand feet then down again he was playing games tanzan mino was not wasting time marveling at the planes performance specs he turned and nodded to general sokolov who was holding a red phone in his hand the mig wing wasnt flying military power it was full afterburners which was pushing them to mach if daedalus stayed on the deck they might still intercept we have no choice he said in russian order them to give him a chance to turn back and tell him if he refuses they will shoot him down maybe the threat will be enough sokolov nodded gravely but what if androv was as insane as every indication suggested he was what if he disobeyed the commands from the sakhalin interceptors what then who was going to give the command that unleashed aams to bring down the most magnificient airplanemake that spacecraftthe world had ever seen the mig with its longrange acrid aa missiles had a standoff kill capability that matched the american f tomcat and its deadly aim phoenix since the aa had its own guidance system the pilot need not even see his target one of those could easily bring down an unarmed behemoth like the daedalus as long as it was still in the supersonic mode which it would have to be at that low altitude a pall of sadness entered his voice as he issued the command androv of all people knew the lookdown shootdown capabilities of the mig maybe there was still a chance to reason with him the daedalus had no pilotejection capability his choice was to obey or die reports from the hangar said hed taken some automaticweapons fire from the ceos bodyguards how badly wounded was he hard to tell but hed got daedalus off the runway then done an immelmann to take her to ten thousand meters followed by a power dive back to the deck he was frolicking like a drunken dolphin pure androv how much longer could he last sokolov glanced at the screen in front of him the computer was extrapolating telling him that a dueeast heading by daedalus would soon take her over international waters if androv kept that vector at least thered be no messy questions about violating foreign airspace how long before they can intercept tanzan mino asked not taking his eyes from the screens now the soviet interceptors were on the katsura radar speeding toward daedalus last known vector coordinates it should only be a matter of time in five minutes they will be within airtoair range sokolov replied he paused then asked the question weighing on his mind if he refuses to turn back do you really want that vehicle blown from the skies now tanzan mino was thinking about the stealth capabilities of the daedalus was the design good enough to defeat the migs pulsedoppler radar he suddenly found himself wishing the plane hadnt been so well designed the stupid soviets of course had no ideayet that it could just disappear he could be headed for alaskan air space thats what the computer is projecting you understand the ramifications if this vehicle falls into the hands of the americans the soviet nodded gravely that was of course unthinkable there would be no going home again friday am yuri eva was up like a shot lean back breathe she was pushing the button that raised the huge flight helmet as she watched his open eyes gradually resumed their focus then he snapped his head and looked around shto what happened i dont think you can handle heavy gloads youre weak from the wound the tourniquet he straightened up then glanced again at the altimeter they were cruising at three hundred meters smooth as silk and they were burning six hundred pounds of jp a second nothing has gone the way i planned he rubbed at his temples trying to clear the blood from his brain were just buying a little breathing space now by staying down here i think the radar noise of the choppy sea together with all our stealth capability will keep us safe but at this low altitude were using fuel almost as though we were dumping it if we continue to hold on the deck weve got maybe half an hours flying time left if we gained altitude vance wondered could we stretch it enough to make alaska probably androv replied if we took her above fifty thousand feet we might have a chance then weve got no choice the only solid ground between here and the us is the kurile islands and theyre soviet territory but if we did reach us airspace then what eva asked wed have to identify ourselves whos going to believe our story nobody even knows this monster exists right he laughed a topsecret soviet hypersonic bomber comes cruising across the bering strait at sixty thousand feet and into the usafs airspace one hint of this thing and theyd roll out the sams maybe we couid talk our way down maybe theres no other choice you are getting ahead of things both of you androv interrupted staring at the screens on the wall we still have to handle the interceptors from dolinsk if we went for altitude wed show enough infrared signature to make us an easy target during ascent before we even reached two thousand meters theyd have a lock on us vance glanced at the irwr daedaluss infrared laser scanners were still tracking the wing of mig interceptors now at twentytwo thousand feet and closing it doesnt matter he said weve got to get off the deck soon while we still have fuel either that or well have to ditch at sea comrade vance the daedalus is a marvelous platform but when we go for altitude were going to be vulnerable theres no getting around it this vehicle was intended to perform best at the edge of space not down here all right he said slowly then why not take her there use the scramjets we may be running out of jp but we have a load of liquid hydrogen maybe this is the moment to finally find out if this thing can burn it imim afraid after what happened when we pulled out of the power dive im not sure i could handle the gload necessary to power in the scramjets yuri paused the tourniquet has almost paralyzed my arm i dont have the kind of control and timing wed need if i thought i couldbut no i hate to say it even think it but maybe we have no choice but to give up and turn back not yet vance said maybe theres one other possibility friday am they still are not acknowledging tanzan mino said grimly we dont know their exact vector but they will have to gain altitude soon when they do he turned to general sokolov radio dolinsk and confirm the order this was the moment valentin sokolov had been dreading the aa missile which was carried on the mig s recessed underfuselage stations came in two versions the active radar homing model and the heatseeking infrared design he suspected that daedalus had enough stealth and ecm capabilities to partially defeat radar but stealth couldnt mask ir sooner or later androv would have to make his move come off the deck and when he did the migs would pick him up and it would be over but that was still preferable to letting daedalus fall into the hands of the americans so if androv refused to answer his radio and comply with the callback thered be no choice friday am what do you mean androv asked wiping at his brow vance took a deep breath weve got no choice you know what im thinking well need ten gs of acceleration to power in the scramjets my friend he leaned back in the seat and closed his eyes his face was now drawn with pain but the bleeding had stopped above them petra silently flew the plane and flashed messages on the screens ive trained for years he continued finally even with your inflatable gsuit you couldnt possibly take the gloads and stay conscious what other choice is there either i try or we ditch down there in the sea of okhotsk personally id rather go out like a shooting star taking our chances its not that simple the scramjets are designed to be powered in at mach we dare not risk that below at least forty thousand feet there are aerodynamic reasons in fact theyre not really intended to be used below sixty thousand well vance said if we started our ascent at max throttle what kind of airspeed could we capture by forty thousand could we achieve mach only if we used afterburners which means wed probably have only about ten minutes of jp left for landing later he laughed sadly assuming theres anywhere we could land how about heathrow i know a japanese banker whod probably love to have this vehicle as collateral for a few billion in eurodollar debentures hes being forced to underwrite hes a friend of mine and i owe him a favor you want to turn this plane over to some banker he was visibly startled we cant ignore the fact that it still belongs technically to mino industries my friends a big boy hell work it out yakuzastyle dont worry he glanced up at the fuel gauges they now had twenty minutes left just enough to get back to the facility and give up or go all the way eva what do you say want to give it a shot im game one things for sure i have no intention of going back to get ourselves murdered by tanzan mino if we can make it to the other side of the world by burning hydrogen then maybe just maybe petra could help enough for you to manage it androv paused to collect his strength i dont know if you can stay conscious through the ten gs of acceleration needed to initiate the scramjets but i know for sure i cant not in my current state you might as well give it a try he turned to eva and continued in russian theres an emergency backup pressure suit in that locker beneath petras main screen see if you can put it on youll still probably pass out but dont worry the event is only temporary after we go through the hypersonic barrier acceleration will subside down to three maybe four gs ill get the suit she said starting to unbuckle her straps okay wed better get started vance was crossing the cabin the nose cameras were showing the spray of white caps directly below them if theyd passed any fishing vessels he mused there were probably stories of flying saucers already going around the passive irwr scanner was still tracking the wing of mig s now at a hundred and thirty kilometers approximately eighty miles and closing daedalus was almost within the kill perimeter of the mig s and their aa missiles the radio crackled something in russian yuri androv stared at the flight helmet then looked down at the console and flipped a switch i copy you firefight one he replied in russian over androv you idiot what in hell are you doing defecting to the capitalists the voice laughed we dont know what the devil youre flying but when you pulled that immelmann my ir thought you were an an condor transport turned into a highperformance foxbat one incredible sonofabitch its a spaceship arkadi excuse me colonel arkadi congratulations on the promotion spacebo he said laughing again then he sobered yuri i dont know what this is all about but im instructed by general sokolov to escort you and that thing youre flying back to hokkaido if youre stupid enough to refuse then i have orders to shoot you down is that any way to treat an old friend yuri andreevich we go back a long way to the ramenskoye flight test center you were the best we ever had dont make me do this im thinking i may spare you the trouble thank god give me five minutes if i dont turn back by then give it your best pull up show yourself on ir we have no idea what your vector is ill take her to three thousand meters youll have a lock on me but i still want five minutes thats all i can give you yuri after that his voice trailed off im going off this frequency talk to you in five five minutes starting now androv pushed a switch on the console then said petra stabilize at three thousand three thousand she repeated confirmed he rose from the pilots seat motioning for vance there was a surge of acceleration as the vehicle changed pitch the cockpit rotating to adjust for the gforces the weight of two and a half gs weighed against them as the altimeter screen started scrolling upward vance walked across to the central seat studying the console the throttle quadrant and sidestick he understood but most of the other controls were new to him maybe it didnt matter does petra understand english of course androv nodded russian japanese and english interchangeable shes programmed such that if you command her in russian she replies in russian if you use english thats what you get back so far so good he looked at the large screen at the end of cabin the one that displayed petras mindstate she was dutifully announcing that shed just taken the vehicle to three thousand meters she also was reporting the ir interrogation of a wing of mig s flying at twenty thousand feet with a closure rate of three hundred knots when daedalus made her move would she be able to outdistance their airtoair missiles were about to find out he thought inhe glanced at the screensthree and a half minutes eva was zipping up her pressure suit now readying to strap herself back into her seat the helmet made her look like an ungainly astronaut like i said the scramjets become operable at mach androv went on at forty thousand feet thats about three thousand miles per hour ive never taken her past mach he was grasping the side of the console to brace himself you probably know that scramjets require a modification in engine geometry in the turboramjet mode these engines have a fan that acts as a compressor just like a conventional jet however when we switch them over to scramjet geometry the turbines are shut down and their blades set to a neutral pitch next the aft section of each engine is constricted to form a combustion chamberthe shock wave inside becomes the compressor he paused the unknown part comes when the fans are cut out and the engine geometry is modified ive unstarted the fans and reconfigured but ive never fed in the hydrogen we simply dont know what will happen those damned turbines could just explode so we take the risk theres more he continued the frictional heat at hypersonic speeds our liquid hydrogen is supposed to act as a heat sink to dissipate thermal buildup on the leading edges but who the hell knows if itll work were now flying at about fifteen hundred miles per hour when you give petra the goahead we could accelerate to ten even fifteen thousand miles per hour god help us we may just melt if you were willing to give it a shot then i am vance looked up at the screens were now at ten thousand feet i kick over to scramjets at forty thousand the computer simulations all said that if we go hypersonic below sixty thousand feet we could seriously overheat but maybe if we climb out fast enough well have to take our chances we need to minimize that window of aam vulnerability i agree androv gestured for him to sit then glanced up at the screens we have two and a half minutes ive set petra for full auto all you have to do is just talk her through the key intervals of the sequence vance settled in and examined the huge flight helmet looming above him making him look like an alien insect from science fiction now the cabin had taken on an eerie quiet with nothing but silent screens flashing data hed never talked to an airplane before and the thought gave him some disquiet two minutes what do i do first you probably should start by attaching that nozzle there on the legs of your gsuit to the pressure hose on the console when the gforces go above eight tubules in the legs automatically inflate using bleed air from the engines its going to squeeze hell out of your lower extremities if you begin to grayout try to grunt as hard as you can the ml maneuver i think you americans call it if your vision begins to go entirely just try and talk petra through what else once you start pushing through the hypersonic barrier keep an eye on screens b and b which report engine strut temperature and stress loads those are the most important data for the scramjet mode but first check the c screen core rpm has to be zeroed out before the scramjet geometry modification since the compressors need to be completely shut down if its not then instruct petra to abort the sequence it could cause a flameout and thats when i switch over to liquid hydrogen exactly petra will set the new engine geometry then sample compression and temperature and tell you the precise moment but the actual switchover is manual i insisted on it he pointed its those blue toggles right behind the throttle quadrant just flip them forward got it after you toggle her over just ease the throttle forward and pray he settled himself into the righthand seat tugging at the tourniquet when we enter the hypersonic regime i dont know what will happen above mach or mach we may begin to critically overheat or the airframe stresses could just tear this damned samolyot apart whatever happens though youve got to keep pushing her right on out to stabilize the shock wave in the scramjets and bring them to full power vance glanced up at the screenthirty secondsand fingered the sidestick and the throttles trying to get their feel as he began lowering the massive flight helmet he noted that with the engines on military power they had exactly eighteen minutes of jp left when he kicked in the afterburners to push them into the hypersonic regime the fuel readings would start dropping like a stone but this was their ball of string their way out of the maze would it work remember androv said with finality just talk petra through any problems you have and try to capture an attitude of sixty degrees alpha yuri are you ready for us to escort you back the radio voice speaking russian sounded through the cabin im still thinking it over he answered dont be a fool i have orders to down you with aas my weapons system is already turned on warheads are locked youre as good as dead if i push the fire button here under my left thumb youre gone in fifty seconds you just made up my mind he said and nodded toward vance go firing one and two was the radio response vance grabbed the throttles petra do you read me yes she answered in english give me alpha sixty he rammed the throttles forward clicking them into the lock position igniting the afterburners next he yanked the sidestick into position the cockpit rotated upward automatically shifting to compensate for the changing gforces in front of his eyes now was a wide liquid crystal screen that seemed to be in d the left side resembled the headsup display hud common to jet fighters providing altitude heading airspeed gforces in a single unified format the right side showed a voiceactivated menu listing all the screens along the wall read me fuel he said testing it immediately the numbers appeared in pounds of jp and in minutes with and without afterburners the gforce was now at and climbing while the digital altimeter was spinning systems alert petra announced suddenly hostile radar lock and hostile ir interrogation two bogies closure rate nine hundred sixty knots they werent kidding vance thought he glanced at the altitude readout daedalus was hurtling through thirty thousand feet afterburners sizzling but an aa had a terminal velocity well over mach add that to the foxhounds petra give me estimated time of impact extrapolating closure rate i estimate impact in forty three seconds their acceleration had reached gs but fuel was dwindling rapidly already down to twelve minutes give me rwr and irwr screen one he commanded the liquid crystal panorama inside the helmet immediately flashed showing the unfriendly radar and infrared interrogations the two acrid aasthats what they had to bewere gaining altitude tracking them like bloodhounds one was radar locked while the other showed activehoming ir guidance the exhausts of daedaluss afterburners must look like a fireball in the sky he thought he scanned the menu for electronic countermeasures ecm capabilities petra commence radar jamming commenced estimated time to impact thirtyeight seconds the missiles were still closing even if the radarguided aam could be confused daedalus had no way to defeat infrared homing the lefthand display now showed they had accelerated to mach the throttle quadrant was locked into the afterburner mode but outrunning aams was like trying to outspeed a smart bullet he watched the dials mach mach estimated time to impact twentyeight seconds im not sure were going to make it he said into his helmet mike we may have to try initiating the scramjets early no it would be too risky androv replied the skin temperatures at this altitude the air is still so dense the thermal stresses vance checked the screen again altitude is now thirtyeight thousand feet im going to level out some try and boost our mach number one things sure we cant make it if we hold this attitude besides were burning too much fuel either we chance it now or we get blown to smitherines weve got no choice he shoved the sidestick forward for this he didnt plan to bother with petra time to impact twenty seconds she reported tonelessly by trimming pitch daedalus started accelerating more rapidly airspeed scrolled quickly to mach time to impact fifteen seconds nine and a half minutes of jp remained just enough to land he thought if we ever get the chance mach eva take a deep breath were about to try and enter the fourth dimension i cant talk then he remembered androv had said she might pass out now he was starting to wonder if he wouldnt lose consciousness too he was sensing his vision starting to fade to gray breaking up into dots the screen noted that their acceleration had reached eight gs and was still climbing fighting for consciousness he reached down and increased his oxygen feed then contracted every muscle in the lower half of his body trying to shove the blood upward the gindicator on the lefthand screen had scrolled to time to impact ten seconds mach he reached down and manually locked the pitch on the compressor fan blades into a neutral configuration they immediately stalled out causing daedalus to shudder like a wounded animal then he heard the voice of petra and a new signal flashed on his helmet screen we have nominal scramjet geometry commence ignition sequence shed reconfigured the turbines meaning daedalus was go for hypersonic he grappled blindly behind the throttle quadrant and flicked the large blue switches that initiated the hydrogen feed but would the supersonic shock wave inside the engines fire it time to impact six seconds lets go reaching for the throttle quadrant he depressed the side button and then shoved the heavy handles forward sending a burst of hydrogen into the scramjets combustion chambers daedalus lurched then seemed to be tearing apart literally disintegrating rivet by rivet friday am we have detonation colonel arkadi reported into his helmet mike his twinengine foxhound was already in a steep fiftydegree bank we copy you general sokolov replied can you confirm the kill the target is outside my radar and ir he said wishing he had some of the new american overthehorizon electronics hed heard about but both missiles reported impact ive ordered the wing to chop power and return to base were already on auxiliary tanks as it is roger came the voice from flight control in hokkaido we downed her comrade general whatever she was theres no way she could have survived those aas the target is destroyed chapter twentyone friday am tanzan mino closed his eyes and sighed the financial portions of the protocol would still stand on their own the arrangement could be salvaged somehow it would merely require finesse the shocked faces of the soviet brass standing behind him told of their dismay daedalus the most marvelous vehicle ever created had literally been within their grasp and now both prototypes destroyed but at least at least it hadnt fallen into the hands of the americans no more humiliating episodes like that in when the traitorous lieutenant viktor belenko defected with a mig foxbat exposing all its secret electronics to the west friday am a slam of acceleration hit him and he felt a circle of black close in on his vision it was the darkness of eternal night the music of the spheres his last sight was the airspeed indicator scrolling past mach almost four thousand miles per hour the starship daedalus had just gone hypersonic he didnt see it but lookdown radar had shown the two acrid aas exploding a thousand feet below when the scramjets powered in the infraredhoming aam lost its lock on them and detonated the other missile sending a supersonic shock wave through daedalus aams however were now the least of their problems skin temperature was pushing degrees and the cockpit was becoming an incinerator at fortyeight thousand feet they were rapidly turning into a meteorite his vision was gone but just before losing consciousness he shoved the hydrogen throttles all the way forward and yanked back on the sidestick sending them straight up into the freezing black above friday am altitude seventythree thousand feet airspeed nine thousand knots petra raise helmet he was slowly regaining his sight as the gloads began to recede the cockpit was an oven overwhelming its environmental control equipment clear evidence vehicle skin temperature had exceeded design confirmed helmet raising although his vision was still black and white he started easing back on the throttles and checking around the cock pit eva was beginning to stir now rising and struggling with her safety straps androv remained slumped in his gseat you okay he rose and moved toward her i think i blacked out there for a second or so im going to make it she shifted her eyes right but im not so sure about dont worry the russian snapped conscious and immediately reached to begin loosening his straps ive been through heavy gloads before suddenly he stared up at the screens pointed and yelled hypersonic zoloto you didnt tell me i almost cant believe we almost lost it skin temperatures reached japanese ceramic composites my droog no other material could have done it and now the atmosphere is thinning when we hit eighty thousand feet or maybe eightyfive skin temperature should stabilize down around a thousand degrees thats room temperature for this vehicle he paused and grinned liquid hydrogen its a fantastic fuel and a terrific coolant of course if this catches on and we stop using alcohol coolant in our migs i dont know what the soviet air force will all drink before payday vance glanced at their vector they were over the bering sea now with a heading for who knew where mach and climbing the daedalus was pressing effortlessly toward the darkness above time to think about what was next how much of this wonderful liquid hydrogen do we have just enough to do what ive been planning for a long time he edged over and touched vances shoulder im deeply in your debt you made it possible now theres only one thing left the ultimate vance looked at him and realized immediately what he meant why not do we have enough oxygen extra cannisters were loaded because of the two mino industries pilots i think we have about ten hours then i vote we give it a shot he said turning to eva what do you think what are you talking about he flipped up his helmet visor if we can achieve mach by around a hundred thousand feet we can literally insert into orbit itd cause a diplomatic flap the size of world war three she slumped back in her gseat is it really possible of course androv said then he laughed well i hope so ive been thinking about it for a couple of months now i actually programmed petra to compute the precise thrust required orbital apogee and perigee everything the first sputnik had an apogee of one hundred miles and a perogee of one hundred twentyfive miles ive calculated that at mach i could propel this vehicle into roughly that orbit to get out we can just do a deorbit burn set the compressors on the ramjets for retrofire and coldstart them so we can hold tanzan minos cojones hostage for a while and have some fun vance smiled what do we tell petra ill give her the coordinates but youve got to handle the stick we need to hit mach above feet then shut down the engines with splitsecond timing shell tell you when if i computed it right we should just coast over the top got it he looked up at the screens on the front wall of the cockpit their altitude was now feet and thenspeed had reached mach over ten thousand miles per hour they were cracking world records every millisecond and the cockpit was starting to cool off again as the thinner atmosphere reduced friction on the leading edges theyd survived the thermal barrier coming up was the emptiness of space he watched as androv called the routine in petras silicon memory where he had stored the orbital data then ordered her to coordinate it with their current acceleration altitude and attitude confirmed she was saying reducing alpha by two degrees shed already begun modifying their flight profile you are approximately four minutes and thirtyseven seconds from the calculated orbit will fuel controls be manual or automatic vance glanced over at androv here at the edge of space were they really going to turn their destiny over to a talking computer this game could turn serious if petra somehow screwed up lets keep the throttles on manual i agree he nodded too much could go wrong if we dont like the looks of anything we can always abort petra androv commanded throttles will be manual affirmative if she felt slighted she wasnt saying anything four minutes wed all better strap in vance said till we see how this goes the screens above them were still flashing flight data the strut temperature in the scramjets where a supersonic shock wave was providing the compression to combust hydrogen and the rush of thin air had stabilized at degrees fahrenheit androv stood staring at the screens and a moistness entered his eyes if my father could have seen this he finally said in russian everything he designed has worked perfectly he dreamed of this vehicle talked of it for so many years and now finally to be murdered on his day of triumph eva looked at him maybe his real dream was for you to fly it to create something for you he paused as though uncertain how to respond the look in his eyes said he knew it was true the pain and anger seemed to flow through him like electricity before we are finished the world will know of his achievement i intend to make sure of it three minutes petra announced reducing alpha by three degrees the screen above reported that theyd reached mach their altitude was now ninetythree thousand feet shes leveling out vance thought are we going to make it or just fade in the stretch the scramjets were punching through the isolation of nearspace now the underfuselage scooping in the last fringes of atmosphere he doubted if thered be enough oxygen above a hundred thousand feet to enable the engines to continue functioning but if they could capture the vehicles design speed seventeen thousand miles per hour they still could coast into the perigee curve of a huge orbital elipse he looked at the screens again they were now at mach with two and a half minutes left the complex calculus being projected on petras main display now showed their rate of acceleration was diminishing rapidly as the atmosphere continued to thin maybe he thought theres a good reason why no one has ever inserted an airbreathing vehicle into orbit before maybe all the aerodynamic and propulsion tricks in the world cant compensate for the fact that turbines need to breathe petra seemed to sense they were in trouble constricting venturi by seven point three she said reducing alpha by four degrees she was choking down the scramjets and leveling them out even more their thrust to weight ratiowhich at thirty thousand feet had been greater than one meaning they could actually fly straight upwas dropping like a stone it was now down to daedalus was slowly smothering but now their velocity had reached mach almost almost thirty seconds petra said as though trying to sound confident she was busy sampling the combustion ratio in the scramjets and making micro adjustments to the hydrogen feed androv spoke into his helmet mike im beginning to think we wont make it petra is now probably estimating thrust based on faulty assumptions about oxygen intake theres nothing left up here to burn therell be no need to abort the edge of the atmosphere is going to do it for us he looked up at the big screen and said petra project image from the nose camera rotated to minus ninety confirmed she replied and flashed an image sprinkled with stars then the camera swept around and the massive screen at the end of their cabin brought into view the edge of a wide globe that seemed to be composed of shimmering blue it was the north pacific i just wanted to see this he said wistfully i once took a mig to seventythree thousand feet but it was nothing to compare were in space ive been eavesdropping on satellites for years eva commented but this gives it all a whole new perspective ten seconds prepare to terminate hydrogen feeds the airspeed indicator now read mach closing vance reached for the heavy throttle grips watching the final seconds tick down four three two one terminate hydrogen feeds he yanked back on the handles feeling a dying tremor flow through the vehicle the airspeed indicator had just hit mph in the unearthly silence that followed petras synthetic voice cut through the cabin preliminary orbital coordinates are computed as perigee miles apogee miles duration is one hour and twentyseven minutes radar altimeter will provide data for second iteration of calculations in thirtysix minutes the engines were completely shut down now as they coasted through the dark nothing could be heard but hydraulic pumps air conditioners light groans from zerogravityinduced stresses in the massive fuselage zadroka androv shouted weve done it maybe there is a god now as daedalus began to slip sideways like a liner adrift at sea the nose camera showed they were passing over the icecovered wilds of northern alberta vance felt a sudden rush of fluids from his extremities where they had been pooling because of the gforces upward into his face and torso the sensation was one of falling hanging on to his seat clumsily he unfastened his gseat harness and pushed up to he sailed across the cockpit at the last instant he twisted trying to right himself but before he could hed slammed into the bank of video monitors on the opposite wall jesus sweetie you look like a flying fish eva drifted back in her seat loving him all over again i feel like a newborn deer trying to stand up he rotated and carefully pushed himself off the ceiling repressing the instinct to kick like a scuba diver but remember the old chinese proverb dont criticize a man till youve floated in his shoes for a day darling its a dream come true im finally weightless she laughed at last no more dreading to get on a scale the pain in my arm is gone androv spoke up again renewed satisfaction in his voice weve just performed our first medical experiment in space its good for gunshot wounds id like to perform another experiment eva said she was slowly extracting herself from the gseat what kind of electrical system do we have on board we have a massive battery section kept charged by the turbines androv replied all these electronics require a lot of power so we could transmit of course were designed for that what are you planning vance looked over as he drifted back across the cockpit a small surprise for tanzan mino she was twisting around as she floated next to her straps let me start preparing the laptop i knew there was a reason why i brought it she reached down under the seat and pushed it out where it floated i want to hook this into petra she reached up and awkwardly retrieved it is there any way i can theres provision for laptop interface they worked so well on the american shuttles our people installed an identical setup here androv swam slowly to the console then flipped down a panel revealing a serial port you can connect it there the wirings in place vance twisted and checked their coordinates they were now at latitude degrees longitude degrees headed over central canada incidentally so much for north american air defenses no radar interrogations whatsoever thats because of our stealth design androv said we have almost no radar signature not only are we a menace to the world were invisible vance floated down and settled into the central gseat the more he learned about the daedalus the more unsettling he found it what should they do with this monster maybe turn it over to the un as a monument to technology gone amuck to hightech excess at last he thought man has achieved the ability to move anywhere on the planet at speeds as fast as the laws of physics will allow and do it invisibly maybe it should be called the shadow okay eva interrupted his thoughts ive finished tying in the zenith were about to go live from the top gentlemen the very top im going to send the protocol to every wire service in the world what better credibility than to be downlinked live from space vance looked at the picture from the nose camera they were over the atlantic now which meant theyd soon be passing over the soviet union with lineofsight horizons that stretched from europe to asia why settle for print he had a sudden thought how about television with all this video gear we should be able to put together something that would transmit the baikonur cosmodrome has receiving facilities we see soviet cosmonauts in space all the time and theyll be directly under us we also could make the evening news all over japan if we broadcast to the katsura tracking facility good thinking but ive got an even better idea she seemed to pirouette in weightlessness japan already has dbs direct broadcast satellites and there are home satellite dishes all over the country its the global village so why dont we just cut in for a special bulletin why not he pointed to the illfated cockpit camera tanzan minos technicians had installed above the entry hatch matter of fact we probably could just use that if we could hook it into some of the electronics here on the console he floated up half drifting and half swimming and inspected the camera convincing himself that it was still in working condition and it had to be wired into something maybe now all they needed to do was flip the right toggles the console switches numbered by his conservative estimate approximately three hundred let me see what i can do androv floated down and immediately started to work toggling testing watching the display screens as various messages were scrolled petra he finally commanded in russian give me a positive connect between uhf displayread and video output terminal k interface confirmed suddenly a video screen fluttered ran through a test series of colored bars then threw up a picture of the cockpit as seen from the camera above the hatch vance studied the image of three figures floating in a confined space outfitted with electronic hardware and a giant wingshaped hood over the central seat on tv their cockpit looked like the flight deck of some alien vessel in star trek ix were on eva waved at the camera her image on the screen waved back okay vance said now for the tricky part transmission androv smiled as he drifted up again thats actually the easiest of all remember this vehicle was originally intendedsupposedlyas a nearearth research platform therere plenty of downlinks in keeping with the need to transmit data as well as general propaganda functions we can use any frequency you want even commercial broadcast channels so why dont we go live worldwide just give everybody an inside look at the planets first radarevasive space platform petra has a listing of all commercial satellite channels just to make sure she doesnt inadvertently violate one of them with a transmission lets pull them up and see what they are he flipped several toggles on the wide console then told petra what he wanted hed no sooner finished speaking than the large screen that supplemented her voice was scrolling the offlimits frequencies okay eva said lets start with the data channels belonging to worldwide newsprint organizations reuters the associated press all the restand send a copy of the protocol itll just appear on every green screen in the world then we can pick off frequencies used by television news organizations and broadcast a picture postcard from here in the cockpit sounds good androv turned to look at the screen quickly he began selecting numbers from the banned list moving them to a new file that would be used to specify parameters for the broadcasts vance watched shifting his glance occasionally to the view from the nose camera below them clusters of light from central europes largest cities beamed up twinkling lightly through the haze of atmosphere he reached over and flipped the camera to infrared and sat watching the backradiation of the north african deserts now blots of deep red on the southern horizon then back to visible again noticing two parallel ribbons of light that signified habitations along the length of the nile the world he was thinking really is a global village she was right theres no longer any place you can hide from the truth eva when you feed the protocol to the wire services note that therell be a transmission of some live video at he glanced up at the digital readouts on the screens how about at hours gmt thats in twenty minutes should be enough time dont you think sounds good to me and to show you im brave i wont even fix my hair you never looked more beautiful even that night out at the palace dont change a thing he turned to androv how about doing the talking first in russian and then in english well write the english part for you it will be my pleasure comrade my fucking pleasure daedalus vance said mostly to himself he found a way to escape the maze of mino we did too its easy you just use your wings and fly friday am kenji nogami settled the telephone back into its cradle and reached for the televisions remote selector the set was currently scrolling a special text being distributed over the reuters financialservice channel very interesting he shoved aside the pile of new mino industries eurobond debentures to make room for his feet on the teakwood surface of his desk bbc had just informed him theyd taped an accompanying video segment and were planning to broadcast it in thirteen minutes at nine oclock at least thats what sir cecil ashton director general had just warned as the london banker for mino industries he had told sir cecil he officially had no comment no comment was required he reached into a drawer and drew out a box of montecristo habana no s noting sadly there were only three left with a frown he picked up his pocket dictaphone and made a note to his secretary to stop off at the tobacconists on threadneedle just down from the bank of england and get another box a hypersonic aircraft so that was what it had been about all along and now some russian test pilot had stolen it taken it to orbit and was planning to land it at heathrow in three hours there to turn it over to westminster union bank the london financial representative of mino industries group perfect timing the thought immediately occurred to him that this would be ideal collateral for the billions in phony eurodollar debentures he was being forced to issue for tanzan mino finally finally he had the man by the bollocks who he wondered did he have to thank for this godsend yes it was shaping up to be quite a morning perhaps a trifle early for a cigar but he flicked the tv off the reuters text and onto bbc would appear to be further evidence of the growing technological supremacy of japanese industry as this commentator has had occasion to note in times past the lines between civilian and military technology are rapidly vanishing that japans socalled civilian research sector could create the hightemperature ceramics required for such a vehicle even as european and american military research has failed to do so speaks eloquently of the emerging shift in world he rolled down the sound a bit the commentator went on to mention that all mino industries representatives both here in london and in tokyonamed in the announcement from orbit had refused either to confirm or deny the story he noted the time on his omega then smiled leaned back and snipped the end off his cigar friday am minosama the man bowed low nhk just telephoned your office in tokyo asking for comment comment about what they have received some text off a satellite what what did they receive it was purportedly the english translation of a secret protocol an agreement between mino industries and the soviets naturally we denied it in the strongest possible terms it has to be some preposterous fabrication i cant imagine how anything so absurd could have thats actually the problem minosama nhk says they received it from a manned space station but theyve checked with nasda and have been assured there are currently no astronauts in orbit by any nation in orbit my god he thought daedalus didnt go down she went up with the protocol aboard how did they manage to get her hypersonic androv was wounded he couldnt possibly have handled the gforces which meant vance tell nhk if they broadcast one word of this libelous unsubstantiated hoax they should be prepared to face legal action his face had become a stone mask as a sepulchral hush settled over flight control i will inform them the man bowed again he hadnt had the courage to tell the oyabun the rest of what nhk was now receiving along with half of the citizens of japan via their new directbroadcast satellite dishes friday am kenji nogami thought the picture was a little indistinct at first the hues slightly off but then somebody in bbcs technical section corrected the color balance making the tapes blues and greens and reds all blue and green and red yes now he could make it out a cosmonaut was drifting across the cameras view suspended it made him ponder briefly the phenomenon of weightlessness curious really that it was all a matter of where you were one wall of the cockpit was lined with video terminals and at the end was a massive screen currently displaying the daedalus corporation logo a double ax nice advertising he thought cocacola probably feels envious overall it was a classy job no two ways about it the oyabun didnt do things by halves well this was one marvel her majestys government would be happy to get their hands on for his own part not a bad piece of collateral must have cost billions in startup investment then he got a better look at the figure and realized something was wrong one side of his white environment suit was stained red and he seemed to be nursing a bandaged arm as he drifted up toward the camera stradstyve he began ya yuri andreevich androv the cosmonaut then proceeded to deliver a longwinded speech in russian that nogami could not follow and the bbc had not yet translated he seemed to be growing angrier and angrier and at one point he gave a long disquisition about someone named andrei petrovich androv he was obviously a soviet test pilot who else could fly that creation given the looks of the cockpit it was a quantum advance in high technology nogami leaned back his match poised the good part the part in english was coming up thats what sir cecil had said the russian segment had been for broadcast in the soviet union had the local spin the english part was for the world and for tanzan mino who was now in deep deep trouble murder fraud a global conspiracythey all were there and even more damning for the way the story had come to light the medium was the message about that time the cosmonaut whod identified himself as soviet air force major yuri andreevich androv drifted to the side permitting a better view of the cockpit thats when nogami noticed two other individuals one appeared to be a womanleave it to the soviets he smiled to know about good public relationsalso wearing an environment suit her helmet momentarily turned away the third appeared to be male also in an environment suit and flight helmet sir cecil hadnt bothered mentioning them since air force major androv had done all the talking then the male cosmonaut in the center drifted up and began opening his visor some kind of curved glass that reflected the yellow sodium lights in the ceiling he grappled with it a moment then in annoyance just yanked it off and tossed it to drift across nogami stared at the face mother of god he was laughing so hard he almost missed his montecristo when he finally whipped up his match
