jonathan kellerman a cold heart book in the alex delaware series to the music men larry brown rob carlson ben elder wayne griffith george gruhn john monteleone gregg miner john silva tom van hoose larry wexer and to the memory of michael katz the witness remembers it like this shortly after am baby boy lee exits the snake pit through the rear alley fire door the light fixture above the door is set up for two bulbs but one is missing and the illumination that trickles down onto the garbageflecked asphalt is feeble and oblique casting a grimy mustardcolored disc perhaps three feet in diameter whether or not the missing bulb is intentional will remain conjecture it is baby boys second and final break of the evening his contract with the club calls for a pair of onehour sets lee and the band have run over their first set by twentytwo minutes because of baby boys extended guitar and harmonica solos the audience a nearly full house of is thrilled the pit is a far cry from the venues baby boy played in his heyday but he appears to be happy too it has been a while since baby boy has taken the stage anywhere and played coherent blues audience members questioned later are unanimous never has the big man sounded better baby boy is said to have finally broken free of a host of addictions but one habit remains nicotine he smokes three packs of kools a day taking deepinthelung drags while onstage and his guitars are notable for the black lozengeshaped burn marks that scar their lacquered wood finishes tonight though baby boy has been uncommonly focused rarely removing lit cigarettes from where he customarily jams them just above the nut of his telecaster wedged under the three highest strings smoldering slowly so it is probably a tobacco itch that causes the singer to leap offstage the moment he plays his final note flinging his bulk out the back door without a word to his band or anyone else the bolt clicks behind him but it is doubtful he notices the fiftieth kool of the day is lit before baby boy reaches the alley he is sucking in mentholated smoke as he steps in and out of the disc of dirty light the witness such that he is is certain that he caught a glimpse of baby boys face in the light and that the big man was sweating if thats true perhaps the perspiration had nothing to do with anxiety but resulted from baby boys obesity and the calories expended on his music for minutes he has been jumping and howling and swooning caressing his guitar bringing the crowd to a frenzy at sets end with a fiery throatripping rendition of his signature song a basic blues setup in the key of bflat that witnesses the progression of baby boys voice from inaudible mumble to an anguished wail theres women thatll mess you theres those that treat you nice but i got me a woman with a heart as cold as ice a cold heart a cold cold heart my babys hot but she is cold a cold heart a cold cold heart my babys murdering my soul at this point the details are unreliable the witness is a hepatitisstricken homeless man by the name of linus leopold brophy age thirtynine but looking sixty who has no interest in the blues or any other type of music and who happens to be in the alley because he has been drinking red phoenix fortified wine all night and the dumpster five yards east of the snake pits back door provides shelter for him to sleep off his delirium tremens later brophy will consent to a blood alcohol test and will come up three times the legal limit for driving but according to brophy barely buzzed brophy claims to have been drowsy but awake when the sound of the back door opening rouses him and he sees a big man step out into the light and then fade to darkness brophy claims to recall the lit end of the mans cigarette glowing like halloween you know orange shiny real bright know what i mean and admits that he seizes upon the idea of panhandling money from the smoker because the guy is fat so i figure he had enough to eat thats for sure maybe hell come across know what i mean linus brophy struggles to his feet and approaches the big man seconds later someone else approaches the big man arriving from the opposite direction the mouth of the alley at lodi place linus brophy stops in his tracks retreats into darkness sits down next to the dumpster the new arrival a man also goodsized according to brophy though not as tall as baby boy lee and maybe half of baby boys width walks right up to the singer and says something that sounds friendly questioned about this characterization extensively brophy denies hearing any conversation but refuses to budge from his judgment of amiability like they were friends you know standing there friendly the orange glow of baby boys cigarette lowers from mouth to waist level as he listens to the new arrival the new arrival says something else to baby boy and baby boy says something back the new arrival moves closer to baby boy now the two men appear to be hugging the new arrival steps back looks around turns heel and leaves the alley the way he came baby boy lee stands there alone his hand drops the orange glow of the cigarette hits the ground setting off sparks baby boy sways falls linus brophy stares finally builds up the courage to approach the big man kneeling he says hey man receives no answer reaches out and touches the convexity of baby boys abdomen he feels moisture on his hand and is repelled as a younger man brophy had a temper he has spent half of his life in various county jails and state penitentiaries saw things did things he knows the feel and the smell of fresh blood stumbling to his feet he lurches to the back door of the snake pit and tries to pull it open but the door is locked he knocks no one answers the shortest way out of the alley means retracing the steps of the newcomer walk out to lodi place hook north to fountain and find someone wholl listen brophy has already wet his pants twice tonight first while sleeping drunk and now upon touching baby boy lees blood fear grips him and he heads the other way tripping through the long block that takes him to the other end of the alley finding no one on the street at this hour he makes his way to an allnight liquor store on the corner of fountain and el centro once inside the store brophy shouts at the lebanese clerk who sits reading behind a plexiglas window the same man who one hour ago sold him three bottles of red phoenix brophy waves his arms tries to get across what he has just seen the clerk regards brophy as exactly what he is a babbling wino and orders him to leave when brophy begins pounding on the plexiglas the clerk considers reaching for the nailstudded baseball bat he keeps beneath the counter sleepy and weary of confrontation he dials brophy leaves the liquor store and walks agitatedly up and down fountain avenue when a squad car from hollywood division arrives officers keith montez and cathy ruggles assume brophy is their problem and handcuff him immediately somehow he manages to communicate with the hollywood blues and they drive their black and white to the mouth of the alley highintensity lapdissue flashlights bathe baby boy lees corpse in a heartless white glare the big mans mouth gapes and his eyes are rolled back his banana yellow stevie ray vaughan tshirt is dyed crimson and a red pool has seeped beneath his corpse later it will be ascertained that the killer gutted the big man with a classic street fighters move longbladed knife thrust under the sternum followed by a single upward motion that slices through intestine and diaphragm and nicks the right ventricle of baby boys already seriously enlarged heart baby boy is long past help and the cops dont even attempt it petra connor barely out of her noguys phase knew the pantsuit had been a stupid idea threemonth noguys phase the way she saw it she deserved more selfindulgence than that but her forgiving nature had taken over and now she could look at carriers of y chromosomes without wanting to punch them she was the only female detective working nights at hollywood division and pretending to be nice was hurting her facial muscles the first month of the phase had been spent convincing herself it wasnt her fault even though here she was barely thirty and a twotime loser in the serious relationship sweepstakes chapter one the rotten husband chapter two was even worse the boyfriend whod gone back to his exwife shed stopped hating ron banks even though hed been the one to come on to her had pursued her gently but unrelentingly weakening her resistance by being courtly and caring and tender in bed a genuine nice guy like so many nice guys essentially weak some would say ron had done the right thing for himself for his daughters something else that had attracted petra to him terrific father ron was raising alicia and bea while his ex a spanish beauty trained horses in majorca twoyearold divorce youda thought it would stick sweet little girls six and seven petra had allowed herself to become attached to them pretending petra had endured a hysterectomy at a freakishly young age toward the end when ms caballera was laying on the pressure big time calling ron ten times a day talking dirty to him emailing him bikini shots begging hed been a basket case crippled by conflict finally petra shoved him in the right direction and he took leave from his sheriffs homicide job in order to sort things out and flew to spain with the girls to petra spain had always meant art the prado degas velasquez goya shed never been there had never been out of the country now spain meant over ron called petra once breaking into sobs so sorry baby so so sorry but the girls are so happy i never realized how unhappy they were the girls had always looked okay to petra but what did she know about kids barren thirtyyearold spinster that she was ron stayed in spain for the summer and sent her a consolation gift stupid little carving of a flamenco dancer castanets and all petra broke off the limbs and tossed it in the trash stu bishop her longtime partner had bailed on her too resigning a promising career to care for a sick wife oh that spousal obligation soon after she switched to the night shift because she couldnt sleep anyway felt in synch with the special poison that scented the air when hollywood streets turned black comforted by the sorrows of people in a lot worse shape than she during the ninety days of the noguys phase she caught three s worked them all solo because staffing was thin and she didnt protest when the nightwatch commander raised the possibility two were easysolves that had gone down on hollywood s east end a liquorstore clerk shooting and a knifing at a latino dance club multiple witnesses all around both files closed within a week the third was a whodunit an eightyfiveyearold woman named elsa brigoon found bludgeoned in her apartment on los feliz boulevard that one took up most of the ninety days a lot of it spent chasing false leads elsa had been a drinker with an abrasive personality who quarreled at every opportunity shed also taken out a hundredthousanddollar term lifeinsurance policy on herself last year and the beneficiary was a donothing son caught in a stockmarket bind but none of that panned out and petra finally put the case to rest by running meticulous checks on every habitue of the apartment complex a handyman hired by the landlord turned out to have a record of indecent exposure sexual assault and burglary and his eyes jumped to mars when petra interviewed him in his filthy downtown sro subsequent skillful interviewing by detective ii connor brought the jerk around three for three petra s overall solverate was approaching the champs milo sturgiss over in west la and she knew she was fasttracking to diii might make it by years end was sure to incur lots of envy among her colleagues good men were no enough of that men are our biological partners oh lord day ninety she decided that bitterness was eroding her soul and resolved to be positive returning to her easel for the first time in months she tried painting in oils found her sense of color wanting switched to penandink and filled pages of bristol board with tight hyperrealistic faces childrens faces well drawn but tacky she ripped the drawings to shreds went shopping she needed to go for color one look in her closet made that painfully obvious her casual clothes consisted of black jeans and black ts and black shoes her work duds were dark pantsuits a dozen black two navy blues three chocolate browns one charcoal all slimcut to fit her skinny frame all designerlabels that she purchased at discount outlets and the barneys warehouse sale and lastday markdowns wherever she found them she drove from her wilshire district apartment to the big neiman marcus in beverly hills and splurged on a halfprice vestimenta soft wool number silklined lapels ticket pocket cut on the bias strong shoulders pegged trousers powder blue she wore it that night and drew shocked looks from the other detectives one wiseass covered his eyes as if shielding himself against glare another said nice petra a couple of others whistled and she grinned at the lot of them before anyone else could crack wise phones began ringing and the squad room filled with the business of death taking her place at her metal desk in a corner next to the lockers petra shuffled paper and touched a powder blue sleeve and figured she knew what was running through the guys heads morticia changes her style dragon lady comes up for light she came across funereal but a lot of it was biology she had sharp features ivory skin thick straight jet hair that she kept in a glossy wedge cut deep brown eyes that leaned toward piercing kids brought out the softness in her but now alicia and bea were out of her life and billy straight a young boy she met working a case whod touched her heart was nearly fourteen had found himself a girlfriend billy never called her anymore the last time petra had phoned him more silence than conversation had passed between them so she supposed she could be forgiven a dragon lady persona the das office had faxed her some questions on the elsa brigoon case stuff the novice ada couldve known from reading the file but she answered anyway and faxed back her replies then her phone rattled and a patrol officer named montez went on about a cutting on fountain near el centro and petra was out of the station in a flash she arrived at the scene and conferred with the assistant coroner he informed her that the morgue was backlogged and the autopsy would take a while but cause of death didnt look to be any great mystery single knife wound exsanguination most of the blood pooled beneath the db establishing the kill spot petra in powder blue was glad there wasnt more gore then she read the victims license and got sad because for the first time since shed been a detective this was a name she recognized shed never been into the blues not musically anyway but you didnt have to be to know who edgar ray lee was aka baby boy the drivers license in his pocket just stated the basics male caucasian a dob that put him at fiftyone height sixtwo weight twoseventy petra thought he looked bigger than that as she recorded the data in her pad she overheard someone one of the morgue drivers remark that the guy was a guitar god had jammed with bloomfield mayall clapton roy buchanan stevie ray vaughan petra turned and saw a ponytailed and bearded exhippie type in morgue coveralls staring at the body white ponytail weteyed talented she said those fingers said the driver as he unfolded a black plastic body bag you play petra asked him i noodle he played he those fingers were magic the driver dabbed at his eye yanked angrily at the bag virtually ripped it open zzzzzzzip ready he said in a sec petra crouched by the body took in the details again jotted in her pad yellow tshirt blue jeans shaved head tiny chin beard tattoos blued both arms ponytail walked away looking disgusted petra continued studying edgar ray lees mouth hung open exposing broken and rotted teeth that made petra think junkie but she spotted no track marks among the tattoos baby boy hadnt been dead more than an hour but his face had already taken on that greenish gray pallor the emts had cut the shirt around the stab wound threeinch vertical slit up the belly gaping at the edges she sketched the wound and slipped the pad back into her purse she was stepping away when a photographer behind her announced i want to make sure my lighting was okay he moved in lost his balance fell on his ass slid feetfirst into the blood pool his camera landed on the asphalt and rattled ominously but that wasnt petra s concern crimson splotches and speckles decorated her pants both trouser legs ruined the photographer lay there stunned petra did nothing to help him muttered something sharp that widened his eyes and everyone elses she stamped away from the scene her own damn fault going for color petra worked the case hard doing all the usual procedural things as well as researching baby boy lee on the internet soon she felt immersed in her victims world wondered what it had been like to be edgar ray lee the bluesman had started out uppermiddle class the only child of two professors at emory university in atlanta ten years as a child prodigy on violin and cello had ended when edgars teenage rebellion aimed him at guitar and landed him on a greyhound to chicago where he found a whole new lifestyle living on the streets and in borrowed cribs sitting in with the butterfield blues band albert lee b b king and any other genius who happened to be passing through developing his chops but picking up bad habits the older musicians recognized the chubby kids talent right away and one of them gave him the nickname that stuck baby boy spent two decades scratching a living as a sessions sideman and a barband front man endured big promises that petered cut records that went nowhere finally recorded a top hit with a southern band called junior biscuit the song penned sung and guitarriffed by the big man was a gutwrenching lament entitled a cold heart the very same ditty baby boy had played moments before his death the song made it to on the billboard top stayed on the charts for a month baby boy bought himself a nice car and a whole bunch of guitars and a house in nashville within a year all the money was gone as lee kicked up his pattern of voracious womanizing and dining and polydrug use the next several years were a blur of fruitless rehab stints then obscurity no relatives called about the case lees parents were both dead hed never married or sired a child that god help her made her care about him deeply and the image of his corpse stayed in her head the usual procedural things were having baby boys apartment taped off before dropping in for a personal lookthrough interviewing baby boys band mates his manager the owner of the snake pit bouncers and bartenders and cocktail waitresses the few patrons whod stuck around to gawk at the crime scene and had gotten their names on a list no one had any idea whod want to hurt baby boy everyone loved baby boy he was a great big kid naïve goodnatured would give you the shirt off his back would give you his guitar for gods sake the high point of usual procedure was an hour in a tiny close interview room in the company of star witness linus brophy when petra first heard about an eyewitness her hopes had surged then shed talked to the homeless man and realized his account was next to worthless brophys description boiled down to a tall man age no idea race no idea clothing not a clue it was real dark detective lady if that wasnt enough to endear her to brophy the bum had a media jones kept pestering her wanting to know if someone from tv would be talking to him petra wondered how long till brophy tried to peddle a screenplay hawking his story to the tabloids i watched aliens murder baby boy lee only problem was the tabs couldnt care less because comeback attempt notwithstanding baby boy was no celebrity it had been eighteen years since the hit with junior biscuit and in the age of rockasporn lee was just what mtv didnt want the gawkers from the scene said volumes all were kids young enough to be baby boys offspring and every single one admired him only by association last year baby boy had played backup guitar on an album by a twentysomething band called tic a disc that had gone platinum and had fueled the big mans rebound attempt still petra wondered if baby boy had taken in some heavy cash from the hit big money was always a good motive but that idea was quashed quickly when she spoke to lees manager nah it didnt make baby rich didnt make him squat the former custodian of lees career was a bighaired stoopshouldered denimed ferret named jackie true who spoke in a clinically depressed mumble why not sir cause it was bullshit a scam said true those kids they hooked him in by telling him they idolized him he was gods answer to whatever then guess what they paid him double scale i tried to get a piece of the profits at least the net but true blew out air and shook his head i didnt even take my cut baby needed every penny too bad said petra too bad was babys theme song she was talking to true in the managers crappy north hollywood apartment jackies boots were scuffed and his nails were ragged what did managers get ten fifteen percent this one didnt come across like he had a stable full of thoroughbreds did baby being gone mean that fresh footwear and manicures would remain dreams for jackie if so scratch another motive no way jackie true could be her man anyway the one thing linus brophy seemed sure of was that the killer had been tall and true would be fivefive after a session on the rack she moved on to the next name on her list the soundman a grad student at usc freelancing for the night whod barely heard of baby boy tell the truth he said it really wasnt my thing im into classical petra visited baby boys residence the afternoon following the murder it turned out to be an apartment every bit as sad as jackie trues a groundfloor unit in a boxy white sixplex off cahuenga midway between hollywood and the valley the building sat behind a cypresslined parking lot oily pools dotted the asphalt and like lees thirteenyearold camaro the resident cars were tired and dusty given lees history shed expected dysfunctional clutter poor hygiene empty booze bottles dope whatever but baby boy had been living clean in every sense of the word the flat consisted of living room kitchenette bedroom bathroom offwhite walls shag carpeting the color of mexican limes low cracked ceilings sixtiesera light fixtures with a nod toward sparkle and gold paint petra started at the back and worked her way forward the bedroom smelled of stale sweat baby boy had slept on a pillowtop kingsize mattress set upon a box spring that rested on the floor no stash space underneath lees clothes took up half the stingy closet tshirts sweats jeans one huge black leather jacket so crackled it appeared ready to disintegrate a nightstand drawer yielded a mostly empty date book and some overdue utility bills petra took the book and continued to look around no dope or alcohol anywhere and the strongest nostrum she found in the bathroom was an economysized bottle of extrastrength advil the top left loose indicating frequent use the avocadocolored fridge held yogurt cottage cheese decaf nonfat mocha mix some bruised peaches and plums grapes that had started to pucker in the freezer was a package of skinless chicken breasts and a dozen boxes of lean cuisine dieting trying to better himself the poor guy and someone had gutted him like a fish the living room contained two straightbacked chairs eight guitars on stands and three amplifiers atop one amp was an obtrusive bit of elegance a charming little cloisonné box black enamel decorated with red dragons inside was an assortment of guitar picks and that was it petra s cell phone tooted the clerk at the station informed her that linus brophy had called wanted to know if she needed him for anything else she laughed and hung up more of the usual procedures took up the next few days lots of perspiration no inspiration petra s esophagus ached and her head pounded the case was starting to acquire that nasty whodunit reek at am monday sitting at her desk she got to baby boys datebook the black leatherette volume was virtually empty save for scant reminders to shop for groceries pick up laundry or call j t lee keeping in touch with jackie true hoping for what then petra came to the week of the murder a single notation spanned all seven days the large rightslanted block letters shed come to know as baby boys but larger penned in thick black marker gig at sp no exclamation points but there might as well have been lees excitement came across in the scale petra flipped a page to todays date two notations much smaller letters baby boy planning a future that never arrived gold rush studios that made sense jackie true had told her baby boy was still fired up had intended to spend some of his snake pit fees on a recording session sad thing was true had said frowning baby didnt realize how little studio time the gig was gonna buy him once i paid the band and everything else whats everything else equipment rentals the soundman the kid who hauled our junk you know moments hesitation my cut not much left said petra not much to start with the second notation was for wednesday and this one looked like an appointment rc on setup tele j petra had learned enough to know that baby boy played fender telecasters so this was a date with an instrument repairman then she flashed on the initials rc alex delawares lady friend robin castagna built and fixed guitars and from what alex had told petra she was the one who got called when serious musicians needed work on their gear rc had to be repairman indeed petra doubted robin could shed any light on the case but she had no other leads and made a note to phone tomorrow she went home early thinking of alex and robins cool white contemporary house off beverly glen those two talk about a solid relationship robin unlike other people we know had been smart enough to get herself a stable guy lucky break especially cause the guy was a shrink and petra suspected most shrinks were highmaintenance alex was goodlooking to boot another highmaintenance predictor but despite all that he had a what a solidity about him a little on the serious side but that was better than the selfcentered flakiness that seemed to afflict la men petra hadnt spoken to alex for a while shed considered calling him when billys breakingaway had caused her to wonder about her skills as a friend alex had been billys therapist but she hadnt followed through too busy no that wasnt the real reason solid or not delaware was still a shrink and petra was worried she couldnt keep the sadness out of her voice and hed pick up on it and want to do his thing she was in no mood to be shrunk now shielded by homicide she could make contact with impunity the next morning at ten she dialed the white house alex picked up and said hey petra whats up they exchanged small talk alex inquired about billy petra lied and said everything was going great then she said im actually calling robin her name came up in the date book of the victim on a case i just picked up baby boy lee howd you know robin worked on his guitars hes been here a few times sweet guy you know him pretty well no said alex he came by once in a while friendly always smiling but a bluesmans smile meaning sad resigned robin told me hed had some hard luck a couple of times i walked in and found him playing best show ive seen all year he had an incredible sense of phrasing not a lot of notes but the right ones talking like a music guy nearly word for word the same thing petra had heard from the big mans band mates she remembered alex played guitar lots of hard luck she said what else can you tell me about him thats about it robin worked on his guitars for free because he was always broke hed always make a show of writing out an iou and handing it to her but to my knowledge she never collected any idea who did it nope thats why im following everything up robin around several seconds passed then she doesnt live here anymore petra we separated a few months ago oh mutual decision its working out he said but he didnt sound as if he meant it ill give you her number petra s cheeks had grown hot not embarrassment anger another castle crumbles sure she said shes got a place in venice rennie avenue north of rose its a sidebyside duplex the studios in the southern unit petra copied the address and thanked him i dont think shes in town petra she spent a good part of last year touring with the kill famine tour and has been moving around pause she met a guy im sorry petra blurted it happens he said wed agreed to try out our independence anyway this guy hes a vocal coach and he travels quite a bit too theyre in vancouver i know because she called to let me know shes taking spike to a vet there toothache petra remembered the pooch cute little french bulldog a chance to change the subject ouch hope he feels better me too anyway theyre due back tomorrow i think okay thanks sure good luck on the case say hi to robin for me will do said petra itching to break the connection you take care now you too he hung up petra shut out the call and went over the details of baby boys demise for the umpteenth time then she left the station and got herself some lunch greasy hamburger at a vine street joint she was certain would disappoint the first time i made love to allison gwynn i felt like an adulterer totally irrational robin and i had been living apart for months and now she was with tim plachette but when the touch the feel the smell of someone is imbedded in your dna if allison sensed my unease she never said a word i met her shortly before my years with robin started to unravel id been helping milo on a twentyyearold murder years before at the age of seventeen allison had been sexually abused by a man who figured in the case her college mentor was an old friend of mine and he asked her if shed talk to me she thought about it and agreed i liked her right away admired her courage her honesty her gentle manner her looks were too notable to miss but back then i appreciated them as an abstraction ivory skin soft but assertive cheekbones a wide strong mouth the most gorgeous waistlength black hair id ever seen huge eyes blue as midnight projected a sharp curiosity like me she was a psychologist those eyes i figured would serve her well she grew up in beverly hills the only daughter of an assistant attorney general went to penn continued there for a phd in her senior year she met a wharton whiz fell in love married young and moved back to california within months of receiving her state license her husband was diagnosed with a rare malignancy and she was widowed eventually she pulled herself together and built up a santa monica practice now she combined clinical work with teaching nights at the u and volunteering at a hospice for the terminally ill keeping busy i knew that tune seated her high waist and willowy arms and swan neck implied height but like robin she was a small delicately built woman there i go again comparing unlike robin she favored expensive makeup considered clothesshopping a recreational activity had no problem flashing strategic glints of diamond jewelry one time she confessed it was because shed been late to enter puberty had hated looking like a child all through high school at thirtyseven she appeared ten years younger i was the first man shed been with in a long time when i called her it had been months since wed spoken surprise brightened her voice oh hi i talked around the issue finally asked her to dinner she said as in a date as in i thought there was someone so did i i said oh is this recent this isnt a rebound thing i said ive been single for a while hating the awkwardness the selfpity of all that giving yourself time she said saying the right thing trained to say the right thing maybe this was a mistake even back in grad school id avoided dating women in my field wanting to know about other worlds worried that intimacy with another therapist would be too confining then i met robin and thered been no need to look anywhere anyway i said if youre busy she laughed sure lets get together still a carnivore you remember did i gorge myself that badly dont answer that no i havent gone vegetarian i named a steakhouse not far from her office how about tomorrow night ive got patients until eight but if you dont mind a late dinner sure nine i said ill pick you up at your office why dont i meet you there she said that way i wont have to leave my car setting up an escape plan i said terrific see you then alex a date how long had it been eons even though allison would be bringing her own wheels i washed and vacuumed the seville got compulsive about it and ended up squatting at the grille wielding a toothbrush an hour later grubby and sweaty and reeking of armor all i took a long run stretched showered shaved shined up a pair of black loafers and pulled out a navy blazer soft singlebreasted italian model two christmases old a gift from robin i yanked it off switched to a black sport coat decided it made me look like an undertaker and returned to the blue next step slacks easy the featherweight gray flannels i usually wore when i testified in court add a yellow tabcollar shirt and a tie and id be which tie i tried on several decided neckwear was too stuffy for the occasion switched to a lightweight navy crewneck and decided that was too damn hollywood back to the yellow shirt opennecked no the tabs didnt look good that way and the damn thing was already sweatstained under the arms my heartbeat had kicked up and my stomach was flipping around this was ridiculous what would i tell a patient in the same predicament be yourself whoever that was i reached the restaurant first thought about waiting in the seville and greeting allison as she approached the door i figured that might alarm her and went inside the place was lit at tomb level i sat at the bar ordered a beer and watched sports on tv i cant remember the sport had barely gotten through the foam when allison arrived freeing a black tide of hair from her sweater and looking around i got to her just as the maître d looked up when she saw me her eyes widened no lookover just focusing on my face i smiled she smiled back well hello she offered her cheek and i pecked the sweater was lavender cashmere and it matched the clinging dress that sheathed her from breastbone to knee matching shoes with big heels diamond earrings diamond tennis bracelet a short strand of silver pearls around her white neck we sat down she ordered a glass of merlot and i asked for a chivas the red leather booth was roomy and i sat far enough away to avoid intrusiveness close enough to smell her she smelled great so she said aiming those blue eyes at the empty booth next to us long day back to me yes thankfully know what you mean i said she played with a napkin what have you been up to after the ingalls case quieted down i took a little time off lately ive being doing court consultations crime consultations no i said injury cases some child custody custody she said that gets ugly especially when theres enough money to pay lawyers indefinitely and you get stuck with an idiot judge i try to limit myself to smart judges find any its a challenge the drinks arrived we clinked glasses and drank in silence she twirled the stem inspected the menu said im starving will probably gorge again go for it whats good i havent been here in years oh she seemed amused did you pick it to indulge my carnivorous tendencies yours and mine also i recalled it as relaxed it is silence my face warmed scotch and awkwardness even in the dim light i could see that shed colored anyway she said i dont know if i ever thanked you but you made talking about my experience as easy as it couldve been so thanks thanks for helping it made a difference she scanned the menu some more gnawed her lower lip looked up said im thinking tbone sounds good you rib eye majorleague beefathon she said she looked at the empty booth again brought her eyes back to the tablecloth seemed to be studying my fingertips i was glad id filed my nails youre taking time off from crime cases she said but youll go back to it if im asked will you be i nodded she said i never got to ask you what draws you to that kind of thing i could recite some noble speech about righting wrongs and making the world just a little bit safer but ive stopped fooling myself the truth is i have a thing for unpredictability and novelty from time to time i need a shot of adrenaline like a race car driver i smiled that glamorizes it she drank wine kept the glass in front of her lips lowered it and revealed her own smile so youre just another adrenaline junkie she ran a finger around the base of her glass if its all about thrills and chills why not just run cars around the track or jump out of planes the work i did had been a factor in the breakup with robin would we still be together if id settled for skydiving as i framed my answer allison said sorry i didnt mean to put you on the spot im just guessing that you crave more than novelty i think you really do like making things right i didnt answer then again she said who am i to utter pronouncements without a solid database being a behavioral scientist and all that she shifted her bottom tugged her hair drank wine i tried to smile away her discomfiture but couldnt catch her eye when she put her glass down her hand landed closer to mine just a few millimeters between our fingers then the gap closed both of us moving in concert touching pretending it was accidental and retracting our hands the heat of skin against skin the blue shirt with which id replaced the sweatruined yellow one was growing sodden allison began fooling with her hair i stared into what remained of my scotch breathing in the alcohol i hadnt eaten much all day and booze on an empty stomach shouldve set off at least a small buzz nothing too damned alert how was this going for the rest of the evening we let loose a few more cautious bits of autobiography ate well drank too much walked off the meal with a slow stroll up wilshire side by side but no contact her big heels clacked and her hair flapped her hips rolled not a vamp just the way she moved and that made it sexy men looked at her halfway through the first block her hand slipped around my biceps breeze from the ocean misted the streets my eyes ached with uncertainty conversation fizzled and we covered the next few blocks in silence pretending to windowshop back at our cars allison gave me a tentative kiss on the lips before i knew it shed gotten into her tenyearold jaguar and was roaring off two days later i called her and asked her out again she said ive got the afternoon off was planning to relax at home why dont you come over and we can eat here that is if youre willing to take the risk big risk who cares youre the adrenalineguy good point i said can i bring something flowers are always appropriate not that im suggesting im kidding just bring yourself and lets keep it casual okay she lived in a singlestory spanish house on fourteenth street just south of montana within walking distance of her office the alarm sign on the lawn was conspicuous and the black jag convertible was parked behind an iron gate that cut the porte cochere from the street as i approached the front door a motionsensing light went on womanlivingalone precautions womanwhohadbeenmolestedtwentyyearsago precautions as i parked i thought about robin moving back to venice all by herself correction not alone anymore stop fool i rang the bell and waited bouquet in hand figuring roses would be too forward id chosen a dozen white peonies casual had come down to an olive polo shirt and jeans and running shoes allison came to the door in a lime polo shirt and jeans and running shoes she took one look at me said do you believe this then she cracked up as i sat in her compact white kitchen she cooked mushroom and chicken liver omelettes and took a chilled salad out of the fridge sourdough white wine an ice bucket and a sixpack of diet coke filled out the menu the kitchen opened to a vestpocket backyard and we ate outside on a trellistopped patio the garden was usedbrick pathways and a patch of grass surrounded by high privet hedges i tasted the omelette not much risk here its one of the few things i can get through without disaster grandmas recipe lets hear it for grandma grandma was ornery but she knew her way around a stove she talked about her family and eventually i found myself parceling out bits of selfrevelation as the evening progressed my shoulders loosened allison had relaxed too curling up on a couch her feet tucked under her laughing a lot blue eyes animated pupils enlarged those who study that kind of thing say its a good sign but shortly before eleven her posture stiffened and she looked at her watch and said ive got an early patient she stood and glanced at the door and i wondered what had gone wrong when she walked me out she said im sorry for what for being so abrupt patients have their needs i said sounding like a stiff she shrugged as if that wasnt it at all but she said nothing more as she extended her hand for a shake her house had been warm but her skin was cold and moist in bare feet she was tiny and i wanted to take her in my arms i said good to see you again good to see you i stepped out to her front porch her smile was painful as she began to close the door then she came out and bussed my cheek i touched her hair she turned her head and delivered another kiss full on the lips but closedmouthed hard almost assaultive i tried for another kiss but she withdrew and said drive carefully and this time she did close the door she phoned me the next day at noon wouldnt you know it my early patient was a noshow too bad i said yes i could we would you like to im free tonight at seven if youre willing sevens fine want me to cook alex would you mind something other than just sitting around and eating maybe a drive ive been so cooped up driving helps me unwind me too how many hundreds of miles since robin had left had i put on the seville we could take a spin up the coast to malibu my favorite drive all those night cruises along the pacific with robinshut up perfect she said if we get hungry there are plenty of places to stop see you at seven want me to meet you somewhere no pick me up at my house i got there at before i reached the door she opened it stepped out onto the front path and met me halfway setting off the motionsensing light she had on a sleeveless black cotton dress no stockings lowheeled black sandals no diamonds just a thin gold choker that accentuated the length and whiteness of her neck her hair was clipped back in a ponytail it made her look younger tentative i need to explain about last night she said talking fast sounding breathless the truth is the early patient was scheduled at ninethirty i had plenty of time didnt need to kibosh everything i was lets call a spade a spade i was nervous being with you made me very very nervous alex i it wasnt you her shoulders rose and fell her laugh was quick just short of brittle as she took my arm and ushered me into her house standing with her back to the door she said if my patients could see me now im a bigdeal expert at helping others make transitions but i am having the hardest time she shook her head transitions now im being presumptuous hey i said the first time we went out i changed shirts three times she stared up at me i touched her chin and raised it she removed my hand saying the right thing she said with people like us you never know if its the training occupational hazard i said she threw her arms around me and kissed me deeply her tongue was gingery and nimble i held her tight stroked her face her neck her back chanced roaming lower and when she didnt stop me dropped both my hands and cupped her rear she moved my right hand around to her front sandwiched it between cottonsheathed thighs i explored her heat and she did something with her hips that was pure intent lifting the black dress i peeled down her panties felt the angle of her legs widen i kissed her i strummed her one of her hands was tangled in my hair holding fast the other fumbled at my zipper finally she freed me and we were on the hardwood floor of her living room and i was in her and she was clutching me and we were moving together as if wed been doing it all our lives she kissed my face and said im going to go out on a limb with you its not just the training youre a sweet man the feelings came later after wed slept and eaten leftovers and renewed our dehydrated bodies with gulps of water and were finally heading north on pacific coast highway taking allisons jaguar because it was a convertible i was at the wheel and allison stretched out on the reclined passenger seat bundled up in a big white irish sweater hair loose flapping like an ebony banner face to the wind one hand rested on my knee beautiful fingers long and tapered smooth and white no scars robin though a master of tools hurt herself from time to time i gave the jag more gas sped past black ocean and gray hillside the headlights of other adventurers stealing peeks at allisons face when the road straightened my scalp still ached where shed yanked my hair and the stretch of brow from which shed licked my sweat pinged with electricity i put on even more speed and she stroked my knee and i got hard again beautiful woman sensuous woman fast car gorgeous california night perfect but this idiots joy was muffled by the wagging finger of doubt some notion that id cheated beyond stupid robins with tim and now im with allison things changed change was good right a hundred hours since baby boy had bled out in the alley and petra had turned up nothing the clammy sour smell of whodunit permeated her sinuses she found herself wishing for a slamdunk bar stabbing but picked up no other cases the crime drop that had become the departments bigtime cap feather meant adequate staffing it would be a while before the homicide dial rotated back to her she went over the file till her head hurt asked a couple of the guys if they had any ideas a young di named arbogast said you should listen to his music petra had bought a few cds spent the earlymorning hours with baby boys bruised voice and wailing guitar licks for a clue no said arbogast cause he rocked guy was a fucking genius another detective agreed an older one krauss petra wouldve never taken him for a blues fan then she realized he was around baby boys age had probably grown up with baby boys music a genius dies but the mainstream press couldnt care less not even a phone call from the times despite uniformly good reviews of baby boys music petra found while surfing the web she left a message for the newspapers music critic on the off chance something in baby boys past could point her in a new direction jerk never phoned back she did get pestered by a handful of selfstyled rock journalists youngsounding guys claiming to represent outlets with names like guitar buzz guitar universe and twentyfirstcentury guitar each one wanting details for obituaries no one had anything to say about lee other than to praise his playing the word phrasing kept coming up alex had used the term and petra figured out that meant how you put notes and rhythm together her phrasing on this one stank the rock writers lost interest when she asked questions instead of answering theirs except for one guy who kept bugging her for details a character named yuri drummond publisher of a local magazine called grooverat which had run a profile on baby boy last year drummond alienated petra immediately by calling her by her first name and proceeded to compound the annoyance by rooting around rudely for forensic details how many stab wounds how much blood did he actually lose guy had the ghoulish curiosity and nasal voice of a hormonally stormed teenager and petra wondered about a prank caller but when he asked her if anything had been scrawled on the alley wall she stiffened why do you ask that well you know said drummond like the manson murders helter skelter why would the manson murders be related to mr lees murder i dont know i just thought have you heard anything about mr lees murder mr drummond no drummonds voice rose in pitch what would i know when did you interview mr lee no no i never met him you said you ran a profile on him we ran an indepth profile and listed his discography you profiled him in depth without meeting him exactly said drummond sounding cocky thats the whole point what is grooverats into the psychobiosocial essence of art and music not the cult of personality psychobiosocial said petra in plain words said drummond condescending we dont care who someone screws only the groove they put out hence the title of your magazine silence petra said do you have information about who baby boy lee was screwing youre saying there was a sexual angle to mr drummond what exactly was the focus of this profile the music pronounced the little snip letting the unspoken duh hang in the air baby boys phrasing said petra baby boys whole groove the mindset he put himself into to get the sound he did you didnt think talking to him would help that petra pressed wondering why she was wasting time with this loser knowing the sad answer nothing else on her plate no said drummond did baby boy lee turn down an interview with you no we never asked him so tell me what kind of blade are we talking about what was baby boys groove said petra pain said drummond thats why his being killed is so it fits so what can you tell me about how it went down petra said you want gory details right said drummond do you have any idea who killed him why would i listen you really should help us the publics got a right to know and were the best messenger whys that mr drummond because we understood him were they the details gory were you at the snake pit saturday night nope not a big enough fan i was at the whiskey showcase for a bunch of new bands hey whatre you saying drummonds voice had climbed even higher and now he sounded twelve petra visualized some acneplagued scarecrow in a slovenly room the kind of creepazoid with too much leisure time whod phone the local supermarket clutching the phone with sweaty hands excuse me do you have pigs feet yes we do then wear shoes and no onell notice yuka yuka yuka drummond said if i knew what was gonna happen id have been there absolutely whys that to see his last show what do they call that a swan song yuri said petra what is that russian drummond hung up on friday just after pm the downstairs clerk beeped petra s extension theres a ms castagna here to see you ill be right down said petra surprised when she got to the ground floor robin was by herself in the lobby staring at some wanted posters hands on hips her back to petra her hair was longer than petra remembered it the mass of auburn curls trailing down her back like a heap of grapes alexs hair was curly too if the two of them had bred they mightve created another shirley temple then petra thought all those years together and they never had bred never tied the knot either because of her own state she found herself wondering about things like that she approached robin taking in robins outfit the way women do with other women black corduroy overalls over a red tshirt with highcut sleeves black suede tennis shoes red bandana hanging out of a rear pocket kind of a rock n roll caj thing on the wrong body the overalls could be deadly robins curves made them look fine when petra was a few steps away she said hi there and robin turned and petra saw that shed been biting her lip and her dark eyes were moist petra she said they hugged i just got back to town picked up your message this morning i had to be in hollywood for a session so i figured id stop by this is terrible sorry to tell you like that but i didnt know when youd be back robin shook her head i heard about it yesterday in vancouver local papers cover it dont know said robin i got it backstage the music grapevine i was shocked we all were i had no idea you were involved i am indeed said petra anything you can tell me what can i say he was such a sweetiepie robins words quivered and faded she held back tears a big old sweet guy and a supremely talented man anything else on the grapevine buzz like whod want to do this to him even the flimsiest rumor robin gave another headshake rubbed a smooth tan arm baby was the last person id peg with any enemy petra everyone liked him not everyone thought petra as i said in the message your name was in his book what was it an appointment to fix some guitars theyre fixed he was coming by to pick them up robin smiled im surprised he actually wrote it down time was a pretty plastic concept for baby youve been working on his gear for a while years and often baby played so hard his fingertips wore grooves in the fretboard i was always planing boards down refretting doing necksets these two were beyond that needed complete new boards a fender telecaster and a j said petra someone told me thats a gibson robin smiled gibson acoustic id already refinished it a couple of times because baby let it get too dry and the lacquer cracked and flaked off and his pick nearly wore a hole in the top this time i put in the second replacement fretboard the tele was simpler just setup i finished them both early right before i left town because i always tried to finish early for baby whys that said petra because baby got sounds out of a guitar that no one else did and i wanted to contribute my small bit i knew id be traveling to vancouver so i left a message at his apartment to pick them up on wednesday he never got back to me but thats not unusual as i said baby and punctuality were strangers most of them are like that them meaning musicians musicians robin repeated and her lips curled upward petra said so he never called but he did jot down the appointment guess so typically baby just dropped in petra what do i do with the guitars now theyre not evidence are they are they worth anything clean theyd be very pricey with all the modifications a lot less no valueadded because baby played them said petra i read how eric clapton auctioned some guitars off and they went way above estimates baby wasnt clapton tears trickled from robins eyes she produced the red bandana and dabbed them dry how could someone do this it stinks said petra i cant see how the guitars would be evidence but sit tight if i need them ill let you know thinking maybe she should pick them up on the slim chance she caught the bad guy and they brought him to trial and some defense attorney wanted to make a stink about the chain of evidence robin was saying i hope you get whoever did it what else can you tell me about baby boy said petra easygoing a big kid people took advantage of his good nature if he got hold of a dollar it floated right out of his pocket doesnt seem as if hes made too many dollars recently said petra remembering what alex had told her about babys perennial ious to robin figuring quoting alex right now might be a distraction things were tough for him said robin had been for a while he got a boost when a new pop band asked him to play on their album guys young enough to be his kids but he was so up for it thought this might be a big break the album did great but i doubt they paid him much whys that robin kicked one suede tenny with the other he seemed broke as usual he hadnt paid me in a long time used to write out these elaborate ious minicontracts really both of us pretending we were being businesslike then hed pick up his gear and offer a few dollars in partial payment and id say forget it and hed argue but eventually give in and that would be it till the next time it went on for so long i stopped expecting to get paid but when he cut the album with those kids he called me and promised hed be settling up closing out my tab sweet lil sis was the way he put it he used to say if hed had a little sister he wouldve wanted her to be just like me another swipe of the bandana but the tab never got closed said petra not a penny thats how i know the gig didnt produce serious money if babyd been flush i wouldve been high on his list right after rent and food his rent was paid up and there was food in his fridge diet food robin winced that again onstage he flaunted his weight shook his belly wiggled his butt made jokes about being heavy but the poor guy hated being big was always resolving to trim down she sniffed for all hed been through he never stopped wanting to better himself once when he was feeling pretty down he told me god made a mess when he created me my jobs cleaning it up she broke down crying and petra put an arm around her shoulder a couple of uniforms walked through the front doors and swaggered across the lobby jangling gear not even bothering to notice the weeping woman they saw plenty of that the thursday after baby boy lees murder my doorbell rang id been typing court reports all afternoon ran out of words and wisdom and called out for chinese food grabbing tip money i trudged from my office to the living room threw open the door and faced robin shed never surrendered her key but was acting like a guest which i suppose she was she saw the tip money and smiled i cant be bought that easily i pocketed the bills hi is this a bad time of course not i held the door open and she stepped into the place wed designed together i watched her wander around the living room as if reacquainting herself with the space when she perched on the edge of a sofa i took a facing seat you know about baby boy she said petra called me looking for you i was just over at the hollywood police station talking to her she stared at the ceiling ive never been close to someone who was murdered all the years you and i were together i stayed on the periphery you didnt miss anything she played with an earring its disgusting the feeling of goneness it brings back my fathers death its not the same of course i was fond of baby but he wasnt family still for some reason baby was a good guy great guy she said whod want to hurt him she got up and walked around some more straightened a picture i shouldnt have barged in on you i said does petra have any leads she shook her head any lifestyle issues had baby gotten back into drugs not as far as i know she said the last few times when he came by he looked clean didnt he far as i could tell not that id paid much attention to baby boys demeanor the last time hed dropped off some gear music had drifted into the house from robins studio and id gone over to listen baby boy had left the studio door open and i stood there watching listening as he cradled his old gibson acoustic like a baby hammered some notes in a dropd tuning sang something low and pained and tender but what do i know said robin maybe he had gotten back into the bad old days what do any of us know about anyone she rubbed her eyes i shouldnt have come it was inconsiderate were still friends right she said that was the deal walk away friends is that sitting right with you howre you doing with it okay she stood ill get going alex things to do places to see i said why had she had come shoulder to cry on was tims shoulder defective i realized i was angry but also weirdly gratified shed chosen me nothing pressing she said i dont belong here i like you here why had i said that she walked over to me tousled my hair kissed the top of my head once upon a time wed be dealing with this youknowhow how she smiled once upon a time wed be doing the twobacked beast thats how we always ended up dealing with stress i can think of worse ways to cope definitely she said she lowered herself onto my lap and we kissed for a long time i touched a breast she emitted a low sad sound reached for me stopped herself im so sorry she said as she ran for the door i got to my feet but remained in place nothing to be sorry for lots to be sorry for she said new adultery hows spike when in doubt ask about the dog fine youre welcome to come see him thanks the doorbell rang and her head whipped around i called out for food that hunan place in the village she patted her hair in place good place spicy but not hostile she gave a terrible smile and twisted the doorknob an hispanic kid who looked around twelve held out a greasy bag and i jogged to the door took the food reached into my pocket for money grabbed too many bills thrust them at him thanks man he said and hurried down the stairs i said hungry anything but said robin as she turned to leave i thought of a million things to say what came out was petra s as good as they come shell keep working at it i know she will thanks for listening bye alex anytime i said but that wasnt true anymore for two weeks of double shifts most of which she neglected to file as overtime petra drove herself crazy trying to track down as many members of baby boys final audience as she could coming up only with the few names on the freebie list most of whom hadnt bothered to show up and the stragglers shed already talked to she had a go with the snake pits absentee owner a dentist from long beach reinterviewed the custodians the bouncers the cocktail waitresses lees band all pickup musicians and the diminutive poorly shod jackie true all useless she even tried to contact the members of tic the band that had sparked visions of comeback in baby boys head here she encountered another side of the music biz layers of insulation from the receptionists of recordcompany executives on up to the bands manager an unctuoussounding stoner named beelzebub lawrence who finally deigned after petra called him a dozen times to speak to her over the phone music pounded in the background and lawrence spoke softly the twominute conversation strained petra s hearing and her patience yeah baby boy had been brilliant no he had no idea whod want to hurt him yeah the guys had dug jamming with him no they hadnt had contact with him since the recording session petra said he really added something to their sound didnt he shed bought the cd found it an execrable mix of whiny lyrics and plodding rhythm only baby boys guitar sweet and sustaining on two tracks lent any sense of musicality to the mess beelzebub lawrence said yeah he was cool the coroner was finished with baby boys corpse but no one had come forward to claim it even though it wasnt her job petra did some genealogical research that led her to edgar ray lees closest living relative a greataunt named grenadina bourgeouis ancientsounding and feeble senile too it soon became clear the phone chat rattled the old woman and left petra s head spinning she called jackie true and apprised him of the situation he said baby wanted to be cremated he talked about dying doesnt everybody said true ill handle it it was nearly am on a monday and she was mentally exhausted but too jumpy to sleep she took a deep breath sat back in her chair drank cold coffee from the cup that had been sitting there for hours caffeine thatll help the old nerves smart girl the detective room was quiet just her and a d ii named balsam pecking away at an antiquated computer balsam was petra s age but carried himself like an old man old mans taste in music too hed brought a boom box but it wasnt booming tuned to an easylistening station some eighties hairband song redone with strings and a harp petra was transported to a departmentstore elevator womens sportswear floor three her notes on baby boy were spread out before her and she gathered them up began replacing them in the folder making sure each page was in its right place you couldnt be too careful what difference did it make this one wasnt going to close anytime in the near future her phone rang connor detective said a male voice yes this is detective connor good this is officer saldinger im over at western and franklin and we could use one of you guys whats the problem said petra your line of work said saldinger lots of blood after robins dropin our contact was limited to polite phone calls and forwarded mail accompanied by even more polite notes if she needed to talk about baby boy or anything else of substance shed found another audience i thought about visiting spike id adopted him but he ended up disdaining me and competing for robins attention no custody struggle i knew the score still from time to time i missed his little bulldog face the comical egotism the aweinspiring gluttony maybe soon id heard nothing about the murder since petra s first call and weeks later i spotted her name in the paper triple slaying in the parking lot of a dance club off franklin boulevard three am ambush of a carload of armenian gang members from glendale by members of a rival faction from east hollywood petra and a partner i didnt know a detective named eric stahl had arrested a fifteenyearold shooter and a sixteenyearold driver after a prolonged investigation prolonged meant the case had probably opened shortly after baby boys death petra spending her time on something she could solve maybe so but she was driven failure would stick in her gut for the next few weeks i concentrated on spending time with allison helping kids banking some income one consultation kept me particularly busy a twoyearold girl accidentally shot in the leg by her fouryearold brother lots of family complications no easy answers but things finally seemed to be settling down i convinced allison to take off some time and we spent a fourday weekend at the san ysidro ranch in montecito imbibing sun and great food when we drove back to la i convinced myself i was doing okay on all fronts the day after i got back milo phoned and said dont you sound chipper been working on chipper dont overdo it he said wouldnt want you to forget the morose underpinnings of our relationship god forbid i said whats up something decidedly unchipper ive got a weird one so naturally i thought of you weird in what way apparently motiveless but we psychologically astute types know better dont we an artist a painter murdered the night of her big opening last saturday someone strangled her ligature thin with corrugations probably a wound metal wire sexual assault there was some posing but no evidence of assault you have time for you always he asked me to meet him for lunch at café moghul an indian restaurant on santa monica a few blocks from the west la station the place turned out to be a storefront blocked by giltflecked madras curtains an unmarked ford ltd was parked near the entrance in a loading only space and cheap plastic sunglasses that i recognized as milo s sat atop the dashboard the place was magentawalled and hung with machined tapestries of hugeeyed nutmegskinned people and spiretopped temples an ultrasoprano voice sang plaintively the air was a mix of curry and anise a sixtyish woman in a sari greeted me hes over there pointing to a table along the rear wall no need for guidance milo was the only customer in front of him was a quartsized glass of what looked to be iced tea and a plate of fried things in various geometric shapes his mouth was full and he waved and continued masticating when i reached the table he half rose wiped grease from his chin washed down the baseballsized bolus that orangutaned his cheeks and pumped my hand the mixed appetizers combo he said have some i ordered entrees for both of us the chicken tali comes with rice lentils side vegetable the works the vegetables okra which is usually about as appealing as snot on toast but they do it good little mango chutney on the side too hi i said the shy woman brought a glass poured me tea and departed iced and spiced lots of cloves he said i took liberty there too how nice to be nurtured how would i know he reached for a triangular pastry muttered samosa and gazed at me from under heavily lidded bright green eyes since robin had moved out id been trying to convince him i was okay he claimed to believe me but his body language said he was reserving judgment no nurturance for the poor detective i said dont want it too tough he winked howre you doing i said mostly to prevent him from focusing on my mood the worlds falling apart but im fine freelancings still fun i wouldnt call it that what would you call it bureaucratically sanctioned isolation im not allowed to have fun he bared his teeth in what i knew was a smile someone else might have taken it for hostility i watched him toss another appetizer down his gullet and drink more tea last year hed run afoul of the police chief before the chief retired managed to play some cards and ended up with a lieutenants title and salary but not the desk job that came with promotion effectively banished from the robberyhomicide room he was given his own windowless office down the hall a converted interrogation space figurative miles from the other detectives his official title was clearance officer for unsolved homicide cases basically that meant deciding which cold files to pursue and which to ignore the good news was relative independence the bad news was no builtin backup or departmental support now he was working a fresh case i figured there was a back story and hed tell me when he was ready he looked in good trim and the clarity in his eyes suggested hed stuck to his resolution to cut down on the booze hed also resolved to start walking for exercise but the last few times id seen him hed griped about his instep today he had on a coarse brown herringbone sport coat way too heavy for a california spring a oncewhite washandwear shirt and a green polyblend tie embroidered with blue dragons his black hair was freshly cut in the usual style long and shaggy on top cropped tight at the temples sideburns now snowwhite reached the bottoms of his fleshy ears he called them his skunk stripes the restaurants lighting was kind to his complexion rendering some of the acne pits as craggy contours he said the artists name was juliet kipper known as julie thirtytwo divorced a painter in oils as they say who says arty types thats the way they talk a painter in oils a sculptor in bronze an etcher in drypoint paintings are pictures or images one makes art blah blah blah anyway julie kipper apparently she was gifted won a bunch of awards in college went on for an mfa at the rhode island school of design and attracted new york gallery attention soon after graduation she sold a few canvases seemed to be moving forward then things tightened up and she ran into financial problems she moved out here seven years ago did commercial illustration for ad agencies to earn a living a year ago she got serious again about fine art found herself gallery representation took part in a couple of group shows did okay last saturday was her first solo show since she left new york which gallery place called light and space its a cooperative run by a bunch of artists who use it mostly to showcase their own stuff but they also support what they call distinctive talent and julie kipper was deemed as such by their review committee i get the feeling these people dont earn a living by their art most of them have day jobs julie had to pay for her own party cheese and crackers and cheap wine a jazz trio about fifty people drifted in and out during the evening and six of the fifteen paintings were reddotted that means sold in art lingo they actually put little red dots on the title tag any of the coop members twang your antenna they come across as a peaceloving bunch nothing but good words about julie but who knows julie calling the victim by her first name early in the game hed bonded with this one i said what happened someone ambushed her in the ladies room of the gallery after hours close confines just a sink and a toilet and a mirror there was a bump on the back of her head coroner says not serious enough to knock her out but the skin was broken and traces of her blood were found on the rim of the sink coroners guess is she was thrashing and her head knocked against it anyone elses blood i should be so lucky a struggle i said how big a woman was she small he said fivefour hundred and ten any skin under her fingernails not a molecule but we did find some talcum powder as in the stuff they use inside rubber gloves if thats what it means i said it implies careful preparation how long after hours did it happen the show closed at ten and julie stayed behind to clean up one of the coop artists helped her a woman named coco barnes who i dont see as a suspect because a shes in her seventies and b shes the size of a garden troll just after eleven barnes went back to check and found julie is she hard of hearing as well i said all that thrashing around no mystery there alex the gallerys one big front room but the bathrooms are out back separated by a solidcore door that leads to a small vestibule and a storage area that feeds to a rear alley door plus the bathroom doors also solid top of that there was music playing not the jazz combo theyd already packed out but julie had brought a stereo system and backup tapes for when the band took breaks she switched it on while they straightened barnes not hearing a thing makes total sense the smiling woman brought shallow round stainlesssteel trays crowded with small saucerlike dishes basmati rice lentils green salad okra nan bread tandoori chicken a ramekin of mango chutney nice variety huh said milo picking up a chicken wing youre assuming the killer got in through the alley was the rear door forced nope how soon after ten did julie go back to the bathroom coco cant recall she remembers realizing julied been gone for a while just before she checked but the two of them had been busy cleaning finally she had to go herself made her way back there and knocked on the bathroom door and when julie didnt answer she opened it selflocking bathroom he thought yeah one of those pushbutton dealies so the killer chose not to lock up or forgot someone who brings gloves and ambushes his victim would remember he rubbed his face okay so whats the insight showing off i said aiming for display you said there was sexual positioning panties down to the ankles legs spread knees propped no bruising or entry lying on her back between the toilet and sink she had to be squeezed in there its not how youd fall naturally he brushed hair off his brow resumed eating what was her mood that night coco barnes says she was flying high because of how well shed done six out of fifteen paintings sold apparently thats great flying high i said with or without aid he put down his fork why do you ask you said julies career flagged after her initial success im wondering if personal habits got in the way he picked up what remained of the chicken wing studied it began crunching bones he mustve ground them fine enough to swallow because nothing emerged yeah she had problems as long as were at it dr clairvoyant got any stock tips stash your money in the mattress thanks yeah back in her new york days she messed around with cocaine and alcohol talked openly about it all the other coop artists knew but everyone ive talked to so far says shed straightened up i tossed her apartment myself and the most addictive thing in her medicine chest was midol strongest thing in her system the night she was killed according to the coroner was aspirin so it looks like she was flying on selfesteem until someone brought her down i said and planned the fall carefully someone familiar enough with the gallery to know the bathroom would be a relatively safe place to get the job done is there any indication julie arranged to meet someone after the party she didnt mention any appointment to anyone and her book was clear except for the party posing but no assault that could be someone wanted to make it look sexual thats the vibe i get the whole thing is too damned contrived for a rapemurder almost like an art piece i said performance art his jaws bunched i said whyd you take this one personal favor her family knew my family back in indiana her dad worked steel with my dad actually he was one of the guys my dad supervised on the line hes dead and so is julies mother but the dads brother julies uncle flew out to id the body got hold of me and asked me to take it last thing i wanted was something with a personal connection but what choice did i have the guy was coming on like i was some goddamn sherlock youre famous in indiana oh joy he said forking a wad of okra then changing his mind and flipping the gooey mess back on the plate was the wire ligament left behind no that was the coroners surmise from the marks on her neck it sliced through the skin but the killer took the time to remove it we canvassed the area found nothing more careful planning i said this is a smart one aint we got fun we finished up and got into my car and milo directed me to light and spaces address on carmelina just north of pico i knew the neighborhood storage facilities auto body shops and small factories just a stroll from la s western border with the city of santa monica if julie kipper had been strangled a couple of blocks away her uncles appeal to milo wouldve been futile as i drove milo balanced a toothpick between the tips of his index fingers and radarscanned the passing world with cops eyes been a while since we did this huh over the past few months wed seen each other less and less id put it down to his backlog of cold files and my workload that was denial there was mutual isolation going on guess you didnt have enough weird ones matter of fact thats true he said just the usual and i dont trouble you with the usual a second later you doing all right in general everythings fine good a block later so everything with allisons things are working out allisons wonderful i said well thats good he picked his teeth kept surveilling the city his first contacts with allison had been professional wrapping up the ingalls file she told me hed been deft and compassionate his first reaction upon hearing that we were seeing each other had been silence then shes gorgeous ill grant you that id thought what wont you grant me then i figured i was being touchy and kept my mouth shut a few weeks later i cooked dinner for four at my place a mild march evening steaks and baked potatoes and red wine out on the terrace milo and rick silverman allison and me the surprise was allison and rick knew each other one of her patients had been brought into the cedarssinai er after a car wreck and rick had been the surgeon on duty they talked shop i played host milo ate and fidgeted toward the end of the evening he drew me aside nice girl alex not that you need my approval sounding as if someone had prodded him to make the speech since then hed seldom mentioned her a few more blocks he said hows the pooch i hear hes fine a moment later robin and i got together a couple of times for coffee surprise surprise nothing wrong with that i said youre pissed why would i be pissed you sound pissed im not pissed where do i turn two more blocks then a right he said okay i keep my trap crazyglued shut even though all these years youve been telling me i should express my feelings express away i said that guy shes with he has a name tim tims a wimp give it up milo give what up reconciliation fantasies i when you saw her was she pining for me silence whoa he said right turn here yeah light and spaces neighbors were a plating plant and a wholesaler of plastic signs the gallerys warehouse origins were obvious brickfaced tarroofed three segmented steel overhead doors in front instead of a window black plastic letters above the central door read light and space an art place stout combination locks secured the outer doors but the one in the middle was held in place by a single dead bolt that responded to a key on milo s ring he pushed and the metal panel slid upward into a pocket they gave you a key i said my honest face he said stepping inside and flicking on lights the interior was five thousand square feet or so walls painted that vanilla white that brings out the best in art gray cement floors twentyfoot ceilings thatched by ductwork highfocus spotlights fixed upon several large unframed canvases no furniture except for a desk up front bearing brochures and a cd player the nearest wall was lettered in the same black plastic used on the outside of the building juliet kipper air and image same title on the brochures i picked one up skimmed a few paragraphs of artspeak flipped to a blackandwhite headshot of the artist juliet kipper had posed in a black turtleneck and no jewelry her face pallid against a gray matte background squarish face not unpretty under chopped platinum hair pale eyes deepset and watchful challenged the camera her mouth was grim tugged down at the corners high uneven bangs exposed a furrowed forehead concentrating hard or burdened shed made an effort to look the part of the troubled artist or it had come naturally milo was pacing the gallery setting off echoes as he drifted from painting to painting i began doing the same a smug psychoprediction of julie kippers art based upon the cheerlessness of her photo would have fallen flat shed created fifteen luminous landscapes exuberantly colorful and textured each marked by a masters control of composition and light sere arroyos fogshrouded razorhewn mountains furious waterfalls emptying to mirrorglass streams deep green forests pierced by gilded bursts that promised distant discovery two ocean nocturnes were livened by cerulean blue heavens and lemon moonglow that turned the tide to froth every painting bore the confident brushstrokes of someone whod known how to move pigment around the canvas layers of color seemed to fluoresce in lesser hands the work wouldve veered into tourist kitsch prices ranged from two to four thousand i examined the canvases with another eye searching for familiar locales but finding none then i read the title tags dream i dream ii dream iii juliet kipper had created her own terrain i said to my eye she was a major talent my voice bounced around the nearempty space milo said i like her stuff too but what do i know cmon let me show you where she died the bathroom was too small for both of us and milo waited outside as i checked out the grimy spot where juliet kipper had been strangled a nasty little space windowless dank cracked sink oxidized spigots black threads of mold curled in the corners with all that dirt the series of faint brown smudges on the cement floor wouldve escaped my notice if i hadnt known better i backed out of the room and milo showed me the rest of the rear space a large storage area to the left was filled with unframed paintings and office supplies and random pieces of cheaplooking furniture the mens room was no more generous or attractive the gallerys rear door was striped by a push bolt another selflocking mechanism i said another deliberate attempt to invite discovery exhibitionist but he keeps it in check someone very measured he pushed the bolt propped the door open with a block of wood left there for that purpose and we exited the building an asphalt strip was backed by a tenfoot block wall a dumpster took up the far corner whats on the other side of the wall parking lot of a plumbing supplies outfit the grounds higher on their side two feet or so but it would still be a climb and thered be no reason for the killer to scale it because all he had to do was walk right in he led me around the north side of the gallery and pointed down another tarred passageway that bordered the plating plant and opened to the street fumes rose from the plant the air smelled lethal not much security i said why would a bunch of artists need any we returned to the proppedopen door and i had a closer look at the lock same key as the front yup i assume all the coop members have keys access is no mystery alex motive is like i said ive already talked to all the coop members and none of them even remotely twangs my antenna fourteen out of twenty are women and of the six guys three are of coco s vintage the young ones seem like your basic headintheclouds creative type were talking the venice crowd here make art not war no ones being evasive i ran checks on all of them anyway clean ive been fooled too often to think it cant happen again but im just not picking up any serious vibes from this bunch we reentered the gallery and i had another look at julie kippers paintings beautiful i wasnt sure that meant much in the art world but it meant something to me and i wanted to cry i said when was she divorced ten years ago three years before she moved out here whos the ex guy named everett kipper he said he used to be an artist too they met at rhode island but he switched careers she kept his name julie told people the split was amicable and kipper was at the opening everyone i spoke to said they looked friendly what career did he switch to bond broker from art to finance i said does he pay alimony her bankbook shows monthly deposits of two grand and she has no other obvious means of support so with her gone he saves twentyfour grand a year yeah yeah like any spouse hes the first suspect he said ive got an appointment to talk to him in an hour hes local lives in south pasadena works in century city why so long to get to him we played phone tag im heading over there next he fingered the knot of his tie businesslike enough for avenue of the stars no business id want a part of as we returned to the seville an old blue vw bus drove up to the gallery save the wetlands sticker on the rear bumper above that art is life a tiny whitehaired woman sat low in the drivers seat a yellowandbrown dog on the passenger side stared at the windshield the woman waved yoohoo detective and we approached the bus ms barnes said milo whats up he introduced me to coco barnes and she gripped my hand with what felt like a sparrows talon just came by to see if you got in okay barnes glanced at the gallerys frontage the dog remained in place dulleyed but tightjawed big dog with a graybeard muzzle bits of dry leaves specked its coat i chanced petting the animal it licked my hand milo said we got in fine youre all finished up in there coco barness voice was scratchy veering toward abrasive tempered by a southern inflection she looked to be seventy the white hair was cut in a boyish cap and trimmed unceremoniously her skin was the color and consistency of wellroasted chicken slate gray eyes more acute than the dogs but filmy nonetheless checked me out whats his name i said lance nice dog if he likes you coco barnes turned to milo any progress on julie its still early in the investigation maam the old woman frowned didnt i hear something about if you dont solve it quickly you probably wont solve it at all its not that simple maam coco barnes ruffled lances neck im glad i caught you it saves me a phone call remember how you asked me to think about anything unusual that happened saturday night and i said thered been nothing it had just been your typical opening well i thought about it some more and there was something not at night and not at the opening strictly speaking and im not sure its really what youre after what happened said milo this was before the opening said barnes the day of the opening around pm julie wasnt even here yet just me and lance here clark van alstrom was here too the man who does those aluminum stabiles milo nodded coco barnes said i brought clark along because i cant lift that metal door by myself once i got in clark left and i started setting up making sure everything was in order a few months ago we had a power outage and that was no good she smiled especially because the artist worked in neon anyway i was checking things out and i heard lance bark that doesnt happen often hes a very quiet boy she smiled at the dog lance made a low contented sound id set up a water bowl for him at the back in the hallway near where julie just outside the bathrooms but id left the door to the vestibule open and i could hear him barking he doesnt have much of a bark mind you hes fourteen years old and his vocal cords are pretty shot what he produces is more of a cough she demonstrated with a series of dry hacks lances eyes shifted to her but he remained inert he just kept it up wouldnt stop and i went back there to see what was wrong by the time i got there hed shlepped himself up on his feet and was facing the back door i wondered if hed heard rats wed had some rat problems a couple of seasons ago an opening that was absolutely disastrous wheres the pied piper of hamlin when you need him so where was i oh yes i opened the door and had a look out back and there were no rats but there was a woman foraging in the dumpster obviously homeless obviously quite mad mad as in angry said milo mad as in disturbed psychotic mentally ill i abhor labels but sometimes they do get the picture across this one was mad as the proverbial chapeau maker you could tell this by her eyes for starts said barnes wild eyes scared eyes jumping all over the place she tried to demonstrate with her own gray orbs but they moved lazily blinking several times as if to clear them she turned to lance and scratched behind his ear and said easy now youre a good boy then there was the way she carried herself her clothes mismatched oversized too many layers for the weather ive lived in venice for fiftythree years detective ive seen enough mental illness to know it when it stares me in the face then of course there was the foraging the moment the door opened she jumped back lost her balance and nearly fell such fear i said if you wait right here ill fetch you something to eat but she raised her hand to her mouth chewed her knuckles and ran off they do that a lot you know turn down food some of them even get hostile when you try to help them theyve got voices blabbering in their heads telling them whoknowswhat can you blame them for not trusting she ruffled the dog some more its probably nothing but in view of what happened to julie i dont suppose we can be too complacent no we cant maam what else can you tell me about this woman said milo the old womans eyes sparked so you do think its important at this stage everythings important i appreciate your telling me well thats good to know because i almost didnt tell you being as it was a woman and my assumption was a man killed julie the way she was the old womans eyes clamped shut then fluttered open im still trying to rid myself of the image not that this woman couldnt have overpowered julie she was large maybe six feet tall built big too though with all that clothing it was hard to tell precisely and we were only facetoface for a second or so big bones said milo sturdy almost masculine could it have been a man dressed up as a barnes laughed no no this one was pure girl all right but a big girl a lot bigger than julie which got me thinking it neednt have been a man at all right especially if were dealing with someone not in their right mind milos pad was out how old would you say she was id guess thirties but its a guess because that kind of misery homelessness mental illness it overrides age doesnt it in what way maam what i mean said barnes is that people like that all look ancient and damaged theres a coating of despair this one though shed managed to hold on to some of her youth under the grime i could see some youth i cant explain it any better than that coco barnes ticked a finger in terms of other details she wore a thick padded militarytype camouflage jacket over a red black and white flannel shirt over a blue ucla sweatshirt ucla in white letters the c was halfgone on the bottom were heavyduty gray sweatpants and from the way they bulked she had on at least one other pair of pants underneath white laceup tennis shoes on her feet and a broadbrimmed black straw hat atop her head the brim was shredded in front pieces of straw coming loose her hair was bunched up in the hat but some had come loose and it was red and curly curly red hair add a layer of grime to all of that and youve got the picture milo scribbled ever see her before no said barnes not on the walkway or kicking around the alleys in venice or in ocean front park or anywhere else you see the homeless maybe shes not one of the locals is there anything else you remember about the encounter it wasnt much of an encounter detective i opened the door she got scared i offered to get her some food she ran off milo scanned his notes youve got a great memory ms barnes you shouldve known me a few years ago the old woman tapped her forehead im accustomed to taking mental snapshots we artists view the world with a highfocus lens two rapid blinks if i hadnt chickened out of my cataract surgery id be doing a lot better let me ask you this maam could you draw me a picture of this woman im sure it would be better than anything our police artist would come up with barnes suppressed a surprised smile havent drawn in a while shifted to ceramics a few years ago but sure why not ill do it and call you appreciate it maam civic duty and art said barnes all in one swoop as i drove back to café moghul i said how seriously do you take it you dont coco barnes has cataracts so who knows what she really saw i still think the murder smacks of planning and intelligence someone well composed mentally but thats just a guess not science he frowned tracking this redhead down means getting hold of the patrol officers where the homeless hang out dealing with the social service agencies and the treatment centers and if barnes is right about the redhead not being local i cant limit myself to the westside one thing in your favor i said a sixfoot woman with curly red hair isnt inconspicuous assuming i find her then what what ive got is a probable psychotic who dumpsterdove in the alley five hours before julie got strangled he shook his head how seriously am i taking it not very a block later on the other hand what if i dont turn up anything else soon i cant afford not to chase it down i pulled up alongside the loading zone in front of the restaurant a parking ticket was folded under the windshield wiper of his unmarked he said want to meet everett kipper sure he eyed the citation you drive long as im renting i might as well occupy will the city reimburse me oh sure ill fedex you a box of infinite gratitude everett kipper worked at a firm called muniscope on the twentyfirst floor of a steelandconcrete highrise on avenue of the stars just south of little santa monica parking fees were stiff but milos badge impressed the attendant and i stashed the seville for free the buildings lobby was arenasized serviced by a dozen elevators we rode up in hermetic silence muniscopes reception room was ovoid paneled in bleached birdseye maple softly lit and carpeted and ringed by saffron leather modules milos badge elicited alarm from the hardfaced hardbodied receptionist then she recovered and compensated with toothy graciousness ill ring him right away gentlemen can i get you something to drink coffee tea sprite diet coke we demurred and sank down in yelloworange leather downfilled cushions no corners in the eggshaped space i felt like a privileged unborn chick nestled in highrent surroundings milo muttered cushy i said put the client at ease it works im ready to peck through the shell and buy something a man in a black suit appeared from around a convex wall detectives ev kipper julie kippers ex was a thin man with a big voice a blondgray crew cut and the smooth round face of an aging frat boy forty or so fiveeight onefifty his bouncy stride suggested gymnastics or ballet training the suit was a fourbutton model tailored snug set off by a sapphire blue shirt gold tie gold cuff links gold wristwatch his hands were manicured and smooth and outsized and when we shook i felt barely suppressed strength in his grip dry palms clear brown eyes that made eye contact a subtle bronze veneer to his complexion said outdoor sports or the tanning bed lets go in and talk he said confident baritone not a trace of anxiety if hed murdered his former spouse he was one hell of a psychopath he took us to an empty boardroom with a view all the way to vegas oystercolored carpeting and walls and a black granite conference table more than large enough for the thirty biedermeierrevival chairs that surrounded it the three of us huddled at one end sorry it took so long to get together said kipper what can i help you with milo said is there anything about your exwife we should know anything that would help us figure out who strangled her putting emphasis on wife and strangled and watching kippers face kipper said god no julie was a wonderful person youve maintained contact despite the divorce ten years ago life took us in other directions weve remained friends other directions professionally yes said kipper milo sat back are you remarried kipper smiled no still looking for ms right your exwife wasnt her julies world was art mine is slogging through bond prospectuses we started off in the same place but ended up too far apart did you study painting in rhode island sculpting kipper touched the face of his watch the timepiece was thin as a nickel with an exposed skeleton movement four diamonds placed equidistant around the rim crocodile band i tried to estimate how many paintings julie kipper would have had to sell to afford it sounds like youve been researching me detective your marriage came up while talking to people who knew her sir people seem to know about your artistic origins the light and space bunch said kipper sad crowd how so sir maximally selflabeling minimally talented selflabeling they call themselves artists said kipper new edge in his voice julie was the real thing theyre not but thats true of the art world in general there are no criteria its not like being a surgeon lots of pretense the brown eyes shifted down to his oversized hands square fingers glossy nails a welltended hand hard to imagine it working a chisel and the look in kippers eyes said he knew it that was my story you were pretending said milo for a while then i gave it up kipper smiled i sucked you were good enough to get into the rhode island school of design well what do you think of that said kipper another layer of silk had been peeled from his voice like i said there are no criteria what julie and i had in common was we both won awards in high school and college the only difference was she deserved hers i always felt like an impostor im not saying im a total boob i can do things with wood and stone and bronze the average person cant but thats a far cry from art i was smart enough to realize that and got into something that fits me milo glanced around the room any artistic satisfaction in this not a whit said kipper but i make a fortune and indulge my fantasies on sunday home studio most of the time my stuff never gets out of clay smashing it can be quite cathartic his face remained unlined but his color had deepened milo said how did your exwife feel about your switching careers that was years ago how can it be relevant said kipper at this point everything is sir please bear with me howd she feel she hated it tried to talk me out of it which tells you something about julie her integrity we were living like paupers in a hovel on the lower east side doing odd jobs julie tried to telemarket magazine subscriptions and i did janitorial duty in the building to make the rent the day i got into finance was the first time we could count on a stable income and not much of one at that i started off gofering for chump change at morgan stanley but even that was a step up now we could buy food but julie couldnt have cared less she kept yelling at me i was talented had sold out i dont think she ever forgave me not until she moved out here and looked me up and we reconnected at that point i think she could see that i was really happy you moved here first a year before julie after we divorced and she looked you up she called my office she was really down about failing to make it in new york about having to draw stupid newspaper ads she was also broke i helped her out on top of the alimony kipper exhaled no big deal like i said i do very well so give me the chronology said milo marriage divorce et cetera sum my life up in one sentence huh a few sentences sir kipper unbuttoned his suit jacket we met right after we got to rhode island instant chemistry within a week were living together after graduation we moved to new york and got married fourteen years ago four years later we got divorced after the divorce what was your contact with your exwife milod avoided using julies name in kippers presence emphasizing the severed relationship kipper said our contact was occasional phone calls even more occasional dinners friendly phone calls for the most part kippers finger massaged the watch face i see where this is going which is fine my buddies told me id be looked at as a suspect your buddies some of the other brokers they have experience with the criminal justice system kipper laughed not yet no they watch too much tv i suppose im wasting my time telling you i had nothing to do with it milo smiled kipper said do what you have to do but know this i loved julie first as a woman later as a person she was my friend and im the last one whod ever hurt her i have no reason to hurt her he slid his chair back several inches crossed his legs friendly phone calls about what said milo letting each other know what we were up to said kipper and i guess what youd term business calls too around tax time i needed to account the alimony and any other money i sent julie and sometimes she needed extra how much extra a bit here and there maybe another ten twenty grand a year twenty would be almost double her alimony julie wasnt good about money she tended to get into tight spots trouble living within her means kippers big hands lowered to the granite surface of the table and lay flat julie wasnt good with money because she didnt care about it so in total you were giving her nearly forty thousand a year generous i drive a ferrari said kipper i dont expect any merit badges his body shifted forward let me explain julies history to you right after graduation she had an initial burst of success got placed in a highquality group show at a midtown gallery and sold every single painting she got great critical notice too but guess what it didnt mean she made serious money her canvases were priced from eight to twelve hundred dollars and by the time the gallery owner and her agent and every other gimmetype took their cuts there was maybe enough to buy lunch at tavern on the green the gallery kicked her price up to fifteen hundred a picture and told her to get productive she spent the next six months working twentyfour hours a day or it seemed that way he winced tough regimen said milo more like selfdestruction she have help keeping up her energy what do you mean said kipper we know about her drug problem is that when it started cocaine can be an energizer coke said kipper she was into it way before that in college but yes it got intense when the gallery demanded she make instant art at an inhuman pace what pace was that a dozen canvases within four months a crapmonger could have splashed that together no problem but julie was meticulous ground her own pigments laid on layer after layer of paint alternated with her own special glazes and varnishes was so picky that she sometimes made her own brushes could spend weeks making brushes and frames each one had to be original perfect for the painting everything had to be perfect everything became a project of immense significance her current works have no frames i said i saw that said kipper asked her about it she said she was concentrating on the image itself i told her it was a good idea one hand closed in a fist julie was brilliant but i dont know if she would have ever achieved real success why not because she was too talented what passes for art now is pure shit videoinstallations performances crap put together with found materials which is artbullshit language for garbagepicking nowadays if you staple a dildo to a pop bottle youre michelangelo if you actually know how to draw youre disparaged add to that julies absolute lack of business sense and kippers shoulders sagged his black suit didnt pop a wrinkle not of this world i said exactly said kipper she wasnt keyed into her surroundings take the money thing for example i tried to get her to invest some of the alimony in lowrisk bond funds if shed started investing back when i did shed have built up a nice little nest egg could have plied her art in the way she wanted instead she had to lower herself by doing commercial gigs she didnt like commercial art she hated it said kipper but she refused to take the steps that wouldve freed her i wont say she was masochistic but julie definitely had a thing for suffering she was never really happy chronically depressed i said except when she was painting lets go back for a moment said milo thumbing through his pad the new york gallery that took her on the résumé on her brochure lists the anthony gallery thats the one bloodsucking lewis anthony not a nice man few of them are said kipper gallery owners owners agents collectors both of kippers big hands had balled the socalled art world were talking profoundly ungifted people people so far from personal talent they wouldnt recognize it if it chomped their gonads living off the fruit of the gifted leeches on the body artistic thats what julie and i called them talents a curse criminals get judged by their peers but not artists his smooth round face was deeply flushed milo said so lewis anthony pressured julie to produce and that kicked her coke problem up a notch kipper nodded she used coke and speed to keep herself working booze and tranqs to bring herself down unless i forced her to eat and sleep she didnt it was hellish i started staying away which was easy because i had my new career working my way up the corporate ladder and all that were you into drugs kipper hesitated i dabbled he said finally everyone did back then but i never got hooked im not an addictive personality that probably has something to do with the lack of talent not enough intensity up here touching his crew cut the old geniusinsanity link said milo let me tell you thats true show me a brilliant artist and ill show you one serious basket case and yes im including julie in that i loved her she was a terrific person but her resting state was turmoil milo tapped the pad tell me more about lewis anthony whats to tell the bastard pressured julie julie doped herself to the gills and produced three canvases anthony berated her sold all three remitted a pittance back to julie and told her he couldnt handle her unless she acquired a better work ethic she came home odd and ended up in rehab kippers fingers opened and clawed black granite ive always felt guilty about that not being there when she needed me when she came home with the check from anthony and i saw how puny it was i went nuts just lost it six months watching her selfdestruct she lost twenty pounds preparing for that show and all she had to show for it was two thousand bucks i told her she was the chump of all chumps and went out to have a beer when i came home i found her stretched out in bed and couldnt revive her i thought she was dead i called the paramedics and they took her to beth israel a few days later she was transferred to the psych ward at bellevue involuntary commitment i said for the first few days whatever the law was but she stayed there even after she couldve left told me it was better being in the nut ward than living with someone who didnt care what could i say id bailed on her bellevue cleaned her up and sent her home and i tried to reconnect with her it was like talking to a block of stone she couldnt work no spark and that freaked her out she started doping again we fought about it eventually i moved out i was the one who filed the divorce papers but julie didnt fight it didnt do a damn thing to protect herself financially i volunteered to give her half my income at the time as alimony which was a thousand bucks a month my attorney thought i was nuts kipper ran his hand through his crew cut as things got better for me i upped it two thousand a month said milo i know said kipper for a guy with a ferrari thats bullshit but julie refused to take any more i offered to rent her a nice house somewhere she could have a studio but she insisted on living in that dump the two of you stayed attached like i said we had dinner once in a while kipper hung his head sometimes we made love i know that sounds weird but sometimes chemistry reared its nasty little head maybe we were meant for each other wouldnt that be a laugh a laugh living in a weird limbo said kipper i didnt want to cut her out of my life why would i and now shes gone and youre wasting your time here sir hey said kipper youve got carte blanche come over to my house and tear up the fucking floorboards but once youre through with that would you do me a favor and get serious about nailing the motherfucker who really did it and if you do get him tell him hes a fucking savage who cut a chunk of beauty out of this fucking world shouting red as a beet the outsized hands whiteknuckled kipper exhaled and slumped milo said i have a few more questions yeah yeah whatever you attended the opening i attended and bought two paintings your exwife didnt mind that why would she being independent and all that said milo werent you worried shed view it as charity i wouldve been worried except that julie and i had discussed the paintings a while back id seen them at her place and told her i really wanted two she wanted to give them to me for free but i refused i said she should hang them at the show reddotted as a strategic move this is hot stuff come and get it how late did you stay at the opening until a half hour before closing which would be ninethirty forty whered you go after you left ah said kipper the alibi well i dont have one i got into my car and took a drive sepulveda to san vicente over to seventh and down into santa monica canyon i know the area because theres a gas station that sells octane hitest gas and a supplement that boosts it to theres one in pasadena too i thought of taking a beach drive decided i wanted more curves the ferrari loves curves turned around took sunset all the way to benedict canyon had myself a little spin hitest said milo how much do you pay for that right now its fourfifty a gallon milo whistled kipper said the ferrari thrives on it what model testarossa work of art said milo oh yeah said kipper highmaintenance like everything else in my life the grieving exhusband said milo as i drove away from century city drifting past the abc entertainment center angry exhusband big strong hands and a temper and once he starts talking about the art world he heats up leeches on the body artistic and julie remained in the body artistic he bothers you hes worth looking at i said smart powerful and hed been to the gallery even by his account his relationship with julie was convoluted a marriage full of upheaval offandon physical intimacy ten years after the divorce when intimates want to fake sexual assault they generally fail to go all the way pulling the panties down not off kipper claims he had to talk julie into taking money but who knows he could also be a very frustrated guy he used to have serious artistic aspirations letting go of dreams isnt always easy even with a ferrari to soothe the angst as he reminded us three times a ferrari that he pumps full of highoctane gas think about that he pays a hefty premium to beef up an already highpowered engine were talking an aggressive guy toss in a difficult exwife whom he continued to sleep with and money issues julie told the other artists the split was amicable how well did they know her did she tell anyone about her suicide attempts no he said she talked about being in rehab but didnt mention that so what julie reversed the terms and started hitting on kipper for big money maybe she got tired of the starvingartist bit stepped back and realized how well kipper was doing and decided to up her own lifestyle kipper couldve liked being generous when he was calling the shots julies getting assertive wouldve been something else completely there was a good reason for julie to take stock she was entering middle age and even her second try at art fame hadnt made headlines i know she sold paintings but light and space isnt a new york gallery and the prices of her canvases havent gone up much since she started out in fact in twentyyearold dollars theyve dropped so perhaps reality finally sank in making it solely as a painter was going to be a struggle and she was tired of scratching by kipper alluded to her living in a dump how bad was it by his standards a dump by mine basic twobedroom apartment in santa monica the east end off pico the living room was her studio despite being an artist she wasnt much for interior decorating thats the tough part of santa monica i said gangs drug traffic thinking about robins place on rennie tim plachette was a nice man a mild man always courteous to me would he be of any use if things got tough milo was saying ill talk to the neighbors again take a closer look at hubbie see what you can learn about his financial situation sometimes investment pros get overconfident and reckless with their funds if kipper leveraged heavily on a deal and lost some big bucks ditching his obligation to julie might be tempting strong hands he said hes a little guy but still bigger than julie hed be tough enough to overpower her in that bathroom maybe he didnt have to overpower her she trusted him that wouldve added to the element of surprise trusted him to what he told us they were still having sex a tryst in that scuzzy place ive heard of stranger things i said so have i but i think your minds gotten eviler than mine i made a uturn and headed back to santa monica boulevard when julies uncle asked you to take the case did you talk to him about her sure was he aware of her background to him she was just the sweet talented niece whod gone off to new york far as her familys concerned she was rembrandt nice to be appreciated yeah a moment later he said strong hands whoever strangled julie didnt rely on their hands they used a wire good way to keep the hands clean i said in addition to using gloves reduces the risk of leaving trace evidence clean hands in a manner of speaking i dropped him off drove home and booted up the computer half a dozen search engines pulled up very little on either everett or julie kipper three hits for him talks hed given at privateclient seminars run by muniscope the identical topic each time for highincome individuals buying taxfree bonds going for premiums rather than discount could actually save money in the long run julies name came up only once six months ago one of her early paintings had been sold at a sothebys arcade auction eighteen hundred dollars for a tenyearold oiloncanvas entitled marie at her kitchen table no accompanying photo the sale had brokered lowticket items few of them illustrated the provenance of the painting told me little i couldnt have guessed from the lewis anthony gallery ny to a private collector i looked up anthony fifty references hed died five years ago but the gallery was still in business i thought about the pathway julie kippers life had taken putting herself through a drugstoked work jag to meet the demands of the gallery owner three paintings and now one of them had been dumped by its owner for less than it had cost demoralizing if shed known my bet was that she had somehow someone wouldve told her yet shed decided to chance a comeback perhaps the sale had spurred the comeback had she created what she believed to be her best work hoping for a second chance with another highpowered gallery only to settle for light and space low output meant no resale market low demand for her work eliminated one possible motive for murder someone trying to up the value of an investment because dead artists often fetch higher prices than live ones that only applied to artists who mattered as far as the art world was concerned juliet kipper had never existed and her death wouldnt elicit a blink no this one had nothing to do with commercial intrigue this one was personal a bright killer forwardthinking and outwardly composed but inside rage tempered to something cold and measured when hed first called me milo had called it a weird one but the killer wouldnt see it that way to him twisting a wire around juliet kippers neck would seem eminently reasonable i had a beer thought some more about julies luminous paintings and snuffedout talent and got on the phone the lewis anthony gallery was listed on fiftyseventh street in new york the woman who answered the phone enunciated the way clippers snip through cuticles mr anthony passed several years ago her tone implied knowing such should be a prerequisite for american citizenship perhaps you can help me im looking for works by juliet kipper who juliet kipper the painter she was represented by the gallery several years ago how many is several ten she snorted thats an eon never heard of her good day i sat there wondering what it would be like dealing with that kind of thing fulltime growing up with a head full of beauty and the gift of interpretation being told how brilliant you were by the people who loved you getting hooked on the oohs and ahs only to enter what passed for the real world and learn that love didnt mean a damn thing julie kipper had faced a frigid universe that regarded the gifted as fodder the kindness of strangers indeed despite all that shed reached deep within herself again and produced works of transcendent beauty only to be garroted and laid out and posed in a filthy bathroom finding the person whod done that suddenly seemed very important it wasnt until hours later after finishing and mailing reports paying some bills making a run to the bank to deposit checks from lawyers that something else hit me about julie a gifted damaged soul snuffed out violently during the first blush of comeback the same could be said about baby boy lee i compared the two cases both had been saturday night backalley killings five weeks had lapsed between them neither milo nor petra nor anyone else had seen any link because there were no striking similarities and as i checked off the differences a nicesized list materialized on my scratch pad male vs female victim late forties vs midthirties single vs divorced stabbing vs strangulation outdoor vs indoor crime scenes musician vs painter i decided i was being overly analytic no sense calling milo i went for a fortyminute run that challenged my heart and lungs but did little to clear my head got back on the computer and searched for murders of creative types within the last ten years despite setting that arbitrary limit a lot of extraneous material cropped up scads of dead rock stars mostly almost every demise selfinflicted the west hollywood stabbing death of sal mineo too that had gone down in well before the onedecade cutoff mineos murder long a subject of filmbiz intrigue and believed to be related to his homosexuality had turned out to be a street burglary gone really bad the actor had been in the wrong place at the wrong time maybe thats how baby boy and julie would shake out i kept searching and refining ended up hours later with four possibles six years ago a potter named named valerie brusco had been bludgeoned in an empty field behind her studio in eugene oregon i found no direct reporting of the crime but bruscos name came up in a retrospective of pacific northwest ceramic artists written by a reed college professor in which her violent end was noted this one had been solved bruscos boyfriend a cab driver named tom blascovitch had been arrested and charged and incarcerated but murderers get out of prison so i printed the data the second case was the stabbing death of a saxophonist named wilfred reedy outside a washington boulevard jazz club four and a half years ago documented in the obituary column of a musician unions magazine the obit lauded reedys gentle nature and improvisational skills and noted that in lieu of flowers contributions to the widow could be made care of the union reedy sixtysix had been a friend of john coltrane and played with many of the greats miles davis red norvo tal farlow milt jackson i logged into the la times archives and found a backpage squib on the crime and a single followup paragraph one week later no leads or arrests anyone with information to call southwest division homicide number three was the threeyearold stabbing of a twentyfiveyearold ballet dancer named angelique bernet in cambridge massachusetts bernet had been part of a touring new york company performing in boston and shed left her hotel around am friday evening and never returned two days later her body was found behind an apartment on mt auburn avenue not far from the harvard campus crossreferences to the boston herald and the globe pulled up brief accounts of the crime but no arrests something else the globe reported caught my eye bernet had recently been promoted to standin for the prima ballerina and had in fact performed her first solo the night of her disappearance the final hit took place thirteen months later another hollywood murder during an allnight recording session a punkrock vocalist named china maranga had unleashed a drunken tirade at her backup band over what she viewed as lackluster playing stomped out of the studio and vanished two months later her skeletal remains were discovered by hikers not far from the hollywood sign barely concealed by brush id had been made using dental records a broken neck and the absence of bullet holes or stab wounds suggested cause of death as strangulation but that was about all the coroner could come up with china marangas teeth had been easy to identify as a youngster shed undergone extensive orthodontic work her birth name was jennifer stilton and shed grown up in a big house in palos verdes the daughter of a grocerychain executive and an interior decorator shed earned good grades in prep school where a sweet soprano earned her a starring role in the glee club admitted to stanford she majored in english lit got hooked on alternative music and whiskey and cocaine amassed a collection of tattoos and piercings and assembled a band of likeminded sophomores who joined her in dropping out for the next several years she and china whiteboy toured the country playing small clubs and garnering cult status but failing to get a record contract during that period china morphed her sweet soprano to a ragged atonal scream a tour in germany and holland garnered larger audiences and brought about a deal with an alternative label back in la sales of china whiteboys two albums were surprisingly brisk the band began attracting attention from peoplewithclout rumors of a deal with a major label were rife chinas murder ended all that china could barely play guitar but she wielded one as a prop a battered old vox teardrop that she treated rough i knew that because two members of the band a pair of slouching inarticulate wraiths named squirt and brancusi were serious about their gear and when they needed repairs they came to robin when china snapped the voxs neck during one of her more ebullient stage tantrums the boys passed along robins number i remembered the day china dropped by a particularly unpleasant july afternoon strangled by west coast pollution and east coast humidity robin was working in back and i was in my office when the doorbell rang eight times in a row i padded to the front and opened the door on a pallid curvaceous woman with spiked hair as black and shiny as la brea tar she hefted a guitar in a soft canvas gig bag and looked at me as if i was the intruder parked below the terrace was a big dusty buick the color of ballpark mustard she said who the hell are you and am i as lost as i feel where do you want to be in paradise feasting on boy virgins is this the guitar ladys place or not she tapped her foot rolled her shoulders her left eye ticced her features were unremarkable but mightve been pleasant if shed relaxed some of the pallor came from ashy pancake makeup laid on thick and set off by kohldarkened lids the rest implied unhealthy habits black ink tats snaky abstract images covered what i could see of her left arm a blueandblack iron cross marked the right side of her face where the jawline met the earlobe both ears sagged under an assortment of rings and plugs all that and the eyebrow pierces and the nose studs said notice me her blue pinpoint oxford buttondown shirt implied a forage in daddys ivy league closet the shirt was tucked into a plaid miniskirt the kind parochial school girls are compelled to wear topped off by white knee socks stuffed into high laced combat boots the outfit said dont even try to figure it out the guitar ladys out back i said where out back im not prancing around without knowing this place freaks me out why there could be coyotes or some other shit coyotes come out at night so do i cmon man my eyes hurt show me i walked her down the terrace steps around to the side of the house and through the garden she had very little stamina and was breathing hard by the time we reached the pond as we approached the water she overtook me and raced ahead swinging the gig bag stopped and stared at the koi big fish she said all you can eat sushi orgy be an expensive meal i said a grin turned her crooked mouth straight hey mr yuppie no need to reach for the xanax im not gonna steal your little babies im a voodgetarian she eyed the landscaping licked her lips all this yummy yuppie greenery so where is she i pointed to the studio she said okay dollarboy you did your good deed for the day go back to the stock pages and turned her back on me hours later when robin came into the house alone i said charming clientele youve got oh her she said thats china maranga she shrieks in a band which one china whiteboy squirt and brancusi i said remembering two skinny guys with cheap electrics theyre the ones ratted me out to her were going to have a little chat she stretched and went into the bedroom to change i poured myself a chivas and brought her a glass of wine thanks i can use that we sat on the bed and drank i said does the young lady shriek well shes got great range from nails on chalkboard to nails on chalkboard even harder she doesnt play just swings her guitar around like she wants to hurt someone last night she assaulted a mike stand and the neck broke off i kept telling her it wasnt worth fixing but she began crying literally real tears stomping her feet like a spoiled little kid i shouldve sent her to talk to you outside my expertise she put down her glass and ran her fingers through my hair im charging her my max fee to bolt on one of those fender necks i got at the bulk sale and taking my time about it next week shell have something even uglier to ruin and shed better pay cash now enough of this chitchat and lets get down to business what business is that something well within the range of your expertise when china came by to pick up the guitar a week later i was in the studio having coffee with robin this time she wore a greasy motorcycle jacket over a long lace dress once white now soupbone beige pink satin highheeled pumps a black tam o shanter capped the black spikes robin fetched the hybridized vox here you go china held the instrument at arms length ugleee im supposed to pay you for this thats the routine china stared at her shifted her glare to me then back to robin reaching into a pocket of the leather jacket she pulled out a crumpled mass of bills and dropped them on the workbench robin counted the money this is forty dollars too much china marched to the door stopped flipped us off buy yourself a fucking fish her murder had elicited a headshake and a how sad from robin china differed from baby boy and julie kipper in that shed lacked substantial talent but there was the matter of a rising star snuffed out midascent i wondered if robin had made any connection years later between the killings two clients of hers one beloved the other quite the opposite if she had she hadnt let me know why would she juliet kippers house was one of two ugly gray boxes squeezed onto a skimpy lot no backyard the front was an oily mesa of concrete curling tarpaper roofs provided the only green in sight bars on the windows a rusted iron fence blocked entry to the property yellow tape across the rear unit billowed in the ocean breeze i got out the fence was locked no doorbell or call box in sight a shavedhead kid of sixteen or so sauntered down the street walking a rednosed pit bull leashed to a pinch collar both owner and dog ignored me but the two older shavedhead guys who drove by a few moments later in a choppedandlowered chevy nova slowed and looked me over no reason for me to be there i returned to the car took pico to lincoln drove south to rose street in venice where i crossed over to the good side robins place was a white cottage shakeroofed and gabled way too cute by half pretty flowers in front hadnt been there months ago id never known robin to garden maybe tim had a green thumb his volvo was parked in the driveway behind robins ford truck i considered leaving to hell with that i said out loud paternal rights and all that i was hoping shed answer the door but he did alex tim tight smiles all around cursory handshake he had on his usual outfit longsleeved plaid shirt khaki dockers brown moccasins mr laid back rimless eyeglasses gave his blue eyes true blue deeper than my graytinged irises a dreamy look hes a year younger than me but i like to think he looks older because hes losing his hair the strands that remain are fine and caramelcolored and too long obvious overcompensation theres gray in his beard soulful those eyes then theres the voice the smoothest most sonorous basso profundo youll ever hear every word rounded and plummy and cadenced walking advertisement for his craft hes a vocal coach one of the best works with opera singers and rock stars and highpriced public speakers travels around a lot robin met him at a recording session a month after we separated hed been called in to help a diva whose larynx had frozen up and he and robin had started talking she was there on an emergency call too several instruments knocked off kilter in transit i thought of the kind of emergencies the two of them faced the two of them lived in a different world from mine from what id seen tim was easygoing patient rarely spoke unless he was spoken to divorced from another vocal coach he had a twentyyearold daughter studying at juilliard who adored him a week after robin met him she called me up once we got past the hemming and hawing i realized she was asking my permission i told her she didnt need it wished her the best hung up then i sank low within a month she and tim were living together so he said the voice making it sound profound maybe he was born with those pipes but it set my teeth on edge hows it going tim well with you ditto he leaned against the doorjamb im on my way out actually on the road again indeed the road to burbank sounds like a hope and crosby movie have fun he didnt budge youre here to see spike im sorry he said hes at the vet having his teeth cleaned ah theres also something i need to talk to robin about no movement for a second then he stepped aside i walked past him through the small dim living room furnished with his solid oak furniture and the few things robin had taken with her an old closet in the hallway had been turned into a passageway between the units through the door i could hear the roar of a table saw alex i stopped and turned tim remained in the doorway please dont upset her i wasnt intending to i know look ill be frank with you the last time she spoke to you she was really upset the last time she spoke to me was volitional she dropped in on me he showed me his palms in a pacific gesture i know that alex she wanted to talk to you about baby boy lee i thank you for what listening to her yet you think i upset her no look im sorry i shouldnt have said anything its just that i waited he said forget it and turned to leave i said did you know baby boy the sudden change of topic made him flinch i knew of him ever work with him never what about china maranga that name i dont know she was a singer i said more of a screamer actually which is why i figured she mightve consulted you the screamers seldom do why are you asking about her shes dead murdered like baby boy thats what youre here for alex i really dont think robin should be exposed to any more ill keep that in mind i continued toward the connecting door fine he called after me youre toughminded i concede now how about thinking of robin this time this time dangling the bait i swam by i stepped into the heat of machinery and the smell of hardwood the floor was coated with sawdust several projects guitars and mandolins in various stages of completion hung on the wall robins back was to me as she guided a block of rosewood through the whirring blade her hair was gathered under one of those bandanas she collects she wore goggles a dust mask had on a tight white tank top loose black cotton yoga pants white tennis shoes the dark wood hissed and threw off what looked like chocolate chips startling her would be dangerous so i stood there and watched and waited until shed flipped the switch and stepped away from the saw and the roar died to a growl hi i said she flipped around stared at me through the goggles pulled down the mask laid the trimmed piece of rosewood on the bench hi she wiped her hands on a rag just saw tim on the way out hes worried im going to upset you are you maybe flipping the mask over her back she said cmon im thirsty i followed her into the tiny old kitchen at the rear of the duplex old white appliances yellow tiles several of them mended the room was onethird the size of the spiffy new kitchen wed designed together but as in that room all was spotless everything in its place she got a pitcher of iced tea and poured two glasses and brought them to the formica table that barely fit the room space for two chairs only guess they didnt entertain much probably busy entertaining each other cheers she said looking anything but cheerful we drank tea she glanced at her watch i said if youre busy no im tired been at it since six ready for my nap in the old days id have suggested a mutual nap ill go i said no whats on your mind alex china maranga what about her i was thinking i said she and baby boy there could be similarities china in what way i told her added the bare facts of juliet kippers murder she got pale i guess but really there are so many differences youre probably right i said you could say chinas career was taking off she said her records were selling better than anyone expected but still alex i hope youre wrong that would be hideous murdering art murdering artists because theyre on the way up her color hadnt returned here i go again i said bringing the bad stuff into your life i stood i was wrong tim was right about what the last time you saw me you were upset i should know better she frowned tim tries to protect me i was upset but not by anything you did what then everything the state of the world all this change i know we did the right thing but then baby boy one day im talking to him the next day he no longer exists at the time i guess i was especially vulnerable im better now talking to you helped till now even now she took hold of my wrist you were there for me for a change she let go and shook her head with all our history you still need to fish for compliments the spot where shed touched me itched sit down she said please have more tea we can be civilized i took a seat baby boy was my friend she said i had no relationship with china my only contact with her was that one job and she wasnt happy with it remember how she flipped me off flipped us off i said i think it was me she didnt care for she kept calling me mr yuppie she was obnoxious theres something she didnt have in common with baby he was the sweetest guy in the world another difference is that he had real talent and her body was buried no i dont see it alex my bet is she allowed herself to get picked up by the wrong person maybe shot off her mouth and paid for it makes sense i said she left the session angry what about her band any of them ever display aggressive tendencies those guys she said hardly they were like china college kids playing naughty and why would they kill china when she died so did the band what does milo think i havent asked him yet you came here first youre a lot betterlooking i guess that would depend on who you ask no i said even rick would say youre cuter i got up again thanks and sorry if i upset your biorhythm have a good nap i began walking toward the front of the house theyre hard arent they she called after me what changes in biorhythm tims wonderful to me but sometimes i still find myself starting to say something to you are you okay im fine shes treating you well yes hows spike too bad hes not here she said periodontal work ouch theyre keeping him overnight you can visit call to make sure someones here thanks okay she said standing let me walk you out not necessary not necessary but polite mama raised me right she accompanied me to the curb ill think more about china ask around if i come up with anything ill let you know big grin hey look at me girl detective dont even think about it i said she took my hand in both of hers alex what i said before is true you didnt upset me not then and not now big tough girl she looked up at me and smiled im still pretty small once upon a time you took up a big corner of my heart not to me i said you could always do that she said make me feel important im not sure i did that for you of course you did i said shes wonderful what the hell happened allisons wonderful i dropped her hand got into the car started up the engine and turned to give her a wave shed already gone inside a partner the last thing petra needed not that she had any choice halfway through her shift schoelkopf had summoned her into his office and dangled a scrap of paper in her face transfer slip from where she said the army hes new to the department but hes got serious experience as a military investigator so dont treat him like an idiot rookie captain ive been doing fine solo well gee thats great connor im so glad the jobs giving you intrinsic satisfaction here you go waving the paper petra took it but didnt read it schoelkopf said go hes due over in a couple of hours find him a desk and make him feel at home should i bake him cookies sir the captains big black mustache spread as he flashed toowhite caps last summer hed been gone for three weeks and had come back with a scary tan and new dentition and what looked like more hair in front he said if thats where your girlish talents lie detective go ahead my personal preference is oatmeal crunch he waved petra away when she reached his door he said that armenian thing squared away seems to be seems to be its all set with the da whats on your plate now the nunes stabbing which ones that manuel nunes the bricklayer who troweled his wife yeah yeah the bloody mortar you on top of it its not a whodunit said petra when the blues showed up nunes was holding the trowel im dotting the ts and crossing the is she resisted the temptation to cross her own eyes and give the bastard a goofy look well dot and cross everything speaking of whodunits you ever accomplish anything on that musician the fat boy lee no sir youre telling me its icecold afraid so what said schoelkopf some nutcase just walked up and gutted him i can bring you the file nah said schoelkopf so you got stuck guess what its good for you once in a while gain a little humility more caps lucky for you he wasnt a bigtime celebrity small potatoes like that it goes cold no one gives a shit what about his family anyone squawking at you he didnt have much family lucky for you again schoelkopfs big smile was polluted by anger the two of them had gotten off to a bad start and no matter what petra did she knew it would never improve youre a pretty lucky galscuse me lucky woman arent you i do my best sure you do said schoelkopf okay thats all show gi joe the ropes maybe hell turn out to be a lucky guy too she returned to the detectives room calmed herself down glanced at the scrap expecting a capsule background on her new partner but all schoelkopf had scrawled on the form was a name eric stahl eric cutesounding a military guy petra got herself a hot chocolate from the vending machine downstairs and climbed back up with her imagination in high gear picturing eric as buff and cut a clint eastwoody type maybe one of those precision military buzz dos an outdoor dude who surfed and biked skydove bungeejumped did all those adrenalized things a highenergy partner was fine with her he could do the driving he showed up twenty minutes later shed been right about the haircut but nothing else eric stahl was thirty or so fiveten tops painfully thin stoopshouldered and ganglylimbed the buzz was medium brown prickly hairs riding the narrow brooding face of a starving poet lord this white boy was white a toomanyhoursinthelibrary complexion except for incongruous coins of pink on his cheeks fever spots sunken cheeks daggerpoint chin lipless mouth the deepestset eyes petra had ever seen as if someone had poked them with two fingers and pushed them back into his skull same matte brown as the hair static he said detective connor eric stahl without extending a hand or moving just stood by her desk wearing a black suit white shirt and gray tie petra said hi why dont you sit down indicating a chair at the side of her desk stahl considered the offer finally accepted his black suit seemed to compound her own outfit an ebony vestimenta pantsuit shed bought at the barneys hanger sale two seasons ago funereal the two of them looked like the welcoming committee at forest lawn stahl didnt bat a lash high energy indeed that face grow out the buzz cut and dress him in leather pants and a bunch of other punky whatnot and hed fit right in with any of the dissolute hustlers you saw staggering down the boulevard keith richards younger brother keith himself at the worst of his junkie days she said so what can i do for you eric cue me in about anything you think is important up close stahls skin was chalky no inflection in the guys voice only a throbbing vein at his left temple hinted at ongoing body function you can use that desk she said and thats your locker stahl didnt move he hadnt brought anything with him how about said petra we drive around and i show you the neighborhood stahl waited for her to stand before he did as they walked down the stairs he lingered behind her creepy schoelkopf had partnered her with a creepy robot they cruised down the dark boulevard hollywood at am was dotted meagerly with nightcrawlers and shadowlurkers petra pointed out drug bars illegal clubs hangouts of known felons taco joints where transvestite hookers congregated if stahl had an impression he wasnt letting on different from the army she said no answer how long were you in the military seven years where were you stationed stahl thumbed his chin and grew contemplative it wasnt a trick question all over he finally said all over domestic or all over foreign both what said petra smiling were you some topsecret op if you tell me you have to kill me she glanced at stahl as she continued to drive expecting at least minimal levity nothing stahl said overseas was the middle east where in the middle east saudi arabia bahrain djibouti dubai the emirates said petra nod fun said petra fivesecond digital delay not much they hate americans you couldnt bring a bible in or anything else that showed you were christian aha a bornagain youre religious no stahl turned away from her stared out the window were you involved in the cole bombing she said stuff like that nothing like that nothing like that petra echoed stahl said i think that car over there is stolen indicating a white mustang two lengths ahead of them petra saw nothing fishy about the plates or the way the driver was handling the vehicle do you said petra stahl picked up the radio and phoned a cruiser totally comfortable with the equipment and the lapd codes as if hed been working the division for years petras jaw hurt from conversational strain they rode around for another half hour in dead silence and when petra pulled into the parking lot eric stahl said anything i should do before tomorrow show up she said making no attempt to hide her irritation i will said stahl and he left the lot on foot disappeared into darkness what he took the bus or he doesnt want me to see what kind of car he drives later before she locked up her desk petra called auto theft and found out the white mustang had been stolen after leaving robins house i went home and got back on the computer tried to track down china marangas band mates the guitarist who called himself squirt was nowhere to be found in cyberspace but the drummer selftitled mr sludge and the bass player brancusi were easy to locate a year ago sludge née christian bangsley had been condemned on the page of shame web site of a music zine called misterlittle hot flash exchinawhiteboy sells out peddles junkslop ends up cappig cancerous bigtiiime during the three years since chinas murder bangsley had made significant lifestyle changes moving to sacramento investing a small inheritance and ending up the coowner of a small chain of familystyle restaurants called hearth and home the zine noted bangsleys plans to fester and postulate this tumor of phonyfuck normanrockwellism into a malignant metastasizingfranchise sludge dludes sic himself that hes cleeeen now but hes sludgier than ever along with the tirade misterlittle ran beforeandafter photos and the contrast was so remarkable that i questioned the truth of the story during his band days sludge had been a scrawny angryeyed nightcrawler christian bangsley was well fed and beatlemopped in a white shirt and tie these eyes sparkled with contentment i found brancusi on his personal web site his real name shockingly was paul brancusi local he worked as an animator for haynesbernardo a burbank studio one of the major players in kids tv brancusis bio listed two years as an art major at stanford an equal amount of time spent as a member of china whiteboy then another year at calarts where hed picked up skills in computer graphics and animation he worked on a morning show called the lumpkins described as edgy but kindly imaginary creatures live in a suburb that evokes some of the humor nostalgia and ribtickling situations of a human neighborhood but in lumpkinville imagination and fantasy reign supreme home and hearths sacramento corporate headquarters was listed i called and asked to speak to christian bangsley the receptionist was cheerful nourished by familystyle food mr bangsleys in a meeting may i help you im calling about an old friend of mr bangsley china maranga could you spell that please i did she said and what shall i tell mr bangsley this is about a few years ago mr bangsley played with ms maranga in a band china whiteboy oh that shes dead right yes so what message should i give mr bangsley i rattled off my la police consultantship and told her i wanted to ask bangsley a few questions ill be sure to tell him i reached paul brancusi at his desk he said all this time and finally somethings being done you dont feel enough was done at the beginning the cops never found out who did it right the thing that bothered me was that they didnt even want to talk to us even though we were close to china closer than anyone excepting maybe her father not her mother her mothers dead he said died a year before china her dads dead too you dont know much about it do you just starting out how about filling me in i can drop by your office anytime today let me get this straight youre what a shrink i gave him a longer explanation than the one id offered the hearth and home receptionist why now he said chinas death might be related to another murder really he said stretching the word so now she matters and i should talk to you because because i am interested in talking to you what a thrill just a brief talk mr brancusi when you name it in an hour he said ill be in front of the hb building im wearing a red shirt haynesbernardo productions occupied a massive freeform pinkbrickandbluetile structure on the east side of cahuenga boulevard just before universal studios where hollywood gives way to the valley the building had no corners no symmetry of any kind just curves and swoops and parabolic adventurism set off by oddshaped windows placed randomly a cartoonists vision coco palms flanked a trapezoidal entry door the color of grape jelly and a hundred feet of brick planter filled with struggling begonias ran along the front facade a man in an oversized red flannel shirt baggy blue jeans and grubby sneakers sat on the planter ledge sucking on a cigarette as i approached him he said you made good time without looking up motivation i said he studied me and i returned the favor paul brancusi had changed less than christian bangsley still scrawny and sallow he wore his hair long and uncombed had tinted the natural dishwater color bronze his cigarette adhered to a chapped lower lip a crusted cold sore was wedged below a hook nose blueblack iron cross tattoo on his right hand stainlesssteel stud in his left lobe at least half a dozen healedover pierces revealed themselves as tiny black dots on his nose brow and chin someone whod never seen what he used to look like might have taken them for large pores john lennon eyeglasses gave his eyes a faraway look even as he checked me out he pulled out a pack of rothman filters and offered it to me no thanks i sat down next to him who else got murdered he said sorry cant give out details but you want me to talk to you you want chinas murder to be solved what i want and whats going to happen dont often coincide he said the faraway eyes had grown dour his back rounded as if under a terrible weight he had a look and a sound that i recognized years of accrued disappointment i thought of him hunched at his drawing table bringing the lumpkins to life edgy but kindly ribtickling situations brancusi fished out a cigarette and chainlit his cheeks hollowed as he devoured the smoke what do you want to know first of all do you have any theories about who killed china sure he said someone she pissed off which is about ten million people challenged in the charm department china was a fourplus bitch and guess what youre the first coptype to ever ask me about her personality whats with those guys retarded what did they ask joe dragnet stuff the facts just the facts what time did she leave the studio what did she do the last few days before who was she doping with who was she fucking no attempt to really get into who she was smoke exited his nostrils and dissipated quickly in the smoggy air it was obvious they despised us and her were blaming the whole lifestyle thing do you think the lifestyle had anything to do with chinas death who knows listen i really dont see the point of this bear with me i said i need to get some context such as such as from what i can tell things were looking up for the band there was talk of a deal with a major label that true brancusi sat up straighter energized by nostalgia more than talk we had a decent shot had just done a showcase at madame boo where some of the better a r guys were in the audience we were great that night really rocked next day we were called for an interview with mickey gittleson any idea who he was i shook my head bigtime manager bigtime clients he rattled off a list of bands some of which i recognized he was hot to represent china whiteboy if hed have gotten behind us things wouldve popped you said he was dead said brancusi last year lung cancer idiot smoked too much he flicked ashes and cackled what happened with gittleson china broke the first appointment pulled an absolute fit said gittleson represented everything evil about the music biz and she wasnt going to sell out which was funny because during the showcase it was she whod freaked out when she saw gittleson sitting there told us backstage that the guy was mr it during the next act she went over to his table chatted him up just about gave him a lap dance couldnt have hurt the guy was a horny old goat liked to fuck the talent china flirting i said trying to picture that brancusi laughed china was incapable of anything as light and airy as femme flirtation but she could put on the sexy act when she wanted method acting what do you mean was it real or was she faking it how sexually active was she she was plenty active said brancusi all with girls she was into girls he stared at cahuenga traffic seemed to be losing interest i said so she was the one who got gittleson involved but then she changed her mind typical china moody i said he flicked the cigarette onto the sidewalk it lay there smoldering i said you said the first appointment gittleson didnt cut you off after the first cancellation he was cool about it we were a hot prospect so he rescheduled but a month later he was traveling to europe arranged to meet us after he got back suggested we lay down some fresh tracks thats the reason we were in the studio trying to burn a cd sampler that would really knock gittlesons argyles off and we were doing it hauling china had changed her mind now gittleson was cool she was on she was motivated thats the thing about her even when she was high she was able to focus bigtime high is there any other kind so what happened the sessions going great china starts freaking out over something maybe something someone said the sound system when she was like that it couldve been the way the drapes were hanging she pulls a fit walks out on us disappears not a word where she was going nope just fuckyous all around we figured shed be back the way she always was tantrums were a way of life for her he pulled out another cigarette and ignited it with a donald duck lighter the opposition he said brandishing the lighter before snapping it shut i said what happened to the sides you cut that night theyre worthless i tried to peddle them but without china to tour no one not gittleson or any of the others wanted to know us a few months later we were ancient history another cackle serious pathos huh i coulda been a contender like that swedish ship the wasa ever hear of it i shook my head i was in sweden last year doing some business theyre maybe going to franchise the lumpkins over there so this swedish animator is taking me around stockholm weird city all these big blond zombies lurching around looking like they havent slept in years cause of the light thing theyve got summertime it never gets dark winter its dark all the time this was summer we get out of a club at midnight and its still broad daylight anyway the next day this guy takes me to this ship the wasa big old wooden viking warrior ship built hundreds of years ago huge the swedes loaded it with cannons for this war they were fighting with the danes problem is they overloaded it with cannons so when they launched it the sucker sank right in the north sea they salvaged it forty years ago pulled it up intact and built a museum around it you can climb in and pretend youre leif ericson get drunk and eat herring whatever anyway this guy whos taking me around after we leave the museum he turns to me with tears in his eyes this incredible wistfulness and says paul my friend if the wasa hadnt sunk sweden would be a world power three rapid drags on the fresh smoke he held his breath closed his eyes broke out into a ragged coughing fit seemed comforted by the spasm were the musical wasa if china hadnt been murdered we wouldve been aerosmith hahaha what else can you tell me about china she couldve used you mentally unstable we all were im on lithium and antidepressants for bipolar four screwedup personalities and then we augmented it with endless dope ribtickling situations i said christian bangsley too mr corporate especially chris he was more thrashed than the rest of us had a very rich family and no moral fiber as opposed to us who merely had weak moral fiber he sold out he didnt sell out said brancusi thats an asinine concept whats the difference how you make your way through life playing music or being a cpa or building warehouses or whatever its all one gray death march chris shifted gears thats all wheres squirt dead he said as if that made perfect sense went over to europe and odd on heroin some park in switzerland living like a bum it took weeks before they identified him youre not surprised squirt was riding the needle pretty hard before china got killed afterward he just started shoveling the stuff in traumatized by chinas death probably he was the most intense not counting china apart from chinas general abrasiveness was there anyone she had a runin with during the week or so before her murder not that i know about but it wouldnt surprise me she was just instinctually unpleasant would get into this greta garbo modei vant to be alone and fuck you for trying to relate to me what about a stalker he threw up his hands i dont think you get it we werent stars no one cared thats what really got to china for all her talk about alienation all that hermit posturing she was a palos verdes princess whod gotten tons of attention as a kid and still craved it thats why it was monumentally stupid for her to blow off gittleson ms schizo one minute shed be seething because the band wasnt getting the respect it deserved the next shed be cussing out anyone who actually wanted to focus on the band like journalists she went out of her way to alienate them called them butthole lickers imposed a strict nointerview policy out came the pack of rothmans another chain light ill give you an example there was this zine dinky little rag that wanted to do a story on us china told him to fuck himself they did the piece anyway without talking to us so what does china do she phones the editor and gives it to him he shook his head i was there listening to her end your mother fucks scabrous nazi dicks and drinks hitlers cum granted shed told them no but what was the logic behind that remember the name of the zine i said you think some journalist type murdered china because she talked mean to him give me a break im sure youre right i said but if the editor was a fan maybe hes got some ideas whatever he said youve obviously got plenty of spare time groove somethinggrooverut or grooverat he sent us a copy and we chucked it cheap little desktop deal probably out of business by now what was the gist of the article we were geniuses did you keep a clipping oh sure he said along with my grammys and my platinum records he shot to his feet smoked and coughed and walked hunchshouldered to the grapejelly door shoved it hard and went back to work i drove to a magazine stand on selma avenue off hollywood boulevard and looked for grooverat fifty feet of stand containing plenty of alternative publications and newspapers in two dozen languages but no sign of the zine i asked the turbaned sikh proprietor and he said hed never heard of it but i might have some luck at the comics storepiercing parlor three blocks up the boulevard i cruised by the shop found a closed sign barely visible behind an accordiongrated front and returned home wondering if paul brancusis comment about too much leisure time had been on target the more i thought about it the weaker the links between the cases seemed i considered the three other murders id found websurfing the only other la killing was the old saxophonist wilfred reedy and thered been no suggestion hed been on the verge of a comeback or careerclimb the killer of valerie brusco the oregon potter had been caught and jailed and angelique bernet the ballet dancer a young woman who had been offered a potential career boost had died three thousand miles away in massachusetts subtotal zero still no reason to bother milo he had his hands full investigating everett kipper by my own reckoning the best bet for julies murderer the dinner hour was approaching but i had no appetite another human voice would be palliative but allison was working at the hospice tonight i might do well by following her example do some gutwrenching clinical work that drew me miles from my own self the kind of work id done years ago on the cancer wards of western pediatric hospital id spent nearly a decade on those wards a tooyoung newly minted psychologist pretending to know what he was doing seeing too much too soon feeling like nothing but an impostor paying dues but that was rubbish oncologists and oncology nurses devote entire lives to the cause so who the hell was i to selfaggrandize allisons husband had died of cancer and she spent one night a week with the terminally ill not a comforting line of thinking i returned to pondering china marangas death her verbal assault had been business as usual but some people dont take well to abuse and when id asked robin to speculate about the case her first instinct had been that china had run into someone on the street accepted a ride shot her mouth off one time too many despite paul brancusis dismissal the stalker element couldnt be ignored you didnt have to be famous to incite irrational attachment and alternative zines were sometimes little more than glorified fanclub bulletins fanaticclub bulletins had the editor adored china from afar had the way shed treated him twisted his passions into rage shed been ill equipped to handle i let my imagination run maybe hed agreed to give china one last chance watching waiting outside the studio china stoned unstable angry at her band leaves and he follows her pleased to be with someone who appreciated her she accompanies him then things turn china reverting to type and hes had enough thin speculation but it was that or introspection i booted up the computer and searched for grooverat not a single hit that surprised me every selfdeluded purveyor of triviality has a web site so the zine had been beyond obscure and as brancusi predicted long out of circulation already online i set out to convince myself that there was nothing more to be learned about the other three murders wilfred reedys name came up nearly a hundred times mostly in discographies and laudatory reviews two references to his tragic murder no speculation neither valerie brusco nor angelique bernet merited notice beyond the hits id found initially i exited the virtual world phoned central division and asked for the detective whod handled reedys case the clerk had no idea what i was talking about and transferred me to a sergeant who said why do you want to know im a consultant to the department what kind of consultant psychologist i work with lieutenant milo sturgis in west la division then have him call all im asking for is the name of the detective you have a case number no i repeated reedys name gave him the date thats four years ago he said you got to call records downtown dial tone i knew records wouldnt give me the time of day and moved on to the cambridge mass police and angelique bernet a southieaccented man instructed me this was the new age of homeland security and there were forms to be filled out requirements to be met when he asked me for my social security number i gave it to him he said hed get back to me and cut the connection a phone call to the oregon state penitentiary where i inquired about the status of inmate tom blascovitch valerie bruscos exboyfriend evoked similar suspicion and resistance i put the phone down enough of amateur hour let milo do his thing with everett kipper and if he hit a brick wall maybe id bring up the rest of it i was about to scavenge some dinner from the fridge when the phone rang tomorrows fine said allison but guess what so is tonight the hospice is bringing in entertainment a comedian and a bluegrass band whats your schedule i was waiting out in front of my house as she drove up in her jag shed kept the top down and her hair was wild when she got out i took her in my arms and kissed her hard wow she said laughing good to see you too she slid her arm around my waist and i looped mine over her shoulder as we climbed the stairs to the house inside she said any of that bordeaux left whatever we didnt drink last time is still there we went into the kitchen and i found the wine oh my she said looking me over you really are happy to see me you have no idea i said lying in darkness i heard the sharp intake of allisons breath everything okay sure she said too quickly curled under the covers her back to me i reached over and touched her face felt moisture on her cheek what is it i said nothing she began crying when the tears stopped she said are we at a point where its safe to tell you anything of course i hope so she said but she didnt speak allison forget it im fine okay moment later here i was feeling so good thinking what could be better than this and grants face floated into my head he looked happy benevolent happy for me god how i need to think of him as being happy of course and then the thoughts came all hed missed how id felt about him how young he was alex i miss him so much and sometimes the way you touch me the way youre tender with me when i need that it makes me think about him she flipped onto her back covered her face with both hands i feel so unfaithful to him to you its been years why cant i let go you loved him you never stopped loving him i never did she said maybe i never will can you deal with that because it has nothing to do with you im okay with it you mean that i do i understand your holding on to your feelings about robin my feelings i said am i wrong i didnt answer you had years together she said youd have to be shallow to just toss it aside everything takes time i said she let her hands drop from her face stared up at the ceiling well folks i may just have made a giant goof no i said i wish i could be sure of that i rolled closer and held her everythings fine i said im going to believe that she said given the alternative ten days later i heard from milo in the interim id persisted with the cambridge police and managed to talk to a detective named ernest fiorelle he began by scoping me out and we went through the old security bit finally i satisfied his curiosity by faxing a copy of an old lapd consultants contract and a couple of pages of my deposition on the ingalls case despite all that fiorelle ended up asking more questions than he answered about angelique bernet no serious leads had developed and the case remained unsolved my guess is some nut said fiorelle youre the shrink you tell me a sexual psychopath i said was there evidence of rape i didnt say that dead air i said what was crazy about it cutting up a beautiful young girl and dumping her in an alley seems pretty crazy to me doc out there in la does that pass for nahmul depends on the day of the week his laughter was brief and harsh i said so none of bernets fellow dancers or musicians came under suspicion nah wimpy bunch mostly females and gays scared witless everyone claimed to love the girl even though shed been promoted so what he said i was wondering about jealousy doc if youda been to the crime scene you wouldnt be wondering this wasnt some spat this was ugly still thinking about chinas possible encounter with a stalking fan i asked him about music conventions at the time of the murder you kidding he said this is collegetown hahvuhd the rest of them weve got nothing but conventions going on all the time anything to do with the music business specifically a group of critics journalists fans nah dont remember anything like that and frankly doc i dont know why youre bahkun up this tree nothing better to bark up well maybe you should find something and keep all that nutty stuff on the left coast nah doesnt sound like any matches between the girl and your cases fact is i found a better match in baltimore and that didnt pan out either who was the victim in baltimore some secretary cut up like ms bernet whats the difference i just told you it didnt pan baltimore busted a lunatic and he hung himself gotta run doc have a nice warm la day i searched for baltimore homicides on the net but came up with nothing remotely familiar to angelique bernet or the other killings nothing seemed to be the operative word during the same ten days a few other things happened tim plachette called me one evening and said apologies for that ridiculous little manoamano thing the other day no big deal i said you werent out of line whether i was or not i shouldve held my peace i really care about her alex im sure you do you dont want to have this conversation he said something in his voice desperation anxiety that came from deep love flipped my mood i do appreciate your calling tim and i wont get in the way im not trying to be a censor its a free country if you want to drop by thats fine i flipped again gee thanks for permission buddy but i knew he was right life would be a lot easier for all of us if i kept my distance we all need to move on tim its good of you to say that robin and then theres spike im making an ass out of myself thats the way it can be with women i said true we traded ychromosome chuckles anyway he said be well tim you too two days after that robin phoned i dont want to bother you but i also dont want you to find out from someone else guitar players running a profile on me and i must admit i think thats extremely cool i know you buy it sometimes so i thought you might see it beyond cool i said tell me the issue and ill be sure to buy it this coming issue she said they interviewed me a while back but never told me the piece was going to run they called me today to say it was itll probably complicate my life by throwing me more business when i dont need it but who cares getting out in the limelight once in a while feels good im such a baby huh you deserve it i said enjoy thanks alex hows everything moving along anything new on baby or that painter no i said when we were together shed never wanted to know about that kind of thing maybe it was her affection for baby boy or the fact that what i did with my life no longer touched hers well she said im sure if anyone can figure it out its you aw shucks maam bye she said and the laughter in her voice put a little light in my day milo reached me at home the following thursday just after pm solitary end of a solitary day id finished the last of my reports collected tax information for my accountant did a few handyman chores around the house when the phone rang i was doing the couchspud bit wearing grubby sweats snarfing takeout ribs a couple of grolsches within reach dimming the lights and turning up the volume on the big screen as i watched both reels of magnolia thinking once again that the film was a work of genius the previous two nights id slept at allisons place waking up in her cozy girly bedroom smelling perfume and breakfast resting the grizzle of my unshaven face against soft sweet sheets dividing my brain between delight and disorientation no more talk about grant or robin and she seemed content or trying to fake it she moved appointments around and took a day off and we drove up the coast had lunch in montecito at the stone house then we continued to santa barbara walked along the beach and up state street to the art museum where a portraiture show was on display blackeyed toowise robert henri children the wistful wounded women of raphael soyer the dandies and dolledup ladies of john kochs new york arty crowd pale languid darkhaired singer sargent beauties who made me look at allison with new appreciation a late dinner at the harbor on the pier stretched out to pm and we got back to la just before am for the last twenty miles i fought to stay awake when i pulled up in front of allisons house i hoped she wouldnt invite me in she said this has been great youre great for me want some instant coffee before you shove off ill make it i kissed her and drove off now the night was mine the next morning i rented the movie milo said am i interrupting something beer and ribs and magnolia that again what is it the tenth time third whats up you alone yup then screw you for hoarding ribs fine i said come over and scavenge dont tempt me satan no ricks cutting his shift early and were heading over to the jazz bakery larry coryells in town and you know rick anyway coco barnes sent over her drawing of the redhead afraid you were right its just this side of abstract those cataracts scotch her as any kind of reliable witness also heres the scoop on everett kipper not a popular guy among who his neighbors he said he lives in a nice part of pasadena near the border with san marino big craftsman place on a fullacre lot lotsa house for one guy the rest of the blocks families and senior citizens both of kippers immediate neighbors are the latter genteel old folk they say hes unfriendly keeps to himself used to go out to his garage late at night create a racket hammering marble or whatever finally they called the cops who went out and had a talk with kipper after that things quieted down but kipper got downright unfriendly doesnt answer when spoken to the cops told him to cool it by ten and the neighbors say kipper makes a point of hammering up until the stroke of ten leaves his garage door open making sure he can be heard hostile and vindictive i said sculpting and tearing it apart i spoke to the pasadena cops but all they remember is the nuisance call they sent me the report nothing illuminating the neighbors also said kipper rarely if ever entertains visitors but every so often there was a blond lady around i showed them julies picture they thought maybe it was her maybe these are folks in their eighties and no one got a close look blond is what they remember very very light blond hair the way julies was so looks like kipper was telling the truth when he said theyd maintained a relationship how often was she there irregularly sometimes once a month sometimes twice one of the old gals did tell me shes sure the blonde sometimes stayed the night because she saw her and kipper getting into kippers ferrari the next morning occasional intimacy i said maybe she came by to pick up the alimony in person and they forgot why they split up that got me thinking about what you said julies dependency what if she decided she no longer wanted any part of that told kipper so and things got nasty he wouldnt kill her at his place not with the neighbors looking over his shoulder that police report already on file youve been talking about a smart calculating guy and hes a bright one do i have any way to prove it nyet but theres nothing else in my scope whats the state of kippers finances im lightyears away from any kind of warrant on his accounts but from all appearances hes doing well in addition to the testarossa hes got a vintage bathtub porsche an old mg and a toyota land cruiser the house is stately and pretty he keeps up the gardening and the maintenance the place sparkles from the curb neighbors say he dresses sharp even on casual days one coot said he looked hollywood which in pasadena is damn near felonious another one an old lady went on about kipper liking black described it as an undertaker uniform then her husband chimes in and says no he looks like one of the stiffs ninetyone and hes cracking wise maybe it was the gin and tonic talking they invited me in for a drinkie i think i was the most exciting thing in the hood since the last rose bowl gin and tonics with the old folk i said refined the queen mother drank gin and tonics and she lived to but i had coke let me tell you it was tempting they were pouring bombay and i havent had much fun recently virtue triumphed goddammit anyway kipper is still on my screen the hostile aggressive loner also i did ask around about tall redheaded homeless gals a few possibles surfaced on the westside or pacific division but all turned out to be wrong one of the shelters in hollywood does remember a woman named bernadine or ernadine who fits the description tall big bones crazy midthirties or about she drops in occasionally to dry out but they havent seen her in a while the shelter supervisor had the feeling shed fallen quite a ways why when her head cleared she could sound fairly intelligent no last name unlike the public shelters the privates dont always keep records its a church group dove house pure good deeds no questions asked when bernadine sounded intelligent i said what did she talk about i dunno why this was just timekilling because i deadended on kipper just wondering if she was a fan of the arts all of a sudden you think its worth pursuing not really what forget it i said i dont want to waste your time right now my time isnt exactly precious julie kippers uncle called this morning politely inquiring as to my progress and i had to tell him there was none whats on your mind alex i told him about the other killings id found recounted my talk with paul brancusi wilfred reedy i remember he said another of ricks favorite jazz guys i think that one was a dope thing reedy pissing off a dealer or something like that reedy was an addict reedys kid was an addict he odd and died and reedy got hot about all the dealing near the south central clubs started making noise i could be wrong but thats what i remember so it was solved dont know ill find out he said so jealousys become the motive its the one point of consistency artists struck down just as theyre about to ascend four if you include angelique bernet but the differences outweigh any link wilfred reedy wasnt ascending hed been admired for years like i said wasting your time silence on the surface its not much he said still i aint sherlocking anything the oldfashioned way why dont i do this make a few calls and try to disprove the theory thats the scientific method right blow up the whatchamacallit the null hypothesis exactly ill find out who handled reedy talk to cambridge pd see whats really gone down i can also check whether or not that ceramicists boyfriend is still behind bars what are their names valerie brusco and tom blaskovitch i said he was sentenced three years ago another creative type sculptor same as kipper maybe another vindictive chisel man ah the art world like i tell my mother you never know when the job will elevate you to higher ground the next few weeks were a slow fade to futility no new evidence on the kipper murder surfaced and milo learned nothing about the other killings that excited him he contacted petra and learned shed deadended on baby boy tom blaskovitch the sculptorkiller had been released from prison a year before having earned good behavior points by setting up art classes for his fellow inmates but hed settled in idaho gotten a job as a handyman at a dude ranch which was exactly where his boss was certain hed been on the nights of the kipper and the lee murders detective fiorelle of the cambridge police remembered me as a pushy guy one of those intellectuals i know the type plenty around here the facts of angelique bernets murder did nothing to support any link with baby boy or julie the dancer had been stabbed half a dozen times and dumped in an area of the college town that was well traveled during the day but quiet at night no strangulation no sexual posing shed been found fully clad the detective whod worked the wilfred reedy case was dead milo got a copy of the file reedy had been gutstabbed in an alley like baby boy but strong indications of a drugrelated hit had surfaced at the time including the name of a probable suspect a smalltime dealer named celestino hawkins whod fed the habit of reedys son hawkins had served time for assault with a knife hed been dead for three years china marangas file was thin and cold milo phoned julie kippers uncle and told him not to expect any quick solve the uncle was gracious and that made milo feel worse allison and i spent more time at each others houses i bought guitar player and read the profile on robin spent a long time staring at the photos robin in her new shop no mention thered ever been another one gorgeous carved guitars and mandolins and celebrity endorsements and big smiles the camera loved her i wrote her a brief congratulatory note received a thankyou card in return two and a half months after julie kippers murder the weather warmed and the case file froze milo cursed and put it aside and resumed excavating cold cases few of them were solvable and that kept him grumbling and occupied the times we got together he never failed to mention julie sometimes with that forced blithe tone that meant failure was eating at him soon after that allison and i drove up to malibu canyon to watch a meteor shower we found an isolated turnoff lowered the top of her jaguar reclined the seats and watched cosmic dust streak and explode shortly after we got home at am the phone rang i was skimming the papers and allison was reading v s naipauls the mimic men shed pinned her hair up tiny blackframed reading glasses rode her nose as i lifted the receiver she looked over at the nightstand clock most of the earlymorning calls were hers patient emergencies i picked up milo spit another one i mouthed his name and she nodded classical pianist he went on stabbed and strangled after a concert right behind the venue and guess what this guy was on his way up careerwise record deal pending it wasnt my call but i heard it on the scanner i went over and took over lieutenants prerogative im here at the scene i want you to see it now i said allison put the book down is there a problem he said youre not a night owl anymore one sec i covered the phone looked at allison go she said where i asked milo hop skip and jump for you he said bristol avenue brentwood the north side moving up in the world i said who me the bad guy bristol was lovely and shaded by old cedars and marked by circular turnarounds every block or so most of the homes were the original tudors and spanish colonials the murder house was new a greek revivalish thing on the west side of the street three square stories white and columned bigger by half than the neighboring mansions with all the welcoming warmth of a law school a flat green lawn was marked by a single fiftyfoot liquidambar tree and nothing else highvoltage lighting was blatant and focused a stroll away was rockingham avenue where o j simpson had dripped blood on his own driveway a blackandwhite with its cherry flashing half blocked the street milo had left my name with the uniform on duty and i got smiled through with a certainly doctor that was a first lieutenants prerogative four more squad cars fronted the big house along with two crimescene vans and a coroners wagon the sky was moonless and impenetrable all the shooting stars gone the next uniform i encountered offered standardissue cop distrust as he called on his walkietalkie finally go on in a ton of door responded to my fingertip some sort of pneumatic assist as i stepped inside i saw milo striding toward me looking like a day trader whose portfolio had just imploded hurrying across a thousand square feet of marble entry hall the foyer had twentyfoot ceilings ten percent of that moldings and dentils and scrollwork the floor was white marble inset with black granite squares a crystal chandelier blazed enough wattage to power a thirdworld hamlet the walls were gray marble veined with apricot carved into linenfold panels three were bare one was hung with a frayed brown tapestry hunters and hounds and voluptuous women to the right a brassrailed marble staircase swooped up to a landing backed by giltframed portraits of stoic longdead people milo wore baggy jeans and a toolarge gray shirt and a toosmall gray herringbone sport coat he fit the ambience the way a boil fits a supermodel beyond the entry hall was a much larger room wood floors plain white walls rows of folding chairs faced a raised stage upon which sat a black grand piano several scoopshaped gridlike contraptions hung from the corners of the curved wooden ceiling some sort of acoustic enhancement no windows double doors at the rear blended with the plaster a pedestal sign to the left of the piano read silence please the piano bench was tucked under the instrument sheet music was spread on the rack the double doors opened and a thickset man in his sixties burst forth like a hatchling trotting after milo detective detective he waved his hands and huffed to catch up milo turned detective may i send the staff home its frightfully late just a while longer mr szabo the mans jowls quivered and set yes of course he glanced at me and his eyes disappeared in a nest of creases and folds his lips were moist and purplish and his color was bad mottled coppery milo told him my name but didnt append my title this is mr stefan szabo the owner pleased to meet you i said yes yes szabo fussed with a diamond cuff link and offered his hand his palm was hot and soft so moist it verged on squishy he was soft and lumpy bald but for redbrown fuzz above floppy ears his face was the shape of a wellbred eggplant and the nose that centered it a smaller version of the vegetable a pendulous plump japanese eggplant he wore a white silk wingcollared formal shirt fastened by halfcarat diamond studs a ruby paisley cummerbund black satinstriped tuxedo pants and patent loafers poor vassily this is terrible beyond terrible and now everyone will hate me hate you sir said milo the publicity said szabo when i built the odeum i took such pains to go through every channel wrote personal notes to the neighbors assured everyone that only private affairs and very occasional fundraisers would be held and always the ultimate discretion my policys always been consistent fair warning to everyone within a twoblock radius ample parking valets i took pains detective and now this he wrung his hands i need to be especially careful because of youknowwho during the trial life was hell but beyond that im a loyal brentwoodite now this szabos eyes bugged suddenly were you involved in that one no sir well thats good said szabo because if you were i cant say id have any great confidence in you he sniffed the air the poor odeum i dont know if ill be able to continue mr szabo built a private concert hall alex the victim was tonights performer the victim szabo placed a hand over his heart before he could speak the doors opened again and a young lithe asian man in snug black satin pants a black silk shirt and a red bow tie hurried toward us tom said szabo the detective says a while longer the young man nodded he looked to be thirty at most with poreless tight skin glowing ivory under a dense blueblack cirrus of hair whatever it takes stef are you okay not hardly tom the young man turned to me tom loh his hand was cool dry powerful szabo hooked his arm around lohs biceps tom designed the odeum designed the house were partners in life said tom loh szabo said is the caterer doing anything or just standing around as long as shes stuck here she might as well tidy up milo said mr szabo lets hold off on cleanup until the crimescene people are through crimescene people said szabo tears filled his eyes never in my life did i imagine that term would be relevant to our home tom loh said is the is vassily still here the body will be removed as soon as were finished said milo sure fine whatever is there anything else i can tell you about vassily the concert weve already been through the guest list sir but as i told you szabo broke in the guest list is only part of the audience eightyfive out of a hundred and thirteen people and you must take my word every one of those eightyfive is beyond reproach twentyfive are our faithful seasonticket holders neighbors whom we grant free admission stroking the neighbors explained loh so we could get the odeum through zoning hassles eightyfive out of one thirteen said milo leaving twentyeight strangers but surely said szabo anyone whod be interested in chopin would be too refined to loh said let them do their job stef his hand rested atop the older mans shoulder oh i know youre right im just a fellow trying to make the world a more beautiful place what do i know about this kind of thing szabo smiled weakly tom reads mystery novels he appreciates this kind of thing only in fiction said loh this is hideous szabo seemed to take that as a reproach yes yes of course im babbling dont know what im saying go about your business detective he touched his chest i need to sit down loh said go upstairs ill bring you a pear william taking szabos arm he guided the older man toward the landing stopped and watched as szabo trudged the rest of the way by himself then returned to us hes traumatized how long have you had the odeum said milo same time as the house said loh three years but the project was over a decade in the making we began right after stef and i moved from new york we were together two years before that stef was in the hosiery business and i was in urban design did public and private spaces we met at a reception for zubin mehta stef had always been a classical music freak and i was there because id done some work for one of the maestros friends dark almondine eyes focused on milo do you think this will jeopardize the odeum i couldnt say sir because its vital to stef loh plinked one end of his red bowtie i really dont think thered be any legal basis to stop it the neighbors have been supportive stef buys their childrens school raffle tickets by the score and we contribute heavily to every neighborhood project were on good terms with the zoning board and believe me that took some doing zoning board raffle tickets said milo lohs eyes rolled and he smiled dont ask the point is id hate for it to end it means a lot to stef and he means a lot to me how often do you throw concerts throw concerts said loh amused by the image stef schedules four a year last year we added an extra one at christmas as a benefit for the john robert preston school neighbors kid lohs smile widened i can see why youre a detective milo said i went over the till and counted thirteen checks from people not on the guest list that leaves another fifteen who paid cash the cash balance matches perfectly any idea who those fifteen are loh shook his head youd have to ask anita the girl at the door i did she doesnt recall sorry said loh its not as if we were looking for as if this couldve been anticipated what can you tell me about vassily levitch young intense like all of them stefan would know more music is his passion and you i keep things organized is there anything you can say about levitchs demeanor very quiet nervous about the performance he barely slept or ate and i heard him pacing in his room just before the recital but really detective thats how it usually is these people are gifted and they work harder than can be imagined vassily arrived two days ago and practiced seven hours each day when he wasnt playing he was holed up in his room no visitors no visitors and two phone calls from his mother and his agent hed never been to la before gifted said milo and on his way up thats stefans thing said loh he seeks out rising stars and tries to help their ascent by offering them recital time here and money our foundation issues grants nothing lavish each artist receives a fifteenthousanddollar stipend sounds generous to me stefs the soul of generosity how does mr szabo locate the artists how did he find vassily levitch specifically from vassilys agent in new york now that the concerts have achieved a certain reputation we get contacted frequently the agent sent stefan a tape and stefan listened to it and decided vassily would be perfect stefan tends to favor soloists or small ensembles were not exactly set up for an orchestra how long before the concert were the arrangements made a while back said loh months we need ample time for preparation the acoustics the lighting choosing the caterer and of course the advance publicity such as it is which is occasional mention on selected radio stations kbak the classic station mentions us twice a day for two weeks prior that fits our budget as well as our aspiration we cant handle a large crowd nor do we wish one eightyfive on the guest list said milo why not prearrange all the seats stefan left a few extras for outsiders in order to be publicspirited music students teachers that kind of thing any publicity other than radio we dont try for that said loh even the small bit of exposure we get means more seat requests than we can handle was that true tonight id assume so loh frowned you cant seriously believe a member of the audience did this at this point ill entertain any theories sir heres mine someone intruded the truth is anyone couldve gone back there behind the poolhouse and stabbed vassily bristols an open street we dont like living behind walls and gates what would levitch have been doing back there loh shrugged possibly walking off his tension after the recital any idea when he left the reception not a clue people were milling stefan suggests that the artists stick around for their sake making connections generally the artists comply obviously vassily slipped away shy type said milo holing up in his room yes but he did like to stroll the garden at night after he finished practicing by himself were there guests milling outside too we discourage that try to keep them indoors trampling the plants and all that but its not as if we post armed guards no armed guards said milo just one security man for the neighbors they prefer that bristol be free of a gestapo ambience and theres never been any need for an army of guards this is one of the safest neighborhoods in the city despite youknowwho the only fence is at the rear property line correct behind the tennis court said loh how bigs the property a little over two acres what was the security guards specific assignment to provide security whatever that means im sure he wasnt prepared for any serious eventuality this wasnt exactly a rap concert the average age of the audience had to be sixtyfive were talking perfect behavior that include the outsiders when it comes to the concerts stefan can be a bit of a martinet he insists on dead silence and his tastes run to soothing music chopin debussy all that good stuff do you share mr szabos tastes loh grinned again im more into technorock and david bowie any david bowie concerts scheduled for the odeum loh chuckled mr bowie isnt exactly within our price range nor would stefans sensibilities survive the experience he shot a sleek black cuff and consulted a sleek black watch milo said lets have a look at levitchs room as we climbed the stairs milo said big house loh said stefans family escaped from hungary in he was a teenager but they managed to cram him into a large steamer trunk were talking days without food or toilet facilities a few air holes for breathing id say hes entitled to his space wouldnt you the right side of the landing was taken up by two enormous bedrooms szabos and lohs open doors to both revealed flashes of brocade and damask polished wood soft lighting to the left were three guest suites smaller less opulent but still stylishly turned out the room where vassily levitch had spent the past two nights was taped off milo broke the tape and i followed him inside tom loh stood in the doorway and said what should i do thanks for your time sir said milo feel free to go about your business loh went back down the stairs milo said stay there while i toss if you dont mind the evidentiary chain and all that got to be careful i said especially in light of youknowwho the guest suite was papered in red silk furnished with a canopied queen bed two regency nightstands and an ornate inlaid italian chest of drawers empty drawers as was the closet vassily levitch had lived out of his black nylon suitcase even his toiletries had remained in the valise milo examined the contents of the pianists wallet went through the pockets of every garment a kit bag produced aftershave a safety razor advil valium and peptobismol a manila envelope in a zippered compartment of the suitcase contained photocopied reviews of other recitals levitch had given the critics lauded the young mans touch and phrasing hed won the steinmetz competition the hurlbank competition the great barrington piano gala no drivers license a checkcashing id card put him at twentyseven years old milo said zero plus zero i said can i see the body a rear patio as large as the odeum emptied to the rolling lawn and widely spaced birch trees walled by a twelvefoottall ficus hedge a gothic arch cut into the hedge led the way to a fiftyfoot lap pool a tennis court a cactus garden a shallow pond devoid of fish and tucked into the rear right corner a fourcar garage i could see no driveway or any other direct access from the street to the garage and asked milo about that they use it for storage antiques clothing lamps you should see the stuff i could live off their castaways they leave their cars in front his and his mercedes s concert nights they park on the street want the house to look aesthetically pure nice life huh cmon he led me behind the garage to where a female cop guarded vassily levitchs corpse the body lay on a narrow strip of soiled concrete backed by another high ficus hedge sharing space with five plastic garbage cans a batteryop lapd floodlight turned everything bilious milo told the policewoman to take five she looked grateful as she headed toward the cactus garden he stood back and let me take in the details a mean putrid space even the grandest of estates have them but on this estate you had to make your way through two acres of beauty to find it best kill spot on the property someone whod been here before and knew the layout i raised the point milo chewed on it but said nothing i got closer to the body stepping into greenish light in life levitch had been a handsome young man a goldenhaired boy literally his sculpted face stared up into the night topped by a mass of curls that caressed his shoulders prominent nose chin cheekbones an aggressive forehead longfingered hands were frozen in palmsup supplication the tails of his cutaway coat had crumpled under him a starched white shirt now mostly crimson had been ripped open exposing a hairless chest a seveninch slit the edges curling ran vertically from umbilicus to the hollow beneath the pianists sternum something pale and wormy peeked out from the wound a curl of bowel levitchs white pique bow tie was also bloodsplotched his eyes popped a distended tongue flopped from one corner of his mouth a bloody ring necklaced his gullet i said paramedics rip the shirt he nodded i stared at the corpse some more moved away any thoughts baby boy was stabbed julie kipper was strangled and this poor guy endured both was the cut pre or postmortem coroner says probably pre because of all the blood spray then the wire was looped around his neck so what are you saying a serial with escalation or strangulation is the killers goal and sometimes he needs to make concessions sadists and sexual psychopaths enjoy choking out their victims because its intimate slow and feeds the power lust incrementally julie was an easy target because she was tiny and the cramped space of the bathroom trapped her so the killer was able to go straight for his fun levitch on the other hand was a strong young guy so he had to be disabled first what about baby boy far as ive heard there was nothing around his neck baby boy was a huge man choking him out wouldve been a challenge and baby boys kill spot was public a city alley easy for someone to walk by maybe the killer was being careful or he got spooked before he could finish be interesting to know how levitchs stab wounds match up with baby boy ill check with petra till now we didnt think our cases had anything in common he stared at me shook his head took another look at levitch however this shakes out i need to do the routine alex which in this case is majorleague scut iding audience members canvassing the neighborhood for sightings of suspicious strangers checking the files for recent prowler calls too much for one noble soldier the guys who pulled the case initially are a couple of dis green no whodunit experience claim theyre interested in getting their feet wet they actually seem grateful for uncle milos council ill sic em on the grunt work get on the phone tomorrow with levitchs agent in new york and see what i can learn about him hey bossman i said thats me he said chairman of the gore seen enough more than enough we walked back to the house and i thought about vassily levitch left to die in the company of garbage cans baby boy dumped in a back alley juliet kippers life terminated in a toilet demeaning them is the thing i said reducing art to trash the next day milo asked me to a meeting five pm in the back room of the same indian restaurant ill be there anything new levitchs agent and mother had nothing to offer she mostly sobbed all the agent could say was vassily was a beautiful boy amazing talent the reason i want to put heads together is petra said levitchs wound sounds like a perfect match to baby boys plus the coroners telling me the ligature used on levitch is the same gauge and consistency as the one used to choke out julie and guess what your idea about baby boys killer being spooked might be righton turns out there was a witness in the alley some homeless guy pretty well boozeblasted and between that and the darkness his description didnt amount to much but maybe the killer sensed him and split whats the description tall guy in a long coat he came up to lee shmoozed then moved in for what looked like a hug guy walks away lee falls down the killer made no move on the homeless guy linus brophy but you never know the killer wouldnt go for brophy why not out of his focus i said were talking about someone with very specific goals i gathered together my notes and drove to café moghul the same amiable sarid woman beamed as she ushered me through the restaurant and over to an unmarked door next to the mens room he is here the windowless green room had probably once served as storage space milo sat at a table set for three behind him was a sleeper couch pushed up against the wall on the couch was a tightly curled bedroll a stack of indian magazines and a box of tissues curry smells drifted in through a ceiling grate i sat down as he dipped some kind of wafer into a bowl of red sauce the sauce tinted his lips liverish our hostess seems quite impressed with you i tip big and they think my presence offers protection theyve had problems just the usual drunks wandering in unwanted solicitors couple of weeks ago i happened to be here when some idiot peddling dried flowers for an instant nirvana cult got unruly i engaged in diplomacy and now the uns requesting your résumé hey those clowns could use the help here she is he stood and greeted petra connor she looked around and grinned you really know how to treat a girl milo only the best for hollywood division she had on the usual black pantsuit the brownish lipstick and pale matte makeup her short black hair was glossy and her eyes shone like milo shed brought a bulging soft attaché case his was cracked and gray hers black and oiled she gave me a wave hi alex then she half turned as a roundshouldered man stepped into the room guys this is my new partner eric stahl stahl wore black too a baggy suit over a starched white shirt and skinny gray tie he had collapsed cheeks eyes recessed as deeply as those of a blind man his spiky crew cut was a deep brown shade one half tone lighter than petras ebony coif but huewise that was a fine distinction a few years older than petra but like her thin with fair skin in stahls case a tallowy pallor rendered sickly by contrast to petras crisp cosmetic kabuki but for rosy spots on his cheeks he mightve been fashioned of wax he appraised the room flat inert eyes milo said hey eric stahl said hey in a low voice and shifted his gaze to the table three place settings milo said ill get you fixed up just get a chair eric wont be eating said petra oh yeah said milo dont like indian eric i ate already said stahl his voice matched his eyes eric doesnt eat said petra he claims he does but ive never seen it the smiling woman brought platters of food milo snarfed petra and i picked eric stahl placed his hands flat on the table and stared at his fingernails stahls presence seemed to discourage small talk so did the situation and milo got right down to business passing around julie kippers case file then summarizing the little he had on vassily levitch both hollywood detectives took it in without comment milo said could you recap baby boy petra said sure her account was concise focused on the relevant details the precise delivery emphasized how little shed unearthed and when she finished she seemed bothered stahl remained mute milo said sounds like a match to levitch at least how about the psych wisdom alex i summarized the outoftown cases quickly glossed over wilfred reedy because his murder sounded like a drug hit and moved on to china maranga as i put forth the suggestion that she mightve been stalked without knowing it the three of them listened but didnt react a trio of blank faces if i was right they were faced with monumental work the night china disappeared i said she left the studio in a foul mood and quite possibly stoned under the best of circumstances she had a bad temper was known to unload on people without warning heres a prime example she refused an interview with a fanzine but the editor was persistent and ran the story anyway a puff piece chinas thanks was to phone the guy and abuse him viciously was the way her band mate put it she had no sense of personal safety lived highrisk that and a major tantrum in the wrong setting couldve proved fatal what was the name of the fanzine said petra something called grooverat i looked for it but couldnt her slim white fingers on my wrist stopped me midsentence grooverat did a piece on baby boy she said she opened her attaché case drew out a blue murder book and began paging the editor was persistent with me too real pest kept calling bugging me for details here we go yuri drummond i didnt take him seriously because he sounded like an obnoxious kid he told me hed never actually met baby boy but ran a profile on him same as china said milo baby boy turn him down too i didnt ask he claimed interviews werent the magazines style they were into the essence of art not the persona or some nonsense like that he sounded about twelve what did he want from you i said the gory details she frowned i figured him for an adolescent ghoul shined him on milo said be interesting to know if he ever wrote up julie kipper wouldnt it said petra i said i tried to find a copy of grooverat at the big newsstand on selma but they didnt carry it the owner suggested a comics store on the boulevard but they were closed probably a dinky flybynight deal said milo thats what chinas band mate said he didnt save a copy either yuri drummond sounds like a madeup name what he wants to be a cosmonaut everyone reinvents themselves said petra its the la way glancing at stahl he didnt respond especially if theyre running from something i said grooverat she said so what does this mean a fan gone psycho someone overinvolved in the victims careers maybe someone whose identity became enmeshed with the creativity of others leeches on the body artistic is how julie kippers exhusband described critics and agents and gallery owners and all the other ancillaries of the creative world the same can be said of fanatical followers sometimes attachments morph into business arrangements presidents of fan clubs selling memorabilia but the core remains emotional celebrity by association for most people fandoms a fling that ends when they grow up but certain borderline personalities never mature and what starts out as a harmless egosubstitution the kid standing in front of a mirror playing air guitar and imagining himself to be hendrix can turn into a psychological hijacking hijacking what said milo the adored ones identity i know the star better than he knows himself how dare he get marriedsell outnot listen to my advice how dare he refuse my generous offer to be interviewed said petra adolescents are the biggest fanatics right and yuri drummond sounded adolescent the fact that he published a zine makes him hardcore desktop publishings elevated hardcore i said buy a computer and a printer and you too can be a mediamaster i know these victims vary demographically but ive thought all along that the crucial element is their career status poised for a jump what if the killer became attached to them precisely because they werent stars entertained rescue fantasies hed be the starmaker by writing about them they rejected him so he interrupted the climb maybe he convinced himself they sold out or said petra since were talking about vicarious talent maybe he was an aspiring artist himself and simply got consumed with jealousy milo said aspiring guitarist painter singer and pianist a real megalomaniac she said all three detectives looked at me its possible i said a dilettante who bounces from game to game i had a patient years ago a successful writer scarcely a week went by when he didnt meet someone who planned to pen the great american novel if only they had time this guy had written his first four books while holding down two jobs one thing he told me stuck when someone says they want to be a writer theyll never make it when they say they want to write theres a chance that could fit with our bitterfan scenario someone who gets off on the external trappings of creativity petra smiled leeches on the body artistic years ago shed worked as a painter i like that so were talking two possibilities said milo a rescue fantasy turned on its head or pathological jealousy or both i said or im dead wrong petra laughed dont say that up on the witness stand doctor she picked up a piece of wafer bread cracked a corner between sharp white teeth chewed slowly yuri drummond went on about his zine capturing the essence of art when he started nagging me for the gories it couldve been revisiting the scene psychologically ego trip said milo like arsonists standing around watching the flames did drummond write the story on baby boy i said i think he told me a writer did said petra all i copied down was the guys name at the time it seemed irrelevant she placed her napkin on the table time to check the guy out earn my salary this was good milo let me split the check with you forget it i run a tab here youre sure im a rajah he said go detect stay in touch petra touched milos shoulder briefly favored me with a smile turned and headed for the door stahl got up and followed her out during the entire discussion he hadnt said a word the silent type some women thought they liked that petra had thought she liked it but working with stahl was proving to be a trying experience the guy never spoke unless spoken to and even then he drew upon his verbal bank account one scroogy syllable at a time now here they were driving away from the meeting with milo and alex when there shouldve been animated discussion stahl just stared out the passenger window inert as dirt what looking for another stolen car hed spotted two gtas in one week and the second had contained a passenger with a felony manslaughter warrant so brownie points for the two of them but if thats what floated stahls dinghy he shouldve asked for an assignment to auto theft why hed chosen homicide puzzled her why hed given up the security of an army gig for the streets was an even bigger question mark shed hazarded a few polite questions every attempt to crack the shell revealed a granite egg not that old eric was any big old stoic macho man with obvious dominance needs or glory lust on the contrary hed made it clear right from the beginning that petra was the senior partner and unlike most men he knew how to apologize even when it wasnt necessary two days into their partnership petra had arrived early and found stahl at his desk reading a folded newspaper and sipping herbal tea that was another thing he didnt drink coffee and if anything contravened the detective code of ethics it was caffeine phobia when he saw her he looked up and petra sensed unease the merest hint of restlessness in his flat brown eyes evening eric this wasnt my idea he said handing her the paper a twoparagraph article toward the back had been circled in black marker summary of the armenian gang killing her name in print as the investigator along with stahls the case had been wrapped up well before stahls arrival someone maybe a departmental pr doofus or even schoelkopf digging at petra intentionally had doled out cocredit dont worry about it said petra i dont like it said stahl dont like what it was your case i dont care eric i thought id call the times dont be ridiculous stahl stared at her okay he said finally i wanted to clarify you have he returned to his tea a mile before the hollywood station petra said so what do you think about what dr delawares theory you know him said stahl a statement not a question if youre asking whether hes good he is ive worked with him and milo before milos the best top solverate in west la maybe the department stahl tapped his knee hes gay said petra no answer delawares smart she said brilliant i usually dont have much faith in shrinks but hes come through then i like his theory said stahl so what next check out comics stores for grooverat or try to find it with phone work both said stahl there are two of us which would you prefer your call state a preference eric ill do the phone work big surprise eric at his desk avoiding reallive people she dropped him off and cruised hollywood for alternative bookstores inquiries about grooverat produced blank stares from the clerks but most of them looked blasted to begin with on her fifth try the pimply kid at the counter hooked a thumb toward a cardboard box to his left red ink scrawl on the flap said old zines one buck the carton smelled moldy and was crammed with paper and loose sheets spindled and mutilated magazines petra said you definitely have grooverat in here the kid said probably and stared off into space petra began pawing through the box raising dust that grayed her black jacket most of the zines seemed to be little more than adolescent hobby junk several were printed on pulp she skimmed a world of incoherence fluctuating from bored to breathless mostly to do with music and movies and dirty jokes nearly at the bottom of the pile she found a coverless copy of grooverat ten pages of poorly typed text and amateurish cartoons the date on the masthead was the previous summer no volume or number listings not much in the way of staff either yuri drummond editor publisher contributing writers the usual gang of miscreants the second line reminded petra of something ripoff of a mad magazine line all four of her brothers had collected mad something about the usual gang of idiots so mr drummond was unoriginal as well as pretentious that fit with alexs theory the bottom of the masthead listed an address for mailing subscription checks the zine promised irregular publication and charged forty dollars a year delusional as well petra wondered if anyone had bitten she supposed if idiots were willing to pay three bucks a minute for phone tarot anything was possible the address was right here in hollywood on sunset east of highland just a short drive away she scanned the table of contents four pieces on rock bands shed never heard of and a writeup of a sculptor who worked in plasticcoated dog poo the author of the art piece nomduplumed mr peach really appreciated fecal art terming it primally satisfying and gutwrenching duchampdadayuk yuk kids petra was surer than ever that she was dealing with an adolescent mind and that didnt synch with the careful planning of the murders still the zine cropping up in two cases bore attention a careful check of the remaining pages revealed nothing on baby boy lee juliet kipper or vassily levitch nothing on the boston case alex had found either bernet the ballerina petra had her doubts about that one but you didnt want to ignore alexs gut she paid for the rag and headed for grooverat headquarters strip mall at gower and sunset a mail boxes n stuff big shock suite was really box now leased to verna joy hollywood cosmetics petra knew that because as she waited for the woman in charge to stop fussing with a cuticle and give her the time of day two bound stacks of mail on the counter caught her eye lots of interest in verna joy too much for one box the top envelope was pink with a return address in des moines neat feminine cursive writing advertised payment inside the maildrop woman finally put away her emery board spotted petra studying the stacks snatched them up and jammed them under the counter a peroxide blonde in her sixties shed gone overboard with the brown eye shadow and the black liner left the rest of her tired splotched drinkers face unpainted emphasizing the eyes bringing out the despair petra showed her id and the womans expression shifted from irritation to outright contempt what do you want a magazine named grooverat used to lease box how long has it been since they vacated maam dont know and wouldnt tell you if i did the womans jaw jutted whys that maam its the law bill of rights you need a warrant petra relaxed her posture tried a soft smile youre absolutely right maam but i dont want to search the box id just like to know how long its been since the tenant vacated dont know and wouldnt tell you if i did the womans smile was tightlipped and triumphant were you working here when grooverat occupied the box shrug who picked up grooverats mail ditto maam said petra i can come back with a warrant then you do that said the woman with sudden savagery whats the problem maam i got no problem this could be related to a homicide investigation the smudgy eyes remained resolute petra fixed on them mustered a hard stare the woman said you dont impress me homicide doesnt impress you said petra its always homicide said the woman everythings homicide what the woman jabbed a finger this is my place and i dont have to talk to you but she followed that with protect yourself and its homicide stand up for your rights and its homicide battle of stares whats your name maam i dont have to tell you sure do or youll be arrested on an obstruction charge petra reached for her cuffs olive gilwhite said the woman jowls flittering are you sure you dont want to cooperate ms gilwhite im not saying nothing rather than deliver a grammar lesson petra left the mail drop and drove back to the station eric stahl was at his desk phoning and taking notes she ignored him and played with the computers plugging in olive gilwhites name and the mail drops address and finally coming up with something two years ago the proprietor of a hollywood mailboxes n stuff a man named henry gilwhite had been busted for homicide petra fished in the files and found the case summary gilwhite sixtythree had shot a nineteenyearold male trannie prostitute named gervazio guzman to death in back of the mail drop gilwhite had claimed selfdefense in an attempted mugging but his semen on guzmans dress told a different story the case had been pled down to manslaughter and gilwhite was serving time at lompoc five to ten but at his age that might very well mean life leaving mrs gilwhite to run the store and drink herself to death protect yourself and its homicide petra resolved to find some way to lean on the nasty old biddy as she thought about it stahl got up and approached her desk whats up eric ive got a few possibles on yuri drummond possibles theres no yuri drumonds anywhere in the state so i looked up all the drummonds in our zip codes why limit it to hollywood said petra its a place to start if drummonds a starchaser maybe he wants to live in the hub eric the stars live in bel air and malibu i was speaking metaphorically said stahl he drew a threebyfive index card from his suit jacket still wearing his black suit coat every other detective was in shirtsleeves petra said whatd you come up with dmv has twelve drummonds listed five of them females of the seven males four are older than fifty these are the three remaining the longest speech shed ever heard from him his flat eyes had acquired a murky glow and the coins in his cheeks had deepened to vermilion this one got off on tedium he handed her the index card neat printing in green ink a list adrian drummond a los feliz address that petra recognized as a gated street in laughlin park rich kid that fit but seemed young to be publishing anything even a lowlevel zine kevin drummond an apartment on north rossmore randolph drummond an apartment on wilton place the first two have no records said stahl randolph drummond has a fiveyearold prior for vehicular manslaughter and dui should we start with him bad car crash said petra its not exactly serial murder its antisocial said stahl something new came into his voice harder more intense his eyes had narrowed to slits petra said still my moneys on the second one kevin the voice i heard was younger than fortyfour and the zines got an immature flavor of course all this assumes any of these are our guy for all we know our drummond lives out in the valley but even as she said that she doubted it the grooverat pob had been rented in hollywood stahls instincts were good he said okay for all we know his names not even drummond said petra yuris probably fake and so why not the surname the incident with olive gilwhite had left her combative stahl didnt answer lets go petra said shoving the card at him and grabbing her purse where on a drummondsearch kevin drummonds rossmore address matched an eightyyearold threestory brickfaced mock tudor just below melrose where the street turned into vine and commercial hollywood began the mansions of hancock park were a brief stroll south and between that highpriced real estate and drummonds block sat the royale and the majestic and other elegant doormanguarded buildings gorgeous old vanillacolored dowagers facing the green velvet links of the wilshire country club built when labor was cheap and architecture meant ornament petra had heard that mae west had lived out her days in one of them clad in satin gowns and keeping company with young men till the end god bless her but any vestiges of glamour had faded by the time you got to drummonds street the bulk of the buildings were ugly boxes knocked into place during the fifties and the remaining older structures appeared ill tended like drummonds several bricks were missing from the facade and a warped slat of cardboard shielded a secondstory window on the ground floor protection was provided by rusty security grates across the front door and the streetlevel windows the alarm sign on the scrubby little lawn was that of a shoddy company petra knew had been out of business for years the hub indeed to the right of the entrance were twenty call buttons most with the tenant ids missing from the slots no identification for drummonds secondstory unit the names that remained in place were all hispanic or asian petra pushed drummonds button no answer she tried again leaned on the buzzer nothing unit one was the manager g santos same result she said lets try the other two randolph drummonds place on wilton was a sixtyunit pinkstucco monster built around a cloudy swimming pool drummonds apartment was at street level facing the traffic no security here not even a symbolic gate across the cutout that led to the complex and petra and stahl walked right in and up to drummonds door petras knock was answered by a boomy hold on the lock turned and the door opened and a man leaning on aluminum elbow crutches said what can i do for you randolph drummond in the flesh such as it is drummonds torso canted to one side he wore a brown vneck sweater over a yellow shirt spotless khakis felt bedroom slippers his hair was white neatly parted and a snowy beard bottomed a full face weary eyes seamed skin mild tan hemingway on disability petra would have guessed his age as closer to fiftyfour than fortyfour massive forearms rested on the crutches a big man above the waist but skimpy legs behind him was a bedsitting room the bed open and covered with a silk throw what petra could see appeared militaryneat the sounds of classical music something sweet and romantic streamed toward the detectives waste of time handicap aside this was no zine guy she said may we come in sir may i ask why said drummond jovial smile but no give were investigating a homicide and looking for a man who calls himself yuri drummond drummonds smile expired he shifted his weight on the crutches homicide lord why his reaction made petras heart beat fast she smiled could we talk inside please sir drummond hesitated sure why not havent had a visitor since the last wave of dogooders he stamped backward on his crutches and cleared space and petra and stahl stepped into the apartment inside the music was louder but barely kept at reasonable volume issuing from a portable stereo on the floor one room just as petra had thought outfitted with the bed and two armchairs a cubby kitchen a tiny bathroom could be seen behind the arch in the rear wall two plywood bookcases perpendicular to the bed were filled with hardcovers literary fiction and law books drummond had been busted for manslaughter a jailhouse expert petra said dogooders disability pimps said drummond state grants private foundations your name gets on a list and you become a potential customer go on make yourselves comfortable petra and stahl each took a chair and drummond lowered himself to the bed keeping that smile pasted on during what looked like a painful ordeal now who got homicided and why would i know anything about it petra said have you heard of yuri drummond sounds russian who is he what about a magazine called grooverat drummonds chunky knuckles whitened you know it said petra what interest do you have in it mr drummond it would be better if we asked the questions yes ive heard of it are you the publisher me drummond laughed no i dont think so who is drummond inched his bulk toward the bed cushions took a long time to get comfortable im happy to cooperate with the police but you really need to let me know whats going on we really dont said stahl stahls voice seemed to spook drummond drummond paled and licked his lips then his eyes brightened with anger i put myself here in this situation tapping the crutches little drinkinganddriving problem but you probably know that no answer from the detectives petra glanced at her partner stahl looked furious inscrutable public servants said drummond i got caught thank god served time in a hospital ward did aa another tap im telling you this because ive been trained to confess but also so youll understand im a fool but not an idiot my heads been clear for ten years and i know that nothing ive done abrogates my rights so dont try to intimidate me abrogate said stahl reaching out and touching the spine of a law book you like legal terminology no said drummond on the contrary i despise it but i used to be an attorney is yuri drummond your son said petra not hardly i told you ive never heard that name but you have heard of grooverat the magazine yuri drummond edits drummond didnt reply mr drummond said petra we found you well find him why add to your roster of poor decisions ouch said drummond stroking his beard sir drummond chewed his cheek i didnt know he was calling himself yuri but yes i have heard of the socalled magazine hes my brothers kid kevin drummond so now hes yuri whats he done maybe nothing we want to talk to him about grooverat well youve come to the wrong place said drummond whys that dont see kevin said drummond lets just say its not a closeknit family any idea why he took on the name yuri hell if i know maybe he fancies himself subversive whens the last time you spoke to your nephew i never speak to him drummonds smile was sour his father my brother and i used to be law partners and my indiscretions cost frank quite a bit of business after i was paroled and discharged from rehab he fulfilled his brotherly obligation by finding me this place ten units set aside for statefunded cripples then proceeded to shut me out completely how do you know about grooverat kevin sent me a copy how long ago years couple of years ago hed just graduated college announced he was a publisher why would he send it to you said petra back then he liked me probably because no one else in the family did wild alkie uncle and all that brother franks a bit stuffy growing up with him couldnt have been fun for kevin so you were kevins mentor drummond chuckled not remotely he sent me the rag i wrote him a note and told him it was dreadful he should study accounting mean old uncle i never liked the kid why not said petra not a charming lad said drummond mumbly ninetyeightpoundweakling type kept to himself always going off on some project publishing projects the fancy of the moment tropical fish lizards rabbits trading cards god knows what those little japanese robots of course he had to have every single one he was always collecting crap toy cars computer games cheap watches you name it frank and his mother indulged him frank and i grew up with no money sports was our thing we both lettered in football in high school and college franks other boys greg and brian are super athletes gregs got a scholarship to arizona state and brians playing varsity in florida kevins not athletic drummond smirked lets just say kevins an indoor type talking about his nephew had brought out the cruelty petra thought drunk this guy would be ugly do you have kids of your own mr drummond no i used to have a wife drummonds eyes squeezed shut she was next to me in the car when i hit the pole my lawyer used my grief as a defense and got me a lighter sentence his eyes opened moist stahl watched him rigid unimpressed petra said so whens the last time you saw kevin like i said years ago i couldnt hazard a precise guess after my review of his socalled publication he never called me it wasnt really a magazine you know just something kevin cranked out in his bedroom probably cost frank another chunk of change do you recall anything about the content i didnt read it said drummond i took one look saw it was crap and tossed it crap about what kevins take on the art world people he considered geniuses why did kevin write the whole thing himself thats what i assumed what you think he had a staff this was amateur hour detective and what the hell does it have to do with homicide petra smiled so you never see kevin despite the fact that he lives close to you does he drummond seemed genuinely surprised right here in hollywood hooray for hollywood said drummond makes sense whys that kid always was a starfucker they spent a while longer in the apartment going over the same territory rephrasing the way detectives do when trolling for inconsistencies refusing randolph drummonds offers of soft drinks but fetching a diet coke for the man when he began licking his lips petra did most of the talking the few times stahl spoke drummond grew uneasy not evasiveness as far as petra could tell stahls inflectionless tone seemed to spook the guy and petra found herself empathizing the interview produced home and business addresses and phone numbers for franklin drummond attorney at law both in encino and the fact that two years ago kevin drummond had graduated from charter college a small expensive private school near eagle rock they sent me an invitation said drummond i didnt attend it was an insincere offer what do you mean said petra no offer to drive me there i wasnt going to take the damn bus it was nearing pm by the time they got back to kevin drummonds building still no one home time for encino as they drove north over laurel canyon petra said randolph d bother you he cant stand his nephew said stahl angry man estranged from his entire family but cant see any link to our case cant see him moving round town on those crutches and offing artistic types he killed his wife you see that as relevant said petra stahls pale fingers interlaced a stricken look washed over his face then it was gone so fast that petra wondered if shed really seen it eric she said stahl shook his head no he has nothing to do with our case back to kevin then that comment about his being a starfucker would tie in with delawares theory so would the history of failed projects and attraction to fads this could be one pathetic little loser who just couldnt take not being talented and decided to act out against those who were stahl didnt answer eric dont know whats your intuition i dont rely on intuition really said petra youve been pretty good with gtas as if taking that as an invitation stahls head swiveled toward the passenger window and he studied the traffic flow he stayed that way during the entire trip to the valley they tried franklin drummonds ventura boulevard office first the firm was a onelawyer affair on the tenth floor of a bronzedglass highrise the waiting room was cozy bathed in the same type of romantic music randolph drummond had played the young receptionist was friendly enough when she informed them that mr drummond was in court her nameplate said danita tyler and she looked busy what kind of law does mr drummond practice said petra general business real estate litigation may i ask what this is about wed like to talk to him about his son kevin oh tyler was puzzled kevin doesnt work here do you know kevin by sight whens the last time you saw him is he in trouble no said petra we need to talk to him about his publishing business publishing i thought he was a student he graduated college a couple of years ago i mean a graduate student at least that was my impression the young woman fidgeted i probably shouldnt be talking about it why not the boss has a thing for privacy any particular reason hes a private man good boss dont get me in trouble okay petra smiled promise could you please tell me where kevin attends grad school dont know thats the truth im not even sure he is in grad school i really dont know much about the family like i said mr drummond likes his privacy whens the last time kevin was here ms tyler oh my i couldnt tell you the family almost never comes in how long have you been working here ms tyler two years during that time have you ever met randolph drummond whos he a relative said petra publishing huh said tyler the police what some kind of porno no dont answer that she laughed ran a finger across her mouth i dont want to know they had her call franklin drummonds cell phone but the attorney didnt answer sometimes she said he turns it off during the ride home the man likes his privacy said petra the man works hard they drove out onto ventura boulevard petra was hungry and she looked for a semiinviting cheap eatery two blocks west she spotted a falafel stand with two picnic tables leaving the unmarked in a loading zone she bought a spiced lamb shwarma in a soft pita and a coke and ate as stahl waited in the car when she was halfway through the sandwich stahl got out and took a seat across from her traffic roared by she munched stahl just sat his interest in food matched his hunger for human discourse when he did eat it was always something boring on white bread that he brought from home in a clean brown bag whatever home was for eric she ignored him enjoyed her food wiped her lips and stood lets go ten minutes later they pulled up to the home where kevin drummond had pursued his evershifting fancies it was a beautifully tended extrawide ranch house perched on the uppermost lot of a hilly street south of ventura boulevard jacarandas shaded the sidewalks like most nice la neighborhoods not a sign of humanity lots of wheels three or four vehicles for each house at franklin drummonds that meant a newlooking gunmetal baby benz sharing circulardriveway space with a white ford explorer a red honda accord and something lowslung under a beige car cover the man who opened the door was loosening his tie midforties stocky build a broad rubbery face topped by wavy saltandpepper hair a nose that looked as if it had spent some time in the ring goldrimmed eyeglasses sat atop the meaty bridge behind the lenses cool brown eyes looked them over with three grown sons franklin drummond had to be older than his brothers fortyfour but he looked younger than randolph yes he said the tie was royal blue silk it loosened easily and frank drummond let it drape over his barrel chest petra noticed a wee gold chain dangling from the back brioni label drummonds shirt was tailored and baby blue with a starched white collar and his suit pants were gray pinstripe petra told him they were looking for his son frank drummonds eyes narrowed to paper cuts and his chest swelled whats going on have you heard from kevin recently sir drummond stepped out of the house and closed the door behind him whats this about wary but unruffled this guy was a working lawyer a oneman firm accustomed to taking care of his own business any sort of subterfuge would bounce right off him so petra kept it straight and simple its kevins magazine were interested in said petra grooverat a couple of the people he covered have been murdered as she said it it sounded farfetched all this time searching for a nerdy little wannabe and it would probably turn into nothing so said frank drummond so wed like to talk to him said stahl drummonds eyes tilted toward stahl unlike his brother he was unimpressed by stahls zombie demeanor same question these are general inquiries sir said petra so find him and inquire away he said he doesnt live here anymore whens the last time you saw him said petra why should i get into this why not sir general principles said frank drummond keep your mouth shut flies dont enter were not flies sir said petra just doing our job and it would really help us if you could direct us to kevin kevin lives by himself in the apartment on rossmore drummond glared at her if you know that why are you here does kevin pay his own rent drummonds lips pursed he clicked his tongue i dont see that kevins financial arrangements are relevant to your investigation if you want to read the magazine go ask him and im sure hell be happy to share hes proud of it the tiniest rise in pitch on the magazine and proud he wasnt home petra said so try again its been a long day sir if youre paying his rent we thought you might know about his comings and goings i pay said drummond and thats the extent of it petra smiled the joys of parenthood drummond didnt take the bait he reached for the door handle sir why does kevin call himself yuri ask him no idea he probably thinks it sounds cool who cares so you dont see your son at all said petra drummond retracted his arm began to fold both limbs across his chest and changed his mind kevins twentyfour he has his own life you wouldnt happen to have any copies of grooverat would you not hardly said drummond the two words were ripe with scorn the same flavor of contempt petra had just heard from uncle randolph machoman putdown of kevins latest nonsense this father that uncle two jock brothers growing up eccentric and unathletic wouldve been tough for poor kevin traumatic enough to twist him in the worst possible way not hardly said petra kevin took all his things with him when he moved out when was that after he graduated randolph drummond had received a copy of the zine around then at the advent of the maiden issue junior and dad had experienced a parting of the ways creative differences or dad tired of junior slacking off is kevin in school sir no frank drummonds mouth got tight is there some reason these questions bother you sir you bother me because i think youre bullshitting me if youre after the magazine why all these questions about kevin if hes under suspicion for something well thats just crap kevins a gentle kid making that sound like a character flaw twentyfouryearold kid petra said any idea who besides kevin wrote for grooverat drummond shook his head and worked at looking bored how did kevin finance his baby drummonds right hand moved to the lovely blue tie squeezed it into a ribbon let go if you want copies im sure kevs got some in his apartment if you see him tell him to call his mother she misses him as opposed to said stahl as they drove away what do you mean his mother misses him his father doesnt dysfunctional family said petra kevin was the resident sissy so where does that take us frank was evasive or just a lawyer who likes asking questions not answering them we made it pretty obvious were after more than back issues which is fine with me shake things up a bit see what happens what could happen said stahl i dont know what bothers me is were spending all this time chasing a kid and his stupid magazine you said he was a ghoul i did at the meeting said stahl you said yuri wanted the gory details was a ghoul true said petra so a half block of silence stahl said lets give his apartment another try it was close to pm petra used to working nights often found herself showering at this hour then wolfing a bowl of cereal all the paper and meetings on the armenian case and breaking in stahl and todays lunch with milo and alex and this entire futile afternoon had played havoc with her bio clock she felt queasy and fatigued sure she said why not kevin drummond was still out but a press of the managers button produced a highpitched yes petra identified herself and the door buzzed open and the detectives found themselves facetoface with a short stout woman in her fifties wearing a white blouse over black leggings and sneakers eyeglasses dangled from a chain around her neck a jumbo roller topped a mass of tooblack hair freshly waved locks hung down to her shoulders she said is everything okay mrs santos guadalupe santos open smile someone with a pleasant demeanor finally were looking for one of your tenants mrs santos unit fourteen kevin drummond yuri said santos thats what he calls himself yes is everything okay what kind of tenant is yuri nice boy quiet why do you want him wed like to talk to him as part of an investigation i dont think hes here i saw him hmm maybe two three days ago i met him out back taking out the garbage i was he got into his car his honda dmv had reported a fiveyearold civic but remembering the red accord in frank drummonds driveway petra said what color white said guadalupe santos so mr drummonds been gone for three days maybe he goes in and out when im sleeping but i never see him no problems from him easy tenant said santos his daddy pays his rent six months in advance he dont make noise wish they were all like that he have any friends regular visitors no girlfriends if thats what you mean or boyfriends santos smiled uneasily is yuri gay santos laughed no just kidding this is hollywood you know stahl said no visitors at all santos turned serious stahls contagious amiability now that i think about it youre right no one and he doesnt come and go much not the neatest guy but thats his business petra said youve been up to his apartment twice he had a leaky toilet and another time i had to show him how to work the heater not too mechanical a slob huh said petra not like dirty said santos hes just one of those howyoucallit holds on to everything pack rat thats it its a single and hes got it all filled up with boxes i couldnt tell you whats in them it just looked like he never throws anything out oh yeah i did see what was in one of them those little cars matchboxes my son used to collect them but not as many as yuris got only tony outgrew it hes in the marines over at camp pendleton training sergeant he spent time over in afghanistan my tony petra offered a congratulatory nod and a moment of respect for sergeant tony santos then so yuri collects stuff lots of stuff but like i said not dirty what kind of work does he do i dont think he does any said guadalupe santos with his daddy paying the rent and all that i figured him for you know what someone with i dont want to say problems someone who cant work regular what kind of problems said petra i dont want to say hes just real quiet walks with his head down like he doesnt want to talk big difference from the pushy guy whod hectored petra kevin chose his moments she showed kevin drummonds dmv picture to santos blurred picture five years old skinny kid with dark hair and a nondescript face brown and brown needs corrective lenses thats him said santos tall he wears glasses not such good skin some zits here and here touching her jawline and her temple like he had it bad when he was younger you know and it didnt all heal up sixtwo fit linus brophys description of baby boys killer would a skinny kid have been able to overpower vassily levitch sure given the element of surprise shy said petra what else hes like one of those someone whod like computers want to be by himself you know hes got tons of computer stuff up there too i dont know much about that kind of thing but it looks expensive with his daddy paying the rent i just figured hes a good tenant though no problems i hope he isnt in trouble youd hate to lose him as a tenant said stahl you bet said santos this business you never know what youre gonna get on the way back to the station just as the sun began to set petra spotted an elderly man and woman walking slowly up fountain avenue followed by a large white yellowbilled duck blinking to make sure she wasnt hallucinating she stopped backed up until she was even with the couple they kept plodding and she coasted at their pace two munchkins in heavy overcoats and knit caps veering toward androgynous twinhood the way very old people sometimes do ninety or close to it each step was labored the duck was unleashed and trailed them by inches its waddle looked a trifle offbalance the man looked over took the womans arms and they stopped nervous smiles probably some animal regulation being violated but who cared about that nice duck said petra this is horace said the woman hes been our baby for a long time the duck lifted a foot and scratched its belly tiny black eyes seemed to bore into petras protective she said hey there horace the ducks feathers ruffled have a nice day she said and pulled away from the curb stahl said what was that reality two days after the meeting with petra and stahl milo asked me to come along for a second interview with everett kipper its a dropin this time he said i called ahead but kippers in meetings all day why the renewed interest i said i want to talk to him about grooverat see if yuri drummond ever expressed an interest in interviewing julie petra and stahl havent been able to get hold of actual copies but drummonds looking more interesting hes a twentyfouryearold loner real name of kevin lives in a onebedroom pad on a scruffy part of rossmore hasnt been seen for several days isnt that intriguing the zine sounds like a vanity deal delusional daddys a lawyer pays the rent and probably the printing costs he wouldnt give petra the time of day im talking a real clamup hes a lawyer i said petra picked up definite family tension kevin sounds like the family weirdo and daddy was definitely not pleased to be discussing him a loner i said what a shock huh hes got a history of jumping from project to project from obsession to obsession exactly the fanatical personality you described hes also a pack rat his landlady says his apartments piled high with boxes including toys so maybe kill trophies are part of his collection he started doing the zine in his senior year petra found one partial copy and drummond lists himself as the entire editorial staff he asked an outrageous subscription price but theres no evidence anyone ever paid whered he go to school charter college which is pretty selective so hes probably smart just like youve been saying and hes tall sixtwo which would synch what the wino witness saw all in all its not a bad fit stahls staking out his apartment and petras still trying to learn more about grooverat to see if anyone distributed it if we can locate back issues and find the articles on baby boy and china and hopefully julie well ask for a warrant and wont get one but its something the orchestration of the murders had set me thinking of a killer in his thirties or forties and twentyfour seemed young but maybe kevin drummond was precocious and for the first time since the kipper case had opened milos voice was light i kept my mouth shut drove to century city the same ovoid waiting room the same toothy woman at the front desk no initial alarm this time just a chilly smile mr kippers gone to lunch where to maam i wouldnt know milo said you didnt make the reservation no reservation she said mr kipper prefers simple places business lunches at simple places mr kipper prefers to eat by himself what about the people hes been meeting with all morning the receptionist bit her lip milo said its okay he pays your salary you need to do what he tells you the city pays mine and im just as determined im sorry she said its just he doesnt want to talk to us any reason not that he mentioned hes like that like what not much of a talker she bit her lip please i understand said milo sounding as if he really did we left the office took the elevator down to street level darksuited men and women streamed in and out of the building if shes telling the truth about a simple place he said my guess is one of the food stands in the century city mall a block away meaning he probably walked and will return this way three massive granite planters filled with rubber trees punctuated the plaza in front of kippers building we chose one and sat on the rim twenty minutes later everett kipper appeared walking alone this time his suit was the color of a blued revolver tailored snug also fourbutton white shirt pink tie a flash of gold at his cuffs as he moved toward his building with that bouncing stride the business crowd in front had thickened and he passed us unmindful we got off the ledge and jogged toward him milo said mr kipper and kipper whipped around with the practiced tension of a martial arts fighter what now a few more questions sir about what could we talk up in your office i dont think so said kipper cops in the office is bad for business how long will this take just a few moments step over here he led us behind one of the rubber trees the plant cast spatulate shadows on his round smooth face what milo said ever hear of a magazine called grooverat no why were trying to trace any articles that might have been written about julie and this magazine wrote one kipper shook his head julie never mentioned it whys that important were conducting a careful investigation said milo kipper said the answers still no never heard of it are you aware of any publicity julie received recently she got none and it bugged her back in new york when she had her gallery show at anthony she got plenty the new york times mentioned the show in their arts section and i think some of the other papers did too she remembered that being obscure was part of what was painful what else was painful failure no publicity at all for the light and space show kipper shook his head she told me light and space sent a notice of the group show to the la times but they didnt deign to run it wait a second there was one magazine that did want an interview not the one you mentioned nothing with rat in the title what was it shit not that it mattered julie was pretty jazzed about it but in the end they crapped out canceled she waited but the writer stood her up she was not happy called the editor and bitched in the end they ran a piece something short probably to mollify her review of the show i said no this was before the show maybe a month for all i know julie called them herself she was trying to drum up publicity for herself for the comeback kipper tweaked his nose she really believed she had a shot she didnt kipper looked as if he wanted to spit the art world i what was the name of the magazine scene something a wiseass name she showed me a copy looked vapid to me but i didnt say anything because julie was excited scene seldomscene something now im out of here he turned and walked away the flaps of his suit coat billowed no breeze blew through the plaza creating his own turbulence seldomsceneatoll was listed in west hollywood on santa monica near la cienega and the address turned out to be a genuine office building twostory chocolate brick squeezed between a florist and a strip mall full of cars and short tempers milo left the unmarked in a loading space in the mall lot and we entered the building through a door emblazoned with a no solicitors sign the directory listed theatrical agencies nutritionists a yoga school business managers and jaguar tutorialsssa in a secondfloor suite sharing space i said no media empire jaguar tutorials said milo what they train you to become a predator the ambience said none of the occupants had made it to stardomhealthwealth shabby gray halls filthy gray carpeting dehydrated plywood doors a reek that said quirky plumbing an elevator whose lights didnt respond to a button push we took the stairs breathing in insecticide and dancing around sprinkles of dead roaches he knocked on the jaguarssa door didnt wait for a reply and twisted the knob on the other side was a smallish single room set up with four movable workstations cute little computers in multicolored boxes scanners printers photocopiers machines i couldnt identify electrical cord linguini coiled atop the vinyl floor the walls were covered with enlargements of framed ssa covers all of a type maliciously lit photos of young malnourished beautiful people lolling in bodyconscious clothing and radiating contempt for the audience lots of vinyl and rubber the duds looked cheap but probably required a mortgage male and female models nefertiti eye makeup for both slashes of purplish cheek blush for the skinny women fourday beards for their male counterparts a dreadlocked darkskinned man in his late twenties wearing a black and bumblebee yellow striped tshirt and yellow cargo pants hunched at the nearest pc typing nonstop i glanced at his screen graphics escher by way of tinkertoys he ignored us or didnt notice miniearphones produced something that held his attention the two central stations were unoccupied at the rearmost computer a young woman in her midtwenties also plugged in aurally sat reading people chubby and babyfaced she wore a black patentleather jumpsuit and red moonwalker shoes bobbed in time to what seemed to be a threefour beat her hair was unremarkable brown sprayed into a fifties bouffant she turned toward us arched an eyebrow an eyebrow tattoo and the beefy steel ring piercing the center of the arch flipped up then clicked down the loop in her upper lip remained stationary so did the score of studs lining her ears and the painfullooking little knoblet parked in the center of her chin what she shouted then she yanked out the earphones kept bobbing her head one two three one two three waltz of the young and metallic what she repeated milos badge elicited twin tattoo arches the outlines of her mouth had been inked in permanently as well so she said im looking for the publisher of seldomsceneatoll she thumped her chest and made ape sounds you found her were looking for information on an artist juliet kipper whats up with her you know her didnt say that nothings up with her anymore said milo she was murdered the eyebrow ring drooped but the face below it remained bland whoa whoa whoa she said and she got up walked over to the graphics guy jabbed his shoulder looking regretful he pulled off his phones juliet kipper did we feature her who kipper dead artist she got murdered um he said what kind of artist the girl looked at us milo said she was a painter weve been told you wrote about her ms patti padgett big smile a notsmall diamond was inlaid in her left frontal incisor milo smiled back and took out his pad there you go patti padgett said always wanted to be part of the official police record when did we supposedly write about the late ms kipper within the last few months well that narrows it down she said weve only put out two issues in six months youre a quarterly were a broke patti padgett returned to her desk opened a drawer began rummaging lets see if whatshername julie merited our howd she die strangled said milo ooh any idea who did it not yet yet said padgett i like your optimism the greatest generation and all that bumblebeeshirt said that was world war ii patricia hes vietnam he glanced at us as if waiting for confirmation received blank stares and put his earphones back on and bopped dreadlocks swaying whatever said padgett here we go three months ago she placed the magazine in her lap licked her thumb turned pages not many pages between the covers it didnt take long for her to say okaay here she is right in our mamadada section sounds like someone liked her she brought the article to us mamadada was a compendium of short pieces on local artists juliet kipper shared the page with an emigrant croatian fashion photographer and a dog trainer who moonlighted as a video artist the piece on julie kipper was two paragraphs noted the promising new york debut the decade of personal and artistic disappointments the wouldbe rebirth as an essentially nihilistic conveyor of california dreamin and ecological schemin nothing id seen in kippers landscapes had connoted nihilism to me but what did i know kippers work the writer concluded makes it obvious that her vision is more of a paean to the paradoxical holism of wishful thinking than a serious attempt to concretize and cartograph the photosynthetic dissonance upheaval and mulchagitation that has captivated other west coast painters authors credit fs mulchagitation mumbled milo glancing at me i shook my head patti padgett said i think it means moving dirt around or something like that total foggoma right she laughed most of the art stuff we print is like that wouldbes with no ability hitching a ride on the talent train milo said leeches on the body artistic padgett stared up at him with naked worship you want a gig not in this rotation hindu makedo padgett told bumblebee be threatened todd im in love milo said if you dont like the writing why do you print it because its there mon gendarme and some of our readership digs it she spit out another laugh set off a metal whirligig with our budget we aint exactly the new yawker honeybunch our focusmy focus cause what i like is what flies is lots of fashion some interior design a little film a little music we toss in the finesyartsy shitsy because some people think its cool and in our niche market cool is everything milo said whos fs hmm said padgett she returned to bumblebee and lifted an earphone todd whos fs who the credit on the kipper story its signed fs how would i know i didnt even remember kipper padgett turned to us todd doesnt know either dont you keep a file of contributors wow said padgett this is getting seriously investigative whats the deal a serial vampire killer milo chuckled what makes you say that i dig the xfiles cmon tell patti sorry patti he said nothing exotic were collecting information he smiled at her maam maam she said placing a blacknailed hand over a generous breast be still my fluttering heart hey how about you guys let me follow you around and write up what you do day in the life and all that im a kickass writer mfa from yale same for todd were as dynamic a duo as you could hope to encounter maybe one day said milo do you keep a contributor file do we todd off came the earphones again padgett repeated the question todd said not really not really said milo ive got a quasi file said todd but its random data inputted as it comes in no alphabetization in your computer said milo todds stare said where else could you please call it up todd turned to padgett isnt there a first amendment issue here puhleeze said padgett these guys are going to let us ride with them well do a kickass law enforcement issue use that strungout cambodian model for the cover whatshername with the sixteensyllable name doll her up in a tight blue uniform give her a riding crop a gun the works well rock todd cleared his screen of graphics it took a second here it is fs faithful scrivener milo hunched lower and stared at the screen thats it no other name the proverbial what you see said todd this is how the submission came in this is how i log it when you paid what name did you put on the check right said todd hahaha said padgett you dont pay padgett said we pay the cover models and the photographers as little as we can sometimes if we get someone with a genuine résumé a screenwriter with a credit we can scratch up something like a dime a word mostly we dont pay because no one pays us distributors refuse to advance us the wholesale price until returns are caculated we get royalties only for issues sold and that takes months she shrugged its a sad day for entrepreneurship todd said she was an undergrad econ major at brown as a sop to daddy said padgett he runs corporations how long have you been publishing i said four years said todd adding with pride we are currently four hundred thousand in the hole in hock to my daddy said padgett to appease him we maintain a job jaguar tutorials said milo which is sat preparation said padgett lifting a business card from her desk and flashing it at us patricia s padgett ba brown mfa yale senior consultant jaguar tutorials our mission should we accept it she said is to educate the offspring of anxietyridden social climbers in the fine points of college entrance exams milo said jaguar as in the connotation said todd is of mastery and swiftness also said padgett of upscale as in jagooar motorcars we cant afford beverly hills rent but we want to pull in the bh kids todd said the ivy league thing helps padgett said todd did his undergrad at princeton so said milo turning back to the screen this faithful scrivener person sent you a piece under a pseudonym and you printed it and never paid looks that way said todd this notation ott means an overthetransom submission padgett said thats publishingspeak for we didnt solicit it it just showed up you get a lot of that plenty mostly garbage real garbage im talking illiterate has fs written any other pieces for you lets see said todd he scrolled heres one all the way back at the beginning to padgett back in issue two milo read the date three and a half years ago she said the halcyon days look at this evidence clues red herrings were stylin and sleuthin todd hey officer can we get cool badges too she went and got a copy of issue two faithful scriveners first piece was in a section entitled pits and peaches brutal reviews alternating with mindless raves this one a peach two paragraphs singing the praises of a promising young dancer named angelique bernet review of a ballet concert at the mark taper in la experimental piece by a chinese composer entitled the swans of tianenmen two months before bernets murder in boston the company had been to la first angelique had been part of a trio of ballerinas featured during the final act fs had picked her out because of slapintheface cygnian grace so fully synched with the tenor of the composition that it tightens ones scrotum this is dance as in paleoinstinctuobioenergetics so right so real so unashamedly erotic her artistry sets her apart from the palsiform pretendeurs that comprise the rest of la compagnie allegement ouch said padgett we really need to be more selective cygnian said milo todd said it means swanlike its on the advanced sat vocab list tight scrotum said padgett he had the hots for her what are we dealing with some kind of sexual psycho milo said could you print copies of both articles and as long as were at it have you ever run anything by someone named drummond padgett pouted i ask he doesnt answer please said milo smiling at her again but talking in the low threatening tones of a bear emerging from its cave padgett said yeah yeah sure first name said todd check any drummond check bulldog said padgett no one laughed no record of kevin or yuri or any other drummond showed up in the ssa contributor files no articles on baby boy lee or china maranga either but todd did find a writeup of a recital given by vassily levitch another pits and peaches entry one year ago levitch had played one piece at a group recital in santa barbara another over the transom said milo the byline e murphy the hyperbolic sexually loaded prose evoked faithful scrivener levitch was lithe as a harem houri as he stroked bartoks tumescent etude and squeezed every drop from the timespaceinfinity between notes padgett rotated her chin stud boy do we print crap this walk down memory lane is not making me proud todd said keep your perspective patti your old man markets toxic chemicals patti padgett photocopied the articles and walked us to the door sticking close to milo he said ever hear of grooverat nope is it a band a zine there are hundreds of those she said anyone with a scanner and a printer can do one her smile began fresh ended up old sad defeated anyone with a rich dad can take it a step higher as we got back in the car milos cell phone chirped the first seven notes of für elise he slapped it to his ear grunted said yeah ill be there asap treat her nice to me vassily levitchs mother flew in last night from new york and is waiting for me at the station maybe shell know something that ties levitch to drummond beyond e murphy so what was that all about drummond using pen names and if hes got his own zine why send stuff to patti and todd the bernet piece was written before grooverat was started if kevin was the author he wouldve still been a sophomore maybe he sent the others because patti and todd were getting distribution and he wasnt the need for exposure he said lots of sex in the prose he wants to screw them he wants to own them i said and he traveled to do it levitchs recital was in santa barbara angelique bernet was reviewed in la but murdered in boston if you could verify his presence in boston at the time that would be grounds for a warrant yeah he said but how do i verify without a warrant the airlines have tightened up bigtime and kevins family isnt going to volunteer the info we traveled west on santa monica when we reached doheny i said if drummond freelanced for seldomscene he may very well have submitted to other magazines his hands clenched around the wheel what if the bastard uses a dozen pseudonyms what do i do find some expert to conduct linguistic analysis of every fringe mag in the country id start with faithful scrivener and e murphy bylines see where that leads extracurricular reading meanwhile a grieving mother waits a few blocks later he said any other insights from the writing its the type of inflated prose you see in college papers writing to impress if its kevin were dealing with he didnt get strokes at home channeled his energies into projects came to see himself as a maven of the art world id check his college newspaper for reviews see if the writing matches you keep saying that if its kevin something bothers me i admitted even at twentyfour kevin seems young for these killings if he murdered angelique bernet he did it at the age of twentyone there are elements of angelique that fit a novice multiple stab wounds that could mean a blitz attack the body left out in the open but traveling three thousand miles from his comfort zones pretty calculated what about this he said he sees bernet dance in la gets the hots writes her up checks the ballet companys travel schedule takes a trip to boston maybe hes not even sure why all sorts of feelings bouncing around in his head then he stalks her follows her to cambridge makes contact with her he couldve even come on to her and she rejected him he freaks out does her flies home sits thinking about it realizes what he did that he got away with it finally hes succeeded at something thirteen months after that china disappears the killer takes time to bury her and no one finds her for months because now hes being careful plotting it out and hes close to home make any sense if hes a gifted boy excitable boy he said like that song the recent murders fit with rising confidence i said all three were done right at the venues in baby boys and levitchs cases with the audience still present in julies with coco barnes in the next room that stinks of audaciousness could be hes practiced his craft is feeling like a virtuoso practiced meaning other murders we dont know about thirteen months lapsed between angelique and china then nothing for nearly two years until baby boy after that weve got six weeks to julie and nine weeks to levitch great he said the alternative is he managed somehow to suppress his urges for years and now hes losing control how could he suppress by obsessing on a new project grooverat being a publisher could grant serious illusions of power perhaps hes finally realized that the zines a failure yet another one daddy pulled the plug from what petra says daddy was never enthusiastic the art world fails him he said so he takes it out on the artists lets get back to the sexual angle weve got male and female victims whats that say a bisexual killer or a sexually confused killer i said certainly a sexually inadequate killer in no case was there any penetration hes intimidated by the clash of genitalia substitutes the eroticism of talent targeting talent on the rise he captures their essence at its peak hows that for a cheap freudian shot youre talking about an artistic cannibal he said im talking i said about the ultimate critic back at my house alone allison was in boulder colorado for a conference after that shed be traveling to attend her former fatherinlaws birthday id driven her to the airport and shed spent the night at my house after i stashed her suitcases in the car she removed something from her purse and handed it to me petite chromeplated automatic as i took it she said heres the clip and gave me that too forgot to leave it at home she explained cant get on the plane with it could you keep it for me sure i placed the gun in my pocket its registered but i have no carry permit if that bothers you you can put it in the house ill chance it ready to go yup as we neared the south she said youre not going to ask i figure youve got a reason the reason is after what happened to me when i finally got my head straight i told myself id avoid feeling that helpless again i started with the usual stuff selfdefense courses basic safety manuals then years later when i was a postdoc i treated a woman whod been raped twice two separate incidents years apart the first time she blamed herself shed been outofhermind drunk got picked up by a lowlife in a bar the second time was some monster managing to jimmy a closed bedroom window i did all i could for her looked up gun shops in the yellow pages bought my little chromium friend makes sense does it you kept it i like it she said i really think of it as my friend im a pretty good shot took basic and intermediate training still go to the range once a month though ive missed a couple of months because weve been spending time sorry to distract you she touched my face does it bother you no youre sure within ten years id shot two men to death both had been out to kill me evil men selfdefense no option sometimes i still dreamed about them and woke up with acid in my stomach i said in the end we look out for ourselves true she said i didnt really forget to leave it home i wanted you to know eric stahl sat and drank water tap water in a halfgallon sprite bottle hed brought it from home watching kevin drummonds apartment on rossmore hed arrived before sunrise checked out the rear of the building treading catlight on old sneakers sure not to squeak no sign of kevin drummonds car no surprise he found himself a good spot catercornered from the dingy brick building nice oblique angle he could study the entrance without straining his head a passerby would have no idea what he was after not that a passerby would be likely to notice plenty of vehicles on the block and stahl had brought his personal wheels a beige chevy van with windows tinted way beyond the legal limit all the comforts of during the first hour a blue jay had swooped and cast a shadow across the building since then very few signs of life seven hours twentytwo minutes of watching torture for someone else stahl was as close to content as he could be sit drink bottled water sit stare put the pictures out of your head keep it clear keep everything clear i volunteered a visit to charter college where id try to find a sample of kevin drummonds writing thanks milo said good idea you being professorial and all that im professorial you can be its a compliment ive got great respect for academia before i started out i took care of some unfinished business second attempt to reach christian bangsley née sludge now ceo of hearth and home restaurants it had been months since the first call this time the youngsounding receptionist put me through as i introduced myself bangsley cut me off i got the first message he said didnt call back because i have nothing to tell you was anyone stalking china silence he said why after all these years its still an open case what do you know i never saw anyone bugging china tension in his voice made me persist but she did tell you something shit he said look ive put all that past me but there are assholes out there who dont want me to recalling the internet flamesexchinawhiteboy sells out ends up cappig cancerous bigtiiime i said are you being stalked yourself nothing regular but sometimes i get letters people who claim to be fans and dont like what im doing people living in the past have you contacted the police my lawyers say its not worth it that people telling me theyre unhappy with how im running my life is no crime free country and all that but i dont want publicity the only reason im talking to you now is my lawyers said if you tried again i should that if i didnt youd think i was being evasive which im not i just cant help you okay im sorry youre being harassed and i promise to keep anything you tell me under wraps silence i said what happened to china went well beyond harassment i know i know jesus okay here it is china bitched once about someone bugging her following her i didnt take it seriously because she was always paranoid about something highstrung the band used to joke shed been weaned on chili peppers when did she start complaining a month or two before she disappeared i told the cops they blew me off said i needed more details it was worthless what exactly did china complain about she was convinced she was being peeped stalked whatever but she never actually saw someone couldnt describe anyone so maybe the cops were right she talked about it being a feeling but china had lots of feelings especially when she was high which was most of the time she could get paranoid over nothing just blow up she never went to the police right said bangsley china and the police the thing is she wasnt scared she was pissed kept saying if the asshole ever showed his face shed break it claw out his eyes and shit in the sockets that was china always aggression was it real i said what do you mean was she really that fearless or was it a cover i dont know he said i really dont she was hard to read had this wall around her drugs were the mortar paul brancusi had mentioned nothing about any stalker i said did china tell anyone else about being followed the other members of the band i doubt it why he hesitated china and i were closer she was officially gay but for a while we had a thing going on shit this is exactly what i didnt want im married now expecting my second kid no ones interested in your love life i said just what you know about chinas stalker i dont even know if there was a stalker like i told you she never actually saw anything a feeling i said exactly said bangsley china had a vivid mind when you were with her you had to be careful to step back put things in perspective at the time did you believe her i fluctuated she could be convincing one time we were up in the hills late at night smoking weed doing other good stuff and suddenly she went rigid and her eyes got scary and she grabbed my shoulders hard it hurt then she stands up and says fuck hes here i can feel him then she starts walking around in circles like a gun turret on a tank like shes aiming herself at something and she starts screaming into the darkness fuck you you asshole fuck come out and show your fuckshit face waving her fist crouching down like shes ready to go karatenuts at that moment i believed her the darkness the quiet how certain she was convinced me later i said to myself what was that what happened after she screamed nothing i got worried someone would hear her tried to get her down the hill and into my car she made me wait until she convinced herself whoever was up there was gone we crashed at my place the next morning she was gone shed eaten all the munchies in my fridge and split a month or two later she disappeared and when they finally found her i freaked out because the place she was buried wasnt far from where we were sitting that night did you tell the cops after the way they treated me china was found near the hollywood sign exactly he said thats where we were under the sign china loved the sign liked the story of some actress throwing herself off there used to be a riding ranch up there one of those rentahorse deals china told me she liked to sneak in at night talk to the horses smell the horseshit just wander around she said she got off on walking around other peoples property made her feel like a manson girl she went through this phase where she was into the manson family talked about writing a song dedicated to charlie but we told her we wouldnt play it even then we had some kind of standards enamored of serial killers no just manson and she wasnt serious about that it was just another china thing something came into her head it poured right out of her mouth anything for attention she loved attention which was mansons thing right i remember thinking how weird it was that maybe shed been murdered by some manson type ironic you know charter college was acres nestled in the northeast corner of eagle rock set apart from that bedroom communitys bluecollar mostly latino bedrock sensibilities by ivycovered stucco walls and grandiose trees the college had been established years ago when eagle rocks twelvehundredfoot elevation and clean air had led developers to frame it the switzerland of the west over a century later the surrounding hills were pretty on the uncommon clear day but chain motels were the closest eagle rock came to resort living i drove up eagle rock boulevard a broad sunbleached haven for garages and auto parts emporia turned onto college road and entered a residential neighborhood of small craftsman bungalows and chunky stucco cottages an arch emblazoned with the schools crest fed into emeritus lane a broad spotless strip heralded by a shieldshaped flower bed spelling out the institutions name in red and white petunias the campus buildings were beauxarts and monterey colonial visions all painted the same graydun and set gemlike in the jewel box of oldgrowth greenery id treated a few charter students over the years was familiar with the schools basic flavor selective expensive established by congregationalists but decidedly secular now with a bent toward activist politics and community involvement visitor parking was easy and free i picked up a campus map from a takeone stand and made my way to the anna loring slater library a good number of the handsome kids i passed were smiling as if life tasted delicious and they were ready for the next course the library was a twostory twenties masterpiece with a mediocre fourstory eighties addition tacked to its south wing the ground floor was all hush and computerclick a hundred or so students glued to their screens i asked a librarian the name of the school paper and where id find back copies the daily bobcat he said everythings online i found a computer station and logged on the bobcat file contained sixtytwo years of back issues for the first forty the paper had been published as a weekly kevin drummond was twentyfour meaning hed probably enrolled six years ago i backed up a year to be careful and set about scrolling thousands of pages and scanning bylines nothing with drummonds name on it showed up for the first three years no pieces by faithful scrivener or e murphy either then in the march of what turned out to be drummonds junior spring semester i got my first hit kevin drummond communications had penned a review of a showcase at the roxy on sunset seven new bands doing their thing in hopes of a breakthrough thumbnail reviews of every act kevin drummond had liked three hated four his prose was straightforward uninspired with none of the puffery or the sexual imagery of the seldomscene pieces i found eleven more articles spread out over a year and half ten writeups of rock acts similarly bland the exception was interesting may of drummonds senior year faithful scrivener byline a retrospective look at the career of baby boy lee this one longer gushing termed baby boy a manifest icon whose elephantoid shoulders may sag atlassly under the ponderous mantle of robert johnson blind lemon jackson the entire pantheon of deltachicagocrawaching royalty but whose soul is whole and will never be sold baby boy deserves the weight and the pain of geniuss crushing burden he is an artist with too much emotional integrity and psychopathology to ever achieve longlasting popular acclaim the essay ended by quoting lyrics from the totemic aortastraining lament a cold heart and concluded that to a bluesman the world will always be a coldhearted unwelcoming treacherous place nowhere does the adage no gain without pain apply more than in the noir universe of smoky bars loose women and sad endings that has fed the genius of every scurvied picker and addicted stringbender from time immemorial baby boy lee may never be a happy man but his music raw and vital and resolutely uncommercial will continue to warm the hearts of many a year later lee had put the lie to that thesis by sitting in on the sessions that produced tic s monster pop hit cognitive dissonance but on the face not much of a motive for murder i needed to know more about kevin drummond charter colleges communications department was housed in frampton hall a majestic doriccolumned affair separated from the library by a fiveminute stroll inside were worn mahogany walls a domed ceiling and cork floors that muted footsteps the building also hosted the departments of english history humanities womens studies and romance languages communications shared the third floor with the latter two three faculty members were listed on the directory professor e g martin chair professor s santorini professor a gordon shull start at the top chairperson martins corner suite was fronted by an empty reception area the door leading to an inner office was six inches ajar and a keyboard clickclack solo in the same key as the library sound track leaked into the anteroom sepia photos of charter college in its infancy decorated the walls big clean buildings dominating twiggy saplings grim celluloidcollared men and highbuttoned women with the resolute look of the heavensent a sign above the nearest file spelled out the chairs full name elizabeth gala martin phd i approached the inner office professor martin a sentence worth of keypresses then silence yes i stated my name and appended my academic appointment at the med school downtown and cracked the door another couple of inches professorial a very dark black woman in a calflength topaz silk dress and matching pumps came around from her desk she had coldwaved hennaed hair wore a string of pearls and matching earrings forty or so plump pretty puzzled sharp licorice eyes above gold halfmoon glasses looked me over professor of pediatrics an alto that might have been mellow under other circumstances sectioned each word into precise syllables i dont recall any appointment i dont have one i said showing her my lapd consultant id she came closer read the small print frowned police whats this all about nothing alarming but if youd be kind enough to spare me a moment she stepped back and appraised me again this is irregular to say the least i apologize i was doing research in your library and your name came up if youd rather set up an appointment my name came up how as chair of communications im looking into one of your alumni a man named kevin drummond youre looking into him she said meaning the police are yes what exactly is mr drummond suspected of do you know him i know the name were a small department what has mr drummond done maybe nothing i said maybe murder elizabeth g martin removed her glasses dull thumps sounded from the corridor shoes on cork youthful chatter crescendoed and diminished she said lets not stand out here her office was persiancarpeted booklined compulsively neat with two walls of windows that looked out to luxuriant lawns california impressionist landscapes probably valuable probably collegeowned hung wherever the bookshelves left off elizabeth martins berkeley phd and ten years of ensuing academic honors were heralded on the wall behind her carved gildedage partners desk on the desk were a smoke gray laptop and an assortment of crystal office niceties a green marble fireplace hosted a rack of cold scorched logs she sat down and motioned me to do the same what exactly is going on i tried to be forthcoming with as few details as possible well all thats dandy professor delaware but there are first amendment issues here not to mention academic freedom and common courtesy you dont really expect to waltz in here and have us throw open our files simply because that would abet your investigation whatever its alleged to be im not interested in confidential information about kevin drummond just anything that might be relevant to a criminal investigation such as disciplinary problems elizabeth martin remained impassive i said were talking multiple murders if drummond turns out to be involved in criminal activities that will become public if he posed problems here and charter hushed it up the college will be drawn in is that a threat no i said just a statement of how these things play themselves out police consultant your academic departments comfortable with your activities do you keep them fully apprised i smiled is that a threat martin rubbed her hands together a silverframed photo on the mantel showed her in a formal red gown next to a tuxedoed grayhaired man ten years older another shot pictured her in casual clothes with the same man behind them goldandrust tileroofed buildings in the background a diagonal stretch of teal canal the curve of a gondola prow venice she said whatever the contingencies i cant go along with this fair enough i said but if theres something i should know that the police should know and you do eventually find a way of helping it will make a lot of peoples lives easier she picked a gold pen from a leather box and drummed the desk i can tell you this i cant recall kevin drummond posing any problems for the department there was nothing homicidal about him at all the pen tapped her inbox really professor delaware this all sounds quite outlandish did you teach kevin personally when did he graduate two years ago then id have to say yes two years ago i was still teaching my massmedia seminar and every communications major was required to take it but you have no specific recollection of teaching him its a popular class she said without hubris communications is an arm of charters humanities nexus our students take core classes in other departments and vice versa i assume kevin drummond had a faculty advisor i wasnt his advisor i work with the honor students kevin wasnt an honor student if he was id have a specific recollection she began typing on the laptop dismissed stepping down the hall to seek out professors santorini and shull was unlikely to escape her scrutiny id find some other way to contact her colleagues or have milo do it id gotten up when she said his advisor was gordon shull which is lucky for you because professor susan santorinis doing research in france astonished by the sudden turn i said may i talk to professor shull be my guest she said if hes in his office is two doors to the left outside in the mahogany corridor several students lounged down a ways near romance languages no one congregating at communications a gordon shulls office door was locked and my knock was answered by silence i was writing a note when a hearty voice said can i help you a man wearing a backpack had just come up the rear staircase midthirties six feet tall wellbuilt he had ginger hair buzzed to the skull and an angular heavybrowed windtoughened face he wore a redandblack plaid shirt black tie black jeans brown hiking boots the backpack was army green pale blue eyes craggy features five day stubblebeard handsome in a coarse way a national geographic photographer or a naturalist adept at obtaining grants to study rare species professor shull im gordie shull whats up i repeated the spiel id given elizabeth martin a gordon shull said kevin its been what a couple of years whats the problem there may be none his name came up in an investigation what kind of investigation homicide shull stepped back loosened the pack scratched his big chin youre kidding kevin he flexed his shoulders this is mindblowing when kevin was your student did he pose any problems problems disciplinary problems no he was a little how can i put this eccentric he pulled a large chrome key ring out of his jeans and unlocked the door i probably shouldnt be talking to you privacy and all that but homicide i guess i should check this out with my boss before we go further his eyes traveled down the hall to elizabeth martins office professor martin directed me to you shes the one who told me you were kevin drummonds advisor did she hmm well then okay i guess his office was a third the size of the bosss mochawalled and gloomydark until he raised the blind on a single narrow window the panes were blocked by a massive knobby tree trunk and it took shulls flicking the lights on to brighten the room faculty status was clearly demarcated at charter college shulls desk and bookshelves were almostwood danish modern his side chairs graypainted metal no california impressionism here just two posters for contemporary art exhibitions in new york and chicago two blackframed diplomas hung askew behind the desk a bachelors degree fifteen years ago from charter college and a masters four years later from the university of washington shull tossed his backpack in a corner and sat down kevin drummond wow in what way was he eccentric he swung his feet atop his desk and placed his hands behind his head his basictraining hairdo revealed a large knobby skull beneath the ginger stubble youre not actually saying the kids a murderer not at all just that his name came up during an investigation how i wish i could tell you shull grinned no fair what can you tell me about him youre a psychologist they sent you because someone thinks kevins psychologically disturbed sometimes the police feel im right for a specific task incredible for some reason your names familiar i smiled he smiled back okay kevin drummonds eccentricity for starts he kept to himself at least from what i saw no friends no campus involvement but not a scary kid quiet thoughtful mediumbright not too socially adept how much contact did you have with him we met from time to time for curriculum guidance that kind of thing he seemed to be drifting seemed not to be enjoying the college experience which is nothing unusual lots of kids get down depressed i said youre the psychologist said shull but yes id have to say so now that i think about it i never saw him smile i tried to draw him out he wasnt much for casual conversation intense shull nodded definitely intense serious kid no sense of humor that i ever noticed what were his interests hmm said shull id have to say pop culture which would describe half our students theyre products of their upbringing what do you mean the zeitgeist said shull if your parents were anything like mine you got some grounding in books theater art todays undergrads are likely to grow up in homes where episodic tvs the entertainment of choice its a little tough getting them jazzed about quality my childhood had been grounded in silence and gin i said what aspects of pop culture interested kevin all of it music art in that sense he fit the department perfectly elizabeth martin dictates that we take a holistic approach art as a general rubric the interface of the art world with other aspects of the culture mediumbright i said dont ask me to tell you his grades thats a definite nono how about a ballpark appraisal shull turned toward the treefilled window rubbed his head loosened his tie weve moved onto touchy ground my friend the college is adamant about protecting grade confidentiality would it be fair to call him a mediocre student shull laughed very softly okay lets go with that was there a change in his grade pattern over time shull hesitated i might possibly recall a slight drop in effort toward the end of his stay here when the last couple of years right after angelique bernets murder sometime before hed graduated kevin drummond had conceived grooverat i said are you aware that kevin tried his hand at publishing oh that said shull his zine you saw it he talked to me about it in fact it was the only time i ever saw him get animated he never showed you the zine he showed me some articles hed written shulls smile was crooked rueful he was needy for praise i tried to comply but his writing wasnt praiseworthy i said shull shrugged he was a kid he wrote like a kid meaning sophomoric junioromoric seniormoric i get a steady diet of it which is fine any craft takes time to develop the only difference between kevin and hundreds of other kids is that he thought he was ready for the big time did you let him know he wasnt lord no said shull why would i shatter his confidence a troubled kid like that i knew the world would do that to him all by itself a troubled kid i said youre telling me hes involved in murder shull returned to his chair i really dont want to badmouth him he was quiet a little weird a little delusional about his talent thats all i dont want to make him sound like a maniac he wasnt that different from other nerdytypes ive seen he placed his elbows on the desk and looked at me earnestly theres no way you could give me any details is there my old journalistic impulses are coming to the fore sorry i said so you went from journalism to academia academia has its charms said shull what else can you tell me about kevin thats really it and ive got office hours in a few minutes i wont take much more of your time professor what else can you tell me about kevins publishing dreams shull pulled on his chin once he got on the publishing kick his senior year it was all he could talk about kids are like that like what obsessive we accept them to college and call them adults but theyre really still adolescents and adolescents obsess entire industries have been built on that fact what was kevin obsessed with success i suppose did he have a particular point of view with regard to what art art echoed shull once again were talking adolescent attitudes kevin adhered to the seminal sophomoric belief whats that anticommercialism if it sells it sucks basic dormdebate stuff he told you that more than once you feel differently my job is to nurture the little ducklings not pepper them with the buckshot of criticism when kevin showed you his articles did you do any editing not his articles on papers id assigned i suggested minor revisions howd he take criticism well shull shook his knobby head very well as a matter of fact sometimes he asked for more i guess he looked up to me i got the feeling he wasnt getting much support anywhere else are you aware kevin wrote arts reviews for the daily bobcat those said shull he was quite proud of them he showed them to you showed them off i suppose he came to trust me which didnt mean pizzaandbeer anything outside of office hours kevin wasnt that type of kid what type is that the kind youd enjoy having a beer with i said did he tell you about his pen names shulls eyebrows arced what pen names faithful scrivener i said e murphy he used them to write for his zine and other arts magazines did he said shull how curious why i was hoping you could tell me professor enough with the title call me gordie pen names youre implying kevin was concealing something kevins motivations are still a mystery i said well i wouldnt know about any pen names you said his grades dropped over time did you notice any change in his writing style how so he seems to have gone from simple and direct to wordy and pretentious ouch said shull youre the critic not me he pulled down his tie opened the collar of his plaid shirt pretentious no on the contrary the little i saw of kevins development seemed to indicate improvement a little more elegance but i guess that would make sense if youre right about kevin being disturbed if his mind deteriorated that would show up in his writing wouldnt it now im sorry but i do have an appointment when we reached the door he said i dont know what it is you think kevin did probably dont want to know but i have to say i feel sorry for him whys that instead of answering he opened the door and we stepped out into the hallway a pretty asian girl sat on the floor a few feet away when she saw shull she got to her feet and smiled he said go in amy be with you in a sec when the girl was gone i said why do you feel sorry for kevin sad kid he said lousy writer and now youre telling me hes a psycho killer id say that qualifies for pitiable i left the college got on the east and was headed back toward la when my cell phone beeped milo said last couple hours i couldve used you grief counseling with levitchs mom vassily was a wonderful son boy prodigy total genius apple of mamas eye who in the world would want to hurt him then i got a prelim report from my ds nothing turned up on the bristol street neighborhood canvass and all the audience members theyve talked to noticed nothing out of the ordinary ditto for the security guard and the parking valets so whoever offed vassily either blended in or slipped in unnoticed you said the audience was older wouldnt a kid like kevin drummond stand out maybe he went in disguise maybe he took a backrow seat in the darkness plus you attend a piano recital youre not exactly looking for suspicious characters there are still some personal checks from the nonmembers to go over get over to the college yet i did kevin drummond wrote a few arts reviews for the student paper for the most part nothing illuminating but during his senior year shortly before he started grooverat his style shifted suddenly from straightforward prose to what we found in the seldomscene pieces maybe he experienced some sort of psychological change at that time going schizo not if hes our guy these crimes are too organized for a schizophrenic but a mood disorder mania would fit with the overheated prose and the delusions of grandeur which is how drummonds faculty advisor described his publishing plans mania can mean a loosening of boundaries and inhibitions and periodic departures from usual demeanor the advisor describes kevin as quiet unassertive he had no friends was very serious a mediocre student with high aspirations not fun to be around all of which could be the depressive component of a bipolar disorder another thing that synchs with mania is the hoarding behavior his landlady described the history of flitting from fad to fad may very well have been a precursor to a manic break manias not often associated with violence but when it is the violence can be serious so now weve got a diagnosis he said but no patient tentative diagnosis the advisor also said kevin felt strongly that commercial success and quality were incompatible by itself that means little he termed it dormroom doctrine and hes right but most college students move past dorm life and develop autonomy kevin doesnt seem to have made big strides in that direction arrested development success is corrupt so nip it in the bud meanwhile no sign of him and its looking more and more as if hes rabbited petra says stahls been on the apartment like a rash hasnt caught a glimpse of the guy im putting a bolo on drummonds honda but without declaring him an official suspect itll be prioritized at the bottom of the basket despite the missing car its possible drummonds holed up in his apartment i said a loner like that some canned soup and a laser printer could sustain him for a while has stahl checked he had the landlady knock no answer no sounds of movement on the other side of the door stahl thought of having her use her master key go in on pretense of a gas leak whatever but he thought better of it called petra she called me and we all decided to wait just in case a search does pull up something serious kevins daddy is a lawyer we ever bust the kid hes gonna be represented by a shark no sense jumping the gun and risking an evidentiary mess just to make sure i had a chat with an assistant da who leans toward permissive about grounds for warrants she listened to what i had asked me if i was taking my routine to openmike night at the comedy store so whats the plan stahl keeps watching and petra continues checking out hollywood spots clubs alternative bookstores to see if anyone knows kevin im going over the file on julie kipper to see if theres anything i missed i also called fiorelle in cambridge and suggested he scour hotel registers for drummond he said hed try but that was a lot to ask for one more thing i said i spoke to christian bangsley china marangas other living band mate he says china was certain someone was stalking her i recounted the incident near the hollywood sign it made her angry not frightened the night she disappeared she was enraged at the band throw in drugs and her aggressive personality and it could add up to a volatile situation with a guy like kevin with any wrong guy china being buried near the sign is consistent with a stalker she had a thing for the sign went up there regularly someone watched her learned her patterns maybe she wasnt picked up walking the streets maybe she chose that night to hike was followed and ambushed bangsley said when she screamed no one heard up there in the hills the sound of a struggle would be muted what kind of thing did she have for the sign the story of that starlet flinging herself to her death appealed to her unfulfilled dreams he said sounds like she and drummond wouldve had some common ground sure i said until they didnt after a futile double shift combing hollywood for someone who recognized kevin drummond petra went to bed at am got up at nine and did phone work from her apartment lying in bed hair pinned still in her tshirt and panties milo had filled her in on alexs visit to drummonds college drummonds professors description firming up the profile your basic loner big shock one heck of a loner not a single club owner or bouncer or patron or bookstore employee remembered his face the only people she found who responded to drummonds dmv photo at all were the owner of a laundromat within two blocks of drummonds apartment and the clerk at a nearby eleven who thought yeah maybe the guy came in there and bought stuff from time to time what kind of stuff maybe slim jims the clerk was a skinhead with a vulnerable face who reacted with the edgy eagerness of a game show contestant maybe said petra maybe pork rinds the laundromat owner was a chinese man who barely spoke english and smiled a lot all petra could get from him was yeah mebbe wash she resisted the impulse to ask if drummond had rinsecycled a load of bloody duds trudged back to her car and returned to the station where she decided to work drummonds pen names no chance faithful scriveners would be in the system but she found plenty of felonious e murphys too late to deal with it at this hour so she put it off for tomorrow now here she was all comfy and beddybye working the phones two hours later none of the e murphys looked promising she located henry gilwhite the transsexualmurdering husband of obnoxious olive the pob lady and by pm she knew that gilwhite had begun his sentence at the state penitentiary at san quentin only to be transferred to chino within a year a threeminute conversation with an assistant warden told her why she thanked the a w brewed coffee ate a hollowedout bagel showered dressed drove to hollywood she found a parking space in the stripmall lot that afforded a clean view of the mail drop a few scuzzy types entered and exited then nothing for ten minutes petra made a smiling entrance and earned a brownlidded glare from olive hi there mrs gilwhite heard from henry recently olive went scarlet the splotches on her face knitting into a rosaceous mask you never had a pronoun sounded more hostile have you said petra olive mumbled something foul under her breath petra put her hands in her pockets and stepped closer to the counter rolls of stamps sat at olives dimpled elbow she snatched them up and turned her back on petra nice for you that henry got transferred olive chinos a lot closer than san quentin easier to visit and you do get there regularly every two weeks like clockwork so hows he doing the old blood pressure under control olive half turned revealing a flabby profile her lips bunched as if gathering spit whats it to you chinos a lot safer too said petra what with armando guzman a cousin of henrys victim incarcerated at quentin and being a big deal in the vatos locos gang turns out theres a large contingent of vls in quentin but only a few at chino so its easier to segregate someone like henry what they tell me though is that chinos getting overcrowded situation like that you can never tell when things are going to change olive wheeled around pale you cant hostility had been sucked from her voice replaced by a nervescratching whine petra smiled olive gilwhites cheeks fluttered the peroxide thatch above her drinkers face thrummed living with this harridan mustve been fun for henry then again there were always trannies available for backalley trysts olive gilwhite said you cant the thing is said petra henry being a convicted murderer even at his age even with the hypertension hes not going to garner much sympathy from the prison administration the fact that hes refused any psychological counseling isnt helping him in the browniepoints department either stubborn fellow your henry olive picked at the platinum birds nest what do you want box what do you remember a loser said olive okay like all of them what the hell kinda clientele you think i deal with movie stars give me details on the loser said petra what did he look like howd he pay for the box he looked like young skinny tall big glasses bad skin one of those whattheycall nerds a nerd fag gay said petra thats what i said what makes you think that i dont think it i know it he got fag stuff in the mail said olive sneering again gay magazines no an invitation from the pope yeah magazines what do you think these are for gesticulating at the wall of boxes not too many bibles coming in olive laughed and even at this distance petra could smell juniper berries on her breath midday gin did he give you his name who remembers he did give you a name he had to fill out a form where is it gone said olive once the box changes hands i toss out the paperwork you think i got space to keep it all convenient said petra thats my middle name threaten me all you want but its not gonna change facts olive cursed under her breath and petra made out fuckin bitch you should be ashamed socalled officer of the socalled law

pictured olive back home at the doublewide in palmdale what had henrys cover story been going to the neighborhood tavern for a couple of beers suddenly she felt sorry for the woman i wont trouble you much longer youve already troubled me plenty was the russian name yuri yeah that was it said olive yuri sounds like urine whatd he do to piss you off she cackled slapped the counter exploded into phlegmy laughter that morphed into uncontrollable coughing nastysounding wheezes accompanied petra as she left the maildrop at am two days into his surveillance of kevin drummonds building eric stahl left his van and sneaked around to the back of the apartment structure the night was blue whipped by transitory biting gusts from the east the neon glow to the north the hollywood glow was misted and dim drummonds block had been quiet for a while nearly two hours remained until sunrise stahl had thought for a long time before deciding this was right hed been doing nothing but sitting and thinking for nearly fifty hours he and connor had spoken by cell phone three times shed learned nothing during the fifty hours stahl had observed plenty of comings and goings including a dogbeater he wouldve loved disciplining a shiftyeyed heathen with an eye for a nearnew toyota parked halfway up the block that one he wouldve called in but the guy thought better of jacking the car and left and a couple of furtive têteàtêtes between drug dealers and customers the busiest dealer lived in the building north of drummonds stahl noted his address for a later report to narcotics anonymous tip that would keep things simple most of drummonds neighbors seemed to be lawabiding hispanic folk quiet the last vehicle to rumble by was a yellow cab twelve minutes ago stahl zipped up his black windbreaker stashed his kit in a button pocket of his black cargo pants got out of the car appraised the street stretched breathed jogged the diagonal trajectory to the building on wellpadded black running shoes old shoes the squeak pounded out of them on the fifteenmile runs that had become a thriceweekly component of his routine his new routine the space between drummonds building and its southern neighbor was a mess of weeds nice and soft on the feet and quiet no lights on in any of the units as the city slept he continued to the back scoped out the parking slots hed made several passes back there but just in case no sign of the white honda drummonds space was empty stahl hustled over to the buildings rear entrance locked single dead bolt an alarm sticker was pasted across the wood but stahl knew from prior research that it was false advertising no wires no open account at the alarm company he removed his kit pulled out his highfocus narrowbeam penlight inspected his collection of key specimens eyeballed the slit in the bolt two blanks looked promising the first one fit the army had taught him how to play with locks and all sorts of other skills hed used these particular skills only once in riyadh the heat and the sand nearly unbearable the relentless sun bleaching his retinas despite all the highrises and conspicuous consumption the availability of american food on the base the city had never been anything to stahl but a desert hellhole the lockpick assignment in riyadh had been part of a bigger plan breaking into the penthouse of a saudi prince whod seduced the eighteenyearold daughter of one of the military attachés at the us embassy skinny plainlooking blond girl borderline iq subterranean selfesteem the prince handsome rich softspoken had sweettalked her into sexondemand at his place and fed her dope now feathers were being ruffled royal family feathers consorting with a girl of such obvious inferiority could prove harmful to the princes image but no way would the saudis move on their golden boy dirty work was always left to foreigners think of it this way stahls co told him shes getting off easy being american she was saudi theyd stone her to death officially the prince lived with his family in a palace his fuck pad was a white marble paradise atop one of the highestrises the delivery door of which just happened to have been left open and unguarded on a certain night same night the prince was due to dine with a couple of the state department flunkies everyone despised accompanied by one of his three wives but that afternoon hed stashed the american girl in the f pad plied her with pills left her there supervised by one female filipina servant to be available when he dropped in for a sexual nightcap stahl staked out the highrise and saw the prince stash his slut a yellow bentley azure pulled around to the buildings delivery entrance the prince dressed in a white silk shirt and cream slacks got out of the car leaving the drivers door open an attendant rushed to close it but the car didnt move five minutes later the left passenger door opened and two men in suits emerged with a bundled figure that they hustled into the building the same attendant was ready for them too holding the door an hour later the prince decked out in long white arab robes and a goldbanded kaffiyeh got behind the wheel of the azure and sped off twenty minutes later the two men in suits left on foot got into a black mercedes parked nearby and drove away soon after dark stahl was inside the building lifting the skirts of his own robe and climbing twentyeight flights to the princes digs a sleepy guard was stationed on the other side of the stairwell door stahl walked toward him muttered a few memorized arabic phrases flipped the guy around put on the chokehold dragged him into the stairwell and bound his arms and legs with plastic ties then he pulled out his pick kit and flipped the lock expensive digs but cheap lock no reason for talal to feel insecure the girl was in plain sight lolling on a purple brocade sofa naked stoned eyes fixed on satellitedelivery mtv hi cathy the girl stroked her breasts and licked her lips the filipina maid appeared stahl gave her a puff of whatever was stored in the little blue inhalator the med officer had slipped him and she nodded out and he placed her in a chair peeling off the arab robes he continued working in his black tshirt and jeans wrapping cathy in the same blanket the princes guys had used slinging her over his shoulder and getting the hell out of there he carried the girl down twentyeight flights a car was waiting behind the building no bentley not even a mercedes just a plain old unmarked ford had she been awake cathy would have seen it as a comedown talal liked to do her in the bentley and shed told her sister she loved it riyadh had been nothing but deceit stay on task no time to get distracted the lock kit was one of the few things stahl had taken with him when hed entered civilian life such as it was he entered the apartments ground floor drummonds flat was on the second floor toward the back but a staircase ran from the front he made his way up the thinly carpeted hallway the building smelled of bug spray and hot sauce under the carpet was old wood flooring that sagged and creaked he trod carefully two light fixtures in the ceiling only the one in front was operative the steps were tile over cement and silent under his rubber soles within seconds he was at drummonds unit unnoticed kit out penlight on the keyhole same make as the back door the same master popped it he shut the door locked it removed his glock from the black nylon holster that rode his hip stood in the darkness waiting for a life vibration some nuance of occupancy to disturb the silence nothing he took a step forward whispered kevin dead air he scanned the room one room not large two small windows both shaded looked out to the building next door turning on the room light would yellow the shades so stahl relied on his other flashlight the black mag with the wider beam he swept it over the room careful to avoid the windows kevin drummonds living space was occupied by an unmade single bed a crappylooking nightstand and a folding chair positioned in the center of a low wide desk closer inspection revealed the desk to be an unpainted door laid over two sawhorses lots of workspace the right side bordering the bed was taken up by a hot plate and provisions three cans of generic chili a bag of potato chips a jar of mild salsa two sixpacks of pepsi a toothbrush in a glass to the left were three computers with nineteeninch flat screens a pair of color printers a scanner a digital camera a stack of tonercartridge replacements for the printers twelve reams of white paper past the equipment a door led to the bathroom to get there stahl had to manipulate his way around piles of magazines nearly every free inch of floor space was taken up by boxes he checked the lav first shower sink toilet no signs of recent usage but the room smelled stale mold in the shower rings of grime around the sink drain and stahl wouldnt have used the blackened toilet on a bet no medicine cabinet just a single glass shelf above the sink carelesly squeezed toothpaste tube otc sinus remedy ladies hand cream probably a masturbatory aid aspirin peptobismol prescription acne pills dispensed three years ago at an encino pharmacy three pills left kevin had stopped paying attention to his skin no soap in the shower no shampoo and stahl wondered how long it had been since kevin had been here did he have another crib he returned to the front room stepped among the boxes anything he came up with tonight would be useless worse than useless if the breakin came to light hed have screwed the investigation he began checking the boxes contents expecting drummonds cache of grooverat back issues wrong not a single copy of the zine anywhere in the apartment the guy was a pack rat but he collected other peoples creations from what stahl could tell the junk was divided into two categories toys and magazines the toys were hotwheels cars some still in their boxes star wars and other action figures stuff that wasnt familiar the pages were vanity fair the new yorker instyle people talk interview and gay pornography lots of it including some bondage and s m stuff the maildrop lady had told petra that drummond was gay stahl wondered if shed told sturgis how sturgis would take to learning about kevins proclivities shed told him about sturgiss proclivities probably wanting to make sure he didnt let loose some homophobic remark which was ridiculous because he never remarked about anything even this early in their partnership she shouldve seen that he made her nervous when they rode together she was jumpier than a sand flea this case was working out well both of them happy to be going their separate ways connor wasnt a bad sort career woman no family ties superficially tough but new situations made her antsy he made her antsy he knew he did that to people he couldnt have cared less he completed the search of kevin drummonds apartment finding no personal papers or trophies nothing criminal or suggestive of criminality hoarding all that paper was consistent with the guess the shrink had worked up drummond was highly obsessive drummonds choice of magazines said the obsession was personality celebrity the breakin had accomplished two things stahl knew now that the lack of a warrant wasnt hurting them all this search wouldve added to the mix was verification of drummonds homosexuality and he couldnt see where that fit in maybe the s m stuff drummond being into his own s other peoples m the other thing spending time in drummonds digs feeling the cold solitude he was willing to bet drummond had rabbited a while back had no intention of returning even with all that computer equipment left behind daddys dough easy come easy go no copies of grooverat left behind said kevin had another storage space or he didnt care about publishing anymore moving on to a new hobby flicking off the maglite he stood in drummonds pathetic little room making sure no one had been alerted by his presence just in case he pulled out the mask and slipped it over his face armyissue black lycra two eyeholes this way if anyone accosted him during his departure all theyd remember would be a centralcasting nightstalking burglar the mask would scare any rational person off and lessen the chance of confrontation stahl would do anything to protect himself but he preferred not to have to hurt anyone the call came in as milo and i were having breakfast on the third street promenade in santa monica a sky the color of lint promised rain and few pedestrians passed our outdoor table the weather didnt dissuade a scrawny man playing bad guitar for spare change milo slipped him a ten told him to find another spot the man moved twenty feet down and resumed howling milo returned to his denver omelette it was two days after my visit to charter college kevin drummond still hadnt shown up at his apartment and eric stahls feeling was that he wouldnt be returning soon why not i said stahls gut feeling according to petra he said is that worth much who knows meanwhile the only new thing weve learned about drummond is that hes gay petra found out that he used his pob primarily to get gay porn he put his fork down think thats relevant we were talking about someone sexually confused so maybe he resolved his confusion what about szabo and loh rich gay men living the good life theres a focus for jealousy szabo and loh werent targeted and their house was the scene of only one murder whoever killed levitch was after what levitch had talent he glanced at the howling guitarist theres a guy in no danger anything new on kipper i said he has a girlfriend much younger late twenties very goodlooking name of stephanie she works as a legal secretary for a firm in his building for the last few days kippers been squiring her around in public this ones blond too so kippers neighbors couldve been mistaken about his visitor being julie if i didnt have the seldomscene articles linking julie to the others and a tentative match between the ligatures used on her and levitch id be wondering about kippers considering a second try at marriage exspouses can make things messy financially as well as emotionally and we know from kippers neighbors that he can be vindictive julie makes waves he shuts her up yeah he said too bad i dont like the guy something about him he forked omelet gulped coffee stephanie i said you spoke to her i heard her friend call her that when they went to the ladies room youve been staking out the building at the time it seemed prudent he shrugged his phone went off sturgis hi really yeah okay ive got alex with me might as well bring him along he read his timex from where we are fortyfive minutes yeah thanks bye he clicked off pocketed the phone looked at my halfeaten toast that was petra how about taking that to go pinning money under his plate he waved to the waiter pushed away from the table whats up i said following him out to the promenade dead woman he said dead redhead the autopsy room was spotless tile and stainless steel silent and pleasantly cool petra and milo and i stood next to a shrouded mass on a stainless table as a softspoken attendant named rhonda reese checked paperwork reese was thirtyish chestnuthaired curvy with the open face of a tour guide id sailed to boyle heights on the but interstate had been jammed by the proverbial jackknifed big rig and the backlog had turned the drive to the coroners office to an hourlong ordeal during that time milo had dozed and id thought about women petra met us in the lobby ive already checked us in she said lets go rhonda reese drew the sheet back and folded it neatly at the foot of the table the corpse was long and rawboned and female waxy flesh tinted that unique greengray eyes and mouth shut peaceful expression no obvious signs of violence a scatter of pimples and fibroid lumps filled a flat expanse of chest between small deflated breasts inverted corrugated nipples sharp hips wide pelvis skinny legs covered with curly auburn down the ankles crusted by red skin hardened and crackled like alligator hide street ankles the womans soles were black as were the dirty ragged nails on her toes and fingers fungus grew between the toes an unruly rusty pubic thatch was littered with dandruff a few white hairs sparked the thatch red hair on top as well but much brighter with claret roots and overlay of purple at the tips long matted hair filthy and dense crowned a swollen face that mightve been pretty once upon a time no needle marks any guesses said milo rhonda reese said i cant speak for dr silver but if you open her eyes youll see petechiae strangulation he moved closer to the body checked the eyes squinted the necks a little rosy too but no ligature marks he glanced at petra and she nodded not like the others i said gentle strangulation petra stared at me milo shrugged the term was obnoxious but wellestablished jargon for a murderous ploy using a broad soft ligature to blunt the outward evidence of strangulation some people choke themselves that way to achieve heightened sexual pleasure and accidentally die milo and i had worked a gentle strangulation case a few years ago no accident a child he said whens the autopsy rhonda youll have to ask dr silver were pretty booked dave silver said petra reese nodded i know him said petra good guy ill talk to him milo eyed the body again when did it happen he asked petra yesterday early am two of our uniforms found her off the boulevard on the south side of the street alley behind a church that had once been a theater that salvadoran pentecostal place said milo east end thats the one she was propped sitting against the wall garbage service came by she was blocking their truck from getting close to the dumpster and they thought she was asleep so they tried to wake her to reese tell them about her clothes we removed layers said reese lots of them junky old clothes really filthy she wrinkled her nose that rash on her legs you know what it is right circulation problems shes got tons of stuff growing on and in her we cultured godknowswhat from her feet and nose and throat on top of the body odor you could smell the alcohol the whole room reeked her blood work wont be back till later today but ill lay odds shes a or higher the recitation wasnt without compassion but the facts remained cruel milo remained expressionless as he inspected the body again no tracks that i can see there arent any said reese looks like drink was her main thing but well see what the tox screen pulls up did you list the articles of clothing right here said reese turning pages of the coroners file two pairs of womans panties two pairs of mens boxers three tshirts a bra over that blue ucla sweatshirt was the c half gone on the sweatshirt said milo doesnt say said reese let me go look a cardboard carton sat atop a stainlesssteel counter reese gloved up bent over the box retrieved a large paper bag that she opened wrinkling her nose again drew out a blue sweatshirt fuzzed with dirt and leaves yup half a c milo turned to petra the old lady at light and space described her dumpster diver as wearing that the drawing she did was useless so i figured cataracts guess she could see okay after all just a lousy artist is this officially your case petra said no digmond and battista caught it i just happened to hear them talking about it and i recalled what you said about a tall redhead homelesstype nosing around no id yet her prints are being run as we speak rhonda reese said can i put this back milo said sure thanks where are the crimescene snaps petra said dig and harry have a set and theres a copy here rhonda if its no trouble we could use some dupes i can do that said reese she left the room and returned a while later with a white envelope milo thanked her and she said good luck detectives he said feel like solving a few s for us rhonda reese laughed sure why not do i get to talk to someone alive we reconvened in the morgue parking lot milo said digmond and battista gonna give you any space on this theyre booked solid would be thrilled to shunt it to me but i want to wait and see if it actually ties in to the others for all we know its not even homicide petechiae she couldve choked or had a seizure or vomited hard anything that bugged her eyes hard enough would do it and you know how prone street people are to catastrophe if the hyoid or the thyroid cartilages are messed up thatll be a different story the sweatshirt says she was at the gallery but if shes connected to the other victims why the lack of aggression to her body no cuts not even a scratch and if it is strangulation it doesnt match what we saw on kipper and levitch that deep ligature ring wire biting into the neck someone really angry serials get more violent over time not less right alex i said this could be tied in with the others but result from a different motivation this victim could mean something different to the killer like what said milo she was behind the gallery casing the place for the killer advance woman he said drummond chooses a homeless woman for an accomplice and now he gets rid of her he would if she became a liability a homeless woman alcoholic possibly mentally ill mightve served a purpose for him when he wasnt under threat but if he knows hes the object of investigation he might have decided to cover his tracks he might very well know hes the object said petra weve talked to his family and his landlady he hasnt been seen for days all the evidence says hes rabbited i said a broad ligature is sometimes used when the killer has some level of sympathy for the victim also shes a big woman if she drank herself into a stupor that wouldve made his job a lot easier no need to confront or struggle the way she was propped is almost respectful were her legs spread milo opened the envelope drew out color photos shuffled through until he found a fulllength body shot legs tight together said petra no sexual positioning but it could still be a pose i said strangulation even with no struggle can set off spasms this looks too orderly to be natural the two of them studied the photo milo said looks posed to me petra nodded i said theres no intent to demean here just the opposite hes guarding her sexuality kevins gay said milo maybe women arent sexual objects to him julie was posed sexually kevin may be leaning toward gay but if hes our guy hes still plenty confused that makes sense said petra macho dad and brothers all that emphasis on sports and being manly it couldnt have been easy for him she glanced at milo and i noticed a spark of unease in her dark eyes wondering if shed offended him he nodded as if to reassure her whatever the motive i said the killer took care to make this victim look comfortable relative to the other cases its an indication of respect accomplice but not a girlfriend said milo petra said even if kevin does have an interest in girls even if hes quirky in ways we dont know i cant see a young guy associating with a diseased homeless woman what motive would he have to hang with her kevins an isolate i said probably sees himself an outcast from way back on top of his sexual issues hes set himself up as a white knight fighting a lonely battle for art in its pure form with that kind of alienation i can see him gravitating toward other outsiders which means i should be scoping out the street people not the bookstores milo said hanging with the homeless offing the talented its like a war against the bright side of life i said theres something else i find interesting this body showed up behind a former theater what if thats a sneaky little allusion to the death of the performing arts theyre still performing there said milo the church isnt that what preaching is or maybe hes being sacrilegious petra said this is veering into serious weirdness she gnawed her lip okay what next milo said were ninetynine percent sure this is the redhead coco barnes saw but lets see if i can get a positive id from the old lady main thing is find out who she is woman like this is gonna be in the system somewhere when do the prints come in you know prints could be today or next week ill talk to dig and harry see if we can speed things up once we know who she is we trace her movements and maybe we dont need to wait for prints after barnes told me what she saw i did some asking around found a shelter in your bailiwick dove house where they knew of a tall redhead who dropped in from time to time bernadine something they also said they figured her for someone whod lived better once upon a time because when her head cleared she talked intelligently i said maybe thats the side the killer saw he knew he needed to get her blind drunk to render her helpless petra said i know dove house brought kids there theyve got a pretty good success rate milo looked at the death shot no ones perfect we found coco barnes spinning an amorphous pot in her garage studio lance the dog snored at her feet it took her one glance to say thats her just like my drawing poor thing what happened to her we dont know yet maam said milo but shes dead yes maam oh boy said barnes wiping clay from her hands do me a favor we ever meet again call me coco not maam youre making me feel paleolithic milo phoned petra and reached her out in the valley when he asked if we could hit the shelter without her she said fine whats she doing i said keeping an eye on kevins folks house stahls still watching the apartment but thats looking pretty useless i turned the car around noticed my gas gauge was near empty all the backandforth he said ill pay to fill it up spring for dinner instead where somewhere expensive double date he said sure i pulled into a gas station on lincoln he jumped out used his credit card to activate the pump hooked up the nozzle bounced his eyes around ever the detective i felt like stretching so i wiped the windows so hows allison he said shes in boulder skiing psych convention oh okay all filled up he replaced the hose whens she getting back few days why we need to wait for her he said to schedule the double date dove house occupied a rundown cloudcolored apartment building on cherokee just north of hollywood boulevard no sign or identifying marks the front door was open and the groundfloor unit to the left was labeled office the director was a young cleanshaven black man named daryl witherspoon working alone at a battered desk cornrows lined his skull a silver crucifix swung as he got up and walked toward us his gray sweats smelled freshly laundered milo showed him the picture and he placed a palm against his cheek oh my poor erna erna who ernadine said witherspoon ernadine murphy e murphy i said witherspoon regarded me curiously what happened to her milo said i called here about a week ago spoke to a woman who thought she knew ms murphy that was probably diane pirello my assistant was erna did this happen a week ago last night what can you tell us about her witherspoon said lets sit down milo and i perched on a thrift shop sofa that stank of tobacco witherspoon offered us coffee from a bubbling machine but we declined footsteps sounded from above the room was painted a bright yellow that seared the eyes inspirational messages taped to the plaster were the art du jour witherspoon pulled up a chair and said are you able to tell me what happened thats still unclear said milo she was found in an alley just a few blocks away behind the pentecostal church the church she wasnt religious said witherspoon thats one thing i can tell you resistant i said he nodded very not that we lean hard on them but we do try to get through to them ernie had no desire to embrace the lord she really wasnt one of our regulars just checked in from time to time when things got bad for her we never turn anyone away unless theyre violent was she ever violent no never milo said what made things go bad for her it all came down to alcohol she was drinking herself to death weve known her off and on for the last couple of years and lately we could see significant deterioration such as health problems persistent cough skin lesions stomach problems one time she slept here and the next morning her sheets were splotched with blood at first we figured it was you know the time of the month theres no shortage of tampons here but some of the women forget as it turned out erna was bleeding from witherspoon flinched her rear end internally we called in one of our volunteer doctors and finally convinced erna to be examined she said it was nothing critical but that ernie did have some fissures that should be looked into she also said there were probably intestinal problems that should be looked into we offered to send erna to a specialist but she left and didnt return for months that was her pattern in and out for a lot of them were a depot what about mental problems said milo that goes without saying said witherspoon for most of our people thats a given what kind of specific mental problems did ernadine murphy have as i said it all came down to drink i figured she finally went too far organic brain syndrome they call it going dull and when shed sleep here shed sometimes wake up and hallucinate korsakoffs syndrome its a vitamin b deficiency they get he frowned folks joke about pink elephants but theres nothing funny about it i said what was she like before she deteriorated hmm i cant say she was ever really normal im not saying she was stupid she wasnt once in a while when we could dry her out long enough and she talked you could see she had a good vocabulary our sense was shed once been educated but when we tried to ask her about it shed clam up lately those dry periods were few and far between for the last year or so she was still pretty dysfunctional aggressive said milo just the opposite passive spacedout slurred speech trouble focusing her motor skills were affected too shed stumble trip is that what happened to her did she fall and hit her head doesnt look like it said milo someone did this to her we dont know yet sir oh lord said witherspoon milo took out his pad whos the doctor who evaluated her when she bled on the sheets we use several all volunteers i think this time it was hannah gold shes got an office on highland it was only one time she never established a relationship with erna no one did we could never reach her witherspoons shoulders rose and fell god gives and takes away but theres plenty we humans do in the interim that affects the journey what do you know about ms murphys family history nothing said witherspoon she never opened up i said did she have any friends connect with any of the other residents not that i saw to be honest most of the other women were afraid of her she was large could come across threatening if you didnt know how so lurching around said witherspoon mumbling to herself seeing things what did she see said milo she never put it into words but from the way she behaved standing there and pointing and moving her lips you could tell she was frightened was seeing something that frightened her but she wouldnt accept comfort so the other women were afraid of her maybe i overspoke said witherspoon more nervous than afraid she never caused a problem sometimes shed go off in a corner get agitated start mumbling and shaking her fist when she did that everyone gave her space but she never aggressed against anyone sometimes shed punch her own chest rap her head with her knuckles nothing serious but you can see how that would be scary a woman of her size those lucid periods i said what made you think she was well educated her vocabulary said witherspoon the way she used words i wish i could remember a specific example but i cant its been a while since ive seen her how long said milo maybe three four months could you please check your records and be more specific sir said milo sorry the only records we keep are for the government taxexempt status and all that shuffling government paper takes up a lot of my time so i dont add to my burden a good vocabulary i said it was more than that good diction something about the way she talked could be sophisticated during her clear periods what did she talk about witherspoon fingered a cornrow let me ask diane he strode to his desk punched a phone extension talked in a low voice said shell be right down diane petrello was in her sixties short and stout with clipped gray hair and big round tortoiseshell glasses even wider than her face she wore a pink sweatshirt that said compassion a long denim skirt and sneakers when milo told her about erna murphy she said oh my god in a soft high voice tears rolled down her cheeks as he added a few details as she sat down opposite us and wiped her eyes daryl witherspoon fixed her a cup of tea she warmed her hands on the cup and said i hope the poor thing finally finds some peace tortured soul said milo oh yes said diane petrello arent we all he went over some of the same ground wed covered with witherspoon then repeated my question about erna murphys lucid periods what she talked about said petrello hmm id say mostly art she could spend hours looking at pictures in art books one time i went out and bought some old art books for her at a thrift shop but when i brought them back she was gone she was like that restless wouldnt stay put in fact that was the last time i saw her she never got to see the books what kind of art did she like said milo well i guess i couldnt tell you pretty pictures i suppose landscapes julie kippers pretty pictures diane petrello said anything pretty it seemed to calm her down but not always nothing really worked when she was all wound up she could be pretty agitated said milo but she never caused problems she have any friends here at dove house not really no anyone on the outside not that i ever saw she talk about any outside friends petrello shook her head milo said specifically maam id be interested in a young man in his early twenties tall thin dark hair bad skin eyeglasses petrello looked at witherspoon they both shook their heads witherspoon said is he the one who did this we dont know if anyone did anything sir what else can you tell us about ms murphy thats all i can think of said petrello she was so alone like so many of them thats the main problem really aloneness without divine grace all of us are alone milo asked if we could show erna murphys picture to the other residents and darryl witherspoon frowned diane petrello said there are only six women in residence this week any men said milo there are eight men witherspoon said its been a tough couple of weeks everyone weve got is kind of fragile those pictures you showed me would be too much milo said how about this no picture we just talk and you come along to make sure we do it right another glance passed between witherspoon and petrello he said guess so but at the first sign of trouble we quit okay witherspoon returned to his desk as milo and i trailed diane petrello up a flight of protesting stairs the upper floors were divided into single rooms that lined a long bright turquoise hallway women were housed on the second floor men on the third each room was set up with two bunk beds bibles on the pillow a tiny portable closet more religious posters half of the residents were sleepy erna murphys name elicited only blank looks until a young darkhaired woman named lynnette with the face of a fashion model and old needle tracks in the crooks of her pipestem arms said big red you know her roomed with her a couple of times lynnettes eyes were huge and black and wounded her hair was long and dark and greasy a tattooed star the size of a sheriffs badge decorated the left side of her neck a vein ran through the center of the body art pulsing the blue ink slow pulse steady unperturbed she sat on the edge of a lower bunk bible at one arm bag of fritos at the other her back curved like that of an old woman the downturn of her mouth said shed given up on personal safety what happened to her im afraid shes dead maam lynnettes pulse remained sluggish then her eyes drooped with amusement milo said something funny maam lynnette shot him a crooked grin only thing funny is maam so what someone offed her were not sure maybe her boyfriend did it what boyfriend would that be dont know she just told me she had one and that he was real smart when did she tell you this said milo lynnette scratched her arm had to be a long time ago to petrello had to be not the last time i was here maybe a few times before that months said petrello i been traveling said lynnette had to be months traveling said milo lynnette smiled seeing the usa yeah had to be months could be six seven dunno i just remember it cause i thought it was bullshit cause like whod want her she was a skank you didnt like her what was to like said lynnette she was a whack job would start off having a conversation with you then space out start walking around talking to herself what else did she say about this boyfriend said milo just that smart yeah no name nope milo stepped closer to the bed diane petrello interposed herself between him and lynnette and he retreated if theres anything you can tell us about the boyfriend id greatly appreciate it lynnette said i dont know nothin a second later she said he was smart thats it bragging on herself like hes smart so im smart she said he was gonna come take her out of here she puffed her lips right out of dove house out of here the life the street so maybe he did so look what happened to her we got back in the car milo said what do you think erna murphy liked pretty art i said that would be a point of contact with someone like kevin the selfassigned arbiter of art julie kippers paintings certainly qualified as pretty erna wouldve been attracted to them maybe he directed her to the show used her as some sort of distraction coco barnes opens the back door and maybe she forgets to lock it he rubbed his face a psychotic advance woman think he couldve used erna for more than just that what if he had her actually do julie erna was big enough to overpower someone julies size especially in the closed confines of that bathroom a woman would also explain the lack of semen or sexual assault and we just heard she could be lucid relatively lucid i said julies murder was too well planned and thought out for a psychotic not a shred of forensic evidence was left at the scene erna cant have been counted on to be that meticulous no i cant see that theres something else going on heree murphy wrote a review of vassily levitch a year ago the prose was florid but not confused enough to be ernas her name was expropriated its a kind of identify theft smart boyfriend he said lynnette was sure erna was being delusional about that in terms of a romantic bond she probably was but there was a relationship ernas aesthetic interests the fact that shed been educated was periodically articulate couldve made her appealing to someone like kevin drummond a tragic figure whod hit rock bottom the ultimate outsider even her psychosis would have appealed to him some fools still think being crazy is glamorous but whatever bond they had kevin was careful to keep her at arms length his landlady never saw her around his apartment and no one petras talked to has linked the two of them he idealizes her then he kills her she ceased fitting into his worldview became a threat cold he said thats one thing that does fit all of it coldhearted like baby boys song i bought one of his cds been listening to it trying to get some insights any success he was one hell of a player even a tonedeaf philistine like me can hear his soul pouring outta that guitar but no big insights did you know your names on the album what are you talking about tiny print on the bottom where he thanks everyone from jesus christ to robert johnson big list robins in there he calls her the beautiful guitar lady thanks her for keeping his instruments happy then he tacks you on something along the lines of thanks to dr alex delaware for keeping the guitar lady happy been a while since that was true sorry he said i thought youd get a kick out of it i pulled away from the curb drove west on hollywood boulevard construction brought us to a halt hardhatted crews running amok graft kings rejuvenating the neighborhood maybe one day the shiny sterile franchised hollywood the civic fathers lusted for would emerge right now glitz coexisted with sleaze in an uneasy balance a few miles away north in the hills was the hollywood sign where a starlet had ended her life decades ago and china marangas body had been left to rot i didnt suggest driving up there and neither did milo too long ago to matter we crawled to vine street he said erna another soul expropriated i said a user thats what this is all about encino petra digested the details of milos call the e murphy id meant the redheads murder would end up in her basket too she phoned eric stahl and filled him in okay he said in that infuriating flat voice nothing impresses me you going to keep watching kevin she said probably a waste of time whys that i dont think hell be coming by soon said stahl whatever you want im still watching his parents house no action yet but i want to stick with it meantime i think we should start delving into erna murphys history if you really think kevins crib is a zero feel free to start on that sure silence petra waited him out he said anywhere you want me to start the usual data banks hold on a woman just drove up to the house could be kevins mother doesnt look like a happy camper just do the usual eric ill talk to you later she remained in her accord and watched the woman climb out of her baby blue corvette the lowslung covered thing she and stahl had seen during their first visit to franklin drummonds home the red honda was registered to anna martinez an hispanic maid who appeared to live in the other three vehicles were registered to franklin drummond his daily drive was the gray baby benz the vette was the missuss toy no one seemed to bother with the white explorer maybe spare wheels for the two younger sons when they visited from college kevin drove cheap wheels not the favored child the woman flipped her hair wiggled her butt and alarmlocked the corvette middleaged tall skinny longlegged big thick features homely but in a notunsexy way the hair was a bright orange helmet same color as erna murphys isnt zat interesting dr freud she wore a baggy white jersey sweater embroidered with rhinestones that bobbled her big boobs black leggings with footstraps backless sandals with hypodermic heels fuckme shoes aging bimbo was kevins mommy doing someone other than kevins daddy petra watched her walk up to the front door fool in her gucci purse remove a ring of keys definitely kevins mom he hadnt inherited his lanky frame from fireplug franklin the car the heels the rest of it said mama liked to party a woman in touch with her sexuality toss that into the family mix and petra could only imagine what kevins childhood had been like this afternoon mama looked miserable tense tight neck croquet wicket mouth she dropped the key ring bent and retrieved it petra got out of her car as the womans key aimed at the lock made it to the womans side before she made contact and twisted the woman turned petra flashed the badge i have nothing to say to you smokers voice tobacco mixed with chanel emanated from the redheads clothing you are mrs drummond said petra im terry drummond fear in the voice could you spare a moment to talk about kevin no way said terry drummond my husband warned me youd be by i have no obligation to talk to you petra smiled the rhinestones on terrys shirt formed the crude outline of two terriers kissing sweet you certainly dont mrs drummond but im not here to persecute you terry drummonds key arm tightened call it what you want im going inside maam kevin hasnt been seen for nearly a week as a mother id think youd be concerned studying the woman for a hint that kevin had made contact tears welled up in terry drummonds eyes soft brown eyes flecked with gold gorgeous eyes really despite the toogenerous application of shadow and mascara petra revised her appraisal despite the thick features terry was more than attractive even in her anxiety she exuded oodles of sensuality as a young woman shed probably been deadon sexy what would it be like to have a mother like that petra knew nothing about mothers hers had died giving birth to her she relaxed her posture gave terry drummond time to think terry wore big gold jewelry a threecarat rock on her ring finger up close the gucci bag looked real petra saw her as someone whose body heat and flashy looks had snagged an upandcoming lawyer someone whod climbed a few notches socially probably given up whatever entrylevel career shed had raised three boys immersed herself in suburban motherhood only to see her oldest son turn out different now she was terrified kevin hadnt phoned home she said its got to be worrying maam no ones saying kevins guilty of anything hes just someone we need to talk to he could be in danger think about it has he ever disappeared like this before dont you think its important that we find him terry drummond bit back tears i havent heard from him so how could you find him how long has it been maam terry shook her head thats all im going to say do you have any idea why were interested in him something to do with murder which is ridiculous kevins gentle terrys voice rose on the last word and she flinched petra had a sense someone had used it as an insult when referring to kevin the gentle one im sure he is mrs drummond then why are you hounding us not trying to maam im sure you know kevin better than anyone you care about him more deeply than anyone so if he does get in touch youll offer him good advice terry drummond cried i dont need this i dont need this one bit if my idiot brotherinlaw hadnt finked on kevin i wouldnt have to be dealing with this why dont you look at him he already killed two people randolph his wife and child the dirty drunk snarled terry frank was always telling randy to stop drinking he nearly ruined us the lawsuits its only cause franks so smart that he managed to climb back up to the top so you can see why randyd have it in for us all randy did was confirm he was kevins uncle said petra wed have found out anyway why said terry why are you harassing my boy hes good hes kind hes smart hes gentle hed never hurt anyone the womans entire body had gone rigid and petra shifted gears did kevin have a friend named erna murphy who petra repeated the name never heard of her kevin never had any i dont know his friends asocial kevin the admission made terry blanch and she tried to cover they move out go their own way creative people especially need their space that sounded like a wellpracticed rationalization for kevins oddness yes they do said petra i paint said terry drummond i started taking art lessons and now i need my space petra nodded please said terry let me be heres my card maam think about what i said for kevins sake terry faltered then took it one more thing said petra could you just tell me why kevin called himself yuri terrys smile was abrupt blinding and it made her gorgeous she touched her breast as if remembering what it had nourished hes so cute so clever ill tell you and then youll see how off base you are years ago when kevin was little just a little guy but he was always bright frank was telling him about the space race about sputnik which was a big thing when frank was a little guy the russians got there first showed us americans how we got soft and lazy frank used to talk to kevin like that all the time kevin was franks firstborn and he really spent time with him took him everywhere museums parks even the office everyone called kevin a little lawyer because he talked so great anyway frank was telling kevin about the russians and sputnik and this russian astronaut whatever they call them cosmosomething cosmonauts cosmonauts beating out the astronauts the first one was a guy named yuri something and kevin little as he was was just listening to frank and then when frank finished kevin piped up daddy i want to be first i want to be a yuri terrys tears flowed anew one longnailed hand plucked at a rhinestone terrier after that whenever he did something good got a good grade on a test anything i called him yuri he liked that it meant hed done a good job two messages on my machine allison two hours ago robin a few minutes later both asking me to call back when i had a chance i phoned allisons hotel she picked up on the fourth ring sounded out of breath its you great you caught me out the door bad time no no excellent time on my way to another seminar hows the conference boulders pretty she said thin air thin hot air she laughed actually thereve been some good papers stuff you might enjoy ptsd in victims of terrorism a good survey of depression in kids hows the case coming along not much progress i said sorry wish you were here we couldve had some fun on the slopes theres still snow not a lick i canceled philadelphia will be coming home tomorrow want to get together tomorrow night you bet i didnt offend grants folks she said to tell the truth they seemed relieved everyone knows its time to cut the ties shall i take a cab directly from the airport i can pick you up no work on the case i should make it by eight should i cook if you want but its not vital one way or another well obtain nourishment i put off phoning robin when i finally did and heard the tension in her voice i regretted the delay thanks for calling back whats wrong i didnt want to bother you but i thought you should know youd have found out eventually someone broke into my place vandalized the shop made off with some instruments god im sorry when last night we were out got back around midnight found the lights on and the door to the studio ajar the police took three hours to arrive wrote a report called in detectives who wrote another report technicians came and dusted for fingerprints strangers in my house all those procedures you and milo always talk about was it a forced entry the back doors bolted and grated but they just shoved it off the hinges looks like they were rusted the alarm was set but the detectives said the lead must have worn down wasnt making proper contact its an old house i shouldve checked but the landlord lives in lake havasu everythings a drawnout process how much damage they took a bunch of stuff but whats worse is they smashed whatever was on the bench beautiful old things an ivorybridge martin clyde buffums lyon healy mandolin a stella twelvestring my insurance will cover it but my poor clients those instruments mean more than money you dont need to hear this i dont know why i called tim installed a new door then he had to fly up to san francisco youre alone just for a few days ill be right over dont alex yes do she was waiting for me sitting in a white plastic chair on her tiny front lawn wearing a green sweater and jeans her arms were around me before i made contact she said they took baby boys guitars her body trembled id been talking to jackie true about buying them so i could give them to you alex he checked with christies and they told him neither would fetch a premium he was about to agree she looked up at me i knew youd enjoy them it was going to be my birthday present to you her birthday was coming up in a month i hadnt thought about it i stroked her curls it was a sweet thought thats what counts right she smiled and sniffled lets go inside her living room looked the same but for some missing pieces of china i said detective have any ideas gang bangers they obviously werent pros left some prime stuff behind a gorgeous dangelico excel and a forties f thank god i had those in a closet other than babys gibson they went for the electrics couple of seventies fenders a standell bass a les paul goldtop reissue going for the flash i said kids that and all the wanton destruction says immaturity according to the detectives like what kids do when they break into schools the gangs are active south of rose until now we havent felt it south of rose was two blocks away another arbitrary la boundary as genuine as a movie maybe robin suddenly realized that because she began shivering clung harder to me buried her head in the folds of my shirt tims trip up north was an emergency i said he didnt want to go i insisted he got a contract to work with the kids in a new les miserables production two weeks of prep before opening night with kids you have to be careful not to stress the vocal cords thought youd only be alone for a couple of days im going up there as soon as i take care of this i said nothing thanks for coming alex need help straightening up i dont even want to go in there how about a breather then lets go somewhere for a cup of coffee i cant leave she said the locksmiths coming when he was due an hour ago just sit with me please she brought out a couple of cokes and we sat opposite each other drinking some cookies no thanks im being selfish im sure youre busy i said where are you going to sleep tonight here youll be okay yes she said i dont know why dont we do this once the new locks are in well tidy up bring the instruments to my place for safekeeping then you can fly up to san francisco tonight she placed her hands in her lap i could do that she said then she cried when she was ready to face the damage we entered the studio robins pinneat organization had been reduced to trash the two of us swept and straightened collected shreds of ravished instruments tuning pegs bridges salvaging what we could discarding the rest uncoiling and discarding kinked guitar strings hurting myself a couple of times on the sharp ends of the wires because i was working fast with a blank mind the ordeal left robin short of breath she dusted the workbench hopped up said its fine dont do any more stretched an arm i stood there broom in hand come here she said i put the broom down and walked toward her when i was a foot away she hooked a hand behind my neck drew me in kissed me i turned my head and her lips grazed my cheek her laughter was dry all those times you were inside me she said and now its wrong boundaries i said without them theres not much to civilization feeling civilized are you not particularly i said she grabbed me and kissed me harder this time i let her tongue work its way into my mouth my cock felt like an iron bolt my emotions lagged well behind she knew it touched my cheek with the flat of her hand and for a moment i thought shed slap me instead she just drew away at the core she said you were always a good boy why doesnt that feel like a compliment because im scared and alone and have no use for boundaries she kept her arms at her side her eyes were a strange mix of cool and wounded tim says he loves me she said if he only knew alex im behaving badly please believe me when i called you all i really wanted was comfort and to tell you about babys guitars god i think thats what bothers me the most about the breakin i really wanted you to have them i wanted to do something for you she laughed and the funny thing is i dont really know why what we had i said isnt just going to vanish do you ever think of me of course does she know allisons smart i try hard not to think of you she said mostly i succeed im happy more often than you might think but sometimes you stick to me like a burr mostly i deal with it very well tims good to me she gazed around the ravished studio pride the fall i really didnt wake up yesterday thinking hey girl how about a little despair she laughed this time with some fervor touched my cheek gently youre still my friend i am will you tell her about coming here i dont know you probably shouldnt she said ignorance being bliss and all that not that you did anything wrong au contraire so theres nothing to tell thats my advice as a girl gang bangers as good a theory as any i wanted her up in san francisco anyway my erection hadnt flagged positioning myself so she wouldnt see i moved toward the closet where she stored the most expensive instruments lets get everything out to your truck a guitar string i said milo and petra and eric stahl stared at me the second group meeting no indian food a small conference room at the west la division seven pm and the phones were ringing cleaning up robins studio handling the strings had given me the idea when id told milo about the breakin he said shit ill check with pacific make sure theyre taking it seriously i went on the size the corrugations check a low e or a string against the marks on juliet kippers and vassily levitchs necks it also fits with the idea of our boy as a wouldbe artiste he plays them said petra milo grumbled opened the case files found the photos passed them around stahl inspected the pictures without comment petra said hard to tell from these ill go out and buy some strings bring them over to the coroner any particular brand i shook my head artiste said milo wonder if kevin has guitar strings in his pad stahls eyes drifted briefly to the floor petra said i spoke to kevins mom very uptight but no revelations kevins gentle et cetera her anxiety level could mean she has no idea where her boy is or that she does one thing did catch my eye shes a flaming redhead like erna murphy said milo interesting what do you think about that alex the old oedipal connection whats the mother like i said curvy voluptuous flashy dresser said petra more flash than class probably a looker in her youth not too shabby now seductive im sure she could be i didnt pick up any weird vibes vis à vis kevin but it was only a threeminute conversation the lady definitely did not want to talk to me i said its possible ernas red hair evoked something in kevin guitar string said milo whats next he stabs them with a fiddle bow kevins got a history of false starts wonder if he tried to be a guitar hero too petra said lets get in his apartment smell a gas leak and get the landlady to check meanwhile were there to ensure her safety stahl said ill do it milo said about the breakin robins name appeared on the liner notes to baby boys cd and baby boys guitars were taken putting into words what had gnawed at me your name was on there too alex it was a long list i said and even if there is a connection i have nothing to worry about not an artist you going to call robin i dont want to freak her out but i do want her to be careful its good shes in san francisco yeah ill call her wheres she staying dont know her boyfriends working with some kids on a les miz production should be easy enough to find out his lips twisted and he played with the cover of the pad her boyfriend the wall clock said seventen if allisons flight was on time shed be landing in twenty minutes milo said anything new on erna murphy stahl said no criminal history no state hospitalizations we havent been able to track down any family to inform said petra most of the state mental hospitals closed down years ago i said she couldve been committed and we wouldnt know it stahl said im open to suggestions doctor milo said even if she was hospitalized at camarillo or someplace like that it tells us nothing we already know shes mentally ill we need something more recent some connection to drummond she has no record at all stahl shook his head not even a traffic violation she never got a drivers license that probably means shes been impaired for a while i said impaired but bright and educated said milo driving can be frightening for disturbed people driving scares me sometimes said petra what paper does she have said milo stahl said a social security number and state welfare says she got on their rolls about eight years ago but didnt put in for benefits the only employment record i can find is eight years before that she worked at a mcdonalds from june through august sixteen years ago said milo she was seventeen high school summer job where san diego she went to mission high there the school lists her parents as donald and colette murphy but says they have no other records sd county assessor has donald and colette living in the same house for twentyone years then selling it ten years ago no indication where they moved no record of their buying another house i took a trip down there the neighborhoods workingclass civilian military employees retired noncoms no one remembers the murphys maybe when daddy retired they moved out of state said milo it would be nice to find them for their sake a halfsecond grimace tightened his face imagining another badnews call but the picture im getting is erna was long gone from hearth and home so its unlikely they can tell us anything relevant he looked to me for confirmation the lack of social connections i said would make erna the perfect acquaintance for our boy someone he could talk to without fear of her confiding his secrets to another friend someone he could dominate whose identity he could borrow the lack of connections said petra made her an easy victim she brushed nonexistent lint from the lapel of her black pantsuit to milo what now maybe another visit to kevins parents said milo shake the family tree a bit and see what falls out not right now she said dads overtly hostile very clear he wants nothing to do with us its possible mrs d could be made more pliable but hes calling the shots and his being an attorney makes it riskier than usual one wrong move he makes lawyer noise there goes the evidentiary chain if we had infinite manpower id stick a surveillance on the house what i figured id do in the real world is work the streets some more keep looking for anyone who remembers erna or kevin she glanced at stahl no harm trying to trace her parents he said donald and colette ill go national a guitar string said milo so far were playing out of tune so far said petra we dont even know what the song is allison arrived by taxi an hour and a half late freshly madeup but looking exhausted i had a couple of steaks on the grill spaghetti with olive oil and garlic in the sauté pan was mixing a butter lettuce salad i was wrong she said food at hand seems like a great idea no peanuts on the plane we were lucky to land some guy got drunk and rowdy for a while it looked as if it was going to be ugly a bunch of us subdued him and finally he fell asleep a bunch of us i said i got hold of one ankle sheena queen of the jungle she flexed a biceps it was terrifying brave girl i said holding her when it happens you dont even think she said you just act i need to sit down is wine on the menu we took a long time eating chatting slipping into the fuzz of light intoxication later undressed in bed we held each other without making love and fell asleep like roommates i awoke at am found allisons side of the bed empty and went to look for her she was in the kitchen sitting in dim light wearing one of my tshirts and drinking instant decaf hair tied up carelessly face scrubbed of makeup bare legs smooth and white against the dark oak floor biorhythm must be off she said from colorado she shrugged i sat down hope you dont mind she said but i was wandering around trying to tire myself out what are all those guitar cases in the spare bedroom about i told her she said poor robin what a trauma nice of you i said it seemed the right thing to do a clump of black hair came loose and she slipped it behind her ear her eyes were bloodshot without makeup she looked a bit faded but younger i leaned over and kissed her lips sour breath both of us so shes back in san francisco yup helping her was the right thing to do she said now do something for me she got up crossed her arms raised the tshirt from her slim white body i was up by seven wakened by her light snoring i watched her chest rise and fall studied her pale lovely face scrunched between two pillows mouth agape in what could have been a comical expression longfingered hands gripped the covers tight grip frantic movement behind her eyelids dreams from the tension in her body maybe not good ones i closed my eyes she stopped snoring started again when she opened her eyes and saw me the blue irises were clogged with confusion i smiled she said oh sat up stared at me as if encountering a stranger then good morning baby she knuckled her eyes was i snoring not a bit she had a morning full of patients and left at eight i tidied up thought about robin in san francisco baby boy lees instruments gone and what that meant if anything three blocks south the gangs were active but babys gibson had been the only acoustic instrument taken the phone rang milo said the ligature marks on julie and levitch are a perfect match to a lightgauge low e guitar string now what does that mean it means nothing about these killings is accidental i said and that worries me talk to the pacific detectives about robins breakin they see it as a routine burglary are they good average he said but no reason to think theyre wrong robins neighborhood theres plenty of that i thought of robin living with me up in the glen higherpriced neighborhood safer except when it wasnt a few years ago a murderous psychopath had burned down the house our house milo said i asked them for a uniform driveby for the next few weeks the usual two passes a day yeah i know but its better than nothing i also gave them kevin drummonds vehicle and plates told them to keep a special lookout meanwhile robins in san francisco so dont worry stahl and the landlady got into drummonds apartment last night he collects toys and magazines has a slew of computer and printing equipment no guitars no strings no creepy trophies nothing incriminating and not a single copy of grooverat thats what i find interesting covering his tracks i said or hes got another storage space stahls calling urent places wonder if it was stahls second entry what do you mean normally hes got the demeanor of a statue yesterday when you talked about going in his eyes got jumpy and he looked at the floor did he hes a strange one thats for sure the magazines included gay porn rough stuff stahl said kevins been living spartan just a few bits of clothing no personal effects of any consequence that could be because he split for the long run or there is another stash spot it could also mean psychological deterioration i said drawing inward spitting on his parents values petra decided she will give the parents another try specifically the father im heading over to ev kippers office building see if i can learn more about his girlfriend because one of his neighbors called me claims ol evs been looking especially angry pounding away late at night past the curfew theyre afraid to call the cops also the girlfriends been looking rather down the last coupla days eating alone i cant see any easy link to the cases but i dont have a lead in any other direction the more i think about erna murphy the more i want to know about her but all petras found so far are a few merchants who vaguely remember erna on the street no buddies or boyfriends she was always by herself what about the doctor the dove house folks called in when she bled on the sheets could be erna opened up to her the dove house folks said the doctor just met erna once the dove house folks admitted they dont stay in touch with the women once they leave the shelter and erna was out of there more than she was in if she got sick again maybe she returned to the person whod cared for her well he said nothing else looks promising might as well check it out you mind doing it im on my way to century city sure i said whats the doctors name let me check my notes here it is hannah gold ill call her now i phoned dr gold got a male receptionist used my title he said shes with a patient doctor its about a patient ernadine murphy is this an emergency its important hold on please moments later dr gold wants to know what its about ernadine murphy was murdered oh hold on please longer wait this time the same man came on the line dr gold will be free at noon you can come by then the office was a sandcolored bungalow next to a fiat mechanic a black plastic sign to the right of the door said vrinda srinivasan md hannah r gold m ph md angela b borelli md internal medicine obstetricsgynecology womens health issues i arrived at noon but dr gold wasnt free three patients sat in the waiting room two elderly women and a starving girl around fifteen all of them looked up as i entered the kid kept staring until my smile made her frown in disgust and she returned to picking her cuticles small overheated waiting room furnished with clean but faded castoffs framed photos of machu picchu and nepal and angkor wat hung on the walls enya sang sweetly on tape a handwritten sign taped to the reception counter said we take medical from you and sometimes we even get paid by the state cash wont be refused pay what you can or dont worry about it no glass blocking the reception area just a cramped space occupied by a young man in his early twenties with neatly cut prematurely gray hair he pored over principles of accounting as if it were a thriller a name tag on his plaid shortsleeved shirt read eli when i stepped up he put the book down reluctantly im dr delaware shes running late he lowered his voice shes very upset by what i told her you might not be able to tell but she is shes my sister twentyfive minutes later all three patients were gone and eli announced he was going to lunch shell be right out he said tucking the textbook under his arm and leaving the bungalow five minutes after that a woman in a buttoned white coat stepped into the waiting room holding a medical chart young face foxlike the kind of bronze skin that glows naturally not much older than thirty but her thick brushy shoulderlength hair was snowwhite genetics eli would get there soon she had pale green eyes that couldve used some rest im dr gold she held out a hand gripped my fingers defensively the way delicately boned women learn to do so as not to be crushed her skin was dry and cold thanks for meeting with me the seacolored eyes were downslanted wide and curious broad mouth strong square chin an exceedingly handsome woman she locked the waiting room door sat down on a worn olive green herringbone chair that matched nothing else in the room crossed her legs beneath the white coat she wore black jeans and gray boots enyas voice mourned in gaelic what happened to erna she said i gave her the basics oh my and youre here because i consult to the police they asked me to talk to you meaning the murder has psychological overtones as opposed to a dumb street crime hard to say at this point i said how well did you know her you dont really know someone like erna i saw her a few times here or at dove house once there twice here she returned after your emergency call to the shelter i gave her my card she said i was shocked to find out shed actually kept it she flipped the chart open inside was a single page upside down i made out small neat handwriting both times were dropins the first was a little over two weeks after i saw her at dove house her anal fissures had started bleeding again and she was complaining of pain it didnt surprise me all id done the first time was a superficial exam someone like that you can only imagine whats going on internally i urged her to get scoped offered to arrange it for free at county she refused so i gave her salve and analgesics and the basic lecture on hygiene not laid on too thickly you have to know your audience know what you mean i said i trained at western peds really she said i did my training at county but rotated through wp do you know ruben eagle i know him well we exchanged names places other petty commonalities then hannah golds face turned grave the second time i saw erna was a lot more alarming it was at night she burst in here just as i was closing up the staff had gone home and i was turning off the lights and the door opened and there she was waving her hands really out of sorts then her eyes got a panicked look and she reached out she shuddered she wanted physical comfort im afraid i stepped away from her she was a big woman my reflexive response was fear she gave me this look just collapsed on the floor in tears i eased her to her feet brought her back to my office she was muscularly rigid and babbling incoherently im not a psychiatrist i didnt want to fool with thorazine or anything else heavy calling emergency services would have been a betrayal i no longer felt threatened she was pathetic not dangerous she closed the chart i gave her an im injection of valium and some herb tea sat there with her for had to be almost an hour finally she calmed down if she hadnt i would have called the emts any idea what had upset her she wouldnt say got extremely quiet almost mute then she apologized for bothering me and insisted on leaving almost mute she answered simple yesorno questions about nonthreatening topics but nothing about what had brought her to the office or her physical problems i wanted to check her out physically but shed have none of that yet she kept apologizing lucid enough to know shed been inappropriate i suggested she return to dove house she said that was a dandy idea those were her exact words thats a dandy idea dr gold when she said it she was almost perky shed do that turn cheerful without warning but it was an upsetting cheerfulness overwrought using phrases that were too refined for the context the people at dove house felt shed been well educated hannah gold thought about that or faking it what do you mean havent you seen psychotics do that they latch on to phrases and spit them back like autistic children was that your sense of erna she compressed her lips i really cant claim to have a sense of her the downslanted eyes narrowed do you have any idea who did this to her it could be someone she trusted someone who used her sexually was she sexually active not in the classic sense she said what do you mean she licked her lips when i examined her her vaginal area was raw and she had body lice and old scars fibrosed lesions those are things you expect in a street person but then i did a pelvic and couldnt believe what i found her hymen was intact she was still a virgin women on the street get used in the worst ways imaginable erna was a big woman but a violent man a group of men couldve subdued her i find the fact that she was never entered remarkable unless her companion had no interest in heterosexual intercourse her genital area was raw i said she couldve been assaulted without being penetrated no she said this was more like poor hygiene there were no lacerations no trauma of any sort and she didnt get upset when i checked her out just the opposite stoic as if she was totally cut off from that part of her i said when she was lucid refined what did she talk about the first time she was here i got her to talk about things she liked and she started going on about art how it was the best thing in the world how artists were gods she could name painters french flemish artists ive never heard of for all i know she made them up but they sounded authentic did she ever mention friends or family i tried to ask her about her parents where she was from where she went to school she didnt want to talk about that the only thing she admitted to was a cousin a really smart cousin he liked art too she seemed to be proud of that but thats all shed say about him him i said a male cousin thats my recollection she shook her head its been a while you said someone she trusted mightve abused her there really is a cousin i assumed it was all delusion i havent heard of one i said the police are thinking she mightve been lured by someone she knew when did her two visits take place she consulted the chart erna murphys first dropin had been five months ago the second had taken place on a thursday two days before baby boys murder the cousin she said she talked about him as if she was really impressed if id known no reason to know spoken like a true psychologist when i was in med school i dated a psychologist nice guy terrible guy she suppressed a yawn excuse me sorry im bushed and thats really all i can tell you kissing cousin said milo by cell phone nothing beyond kissing i gave him the results of erna murphys pelvic exam last virgin in hollywood if it wasnt so pathetic he was on his cell calling from the car reception fading in and out more like virgin sacrifice i said she was used and discarded used for what good question theorize adoration submissiveness listening to his fantasies running chores as in scoping out murder scenes and reporting back an asexual relationship is consistent with kevins being gay the interest in art drew them together maybe she called him her cousin because he represented her surrogate family she refused to say a word about her real family or he said kevins really her cousin that too i said red hair just like his mother i laughed hey sometimes it helps not to be too brilliant how would you know i said pshaw no luck on ernas folks yet stahls working with the military but guess what kevins honda showed up inglewood pd tow yard parked illegally it got hauled in two days ago inglewood i said near the airport not far im heading there as we speak gonna flash kevins picture at the airline desks see if anyone remembers him youre canvassing lax by yourself no me and my baby ds but its still a needle in the proverbial youknowwhat the hondas being transferred to our motor lab but its been pawed over pretty thoroughly what finding it does though is firm up kev as our bad boy he did bad things found out we were asking about him cut town there were no trophies in his pad because he took them his voice was engulfed by static any ideas about which airline to start with check with passport control and eliminate foreign flights my first stop he said not that its gonna be a snap those guys love paperwork lets assume domestic though where would you begin why not boston i said hes been there before enjoyed the ballet eric stahl spent two days dealing with the various branches of the united states armed forces thousands of donald murphys in the social security files military service would winnow it down but pentagon pencil pushers werent spitting out the information without putting him through the usual the fact that he knew the sublanguage made it a little easier how he felt about the military was another thing hed started with ernas mother first because colette was a less common name one hundred eighteen ssi records with fortythree fitting the approximate age range he began with the western states came up empty wondering all the while if this chasing down erna was fruitless even if he found her family even so hed do what he was told he worked his way east found a colette murphy in saint louis whose evasive tone and repeated denials made him wonder from her accent stahl guessed a black woman he didnt ask you didnt do that anymore the army had taught him racial sensitivity as in treat the saudis like gods and smile as they shit on you he traced saint louis colette with her local police found out she had a record for petty larceny which explained the caginess and that shed never been married to any donald at pm he reached a colette murphy in brooklyn eleventhirty her time she said you woke me up sorry maam not expecting much stahl gave her the line tracing donald on a routine investigation no mention of ernas name she said christ at this hour thats not me its my sisterinlaw my husbands brother married her and they had a crazy kid im colette and donald finds himself a

that uniform of his go to bars try to pick up women military types do that youre telling me said brooklyn colette i was married to one for thirtyfour years ed was coast guard then he joined the port authority sat at a desk and made like he was an admiral she cackled finally his ship came in and im on high ground im going back to sleep one more thing maam said stahl please its late she snapped

military time am i right i served maam well goody for you ohsaycanyouseebythedawn enough of you soon im gonna see the dawn san diego to hawaii made it easy back to the ssi list donald arthur murphy sixtynine years old somewhere near la despite her problems erna hadnt strayed far from home it was too late to access navy or county property files so stahl drove to his oneroom flat on franklin removed his clothes folded them neatly got on his bed lay atop his blanket masturbated briefly while thinking of nothing showered and scrubbed himself raw then he placed prewashed precut salad greens on a paper plate added a can of tuna because he needed protein ate quickly without tasting went to sleep the next morning he used his home phone donald arthur murphy owned no real estate in la county same for orange riverside san bernadino all districts south to the mexican border stahl worked his way through the northern counties up to oregon still no hits a renter he phoned the navy office in port hueneme finally obtained the address where murphys pension check was sent each month sun garden convalescent home palms avenue in mar vista a half hour car ride connor hadnt called him in a while but he wanted to keep things orderly so he phoned her at the station knowing she wouldnt be in he left a message document everything tried her home number got no answer was she sleeping in and letting the phone ring or out already working the streets maybe neither and she was recreating out on a date she was cute enough a girl with a social life intellectually he understood the need for pleasure viscerally it left him cold petra got up early to work the streets last nights shift had been spent with the afterdark crowd clubbies bouncers parking valets boulevard evangelists dopezombies curb trawlers assorted other miscreants crazies too hollywood at night was an openair asylum she stared into dead eyes sniffed rancid auras felt revulsion and pity and futility these were erna murphys compatriots but no one coherent enough to talk admitted knowing the big redhead today would be more mundane covering merchants shed missed the first time around hopefully some good citizen would recall erna it was a miscreant who came through a pallid twentytwoyearold meth shooter and petty pill dealer named strobe with matted oatmealcolored hair that hung past his shoulder blades real name duncan bradley beemish a country kid a hick from somewhere down south petra couldnt remember where hed run away years ago come to hollywood rotted like so many of them petra had worked him as a smalltime informant very smalltime and only once shed run into beemish while working a bar shooting and the speedfreak had provided ambiguous info that led petra to someone who knew someone who mightve heard something about something that mightve gone down but hadnt that fiasco had cost her seventy bucks and shed had enough of strobe but he found her as she talked to the owner of a joint on western that advertised mediterranean cuisine on western that meant kabobs and felafel and charcoal fumes that leaked to the sidewalk the proprietor was a middleeasterner with a big gold frontal incisor and a toofriendly attitude the unctuous type that could turn quickly the food stand had a b rating from the health department which meant rodent droppings had topped the acceptable level gold tooth denied ever seeing erna murphy and offered petra a free sample as she begged off and turned to leave a reedy voice said ill take the sanwich tective connor she turned saw strobes twitchy face the kid never stood still and his long hair vibrated like electric filament the falafel guys swarthy complexion purpled you to petra geet him offa my brawberty he alla time take the hot bebber fuck you osama said strobe petra said work on the charm duncan strobe hacked and blew tobacco breath at her and slapped his knee tective connor whuz up wuz that twitchy fingers wiggled at the photo in petras hand dead woman cool lemme see the falafel king ordered you police geet him offa my brawberty strobe bent his knees in a crouch filthy hair strands swinging like vines as he put body english into a fulminating onefinger salute before he could complete the gesture petra ushered him off the property away from gold tooths shouts and over to her car fuckin towelhead said strobe in a suddenly scary voice if i come back and cut him you gonna bother to investigate before petra could answer the freaks methattenuated attention span snapped his coyote eyes back to erna murphys photo merriment in the eyes meanspirited the kids cold side lurked just beneath the surface hey i know her do you said petra yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah saw her what lemme see hadda be a few days ago where duncan how mutchez it worth a sandwich said petra ha hahahahahahaha get serious tective connor how can i know what its worth until you tell me what you know duncan how can i tell you what i know unless you pay me tective connor duncan duncan said petra unclasping her purse and pulling out a twenty strobe snatched the bill like a zoo animal grabbing a peanut he pocketed the money squinted at the photo hadda be a few days ago you already told me that when exactly and where when exactly was three days ago maybe three could be two could be three which is it duncan oh man said strobe time you know sometimes it he chuckled finishing the sentence in his head and deeming it witty two versus three was a crucial distinction erna murphy had been killed three days ago two would mean strobe had zero credibility two or three choose one said petra id hafta say three whered you see her duncan roun bronson ridgeway roun there you know not far from where ernas body had been found petra squinted at strobe took in his scrawny frame the double bags under his eyes incipient wrinkles the kid had what five more years strobe fidgeted under her scrutiny rocked on his heels twisted his hair girlish gesture but nothing feminine about this kid he was a victim turned to predator on a dark secluded street petra wouldnt have approached him without backup what time was this she said like i said late another chuckle or early depending what time two three four am strobe stared at her stunned by the idiocy of the question yeah he said what were you doing there duncan hanging who were you hanging with no one hanging all by yourself hey said strobe least i know i got good company hollywood near bronson was only a short stroll from hospital row on sunset perfect place to score pills from some corrupt doctor or nurse or pharmacist then back to the boulevard for resale more than theory petra knew last year narcotics had busted a surgical resident playing wholesaler idiot studies that hard gets that far only to blow it she said im figuring you were doing a little trading strobe knew exactly what she meant and he flashed a gaptoothed grin green stuff grew on his gums lord petra said tell me exactly what you saw shes a crazy right was yeah yeah yeah thats what i saw a crazy acting crazy walking up and down crazy talking to herself like any other crazy then some car picked her up a john youre saying she was hooking what else do bitches do at night when theyre walking back and forth strobe laughed so what he cut her we got a jack ripper or something youre amused by all this duncan hey you get your laughs where you get em do you know for a fact that she was hooking well sure why not theres sure and theres why not said petra i gotta choose one again cut the crap duncan tell me what you know for a fact and theres another twenty in it for you keep this up and i take back the first bill and book you on something hey said strobe in that same scary voice petra figured shed probably averted something nasty between him and the hottempered falafel vendor for the time being strobes eyes were all over the place and his emaciated frame had tightened up checking out an escape route or planning something aggressive then he glanced at petras purse her gun was inside right on top her cuffs were on her belt riding the small of her back he wouldnt be that nuts would he she smiled said duncan duncan grabbed him spun him bent his arm back fumbled with the cuffs got one wrist then the other aw tective a quick frisk produced a crumpled halfempty pack of salems a baggie of pills and capsules and a rusted pocketknife aw he repeated then he began bawling like a baby she put him in the backseat of her car stuffed the cigarettes in his shirt pocket ditched the dope down a sewer drain sorry pacific ocean pocketed the knife got in front unzipped her purse placed her hand on her gun tears drizzled from the kids eyes im real sorry tective connor he said sounding around twelve i aint trying to jerk you aroun im just hungry is all need a sandwich not enough business strobe looked in the direction of the storm drain not no more look she said i dont have time for games tell me exactly what you know about erna murphy and what you saw three nights ago i don know nothing about her don even know her name said strobe i just seen her like i told you i know shes one a the crazies she hang with any other crazies you gonna arrest me not if you cooperate you gonna take these off shifting his arms it hurts his wrists were tiny and shed ratcheted the cuffs tight but no way was he in pain shed been careful she always was everyone an actor they come off when were finished aint this illegal duncan sorry sorry okay okay okay what i know what was the question did she hang with other crazies not any i saw its not like she was there all the time like a part of the scene shed be there then she wouldnt know what i mean i never talked to her no one talked to her she didnt talk to no one she was crazy do you know for a fact that she was hooking strobes fuzzy tongue traveled along the meager parched strip of grayish tissue that passed for his lower lip no i cant say that i just assumed cause she got in the car what kind of car just a car he said nothing fancy no beemer or porsche color light big or small small i guess kevin drummond drove a white honda milos call about the car turning up near the airport firmed kevin up further as their guy the plan was to wait until the vehicle was processed then shed be bracing kevins parents again strobes story kicked things up several notches time and place a perfect fit kevin decides ernas expendable picks her up drives her a few blocks away plies her with booze does the deed ditches the car in inglewood makes the short hike to lax and is heavenward milo had called her early this morning before she left no sightings of kevin at the airport yet the car she said give me a brand duncan i dunno tective connor nissan toyota honda chevy ford i dunno strobe insisted thats the truth i dont wanna give you some bullshit and then you find out different and you think im lyin and you come back for me could you please take these off i cant stand being tied up something in the kids tone a genuine plaintiveness that spoke of past indignities tugged at her heart runaways came to hollywood for a reason for a horrible moment petra visualized a younger rosycheeked duncan beemish tied up at home by some pervert as if sensing her unease strobe broke down and cried even louder petra cut him off mentally not a van definitely a car a car not an suv a car color light white gray i dunno i aint lying to you whyd you assume she was hooking duncan because she was on the street and the car pulled up and she got in how many people in the car dunno what did the driver look like didnt see him how far were you from the car um um um maybe half a block this happened right on the boulevard no a side street which one um ridgeway yeah i think it was ridgeway yeah yeah ridgeway its real dark there go there and check all these broken streetlights ridgeway was a block from where the surgeon had been busted the city had probably fixed the lights only to have them vandalized by the freelance pharmacists petra said before she got in the car did she talk to the driver no she just got in no negotiating no scoping out for a uc cop that doesnt sound like a hooker duncan strobes eyes widened speedfreak insight yeah youre right he squirmed some more can you take these off please she pumped him a while longer got nothing left the car returned to mr gold tooth and ordered a jumbo kabob combo with double hot peppers and an xl cola once again he tried to freebie her once again she insisted on paying in full and tooths dark eyes clouded some ethnic insult no doubt i give you extra bebbers returning to the honda she placed the food on the trunk pulled strobe out uncuffed him had him sit on the curb a few feet away he complied readily and she brought him the food and another twentydollar bill a few feet away gold tooth glared strobes claws were on the sandwich before petra took a breath snarfing audibly making animal sounds with a mouth full of meat and bread and tahina dripping down his chin he said thanks tective bon appétit duncan milo followed the blonde hed been watching her building for an hour tailed her as she and a group of coworkers left and walked a block west to the century city mall her companions were three other women all dressed like the blonde in sombercolored suits all were older than the blonde who appeared to be twentyfive or six everett kippers young squeeze stephanie she was shapely of medium height a good deal of it legs she made no attempt to capitalize on that her skirt was knee length but she couldnt prevent the way she moved naturally the blond hair was long and straight platinum with an overlay of gold from the back she looked like every straight guys dream milo appreciated her figure the way he enjoyed a good painting he followed the four women to the food court where the coworkers veered into the warren of fastfood booths after one of them said youre sure steph stephanie nodded her friend said see you later she continued walking past the brentanos bookstore and the multiplex theaters stopping to windowshop at bloomingdales and several boutiques then continuing until she reached a plaza at the south end of the mall benches and food vendors were scattered around a big square of sunbrightened stone gorgeous day perfect for a meeting with someone you loved the complex was jammed with shoppers and tourists and whitecollar types from the neighboring office buildings taking lunch milo bought a jumbo iced tea melted into the throng and strolled leisurely while keeping his eye on that pretty blond head when stephanie stopped in the center of the plaza and didnt move for a moment he kept himself behind a corner then ventured out on foot and stood with his back to her sipping tea through a straw positioned so he could watch her reflection in a shop window she tossed her hair smoothed it over her ears removed her sunglasses put them back on waiting for the boyfriend milo was curious why kipper had been looking so angry he kept his eye on the walkway kippers likely approach stephanie bought a hot pretzel with mustard and a cup of something from a pushcart vendor took a bench and began eating munching away tossing crumbs to the pigeons crossing those long legs finishing most of the pretzel and the drink she got up and bought an icecream cone from another cart and sat back down in the same spot not a single glance at her watch fifteen minutes passed and she didnt look the least bit impatient another five she yawned stretched looked up at the sun she removed her shades again took midday heat on her face eyes closed mellowing out not waiting for anyone milo crossed the plaza made a long wide circle and approached her from the back she wouldnt see him until he was ready his badge was in hand concealed by his fingers she was sure to be startled by the sight of a big man bearing down on her and he hoped the shield would focus her avoid a scene she didnt hear him coming didnt look up and open her eyes until hed walked around to the front of her bench was nearly on top of her dark eyes surprised he looked past that focused on the bruise that swelled her left cheekbone shed done well with her makeup had almost concealed the purpling but a bit peeked through a rosy splotch deepening her smooth tan complexion the entire left side of her face was enlarged cosmetics couldnt handle edema the badge scared her and he pocketed it sorry to bother you maam especially today i dont understand she said in a small voice today he sat down beside her recited his title emphasizing all the buzzwords lieutenant police homicide that did nothing to squelch stephanies fear level but it did focus her anxiety this is about julie right she said trembling lips you cant be serious serious about what ms cranner stephanie cranner ev told me youd been asking him lots of questions about julie that you probably suspected him because he was the ex her hand rose toward the bruised cheek then stopped and dropped into her lap thats ridiculous he told you we suspected him said milo its true isnt it said stephanie cranner pleasant voice youthful lilting but strained by anxiety everything about her radiated youth and health except the bruise did mr kipper do that to you the brown eyes dropped i dont want to make a big deal out of it it has nothing to do with julie not her murder anyway milo slumped made himself as small as possible nonthreatening stephanie cranner sat up straighter ive got to get back to the office you just got here said milo usually you take forty minutes for lunch her mouth dropped open youve been watching me he shrugged thats outrageous she said i havent done anything i just happen to be in love with ev a beat and he loves me milo eyed the swollen cheek first time hes done that yes absolutely ah it is she said absolutely the first time thats why i dont want to make a big deal please sure said milo thank you lieutenant he made no move to leave she said may i go now lieutenant please milo swiveled eased himself a little closer made eye contact ms cranner i have absolutely no desire to make your life difficult i work homicide not domestic violence though i should tell you the two arent always unrelated stephanie cranner gaped at him this is unbelievable youre saying id be less concerned about your wellbeing if i knew what happened what happened was ev and i had words a fight it was my fault i lost it got physical and started shoving at him kept shoving really shoving hard he took it for a while then finally he shoved me back with his fist with his hand she said showing milo a smooth palm she wore two rings on each hand cheap stuff thin gold semiprecious stones no diamond solitaire his open hand did that yes it did lieutenant because i was charging him and the movement all the force we collided believe me he was a lot more upset than me got down on his knees and begged forgiveness did you grant it said milo of course i did there was nothing to forgive she thumped a firm bosom i started it he was defending himself milo sipped iced tea and let several moments pass lunching alone today he said hes in a meeting ah using the old shrink word again after riding alex about it for years hed found it a useful tool he is said stephanie cranner if you dont believe me you can check and you were in the mood to be alone is that a crime what got you so upset that you shoved him ms cranner i dont see why i have to talk about it you dont then i wont milo smiled she said youre not going to let go of this ive got a job to do look she said if you have to know the fight was about julie which is exactly why youre wasting your time looking at ev she folded her arms across her chest looked smug as if that explained it all milo said you lost me ms cranner puleeze she said dont you get it ev loved julie still does thats what ticked me off he loves me but he also he cant get julie out of his head even with her being since she died he cant a blush spread from her neck to her hairline a reaction so sudden and deeply pigmented that it appeared cartoonish since she died he cant what said milo stephanie cranner mumbled pardon you know milo said nothing shit said stephanie cranner me and my big mouth her fingertips grazed his sleeves she batted her lashes and flipped her hair and shot him a sick smile please lieutenant dont tell him i said anything about please dont tell him hed she stopped herself milo suppressed his own sick smile knowing what had been coming hed kill me hed be unhappy she said too emphatically i had no right to tell you youve got me to say things i dont mean lets leave it at this since julie mr kippers changed no yes not just in that way mainly emotionally he hes distant its all part of the same thing emotionally he said another shrinks trick echoing she said yes ev cared for julie so much that he cant put her out of his mind and give himself over she drew back her arm hurled the remaining piece of pretzel across the plaza more of an assault than altruism pigeons scattered the mustardcrusted dough rolled teetered came to a halt she said i knew about julie when i started going with him knew what that they still saw each other once in a while i was cool with that i figured it would fade and ev tried he wanted to give himself to me but she blinked away tears put on her sunglasses showed milo her profile they kept seeing each other he said it was nothing sneaky lieutenant ev was always open about it it had always been part of the deal she turned abruptly faced milo again ev loved julie so deeply that he couldnt let go of her theres no way he would have done anything to hurt her let alone kill her he managed to keep her there for another fifteen minutes shifted the topic to her work and learned she was a u grad working as a secretary while she studied nights for a pepperdine mba smart with big plans seeing herself and kipper as a potential power couple in the financial world she gave him nothing more about kipper and julie he handed her his card she said i really have nothing else to tell you figuring shed toss it the moment he was gone he left the plaza amazed that someone so young and goodlooking and bright would accept the contingencies ev kipper had saddled her with probably something to do with her own upbringing but that was alexs world back in his unmarked he phoned alex at home recounted the interview alex said im inclined to agree with her that level of passion julie and kipper get divorced but nine years later kipper cant let go his feelings for her are so intense that once shes dead he cant get it up doesnt all that imply an unhealthy emotional situation alex toss in kippers temper and now we know he acts out physically and doesnt that add up to an explosive situation like i told cranner domestic violence and homicide aint strangers im not saying kipper couldnt have lost it and gotten violent with julie but thats not the crime scene weve got julies murder was thoughtout cold and calculated just like all the others stalking an optimal kill site the use of a preselected weapon pseudosexual posing if kipper had done it he wouldnt have demeaned julie on the contrary hed have arranged her body in as dignified a manner as possible the only thing that would get me to change my mind is some link between kipper and erna murphy also the same type of guitar string was used on julie and levitch that would mean kipper murdered levitch to cover for julie and that sounds like a bad movie life sometimes imitates bad art said milo why not a welldressed man like kipper would blend in with the concert crowd at szabo and lohs and julie and levitch were the only ones the string was used on you have your doubts about the psychiccannibal scenario what about faithful scrivener all those reviews of our victims artistic types get reviewed its not a matter of doubt im exploring alternatives okay said alex im sure youre right but kipper being that freaked out over julie bugs me not just the impotence but his defying the cops by hammering late at night to me that says boundaries are loosening i wouldnt want to be stephanie im not sure she sees the danger your instincts are good if you think shes in serious danger warn her basically i did okay im gonna check in with petra then see how the motor labs doing on kevin drummonds honda thanks for listening my pleasure robin still in san francisco last i heard said alex keeping his voice even but milo knew the question had been out of line no time to get distracted stay on course if only he could decide what on course meant he didnt apologize no sense apologizing instead he said anything turns up ill let you know id appreciate that said alex back to his friendly voice this ones a twister isnt it always the therapist eric stahl snapped off fifty onehanded pushups followed by another four hundred conventionals that level of exertion seldom made him sweat but this time he was soaked anticipation of the visit to donald murphy stupid he should be able to control it but the body didnt lie he showered dressed in one of his four black suitwhite shirtgray tie combos and drove to sun garden convalescent home in mar vista the place was a coffeecolored twostory building with dark brown trim inside was a lobby covered in flocked green paper ancient people lolled in wheelchairs then the hospital smell vertigo stabbed stahl he fought the urge to bolt kept his posture bootcamp rigid yanked his lapels in place and walked to the front desk the woman in charge was a middleaged filipina who wore a white coat over her floral dress in saudi arabia a lot of the servants had been filipinas little more than slaves really people in a worse situation than him this ones badge said she was corazon diaz unit assistant hospital lingo for clerk stahl smiled at her worked hard at being a regular guy told her what he was after police she said nothing serious maam i just need to speak with one of your patients we call them guests the guest im looking for is donald a murphy let me check computer clicks floor two he rode a very slow elevator up to the second floor more flocked walls but no mistaking this for anything but what it was a ward a nursing station was positioned at the center and a couple of women in red uniforms stood around chatting then one long corridor lined by rooms two gurneys in the hall rumpled bedding on one stahl struggled to maintain even as he approached the nurses they didnt stop talking he was about to ask them for donald murphys room number when he noticed a whiteboard above the station names inked in with blue marker not unlike the case list at the station twofourteen he made his way up the hall passing rooms occupied by very old people some in wheelchairs others bedridden waves of television noise hit him the clickclick of medical apparatus the smell even stronger up here the generic chemical reek mixed with vomitus fecal stench sick sweat and a host of odors he couldnt identify his skin had turned clammy and another attack of imbalance nearly doubled him over he stopped midway up the corridor pressed a palm against the fuzzy wallpaper breathed in out in out felt lightheaded but a little better and kept going to open door he went in and closed it behind him the man on the bed had tubes running in and out of his nose and arms a bank of monitors above his pillow proved he was alive catheter hosing trailed from under the sheets to a bottle on the floor filled with amber fluid the navy said cpo donald arthur murphy ret was sixtynine years old but this guy looked a hundred stahl checked the patients wrist bracelet da murphy the correct birth date his own heart pounding he forced his way past the anxiety and studied the man on the bed ernas father had a withered triangular face topped by dry wild white hair a few of the hairs bore the remnants of their original color a faint ginger at the roots murphys hands were large and thick and liverspotted his nose was a mass of gin blossoms his toothless mouth had collapsed eyes closed still as a mummy no respiration stahl could make out but the monitors said otherwise he said mr murphy no reaction from the body on the bed or the equipment all the effort for nothing he stood there wondering who to talk to when another wave of vertigo hit him and a fullbody sweat washed over him like hard surf too strong to control shit this one was going to get him he spotted a chair made it over just in time closed his eyes a foghorn brought him out of it who are you and what do you think youre doing here stahls eyes opened traveled to the clock above the medical monitors hed been out for just a few minutes answer me demanded the same voice brassy female a blaring tuba of a voice he turned faced the source older woman mid to late sixties big broadshouldered heavyset her face was a nearperfect sphere topped by a puffy sprayed bulb of champagnecolored waves made up heavily way too much rouge and eye shadow burgundy lipstick did little to enhance her rubbery lips she wore a grass green knit suit that had to be expensive with big crystal buttons and white piping on the lapels too tight for her linebackers frame she seemed to be bursting out of it matching shoes and purse crocodile purse with massive rhinestone clasp the rock on her sausagelike ring finger was no rhinestone blinding white humongous diamond earrings a pair of stones in each a string of huge black pearls encircled a turkeyringed neck well she blared glaring down at him as she planted both hands on barnwide hips another massive ring sparkled from her right hand emerald solitaire even bigger than the diamond enough jewelry on her to finance stahls retirement several times over im going to call security right now her jowls shook and her bosoms expressed sympathy stahls head hurt the sound of that merciless voice was ground glass in an open sore he fumbled in his pocket flashed the badge youre the police she said then what in blazes were you doing sleeping in donalds room sorry maam not feeling well i sat down to catch my breath mustve passed out for a second if youre sick then you certainly shouldnt be here donalds very ill youd better not have given him anything this is outrageous stahl got to his feet no more vertigo annoyance at having to deal with this battleax had vanquished his anxiety interesting he said what relationship do you and mr murphy have no no no a finger wagged diamonds glinted you tell me why youre here mr murphys daughter was murdered said stahl erna you knew her knew her im her aunt donalds baby sister what happened to her irritated demanding not a trace of sympathy or shock youre not surprised said stahl young man ernadine was psychiatrically disturbed had been for years donald had no contact with her nor had i no one in the family had she regarded the man on the bed as you can see theres no point in bothering donald how long has he been this way her expression said whats it to you months young man months coma the woman laughed you must be a detective whats wrong with him ms mrs trueblood alma f trueblood murphys baby sister stahl couldnt imagine this one ever being small he said maam is there anything you can tell me about no snapped alma trueblood maam you didnt hear the question dont need to theres nothing i can tell you about ernadine as i just said shes been disturbed for years her death was a long time coming if you ask me living on the street like that donald hadnt seen her in years youll just have to take my word on that how many years many they lost contact you say her death was a long time coming i certainly do ernadine refused help went her own way lived on the streets she was always a strange little girl wild sullen odd habits strange eating habits chalk dirt spoiled food she picked at her hair walked around in circles talking to herself drew pictures all day but had not a whit of talent alma trueblood drew herself up i never liked having her around she was a bad influence on my children and i must tell you officer i wont have the family drawn into anything sordid wow said stahl what is that supposed to mean young man you seem pretty angry i am not angry i am protective my brother needs protectionlook at him first his heart then his liver and his kidneys everythings failing im footing the bill for this place and believe me it adds up to a pretty penny if i wasnt donald would end up in some veterans affairs hospital no i wont hear of that the good lords been kind to me and my big brother will rest here for however long it takes now dont think me cruel i regret hearing about ernadine however she left the family years ago and i wont have her ruining things ruining things by dying by associating us with whatever sordid life she led we my husband and i william t trueblood are well respected in the community we endow many worthy causes and i wont have mr truebloods name dragged into anything unsavory is that clear very ill thank you to leave then alma trueblood popped the clasp on the green croc purse offering stahl a view of the contents lots of stuff inside but everything neatly arranged parcels wrapped in filmy tissue paper first time hed seen a purse that organized ever spend time in the military mrs trueblood why would you ask that ridiculous thick fingers probed the bottom of the purse found a small gold case that she opened out came a creamcolored calling card have someone inform me as to ernadines burial arrangements ill be footing the bill of course good day young man stahl slipped the card in a jacket pocket great paper heavy weight silky gloss baby sister had climbed socially he headed for the door alma trueblood said youd better do something about that narcolepsy of yours im sure your superiors wouldnt be pleased to hear about it milo called late in the afternoon petra and i figured its time to give drummonds parents another try no prints in the honda other than kevins on the steering wheel and the drivers door handle and a few scattered smudges from various inglewood towyard folk no blood no body fluids no weapons no link to erna murphy either but petra did find someone who saw her getting into a small light car the night she was killed walking distance from the kill spot kevins car wasnt towed till the next day whos the witness i said speedfreak hustler he said its not sterling but it does firm up the time frame kevin picks her up finishes her off cuts town after wiping ernas prints from his car had it been washed recently hard to tell with it sitting in the yard all this time lab guys did say the passenger door appeared to be too clean as in wipedown thats an indication of criminal intent which is why we want to lean on mommy and daddy your suggestions and your presence would be appreciated psychological strategy and all that when i said after dark couple of hours ill pick you up petrall meet us there not stahl petras got him on the computer see you in two start warming up the old insight machine when it comes to dealing with people you can only rehearse so much but the three of us tried sitting in petras accord on a quiet encino street the spot was two blocks west of franklin and teresa drummonds house in the shade of a shaggy anthropomorphic pepper tree the moonlight was feeble just enough to transform branches to grasping limbs from time to time a car drove by but no one noticed us petra filled us in on the drummonds does any of that sound like breeding ground for a psycho killer alex so far i said it sounds like uppermiddleclass suburban life she nodded ruefully i figure we focus on frank his being dominant and all that if we ignore him we run the risk of alienating him right from the start hell come to the door alienated i said you can start off being polite but at some point you may need to get more assertive threatening said milo if they do know where kevins gone theyre vulnerable to an aiding and abetting charge i said franks an attorney he may try to bluster his way through it but id watch for signs of anxiety as well as too much hostility overreacting can be a cover so what we ask them to sell out their kid to save their own butts however they feel about kevin they may not be willing to put themselves in criminal jeopardy at some point id also focus on the financial angle they bankrolled kevins magazine so they bear indirect responsibility for whatever flowed from that at the least it wont help franks practice in that regard the mother might also be your target work on her guilt by showing her ernas photos who is maybe cousin erna said milo to petra stahl still hasnt come up with any link there nope she said like i told you he located ernas dad but hes comatose on his way out while he was at the rest home he did run into a relative donald murphys sister a real battleax named alma trueblood more like she ran into stahl she says erna had been strange all her life refused family help she turned to me so we study their reactions three of us two of them should make that feasible do we tell them alex is a psychologist what for said milo let them know the case has kicked up a notch kevins being thought of as a psycho both of them waited for my answer i said no ill just stay in the background if you dont mind giving me some leeway ill cut in if i feel the timings right fine with me said petra milo nodded she said you guys ready a stocky man in a tootight red lacoste shirt baggy khakis black socks and bedroom slippers came to the door fleshy face broad nose wavy graying hair keen angry eyes a tightly coiled man ready to pounce petra said evening mr drummond a ripple coursed through frank drummonds jaw he looked at milo and me a battalion what now petra said we found kevins car franklin drummond blinked id hung back kept most of my body concealed behind milos bulk but i was studying drummond intently he mustve sensed it because his eyes fixed on mine and his mouth worked where he said it was impounded sir said petra parked illegally near lax were canvassing various airlines right now to find out where kevins gone if you know lax said drummond sweat broke at his hairline the brown eyes were seized by a clutch of rapid blinks goddamn may we come in please drummond rolled his meaty shoulders and stood taller snapping back into litigator stance i have no idea where kevin is petra said that must concern you sir drummond didnt answer she went on at this point kevins disappearance is being regarded as a criminal matter you people are ridiculous petra edged closer to drummond milo and i followed fullcourt press if you know where your sons gone its in his interest and yours that you tell us drummonds jaws clenched a voice behind him called out frank rapid footsteps muffled yet percussive its all right he said but the footsteps continued and terry drummonds face appeared over her husbands right shoulder half her face she was an inch or so taller than him boosted by highheeled backless sandals fourinch heels not much thicker than darning needles the percussion plush carpeting contributed the muffling i looked at the heels again putting herself through foot agony in the privacy of her own home go back in frank drummond ordered her what she insisted petra told her about the honda oh no frank said terry frank please maam kevin could be in danger said petra frank wagged a finger in her face now you listen frank terry drummond reached around grabbed his hand pushed down and lowered it this is inexcusable frank drummond said may we come in said petra at this point its either that or the station drummond pressed his fists together and grimaced isometric exercise no gain without emotional pain what do you mean this point we found evidence in kevins car of criminal intent what kind of evidence lets talk inside said petra drummond didnt respond his wife said enough frank let them in drummonds nostrils flared make it short he said but all the fight had been taken out of him the living room spoke of financial success acquired through achievement rather than legacy the coffered ceiling was several feet too high for the modestly proportioned space a fauxmarble finish glossed the walls prefab moldings were slathered like whipped cream the furniture was heavy machinecarved blond bleached by too many crystal light fixtures machined copies of persian rugs were arranged haphazardly over a bed of thick beige walltowall three paintings a harlequin a ballerina a toobright rendition of an imaginary arroyo under a salmon pink sky in the landscape flecks of silver paint passed as reflection dreadful kevin drummond hadnt grown up with fine art and hed escaped the dingy hollywood flat was less than an hour away but for all intents we were talking different planets his father dropped heavily into an overstuffed sofa terry settled herself a foot away crossed long dancers legs encased in skintight capris tossed her flamecolored hair and displayed no selfconsciousness as her unfettered breasts bobbled high heels no bra the smell of canned spaghetti wafted from the kitchen i wondered more about kevins childhood frank drummond exhaled sat up straight terry drummonds face was heavily madeup but cosmetics failed to mask her grief yet her body posture remained languid cleopatraonanilebarge a handsbreadth between them no touching petra said i know this is hard for you and youre making it a lot harder said frank drummond his wife tilted her face toward him but kept silent what would you have us do sir said petra no answer milo said looks like kevin flew somewhere any guesses where youre the detectives said frank drummond milo smiled if i was in your situation id like to know where my son was more silence i scanned their faces for the slightest hint of deception the errant eye blink the facial twitch the merest shift in body language all i saw was anguish a pain id seen far too often parents of seriously ill children parents of runaways parents living with adolescents whose behavior had long since stopped being predictable the agony of not knowing terry drummonds eyes caught mine i smiled and she smiled back her husband didnt notice sitting stiffly eyes dulled off in some lonely place milo said there is one good thing for us and maybe for you kevin never got a passport so chances are hes still in the country terry drummond said this cant be happening honey said frank this just cant be happening please what do you want from us information about kevins whereabouts said milo i dont know his whereabouts thats why im going out of my mind terry said frank she ignored him shifted her buttocks and showed him her back dont you people think if i knew where he was id tell you would you said petra terry regarded petra with contempt youre obviously not a mother petra went white then she smiled because mothers are protective young lady do you actually believe id want kevin to be hounded by you people maybe god forbid get shot because he looked at you the wrong way i know how you people operate triggerhappy if i knew where he was id want him safe and beyond suspicion frank drummond regarded his wife with what seemed like new respect no one spoke terry said this is absolutely ridiculous considering kevin a suspect in anything a mother knows are any of you parents silence ha thought so now you people listen to me kevins a good boy hes done nothing wrong thats why i would tell you if i knew where he was because i am his mother a glance at frank said she considered that several ranks above father he said okay in a soft voice will you please go now milo said why would kevin leave town terry said you dont know that he did his car was near the airport there could be any number of reasons for that frank broke in pugnacious inflection back to lawyers mode his wife shot him a disgusted look then turned to petra if you were really interested in doing your job young woman youd stop regarding my son as a criminal and look for him as if he were just a regular person meaning said petra meaning i dont know what i mean thats your jobyour world maam terry wrung her hands were normal people we dont know how to behave in this situation answering our questions would be a good start said petra what questions terry shouted rednailed fingers clawed the air trying to rip through an invisible barrier i havent heard any intelligent questions what what milo and petra let her calm down then went through their routine twenty minutes later theyd learned little more than the approximate date of kevins last call to his parents nearly a month ago franks admission terry blanched as he said it a month between calls spoke volumes about the parentchild relationship kevin needed space she said he was always my creative one frank started to say something stopped himself began picking lint from the sofa terry muttered stop that youll ruin it frank complied closed his eyes rested his neck on a throw pillow terry said kevins twentyfour he has a life of his own i said whens the last time you sent him money the subject of cash rejuvenated frank his dark eyes snapped open not for a long time he wouldnt take any more kevin refused money eventually he said eventually i repeated terry said he was always independent never wanted to rely on us but you did finance grooverat i said mention of the magazine made both of them wince frank said i bankrolled it in the beginning and after that nothing he told me youre wrong about our being involved in everything he did his life we were involved in countered his wife hes our son well always be part of his life but she trailed off i said kevin needed to establish his own identity and you respected that exactly she said kevins always had his own identity frank blinked and i addressed him so you sent him money to start up the magazine then stopped i sent him money for whatever he needed said frank it wasnt specifically for the magazine what did you think of the magazine he shrugged not my thing terry said i thought it was cute very well written i said and after the first few months franks eyes narrowed he stopped calling dont say it like that said terry it wasnt like we had a fight you and he to us my husbands a dominant man the other boys can deal with it kevin needed to find his own way great said frank its my fault its no ones fault frank were not talking about fault no ones done anything thats a fault were trying to give them a clear picture of kevin so they can see him as a person not some some suspect frank folded thick arms across his chest terry said this is not about you frank thank god she moved a few inches farther from him took hold of an accent pillow and held it on her lap like a pet he glanced toward the kitchen rolled his jaw you know something ive had it with this ive been in court all day figure i deserve a goddamn homecooked dinner you people interrupted our dinner but terry didnt back him up and he didnt budge i asked her how did kevin support himself after he stopped asking for money he never asked said terry not even in the beginning we offered and kevin agreed to take it did us a big favor said frank terry said kevins not materialistic when he graduated we offered to buy him a nice car he went and got an old clunker her face clouded thinking of the honda by the airport i thought wanting an unobtrusive crime car then if so why not choose a dark vehicle i said at some point kevin actively refused money terry said yes frank said there are different ways to ask he unfolded his arms cracked his knuckles ive been financing his hobbies for years which is what a father does frank thats me said drummond a father terry glared at him her fists were small and white now you people have seen us at our worst i do hope youre happy the shame in her voice made her husband flinch he scooted closer to her placed a hand on her knee she didnt budge milo looked at petra then me she gave a small nod i didnt object he reached into his briefcase produced a death shot of erna murphy and flashed it at the drummonds oh my god said terry who the hell is that said frank then so much for dinner milo and petra kept them there as the spaghetti smell faded asking the same questions several times rephrasing alternating between sympathy and aloofness probing for details pressing for a murphydrummond link the drummonds denied it denied everything no anxiety i believed them believed they knew little about their son at some point a certain looseness entered the conversation low voices all around discouragement all around wed learned nothing vital and they had a missing son terry said that poor woman you say she was homeless yes maam said milo why in the world would kevin know anyone like that he lived in hollywood maam said petra you run into all kinds of people in hollywood all kinds of people made frank drummond grimace thinking about kevins sexual orientation he said i never liked him living there terry said he needed something new frank to us kevin wouldnt i mean he might be kind to someone like that give them money but thats it hes never been interested in mental illness or anything like that just the arts i said yes sir kevin loves the arts he got that from me i used to dance really said petra ballet i took ballet said terry but i specialized in modern rock n roll disco jazzercize i used to be on tv she touched her hair hullabaloo hit list all the dance shows back in ancient times i worked a lot back then franks eyes glazed over her talking about her career made me think of something i said have you ever heard of baby boy lee she bit her lip hes a musician right ever meet him lets see she said no i dont think he was on any of the dance shows i did meet the dave clark five and the byrds little richard franks loud exhalation cut her off why did you ask about that she said my turn to get an okay milo and petra both nodded baby boy lee was murdered i said kevin ran a profile on him in grooverat and he called the police to ask for forensic details thats what this is about said frank his laugh was coarse my god what utter and complete horseshit another laugh a phone call i dont believe you people milo said theres more to it mr drummond like what milo shook his head drummond said beautiful i broke in how much money did you give kevin whys that important whys it a secret because terry said ten thousand dollars beautiful frank repeated it is no secret frank i said one payment or in installments one payment he said graduation gift i wanted to break it up but she i also pay his car insurance and his health coverage i figured ten would cover a years rent and expenses if he didnt overdo it how did kevin finance the magazine and the rest of his living expenses for two years dont know said drummond i assumed hed gotten some kind of job did he mention a job no but he didnt ask me for anything terry said kevins always been independent what kind of jobs had he worked before i said he didnt work as a college student she said i advised against it he concentrated on his studies good student oh yes kevins advisor shull had seen it differently no honor student i said so he worked before college oh absolutely she said he worked at a tropical fish store sold magazine subscriptions did yardwork for us she licked her lips several summers he helped frank out at the office paralegal work i asked drummond he filed papers for me his expression said it hadnt been a good match terry picked up on it kevin was always hes always had his own ideas frank said he doesnt like routine my office any law office theres a lot of routine my bet is he found himself something unconventional such as said petra writing something like that hes fine said terry i just know he is her voice shook frank reached over and tried to hold her hand but she pulled away from him and burst into sobs he sat back disgusted when she quieted i said youre worried about kevin of course i am i know he hasnt done anything to anyone but that the picture you showed us more sobs stop said frank drummond in a harsh tone then he forced his voice lower for your sake ter you dont need to do that honey why she said because you tell me so whats the deal beyond basic dysfunction said milo as petra drove us back to his unmarked kevin left home two years ago i said but he was a stranger long before that they have no idea what goes on in his head if theyre telling the truth about his turning down money id like to know where he got the money to finance his publishing venture something illegal said milo something on the street thats how he met erna not his cousin said petra doesnt look like it i raised the issue of a crime car kevin selecting a white honda over something dark hes unsophisticated said petra over the phone he sounded like a kid nasty kid said milo mommys worried hes a victim mommies think that way said petra she sounded nearly as sad as terry drummond petra and milo wanted to talk more so we found an allnight coffee shop on ventura near sepulveda ordered coffee and pie from a waitress who read our faces and kept her distance he told me youre right about the money ten grand mightve covered kevins computer equipment and maybe not all of it that leaves printing expenses marketing the magazine rent and food petra said kevins landlady said hed paid six months in advance the place goes for five hundred a month so theres three grand he also paid for six months of pob rental up front not a big deal but he was obviously spending daddys cash up front daddy just said kevin preferred unconventional jobs shed ordered boston cream cut away the cream picked at the chocolate milo inhaled half of his apple à la mode deluxe two scoops of vanilla and i realized i was hungry and made inroads on a slab of pecan the thing is she said ive been out on the streets three days running cant find anyone who even knows him let alone a hint of criminal enterprise whats your guess i said drugs rich kid with a bankroll it fits milo said ten grand doesnt make him a cartel but its more than enough to finance an initial stash mark it up peddle it use the profit for another stash petra said the spot where he picked up erna is a wellknown illicit pill market maybe kevin knew it from previous experience milo finished his pie began work on the ice cream once upon a time you worked at a hospital alex anything you want to toss in here never caught a hint of a blackmarket pill trade still in touch with anyone at western peds from time to time what about the neighboring hospitals ive got a few contacts he looked at petra what do you think of his showing kevins picture around to white coats couldnt hurt she said maybe theyd be more open with a colleague you mind alex no i said but if someones dealing pills theyre not going to fess up to it or admit they know any dealers but you could study reactions said milo see if anyone comes across weird wed take it from there okay dont wear yourself out give it one day its a long shot but you never know ill do it tomorrow i said but we should also consider other sources of income for kevin all that computer equipment the printers the scanners and kevin collected pornography both of them stared at me petra said i shouldve thought of that when we visited frank drummonds office his secretary asked if this had something to do with porn jeez right under my nose maybe she knew the kid had a history summers at daddys office said milo didnt seem to be a happy memory for daddy kevin being creative said petra maybe in ways daddy didnt like the stuff junior collects is hardcore s m or it wasnt just kevin in the biz and they had creative differences i said what if theres more than parental protectiveness to franks hostility both of them were silent petra played with her fork family business you know terry looks like she couldve done dirty movies in her youth she bounced the forks tines on the tabletop ill check it out with vice i spent all day talking to friendly faces at western peds and other sunset boulevard hospitals no one recognized kevin i tried a few less friendly faces got blank stares headshakes i drove by the spot where erna murphy had been picked up during the day the street was quiet sunny lined with old apartment buildings not a hint of what went on after dark i spotted a young hispanic woman walking twin babies in a double stroller smiling the infants dozed a few miles west shed be wearing a uniform and theyd be someone elses babies here mothers took care of their own and locked them in at night before heading home i called milo to let him know id come up empty he said comrades in arms pal no progress at the airlines and ive been on the phone to boston all morning trying to find out if kevin checked in anywhere near there both now and during the period when angelique bernet got carved up nothing on the former hard to be certain regarding the latter because most of the smaller hostelries claim not to hold on to their guest registers for more than a year a few places did crack their computers but if kevins staying at any of them its not under his own name the bigger hotels report being booked the week of bernet lots of conventions and they do keep records again no kevin what kind of conventions lets see there were six goodsized affairs that week three at harvard rehabilitation medicine media and public policy and history of science one on plasma physics at mit a law symposium at tufts something to do with the middle east at brandeis any of those sound like our boys cup of tea no i said and a student on a limited budget wouldnt have stayed at the four seasons or the parker house thats why i concentrated first on motels and budget places i also checked car rental outfits and bugged boston and cambridge pds to check their traffic files on the chance that kevin rented another under an assumed name and got a parking citation its how son of sam got nailed why shouldnt i be lucky long breath nada and petra found out the drummond pornography connection isnt kevin its his daddy franklin d has represented over a dozen adult filmmakers the valley is porn central so an encino mouthpiece makes sense constitutional issues breadandbutter civil issues overdue bills contract disputes workmans comp frank comes across as your basic hardworking solo practitioner guess he doesnt blush easily given all the xrated types in and out of the office i can understand his secretary wondering about kevin getting his feet wet so to speak but no evidence kevin got involved not so far vice knew about frank but never heard of kevin they checked all the corporate doingbusinessas registrations nada redux what about terry i said nothing but even assuming mommy did make some dirty movies maybe thats even how she and frankie met so what if kevin didnt take up the family biz the family biz couldve contributed to kevins sexual confusion i said by itself it means nothing but toss it onto the pile and it helps define kevin a bit more i can see him wanting to distance himself becoming obsessed with art for arts sake getting enraged at people he views as selling out prostituting themselves but in the privacy of his apartment he stockpiles dirty pictures sexual confusion he said nice euphemism hes gay alex its not a euphemism to me he could be straight and be confused guess so dont mean to get touchy but like ol bob d said too much of nothing okay the drummonds are highly screwed up now how the hell do i find kevin before he channels his confusion into offing another poor unsuspecting artiste i had no answer for that he said were still exploring the erna murphy angle on the off chance that frank and terry lied to us about not knowing her or maybe ernas smart artistic cousin really does exist stahls been working the internet searching the family tree using the name of the battleax aunt trueblood turns out she really is in the money married an appliance king lives in a big house in pasadena a neighbor of everett kipper i said a couple of beats passed didnt think of that well lets see what stahl turns up meanwhile petra and i have adopted the showbiz approach got no ideas take a meeting the next ones tonight nine pm her turf ginos on the boulevard youre welcome to come but i cant promise you any excitement shame on you i said no rose garden and now this allison had a break between her last outpatient of the day and a man dying of lou gehrigs disease whom she was seeing at the hospice i bought some takeout deli picked her up on montana avenue in front of her office and we drove to ocean park and ate while watching the sun sink a few windsurfers lingered on the beach incorrigibly optimistic pelicans flapped their wings and scanned the water for dinner she attacked her sandwich wiped her mouth and watched the birds i love them arent they gorgeous pelicans have always been favorites of mine ungainly fliers but efficient feeders no pretense just do the job i told her so put my arm around her and finished my beer my idea of gorgeous is more like you shameless flattery sometimes it works she put her head on my shoulder tough night ahead i said shed talked to me a few times about the als patient a good man a kind man hed never make it to fifty shed counseled him for four months now as he faded so had allisons feelings of usefulness this job we chose to do shed said a few weeks ago were supposed to be experts but which god appointed us the baal of academia i said exactly get good grades pass the right exams its not exactly spiritual training neither of us spoke for a very long time i heard her sigh what is it have the stomach for another confession i squeezed her shoulder my little chromium friend she said ive used it once when soon after i got it before i got my own place when i leased space in culver city i used to work really late because i had nothing to come home to one night i was in the office doing paperwork until after midnight i came out to the parking lot and some kids punks were hanging out smoking dope drinking beer by the time i got to my car theyd moved in on me four of them fifteen sixteen they didnt seem hardcore but they were clearly blasted to this day i cant be sure they meant to do anything other than hassle me but when the leader stepped up to me really got in my face i gave him my best girlish smile pulled the gun out of my purse and stuck it in his face he peed his pants i could smell it then he backed away ran they all did after they were gone i just stood there the smile still plastered to my face it felt wrong smiling but for a moment i couldnt move my facial muscles then i began trembling couldnt stop the gun was flopping around catching moonlight the reflection on the barrel was like shooting stars when we were up in the canyon watching the sky that image came back to me i was gripping the gun so hard my fingers began to ache when i finally calmed down my hand still remained tight id actually pushed the trigger down partially she lowered her head black waves of hair fanning out after that i thought of ditching the gun but i decided that wasnt the answer i needed to master it master more of my life and heres the real confession part of what attracted me to you was the fact that you got involved in crime cases someone in the same field as me who got it i felt we were kindred spirits i thought about you a lot when you finally called me i was thrilled she touched my hand her nail tickled my palm my erection was sudden disembodied first with robin now this reacting to everything with the little head of course she said that was only part of it your being handsome and smart didnt hurt she looked up at me im not telling you this to lord it over robin because she had problems with your work and i want to be the big brave kindred spirit its just the way it is she gripped my fingers does all this sound twisted no does any of what i just said change things i really dont want it to im so happy about what weve got going im taking a risk here letting you know who i really am nothings changed i said i like what i know youre sweet to say that its the truth the truth she said rolling on her side and pressing herself against me thatll do for now i dropped her at her office and was setting out for the meeting at ginos when milo called canceled another body turned up similar to ours but different because it wasnt found near any artistic venue dumped outdoors in the wetlands near the marina not buried but halfhidden by marsh plants some cyclists saw birds clustered went to check significant decay coroner estimates its been lying there two three days right after erna got picked up i said right around the time kevins car was left near the airport the marinas not far from the airport the dump sites right on the way looks like kevin gave himself a goingaway present the victims definitely an artistic type sculptor named armand mehrabian hes based in new york came out to audition for a big corporate project downtown works in rocks and bronze and running water kinetic sculpture they call it he was staying at the loews in santa monica had gone missing young gifted just starting to get noticed by the art world good shot at winning the corporate gig he was gutted just like baby boy and had his neck yanked by a corrugated ligature i told the coroners tech it was probably a low e guitar string she was very impressed marina dump site makes it pacifics case two ds i dont know he said schlesinger and small petra says small used to work wilshire she collaborated with him hes okay were rescheduling the meeting for later so they can show up were an equal opportunity organization share the despair figure on tomorrow morning so schlesinger and small have time to do a preliminary workup on mehrabian not ginos the westside for their sakes my indian pals say am that work for you like a charm the same small back room at café moghul the same smells of hot oil and curry two more people huddled around the table made the space feel like a cell the pacific detectives were men in their forties dick schlesinger was big dark rangy longfaced and thoughtful with a minkcolored mustache that crossed his face like a freeway marvin small was smaller chubby and blondgray his ode to facial hair a silver brush prickly as a straw bed bursting from under a boxers nose he chuckled a lot even when nothing was funny the woman in the sari brought chai and ice water and left smiling at milo marvin small said this joker drummond anywhere else he couldve rabbited other than boston milo said your guess is as good as ours dick schlesinger shook his head another whodunit petra said had a few lately two others still on the burner little girl disappears from a supermarket where shes shopping with her mom were thinking one of the box boys hes got a molestation record but no body no evidence and for a stupid guy hes being smart were also working a shooting on lincoln one of the hookers who works the stretch between rose and lax whoever did it left her with a purse full of dope and cash and this time weve got a pimp who actually seems to care they had three kids together a few city employees have been busted there recently mostly cal trans losers and bus company folk heading home after the night shift veering off for a quickie were hoping its not the beginning of another serial a municipal employee killer at that small said but dont weep for me argentina sounds like you guys have been plenty busy yourselves knock on the door the smiling woman entered with a tray of free appetizers that she placed on the table milo thanked her and she left that one has a crush on you said marvin small the old charm said milo petra grinned everyone trying to deal with the frustration with levity except stahl he just sat there detective small eyed the food with some anxiety multicultural time this is one culture ive never done foodwise its not bad marve said schlesinger my wifes a vegetarian we go to indian restaurants a lot he reached for a samosa held it up named it petra and milo and marvin small took food stahl didnt the remnants of a pastrami sandwich had taken residence in my gut milos call interrupting my digestion so i stuck with the hot spiced tea stahl seemed off in another world hed arrived with a large white envelope placed it in front of him hadnt talked or budged since the meeting had started the rest of them munched as small and schlesinger summarized the armand mehrabian case passing around death photos to the sounds of chewing i flipped through them quickly the abdominal wound was a horrible gape shades of baby boy lee and vassily levitch the outdoor dump matched angelique bernet and china maranga flexibility creativity i said so they listened made no comment ate some more went over old ground for twenty minutes then milo said so whats up with the murphy family tree eric stahl opened the white envelope and removed a computerprinted genealogy chart i got this from the internet but it seems reliable erna murphys father donald had a brother and a sister the brother edward married a woman named colette branigan only cousin there is one daughter mary margaret edwards dead colette lives in new york mary margarets a nun in albuquerque theres a hot lead for you said small maniacal sister mary stahl said murphys sister is named alma trueblood i ran into her at the rest home where murphys dying shes got two sons from a previous marriage ones deceased her first husbands dead but she divorced him before he died i found a few distant cousins but none of them are local and none are drummonds no connection to kevin i can find the whole cousin thing was probably nut talk said small a cousin who likes art said schlesinger so what milo reached for the chart scanned it absently gave a disgusted look i took a look whos this i said pointing stahl leaned across the small table and read upside down alma truebloods first husband he was a real estate agent in temple city alvard g shull i said kevins faculty advisor at charter college is a guy named a gordon shull the two sons youve got listed here are bradley deceased and alvard junior a gordon said petra my first name was alvard id want to use the middle name damn said marvin small this professor like art as a matter of fact i said dead silence in the room i said shull told me hed grown up grounded in art and literature and theater hes also got red hair big and strong enough said milo easily i said six feet close to two hundred outdoorsy outgoing and not at all protective of kevin the way you might expect from a mentor at first he expressed surprise that kevin was under suspicion of anything but as we talked he warmed to the subject of kevins eccentricities i remember one phrase he used kevin wasnt the type of kid youd want to have a beer with at the time i didnt make much of it but in retrospect its cruel one of the last things he told me was kevin was a lousy writer oh boy said petra milo rubbed his face something else i said when i first talked to shulls department head about kevin she put on a fullforce stonewall cited academic freedom confidentiality exactly what youd expect from a department head then she found out shull had been kevins advisor and her attitude changed completely all of a sudden she was more than willing for me to talk to shull i didnt think much of it but maybe she had a reason wanting shull to have problems shulls been a bad boy said petra for a professor said small being a bad boy could mean giving the wrong kid a bad grade what do we really have on this guy except he likes art and had a nutty cousin a cousin who got strangled said petra and was spotted at the scene of one of our s small tickled his own mustache so what were thinking two bad guys now teacher and student like buono and bianchi bittaker and norris pair of lowlife scumbag psychopaths pulling a duo weve got a literal teacher and student said petra maybe they branched out of academia to stahl you said shulls mommy has dough that could explain kevins financing i said shulls influence could also explain the shift in kevins writing style kevin started off simple but shull guided him toward greater complexity i told shull kevins style had gotten pretentious he laughed and said ouch but maybe he wasnt amused milo said he show any signs of weirdness alex not really very selfpossessed but right from the beginning ive thought our guy wouldnt come across strange someone who can move in and out of artistic venues without being conspicuous someone smart enough to plan someone older than kevin he said his age bugged you from the beginning shulls how old said petra midthirties to forty right in the zone schlesinger said wheres the family money from stahl said the second husband i said some of it may have found its way to her sole living child any idea how shulls father and brother died stahl shook his head petra said good work eric the merest flicker of emotion livened stahls eyes then they went flat again lifes like that said marvin small all of a sudden things change a philosopher said schlesinger with the good humor of a longsuffering spouse i wouldnt mind some good change for a change you guys gonna learn more about this professor petra said minute were out of here ill run him through the data banks stahl said i dont recommend interviewing his mommy not a nice lady said milo not someone id like to have a beer with the first bit of humor id ever heard from him but no comic inflection mechanical voice the deadened tone of someone beaten down or maybe he just had a weird personality he placed the chart back in the white envelope and studied his empty plate milo turned to me whats the name of that department head alvard gordon shull had been run through the law enforcement files no criminal record but guadalupe santos kevin drummonds landlady thought she recognized shull from the dmv photo petra showed her hmm maybe maybe what maam once i saw yuri on the street talking to a guy couldve been him where on the street mrs santos not far from here like up on melrose couple of blocks that way pointing east i figured yuri had gone shopping or something petra shook her head as she recounted it to milo and me she never thought to mention this maam was he carrying a bag that indicated hed been shopping santos thought it was a while ago maybe but you think this was the man he was with im not sure like i said it was a long time ago how long ago id have to say months only reason i noticed was i never saw yuri with anyone but its not like they were hanging out or anything what were they doing just talking like maybe the guy asked yuri directions or something then yuri walked home alone the man left on foot um i think so but theres no way i could testify or anything i couldnt honestly say i remember details its more like maybe who is he maybe no one thank you maam santos closed her door looking worried shull lived in a house on aspen way in the hollywood hills and stahl had been stationed down the block all night with nothing to report how far is aspen i asked milo from the hollywood sign right down the hill and east not far from kevin either hed dropped by soon after the meeting kept busy on the phone finally sat down at my kitchen table to toss things around not far from the recording studio where china was recording i said or the snakepit id say shull likes his hollywood comfort zone but weve also got three murders on the westside not to mention boston this guys hard to pin down how do you see the affiliation between shull and kevin teacherstudent thing gone evil thats one possibility i visit shull he gets nervous tells kevin to make himself scarce either or both of them pick up erna and get rid of her then shull drives kevin to the airport ditches the car takes a taxi back ill have my ds check the cab companies he made another call put in the order whats the other possibility terry drummonds right and her boys innocent if he is hes also probably dead he went to the fridge poured milk brought it back if kevin did rabbit i doubt it was to boston shulld be smart enough not to want kevin there i knew what he was thinking how many other cities how many other bodies his beeper went off the coroners office he called in and i went to my office and ran a gordon shull through all the general search engines a reference to shulls personal web site connected to an inactive notice thirtyone additional hits twothirds of them duplications twelve of the original twenty were citations of shulls name in charter college publications presiding over communications department symposia papers hed delivered the role of the artist in contemporary society advocacy journalism acceptable tool for change or subterfuge rock n roll hoochy coo sexuality as a metaphor in contemporary music linguistics as fate why noam chomsky might be god one title grabbed me by the throat a cold heart the ultimate fatalism of artistic endeavor no text summary no reference shull had delivered the paper at a coffeehouse in venice a latenight party honoring the memory of ezra pound i checked the venues of his other presentations all were informal gatherings at cafés and the like padding the résumé was that why dr martin disapproved of her faculty member or perhaps it went beyond that i recalled shulls easy manner with the coed whod waited outside his office cool prof toofriendly slickster like politics academia posed all sorts of possibilities for an amoral guy venice coffee shop what relevance did the concept of comfort zone have in la here if you had a car you mastered your destiny then i thought of something else milo returned the wounds on mehrabian match baby boys so do the ligament striations and guess what this time our bad boy left physical evidence couple of short facial hairs redgray mehrabian had a beard too but it was long and black the killer got in his face literally shull sports one of those fiveday beards gingergray hey sherlock coroner estimates the hair was five six days old so now what i said you question him and get a warrant to pluck were a ways off from that yet even with the hair i phoned an ada they want more significantly more shull being a rich kid make a difference he smiled ada would shudder at the thought this might help i pointed to the cold heart reference on my screen he said oh my is shull warrantable now probably not literary pretension doesnt qualify as probable cause what about this then there were six conventions in boston the week of angelique bernets murder you mentioned one had something to do with the media that sounds like something shull might be interested in he whipped out his notepad flipped pages the media and public policy harvard who ran it this is all ive got he said want me to look into it yeah he said put that phd to good use please he left with a promise to return in an hour it took nearly that long but finally i had a copy of the massmedia conventions attendees in hand confidentiality and all that slowed the process but one of my grad school classmates taught at harvard and i called him made connections combined shameless namedropping with my academic bona fides and spun a yarn about planning a symposium on the media and violence wanting the list so i could target the right people the final target of that lie was one of the symposiums cochairs a fasttalking professor of journalism at the university of washington named lionel south that was mine all right harvard let us use the k school the kennedy school so we stuck one of their faculty members names on it as a cochair but vera mancuso and i shes at clark really ran it you say yours is going to be at the med school what a psychiatric slant eclectic i said meanwhile im running interference between the med school the psych department and the law school sometimes falsehood came so easy in spare moments i wondered about that media violence said south great funding for that not bad i said couple more schoolyard shootings and youll really be set i forced a collegial laugh anyway about your roster ill email it to you right now do me a favor and keep us posted and if you need a cochair i found it on the third page halfway down the ss shull a gordon prof comm charter college a bit of selfaggrandizement shull was a lecturer that fit milo came back and i pointed oh yeah great work did shull deliver a paper no he just attended or signed up to attend playing hooky it wouldve been easy once he registered no one wouldve checked to see if he actually sat through the meetings shull had a free schedule plenty of time to take in the ballet ballet might very well be his thing i said growing up with culture and all that cold heart son of a bitch he checked his notes found the list of boston hotels began working the phone forty minutes later he had confirmation shull had stayed at the ritzcarlton the week of angelique bernets murder not far from the ballet hall he said he picks her up in boston takes her to cambridge where he does her and dumps her because its away from his hotel and close to the symposium carve up a girl be back for another bullshit lecture his eyes had heated time for a warrant i said he cursed silently i picked the most agreeable judge i could find shes sympathetic but wants physical evidence like the facial hairs found in mehrabians beard i said but you cant verify the hair is shulls until you have grounds to ask him for a sample viva joseph heller he said at least weve got a target petras retracing her steps armed with shulls photo i also talked to small and schlesinger about the hair they said thanks keep them informed my sense is theyd love to dump mehrabian on us my sense is also thats where mehrabians gonna end up he eyed my computer anything else interesting out in cyberspace shull had a web site but its no longer operative covering his tracks or technical problems i said an ego like that hed want to be out there id like to know what hes been up to recently dr martin could help us there think shell cooperate like i said at the meeting my sense is shulls not her favorite employee so maybe lets do it he said at her house not her office why get her away from her professional comfort zone elizabeth gala martins office had been filled with antiques but at home she preferred modern her house was a wide gray collection of cubes set on a large lot in a good part of pasadena the landscaping was lowprofile japaneseinspired glossed by strategic lighting a sculptural gong stood off center in the broad impeccable lawn two cars shared the doublewide driveway a silver late model bmw sedan and an identically colored mercedes coupe of slightly older vintage every blade of grass in place as if the exterior was vacuumed regularly half a mile from everett kippers place but that didnt seem relevant now it was pm when milo knocked on the front door martin answered her own door wearing a long green silk caftan embroidered with golden dragons on her feet were gold sandals her toenails were pink her hennaed hair appeared freshly set and she wore huge gold hexagonal earrings behind her was a wide white entry hall floored in travertine her initial surprise was replaced by flinty scrutiny professor delaware thanks for remembering i said you made an impression she studied milo i introduced him the police she said evenly more about mr drummond milo said more about mr shull martins hands flexed and she let them fall to her side come in she said the house was rambling moodlit topped by skylights a rear wall of windows looked out to a softly illuminated garden and a long skinny lap pool that traced the curves of a high white wall large abstract paintings hung on the walls brass cases were filled with contemporary glass elizabeth martin seated us on a low black suede couch and took her place in a black leather slingchair all right she said tell me what this is all about milo said professor martin were looking into possible criminal activity on the part of a gordon shull im sorry i cant tell you more sounds filtered from across the dining room footsteps and rattles behind white double doors utensil clink running water someone in the kitchen you cant tell me more but youd like me to tell you whatever you want to know milo smiled exactly well that seems fair green silk rippled as martins legs crossed she was wearing perfume something grassy and it drifted toward us bodyheat activated she looked composed but you never knew professor martin said milo this is a very serious matter and i can promise you that the information will come out eventually what information is that mr shulls problems oh she said gordons got problems does he you know he does i said she turned to me professor delaware when you came to me you said kevin drummond had something to do with a murder thats not an everyday occurrence for a boring academic thats why you made an impression back to milo are you now saying that gordon shulls suspected of being a murderer you dont seem surprised he said i try to avoid being surprised she said but before we proceed you must tell me this is something highly embarrassing to my department fulminating im afraid yes maam thats too bad said martin a murderer her smile was sudden feral unsettling well i suppose when too much garbage piles up the best thing to do is to take it out so lets talk about gordon perhaps youll be able to take him off my hands she recrossed her legs seemed amused a murderer i must admit ive never thought of gordon in those terms what terms have you thought of maam lack of substance said martin gordons a phony all talk no action the kitchen doors opened and a man stepped out bearing a hefty sandwich on a plate liz the same grayhaired man id seen in martins office photos he wore a white polo shirt beige linen trousers brown loafers tall and well built but running to paunch older than martin by at least a decade its okay honey she said just the police the police he approached us the sandwich was a tripledecker full of green stuff and turkey something to do with gordon shull dear what he stole something he positioned himself next to martins chair this is my husband dr vernon lewis vernon this is detective sturgis said milo to lewis are you a professor as well sir no said martin vernons a real doctor orthopedic surgeon that comment about stealing doctor said milo sounds like you know gordon shull too mostly by reputation said vernon lewis ive met him at faculty parties elizabeth martin said honey why dont you relax lewis shot her a quizzical glance she smiled at him his eyebrows rose and he looked at his sandwich how long will this take liz not too long okay he said nice meeting you fellows dont keep my sweetheart too long he continued across the room turned a corner was gone milo said what reputation was dr lewis referring to martin said general amorality gordons been a problem my problem since the beginning does amorality include theft if that were all of it martin frowned lord only knows what im doing to myself by talking to you but the truth is ive had my fill of nonsense with that man i run a threeperson department should have control over who i bring on i said you were forced to hire shull forced would be too coarse a word she looked as if shed swallowed something spoiled i was strongly advised to hire gordon because his familys got money oh yes she said its always about money isnt it six years ago i was brought to charter college to create a firstrate department of communications promises were made to me i had several other offers larger schools better facilities but all were in other cities and id just met vernon and his practice was established here i chose romance over practicality small smile the right choice but there are consequences to any decision charter broke its promise i said broken promises are a given in the academic world the issue is the proportion of truth to nonsense dont get me wrong for the most part im not miserable charters a good school for what it is which is a small place a very small place that affords one the opportunity to interact with students closely which was initially appealing and still is all in all the kids are a nice bunch after five years at berkeley all the leftwing nonsense charter seemed positively quaint but sometimes its limiting which promises were broken i said she ticked her finger i was pledged a fiveperson faculty and got three my budget was cut by thirty percent because several pledges dried up the recession was in full force back then donors stock portfolios had tumbled et cetera my planned curriculum was severely attenuated because i now had a smaller faculty which promises did they keep i got a nice desk she smiled i couldve walked vernons practice is more than adequate in terms of financial support but i didnt go to school for twentythree years in order to play golf and have my nails done so i resolved to make the best of the situation and set about enjoying the one thing they hadnt reneged on wide latitude in hiring faculty i was fortunate to snag susan santorini because she too wanted to remain in southern california her partners a film agent then i set about finding the third member of our tight little group and was informed by the dean that a strong candidate had come up and that i was highly advised to look favorably upon his application she touched a pearl earring gordon shull is a joke however his stepfather is one of our wealthiest alumni gordons an alumnus as well a joke in terms of scholarship i said a joke period when his application came across my desk and i noted that hed graduated from charter i got hold of his undergrad transcripts suspicious she smiled i was rather displeased to be advised when i read the transcript my displeasure turned to wrath to say gordon had been an undistinguished student would have been too kind he was on academic probation several semesters put together a cminus average by taking mickey mouse courses took five years to graduate somehow along the line he managed to get himself a masters her lips curled i got my doctorate at berkeley did a postdoc at london university and another at columbia susan santorinis doctorate is from columbia she taught in florence italy and at cornell before i snagged her the way the job market for academics is running we couldve had our pick of bright phds from top places instead we were forced to occupy the same intellectual space as that clown which helps the budget i said oh yes she said every year the department receives a check from the trueblood endowment the stepfathers foundation just enough to keep us motivated academic stranglehold said milo very well put detective and truth be told your visit tonight may very well have crystallized things for me if gordons transgressions have stretched beyond my wildest imagination i may finally have to make some serious life choices but before i tell you more i need one thing you must keep me informed provide me enough lead time so i can take my leave well before the storm and thus avoid embroiling myself in criminallegal matters youre resigning maam why not if the parachutes sufficiently golden said martin vernons been talking about cutting back the two of us have been itching to do more traveling perhaps this is providence so if you want to know more about gordons character flaws you must keep me in the loop fair enough said milo what problems have you had with shull pilferage sloppy expense accounts spotty attendance as a teacher shoddy grading said martin his lectures when he chooses to show up are execrable lowlevel discourses on pop culture with cretinous reading lists everything centers on gordons insight of the moment and gordons attention span is severely attenuated a dilettante i said shull had applied the term to kevin drummond hed have to work at being a dilettante said martin gordon is everything i despise about what passes for scholarship in contemporary academia he fancies himself an avatar of pop culture oracle on the mount passing judgment on the creative world no doubt because he sees himself as an artist but has failed miserably milo sat up how so gordon fancies himself quite the renaissance man he paints horrid blotchy canvases garden scenes purporting to be impressionistic but at a level of competence most middle school children could surpass shortly after he came on he brought several canvases to me asked for a oneman show sponsored by the department she snorted i put him off and he went to the dean even gordons connections couldnt help with that renaissance man said milo what else he plays drums and guitar very poorly i know that because hes always talking about gigging or riffing whatever last year he volunteered to play at a party vernon and i threw for the honor students this time i was foolish enough to agree her eyes rolled as if all that selfdelusion wasnt enough he also claims to be working on a novel some magnum opus in progress that hes been touting since ive known him ive never seen a page of manuscript big talk no walk said milo a real california guy said martin without family money hed be waiting tables and lying about his next big audition you said his attendance was spotty said milo hes always off on some jaunt financed by his stepfather what kind of jaunts alleged research trips symposia conventions in addition to his other pretensions he sees himself as an adventurer has been to asia europe you name it its all part of that macho thing he has going on plaid shirts with ties hiking boots the arafat beard he always claims to be working up some profound paper but again hes never produced she jabbed a finger in a sense the worlds fortunate he never follows through because gordons a horrid writer incoherent puffed up pompous faithful scrivener i said her eyes widened you know about that know about what gordon likes to refer to himself in third person graces himself with a slew of obnoxious nicknames the gordster the intrepid mr shull faithful scrivener she bared her teeth hes always been a joke unfortunately hes my personal sick joke and now youre telling me he killed someone and our offices are footsteps away that is unsettling am i in danger not that i see professor said milo who has he killed artistic individuals martins eyes saucered more than one im afraid so professor she sighed im definitely going to take some time off what can you tell us about kevin drummond said milo what i told professor delaware was true i have no specific memory of the boy after the visit i took a closer look at his transcripts mediocre student absolutely nothing out of the ordinary you have no memory of his hanging out with shull sorry no students come in and out of gordons office to a certain type hes appealing i dont recall mr drummond specifically what type of student finds him appealing said milo gordon stays abreast of all the latest trends and that impresses the easily impressed im sure what hed really like would be to host a show on mtv i said has shull acted out sexually with students probably she said probably said milo just like that thereve been no complaints but it certainly wouldnt surprise me most of the students who take advantage of gordons office hours seem to be female but thereve been no actual sexual harassment complaints no said martin facultystudent sex is a fixture of college life and complaints are very rare for the most part its consensual isnt that so professor delaware i nodded kevin drummonds gay said milo should we be looking at that youre asking if gordons bisexual said martin well i havent picked up on that but the truth is nothing youd tell me about him would surprise me hes what used to be referred to as a scoundrel nice word that too bad its fallen out of usage hes your prototypical spoiled brat he bounces along doing exactly what he pleases have you met his mother not yet martin smiled you really should especially you professor delaware right up your alley a font of psychopathology said milo martin regarded him with a long amused look the womans devoid of basic courtesy and simple good sense every year at the endowment luncheon she corrals me and reminds me how much money her husbands doled out then she proceeds to lecture me about the wondrous accomplishments of her baby boy gordon comes by his pretentiousness honestly she presents herself as society but from what ive gathered her first husband gordons real father was a drunk an unsuccessful real estate agent who spent time in prison for fraud both he and gordons brother died in a house fire when gordon was young and a few years later the mother found herself a sugar daddy milo scrawled in his pad martin said this has been educational but im tired if thats all if youve got a writing sample from shull that would be helpful back at my office she said ive got his latest endofyear selfassessment every faculty members required to submit one listing accomplishments goals gordons is a formality because we both know hes got life tenure maybe not said milo what a lovely thought said martin ill come in early tomorrow messenger it to you first thing she saw us to the door and milo thanked her my pleasure she said really you know now that i think about it gordons being a murderer doesnt really surprise me all that much whys that maam someone that false that shallow could do anything petra was having a decent night the air was cool the sky was a velvety purpleblack where hollywood neon didnt bleach it gray and a gordon shull was well known at clubs and dives and alternative bookstores the recollections of a hungover barkeep at the screw a rancid thrashmetal cave on vermont were typical yeah i seen him wears black and tries to pick up young chicks does he succeed maybe sometimes any girl in particular theyre all the same what else can you tell me about him just an old guy trying to be cool yknow i know what its the way things go a whole different ball game than her futile attempts to find any links to kevin drummond but something gave her pause none of the sightings paired shull with kevin was the younger man even involved in the bad stuff despite the ids her attempts to link shull specifically to dope violent tendencies aberrant sex or erna murphy were unsuccessful by shifts end she realized it added up to very little they could use in the short term and she felt her mood sinking then she got a little gift from god during her first pass down fountain avenue the snake pit had been closedno show tonight but when she passed by on the way to the station she spotted cars parked in front and a door left slightly ajar she went in and encountered a fat ponytailed bouncer nursing a gin and tonic the place smelled like a toilet closed the fat guy told her maintenance that meant him standing around guzzling and a diminutive man who looked like a rain forest indian sweeping the sticky floor music some kind of harmonicadriven bassheavy chicago blues blared on the sound system bare plywood tables were arranged haphazardly a drum kit sat on the stage a microphone stand with no mike looked decapitated nothing sadder than a dive without patrons petra stepped in farther and looked around some more and smiled at the bouncer yeah he folded thighsized forearms over his sumo belly his skin was the pinkgray of raw pork sausage a brocade of tattoos turned the arms into kimono sleeves prison art and finer work a swastika graced the back of his neck he hadnt been one of the interviewees on baby boys murder she showed him the badge and asked him about that i was off that night shed requested a full staff list from the management so much for that she showed him shulls photo yeah he comes here pork sausage downed his drink waddled behind the bar and fixed himself another he took a long time cutting a lime squeezed it into the glass then tossed the slice into his mouth chewed swallowed rind and all how often does he come here said petra sometimes whats your name he didnt like the question but he wasnt the least bit intimidated ralf kvellesenn she had him spell it for her write it down ralf with an f some viking ancestor was rolling over in his grave be more specific than sometimes ralf kvellesenn frowned and his greasy forehead furrowed dude comes in once in a while he aint a regular i only know him because he comes on real friendly with you with the acts dudes into talking to them between sets he digs going backstage is he allowed to do that kvellesenn winked it aint the hollywood bowl meaning a few bucks opened doors petra said so hes kind of like a groupie kvellesenn emitted a wet laugh i never seen him giving head i didnt mean literally ralf whatever you dont seem curious about why im asking you about him i aint a curious person said kvellesenn curious gets you fucked up she recorded kvellesenns address and phone number sat down at a bare table as he stared took her time rereading her notes and found the name of the bouncer whod been on the night of baby boys murder val bove she left the club phoned boves home number woke him up described shull yeah he said yeah what i know the dude you mean but i don remember if he was there when baby got offed why not house was packed but you definitely know who im talking about yeah the professor dude how do you know hes a professor he calls himself that said bove he told me he was a professor like trying to impress me like i give a shit what else did he tell you basically hes like im cool i write books i play guitar too like i give a fuck an artistic type said petra whatever a loud yawn came over the phone and petra could swear she smelled the guys rotten breath what else can you tell me about the professor dude thats it babe next time don call so early she made careful copious notes was about to phone milo call it a day well spent but drove to dove house instead the assistant director diane petrello was at the downstairs desk petra had brought her a few people diane smiled her eyes were pinkrimmed and raw her expression said what now rough day said petra terrible day two of our girls odd last night sorry to hear that diane they were doping together separate incidents detective which somehow makes it worse one was right around the corner shed just left for a walk promised to come back for evening prayers the other was in that big parking lot behind the new kodak center all those tourists the only reason we found out so quickly is both girls had our card in their purses and your officers were kind enough to let us know petra showed her shulls photo diane shook her head is he involved with erna dont know yet diane could i please show this to your current residents of course they trudged upstairs together and petra began with the males six profoundly inebriated men none of whom recognized shull on the womens floor she found only three residents in one room including lynnette the gaunt blackhaired junkie milo had spoken to about erna cute she said kind of like a banana republic ad have you seen him before lynnette i wish behind smudged eyeglass lenses diane petrellos eyes shut tight then opened lynnette she said softly before lynnette could reply petra said you wish like i said cute said lynnette i could do him so good hed buy me pretty things she grinned revealing ragged mossy teeth yellow eyes hepatitis or something in that league petra felt like stepping away but she didnt lynnette have you ever seen this man with erna erna was a skank hes way too cute for her one of the other women was elderly and whiskerchinned stretched out on the bed sleeping the other was fortyish tall black heavylegged petra glanced at the black woman and she drifted over sliding worn bedroom slippers over threadbare carpeting and sounding like a snare drum i seen him with erna right said lynnette petra said when did you see him ms devana moore i seen him here and there talking to erna uhhuh right said lynnette devana moore said i did here and there said petra not here like you knowhere said devana moore talking slowly slurring forming sentences was an ordeal here and there not in the building said petra but in the neighborhood right shes lyin said lynnette i aint lyin said devana moore without a trace of resentment more like a kid protesting her innocence petra was no expert but she was willing to bet this ones iq made her a disastrous witness still work with what you have lynnette snickered devana moore said girl i be lyin i be flyin petra said whens the last time you saw this man with erna ms moore mizz moore said lynnette cackling diane petrello said cmon lynnette lets get some coffee lynnette didnt budge the old woman snored loudly devana moore stared at petra petra repeated the question and moore said had to be few days ago how many days silence about pressed petra dunno maybe dunno lynnette said they gonna bust you for lyin mizz moore to petra shes a retard moore sagged and pouted and petra thought shed break into tears instead she lunged at lynnette and the two woman flailed their arms ineffectually until petra got between them and shouted stop it right now silence downcast looks lynnette cackled again and diane petrello ushered her out of the room devana moore was crying petra said shes just being mean i know youre telling me the truth sniffle moore looked at the floor youre really helping me ms moore i appreciate it dont bust me said moore please why would i bust you moore kicked her own ankle sometimes i whore its a sin and i don want to but sometimes i do it thats your business ms moore said petra im homicide not vice who got homicided said devana erna yeah said devana thats true relaxing as if confirmation upped petras credibility she blinked scratched her head pointed at shulls picture he do erna maybe whered you see him and erna um um it was over on highland highland and where sunset north or south of sunset this way devana pressed her hand against her chest which petra supposed meant south two more attempts to pin down the location failed either way highland and sunset made sense right near ernas doctors office hannah gold what were they doing ms moore talking talking angrily uhuh just talking you aksing this because he did erna maybe said petra what else can you tell me about him ms moore thats it said devana she crossed herself he did erna hes a sinful man petra returned to the station at am stahls desk was unoccupied still surveilling shull hed started just after dark all those hours sitting there the guy had an attention span that was for sure she checked her message box stahl hadnt called in he never did meaning no progress how did he stand the inactivity she supposed stahls willingness to play statue made him the perfect partner on this one how cases that required more teamwork would work out was anyones guess no sense wondering about that she needed to keep focused on the here and now four in the morning was no time to bother a friend so she phoned milos desk at west la and left a message knowing hed be likely to wake her when he returned but that was okay she wanted to let him know shull was an habitue of the snake pit liked to go backstage she was thirsty got up and poured herself terrible police coffee and drank it standing alone in the corner of the detective room thought about shull hollywood nightscene regular the professor too bad neither bouncer could verify his presence the night of baby boys murder maybe shed go back over her witness list do a major recontact with the photo see if anyone remembered yeah shed have to do that bigtime tedium the core of detective work with shull under surveillance it could wait until tomorrow she was exhausted needed to shower and stretch out and catch a few hours of dreamless sleep so why was she loading up on caffeine she tossed the muddy swill returned to her desk got her coat stood there some more visualizing how it had probably gone down between shull and baby boy shull pays his cover orders enough drinks to hold on to a nice dark seat at the back he takes in the show watches listens applauds clapping for himself more than baby boy baby boy finishes his first set and leaves shulls watched him before knows his habit of heading back to the alley for a smoke he sits for a moment sipping planning makes sure no ones watching as he slips out of the club linus brophy had said the killer was wearing a long dark coat shull wore all black habitually when he nightcrawled a big black coat would be perfect for concealing a big sharp knife ready for business shull makes his way to the alley conceals himself in the shadows waits baby boy shows up lights a smoke shull studies him taking his time savoring the moment finally he approaches baby boy unaware of brophy but the winos presence turns out to be irrelevant baby boy unsuspecting a sweet guy a warm guy hes used to the adoration of fans and heres another one shulls demeanor nurtures the subterfuge big smile tossing out the heartfelt praise of a true believer the professor ingratiating himself the way hed done with lots of artists none of them knowing he considers himself the ultimate artist a loser in real life a legend in his own mind like alex had said psychological cannibalism if you cant beat em eat em petra shuddered baby boy a trusting man a naïve man smiles back both of them smiling as shull plunges the knife she put on her coat and left when she reached home there was a message from milo on her machine call me im up she reached him on his cell youre up late the bad guys dont sleep why should i whats up she gave him a progress report milo said good work very good were closing in meaning meaning you earned your shuteye and ill be at the courthouse by nine tomorrow to see if judge davison is a little more openminded let me know you bet thanks kid youre welcome pop the first time eric stahl saw the house he knew it wasnt an ideal situation all that was visible from the street were bleached wooden gates flanked by brick posts beyond the posts were sixfoottall ivycovered walls behind the walls junipers and cypress towered and some kind of vine sprawled nice place shull had money it always came down to money soon after he positioned himself down the hilly block stahl entertained a brief fantasy scale the fence b and e the house find shull doing something evil and finish the bastard off the way bad guys deserved to be finished off nice movie reality was that he sat and watched and waited tonight for some reason his talent for inertia was being tested by pm two hours after hed arrived the hero fantasy recurred he visualized how hed do shull the neck snap or if shull resisted a knife eric stahl big hero providing closure ugliest word in the english language justice was a close second he wondered how long he could do this job maybe forever maybe till tomorrow there were three positives to the layout shulls house was positioned at the end of a culdesac meaning one way in one way out parking was permitted on the west side of the road allowing stahl to find himself a spot between two other vehicles and avoid conspicuousness the best thing this was an outoftheway street hard to find without a map no sidewalks no reason for a casual pedestrian to come up here nice for a bad boy by ninefortyfive he still wasnt sure if shull was even home guy kept professors hours and according to sturgis not much of that for all he knew shull was bunking in all day had yet to emerge or the bastard hadnt come home at all was somewhere below in the flats of hollywood trolling city streets digging art since stahl had arrived only two cars had appeared within the first hour each stopping well short of his surveillance spot in both cases the drivers were young women with terrific figures driving foreign compacts stahl watched them carry groceries to their cute little hill houses poor choice of neighborhood for a woman alone too isolated too far from help not that crowds kept you safe he wondered how the tightbodied women would react when they found out theyd been neighbors to a very bad person he imagined the usual horrified newspaper quotes i had no idea i cant believe it he seemed like a nice person believe it ladies anythings possible the night sky gelled and turned shiny purplish black like boysenberry jam black napalm stahl ate a ham sandwich and drank from his thermos of espresso and risked a couple of forays across the road so he could pee in the bushes then back to his car where he kept his eyes out for either of the two vehicles registered to shull a oneyearold bmw and a twoyearold ford expedition the beemer was probably shulls show wheels the fourwheeler was what he used for exploration not a van guys like shull loved vans because you could turn one into a prisononwheels easily enough but a trendy guy like shull living up here in the hills would view a van as déclassé and the oversized suv provided some of the same benefits big unobtrusive lots of storage space a hundred to one shull had blackened the windows headlights brightening stahls rear window made him slink down and turn his head small vehicle a dark car there it was the bmw grille zipping toward the end of the culdesac the bmw passed too quickly for stahl to make out the driver in the darkness but when it stopped at the bleached gates he sat higher and watched electric gate the car passed through exactly thirty seconds later the gate closed some sort of timerelease mechanism stahl waited until pm before exiting his car figuring even a hip guy like shull was probably buttoned down for the night had he arrived alone no way to know checking out the street and finding it dead stahl crossed the road again peed continued sticking close to the foliage if anyone did appear he could conceal himself in the brush he proceeded slowly with rubbersoled silence feeling loose the old prowlzen kicking in good trackers and snipers were born with it a neighborhood this remote shouldve been silent but an insistent hum filtered up from the base of the foothills the sounds of hollywood the real hollywood percolating a couple of miles below he got within yards of the bleached gate through the big trees fronting shulls property distant lights sparked and blinked a few stars in the sky too struggling to be noticed through the smog guy had a terrific view the good life stahl made it to the gate surveyed the street again got his nose up close and was able to inspect the gates construction without using his penlight twobyfours tongueandgroove arranged in a pretty chevron design and framed by heavier boards the frame bottom was stout and steady provided a nice toehold he put his foot in place lifted himself up high enough to peer over on the other side was a round brick courtyard surrounded by greenery plants in pots tiled fountain off to the left no drip soft lighting revealed the house a splitlevel spanish design tileroofed with nice arched windows very good life no sign of the bmw or the expedition but the courtyard terminated in an attached threecar garage that sat under a wing of the house a lowwattage bulb revealed a trio of bleached wood chevron doors that matched the gate to the right an ironrailed staircase led up to what stahl assumed was the houses main entrance hard to say how big the place was it looked goodsized he thought about the layout the door up the stairs would be where you had your guests enter if you wanted to make an impression first thing theyd see would be a windowful of city lights with no one to impress shull would drive in through the garage take an interior staircase into the house no bmw in sight said thats what hed done tonight meaning he was alone or with someone he didnt care to impress stahl stood there perched on the gate frame figuring this would be another uneventful night then a rustle of leaves several rustles tightened the back of his neck and he got down and pressed himself against the ivycolored wall more noise more than a rodent scurrying someone sniffing the air stahl waited nothing happened then the sound repeated itself louder and twenty feet down the brush parted and a deer a smallish doe began prancing across the road the animal stopped in the middle stood there twitching stahls heartbeat was way slow the way it always was after it had been tweaked quick recovery from some things the deer considered her options finally bounded off and ran down a driveway disappearing between two houses a regular she knew who was home and who wasnt now someones garden would be a latenight snack and eventually the doe would be some coyotes dinner or maybe a puma would get her stahl had heard that the mountain lions were making a big comeback wildlife in general was inching its way toward the urban jungle that had certainly been true near the base all sorts of critters turning up in the strangest places his favorite was the snake who chose a colonels wifes bidet as a drinking fountain she squats in the dark gets a slithery surprise stahl felt himself smiling noise on the other side of shulls gate wiped his face clean ignition rumble he ran to the gate regained his foothold chanced a quick look the center garage door slid open and he jumped down sprinted back to his car he barely made it back as the gate swung back headlights a new set higher up than the bmw the expedition nosed its way out paused sped away black suv blackened windows oneman tails were impractical often impossible but with an arrogant guy like shull the job was easier why would the bastard even imagine he was being followed stahl drove with his lights off as shull sped down the hill way too fast the expedition headed north on cahuenga and over to a jazz club just south of the valley not far from baby boys apartment shull left the expedition with a parking valet stayed inside for forty minutes and retrieved the suv now it was nearly am and with the traffic thinned stahl had to keep his distance shull didnt go far just a quick jaunt into studio city where he had coffee and a burger at an allnight coffee shop on ventura near lankershim no valet here stahl parked in the halfempty lot observed the window four cups of coffee black shull inhaled his burger fueling up shull paid in cash got back in the suv back to the city on laurel canyon a right turn on sunset a few blocks up shull pulled in front of a bar called bambu neo tikihut décor bored bouncer in front another valet situation stahl drove a block hung a quick u watched from across sunset as shull got out of the suv smoking a cigar dressed in a black leather jacket black jeans black tshirt swaggering shmoozing with the parking attendant no nerves obviously delawares showing up at his office didnt worry him just the opposite shull had taken delawares questions about drummond as proof he was safe if drummond had been shulls partner in crime if drummond had known anything delawares asking about him had probably accomplished something else drummond was now a severe liability bye bye kev sturgis had opined as much at the last meeting drummonds car near the airport meant shull had probably taken care of the kid used the honda to pick up erna murphy then planted it to imply drummonds longdistance rabbit and it had worked all those days wasted checking out airline rosters all the time stahl had spent watching drummonds apartment meanwhile drummond was probably moldering somewhere even if drummond hadnt been in on the bad stuff he was a likely corpse because his disappearance provided distraction terrific cover for shull and because shull liked killing people modern art bambus fakegrass door swung open and shull exited with a knockout blonde in tow late twenties big golden hair a real barbie she wore a red glittery crop top under a short black jacket shredded secondskin jeans highheeled boots breasts way too high and too large to be real too much makeup stahl upped his age estimate the wrong side of thirty your basic sunset boulevard party girl past her prime but not a pro she looked too happy positioned on shulls leather arm for this to be work giggling staggering giddy shull smiled back at her but he was composed life is going so well for me stahl sat in his car and watched the two of them flirt fixing on shulls macho posturing just about feeling the heft of the sniper rifle on his shoulder the expedition arrived and shull was careful to hold the passenger door open for barbie taking her hand as he did it she kissed him in appreciation once the blonde was inside shull and the parking valet exchanged conspiratorial glances someones getting lucky tonight bro not the girl shull stayed on sunset and continued west through the strip and into beverly hills speeding into even ritzier bel air at hilgard he turned south drove through westwood village got on wilshire and resumed a westerly route making stahls job easy because even at this hour am the brightly lit boulevard had its share of traffic he hung three car lengths behind the expedition accompanied shull and the blonde all the way through brentwood and santa monica down to pacific coast highway the beach here the traffic was sparse and the job became trickier stahl hung back fixed his eyes on the suvs taillights shull picked up speed traveling nearly seventy twenty miles over the limit as he crossed the coastal boundaries of pacific palisades and continued into the city of malibu going seventyfive per eighty eightyfive big hurry no concern about being stopped on a traffic violation because he thought of himself as the kind of guy bad things didnt happen to or because a speeding ticket was just money and he had plenty of that did it also mean anything of forensic value been expunged from the suv a perfect cleaning was hard to pull off one errant hair a speck of body fluid could tell a tale shull didnt transport his victims he left them in place but still his own garments the seat of the car anything couldve picked up some transfer yet here he was playing daytona was the guy that arrogant stahls mental meanderings were cut short when the expedition made an abrupt right turn off the highway into the parking lot of a whiteboard blueshuttered motel the sea arms caught off guard stahl continued another quarter mile pulled over to the shoulder turned around and drove back parking on the beach side of pch he studied the sea arms twostoried cape coddish building behind an open parking lot no rear property the motel was nestled against the mountains the usual aaa endorsement a pink neon vacancy sign on a tall pole six units on each floor the managers office down below to the right thirteen cars in the lot including the expedition twelve occupants plus the manager a gordon shull lucky boy that he was had snagged the last empty room stahl lost it falling asleep in his car rudely awakened by a rap on the window blinding light in his eyes he opened the window and a voice barked lets see some id stahls hand had moved instinctively toward the holstered mm concealed under his car coat but fortunately his brain kicked in once he saw the robocop countenance of a highway patrolman eventually everything was cleared up and the chp guy sped away in his cruiser stahl sat there humiliated how long had he been out threeforty am meant nearly half an hour the ocean roared in his head the beach sky was full of stars the sea was ash gray speckled with pinpoints of gold eleven vehicles in the lot shulls expedition one of them stahl got out took in a headful of salt air stretched cursed his stupidity got back in the car resumed watching at am a gordon shull stepped out of a downstairs unit alone no blonde carrying his black leather jacket over his shoulder rubbing his eyes he got in the expedition swung out of the lot and made a quick illegal left turn across the highway crossing a set of doubleyellows speeding off back to the city where was chp when you needed them quick decision time follow the bastard or check on the blonde did the blonde fit shulls pattern some kind of artistic type a wouldbe actress did that qualify or maybe she was a dancer those legs shull had already done a dancer would he repeat himself the one in boston had been a ballerina this one looked more like the lapdance type enough kill variety he goes in with her comes out without her meaning the room could be a pretty sight stahl drove across the highway straight into the sea arms lot parked at the far end wanting to examine the spot where the expedition had stood nothing but a grease stain stahl walked up to unit five knocked on the sea blue door got no answer tried the knob locked a louder knock thunderous in the earlymorning calm brought no response and stahl glanced at the managers office lights out should he wake the manager up and get a key or pull off a doityourself the lock was a mediocre dead bolt and his kit was back in the car he could always say hed found the door open he assessed his options talking to himself in the stilted selfjustification of courtroom copspeak a serial murder suspect entered with a female companion and remained at the site for an hour and fiftytwo minutes before departing alone i initially attempted to gain entry by knocking and when i received no answer after a significant lapse in time i felt the situation demanded the sea blue door opened the blonde stood there in her red crop top and ragged tight jeans zipper halfup the faintest swell of belly above pink lace panties lowslung thong panties several platinum pubic hairs strayed above the elastic she blinked staggered looked at the spot where the expedition had stood then at stahl several beats of the rolling tide caressed the morning the air was cold and wet and smelled of driftwood stahl said miss the blonde wore no makeup was blearyeyed her hair stiff as a birds nest the way sprayed hair got when you slept on it tear streaks striped her perfect cheekbones not as hard a face as stahl had thought cleansed of greasepaint she looked younger vulnerable who the hell are you she demanded in a voice that couldve dissolved rust from a rain gutter so much for vulnerability stahl showed her his badge and pushed his way in despite the beach location the sea arms was just another tacky motel and the room was just another moldy bytheday cell cottagecheese ceiling rumpled double bed with a upay vibrator hookup woodite end tables plastic lamps bolted down a smallscreen tv bolted to the wall was topped by a chart of movies by the hour at least half of them xrated a mud brown carpet was marred by indelible stains stahl spotted white grains on the nightstand a folded piece of stiff paper the coke chute a crumpled kleenex stiffened by snot kyra montego knew stahl had seen the dope leavings but she pretended to be oblivious i dont understand she said tight butt perched on the edge of the bed zipper all the way up now her bra was slung over a chair and her nipples pushed through the red top she fooled with her hair had little success organizing the wild yellow thatch stahl said the man you were with it wasnt like that said montego kyra montego no way that was on her birth certificate stahl asked her for id and she said what gives you the right youre implying im a hooker or something and thats bullshit you have no right i need to know your real name maam you need a warrant everyone watched too much tv stahl took her purse off the dresser found three joints in a plastic baggie and placed them on the bed next to her a long blond hair curled atop a crushed pillow hey she said he removed her wallet found her license katherine jean magary address in van nuys a threedigit apartment number that said she lived in a huge complex katherine magarys a fine name he said you think she said my agent said its too clumsy film agent i wish im a dancer yeah the kind you think but ive also done legit theater so dont go assuming anything about my morals i dont think its too clumsy said stahl she stared at him and her eyes softened big moist irises deep brown almost black somehow they went okay with the whiteblond hair you really think i do stahl replaced the wallet in the purse put the joints back too magarymontego arched her back and flipped her hair and said youre cool he talked to her for twenty minutes but after five he believed her shed never seen shull before had drunk too much wink wink shull had seemed cute masculine funny kinda smart from his clothes she thought he had money his clothes said stahl his jacket was gucci magarymontego smiled i managed a peek at the label stahl smiled back in a way that told her that had been clever and kept her talking shull had spun her a good yarn telling her he was a professor of art and a landscape painter had exhibited all over the world was represented by galleries in new york and santa fe landscapes stahl remembered sturgiss description of the kipper womans paintings sturgis had gone into detail more than was necessary hed clearly liked the pictures thats what he said did he name the gallery said stahl uh i dont think so katherine magary hed decided to think of her by her birth name licked her lips and smiled and placed her hand on his knee he let it sit there no reason to alienate a witness was it all bs she said what he told me hes not a good guy said stahl oh boy katherine sighed knocked a fist against her blond bangs ive gotta stop doing this getting wasted getting picked up even when theyre cute it is dangerous said stahl ill bet you know all about that being a detective you could tell me stories unfortunately yeah said katherine it must be fascinating your work stahl didnt answer was i in serious danger she said being with him i wouldnt go with him again said stahl jesus im sorry apologizing to him he said living by yourself you need to keep yourself safe yeah i do ive been stressedout havent worked for a while must be tough said stahl oh boy you learn to dance when youre a kid let me tell you its hard its really hard work an olympic athlete wouldnt work any harder and then all they want is you know stahl nodded grimy drapes pocked with cigarette burns blocked the motel rooms sole window through the glass and the fabric he could barely make out the rush of the tide slow rhythm easy come easy go he said did he treat you okay katherine magary didnt answer stahl turned to her she was blushing was he weird to you katherine no thats the point he couldnt you know he came on like a big stud and then he couldnt so instead we he i really dont want to incriminate myself you wont said stahl she remained silent he said he was impotent so he concentrated on packing his nose like a pig he wanted me to use too but i didnt honest at that point all i wanted to do was get some sleep but i was nervous because when he couldnt he got real jumpy restless pacing around and the coke just made it worse i finally calmed him down by giving him a massage thats my other skill im a certified massage therapist real massage not youknowwhat i rubbed him down real good and he relaxed but something about him even when he slept he was uptight grinding his teeth he had this real unpleasant look on his face she squinted jutted her lower jaw strained uptight said stahl when i met him he was totally mellow loose real easygoing thats what i liked about him ive had enough stress in my life who needs bad vibes she shrugged i thought his vibes were good guess im stupid stahls thigh where her hand rested had grown hot he patted her fingers lightly removed her hand and got up she said where are you going alarm in her voice stahl said stretching he moved closer to the bed stood by her she said when i woke up when you woke me up i was freaked out to learn he was gone how am i supposed to get back to my place stahl said ill take you she said youre really cool reached for his zipper pulled it down very slowly nice she said nice man stahl let her i put the photocopies down its pretty obvious it was pm and milo had dropped by to show me the endofyear summaries elizabeth martin had pulled from shulls faculty file when i scanned the material bloated paragraphs jumped out at me phrases bunched together like tokyo commuters disorganization pomposity lack of grace shull could plot and carry out murder with cleverness and decisiveness but when faced with the written word his mind lost traction hed proposed a course he wanted to develop the cartography of dissonance and upheaval art as paleobioenergetic paradox i reached into my file box found what i was looking for the seldomscene review of julie kippers show penned by fs there were the words paradoxical cartograph and dissonance i searched further when fs had picked angelique bernet out of la compagnie hed raved this is dance as in paleoinstinctuobioenergetic so right so real so unashamedly erotic i pointed it out to milo he recycles limited creativity its got to be frustrating so hes a hack he said so why couldnt he just write for the movies instead of killing people muttering he circled the matching phrases with red pen now that we know its him i said im getting a new slant on his victim selection until now id been thinking along purely psychological lines capturing stars on the ascent swallowing their identities before they became corrupted psychic cannibalism he said i was starting to like that you dont anymore i do but another factor is the disconnect between shulls inflated sense of self and his accomplishments the grand artiste whos failed at music and art he hasnt killed any writers so he probably still thinks of himself as a viable writer the novel he talks about maybe there is a manuscript in a drawer i said the bottom line is shulls a good bet for bitterness and pathological jealousy but thats only part of it i think hes being practical murder someone really famous and you bring down bigtime publicity and persistent scrutiny pulling off something that grandiose would be tempting for shull but at this point hes smart enough to be deterred by the risk so he lowers his sights targets notquitecelebrities like baby boy and julie kipper and vassily levitch their stories dont make the papers youre saying hell eventually go for the big time if he keeps succeeding murders the only thing hes ever been good at youre right with a famous victim ida gotten a warrant a long time ago still no luck i tried the three most permissive judges i know went to the da for backup no dice everyone says the same thing the totality is suggestive but insufficient foundation what do they want short of an eyewitness body fluids anything physical detective stahl may have helped things along early this morning he watched shull pick up a girl at a bar on sunset take her to a motel in malibu and leave the place without her stahl assumed the worst and abandoned the tail to check the room but it was just a case of shull leaving early but while he was interviewing the girl ol eric got consent from her to look around she was the resident so its full consent what he took with him was a cardboard coke chute a tissue caked with snot and whatre probably blood flecks a drinking glass the girl said shull used and the bedsheet any of that matches the little red hairs in armand mehrabians beard were in business when will you know we put a rush on but were still talking days still its progress good for stahl weird guy said milo but maybe our hero speaking of mehrabians beard i said you phrased it as shull getting in his victims face im wondering if he actually kissed mehrabian kiss of death the image mightve appealed to shull seeing himself as a mafioso or the angel of death the sexual ambiguity might also be relevant that would tie in with his relationship with kevin think kevins alive i wouldnt take odds on it i said whether or not he was shulls confederate once i started asking about him shull wouldve seen him as a liability petra says no one can confirm seeing the two of them together so whatever they collaborated on it was private one thing id wager shull financed kevins magazine and got himself an outlet for his writing ten to one hes been trying for years to get in print at real magazines piled up the rejection slips kevin was his vanity press he said shull used kevin as a front because kevin was young edgy and impressionable and if anything went wrong with grooverat as it did shull would be spared public embarrassment right after baby boys murder kevin called petra trying to get gory details either shull put him up to it aiming for psychic souvenirs or kevin suspected something about his teacher and was checking it out either way hed be in trouble he frowned i said whats next more of the same this is stahls second day on surveillance he called in an hour ago and all shulls done so far is spend a few hours on campus run errands come home hes still there but stahl figures hell likely get going soon he usually begins nightcrawling around now where does he crawl all over town clubs bars restaurants he drives a lot moves around constantly which fits these guys are always mileage freaks tonight stahl switched cars to a rental suv just in case petras run out of things to do so she may join in a twoperson surveillance is always better i showed shulls photo to the gallery people and szabo and loh no one recognized him why would they he wears the uniform blackonblack your prototypical la guy his name doesnt show up on szabos invite list either but ill keep looking what kind of girl did shull pick up i said stahl didnt say the main thing is he didnt kill her stahl describes shulls general demeanor during the pickup as relaxed hes certain shulls unaware were looking at him so maybe hell slip up actually make a move on someone caught in the act i said yeah yeah he said a boy can dream the next morning milo phoned and said boring night shull just drove around up in the hills then out to the beach all the way into ventura county he turned off on las posas got on the north went another ten miles returned stopped at an allnight coffee shop in tarzana he likes cheapieeats places probably thinks of himself as slumming then he drove home alone went to bed restless i said the tension could be building up well he said lets see if he blows just as i was leaving for a jog allison phoned to say shed had to add three appointments to her patient schedule wouldnt be through until pm crises i said when it rains it pours are you up for a later reservation wed arranged an eight oclock dinner date at the hotel bel air fabulous food impeccable service and when the weather was kind which was often in la you could dine outside and watch swans glide on lagoons years ago id seen bette davis glide across the patio that night id been with robin she and i used to hit the bel air on special occasions i thought the fact that i was ready to take allison was a healthy sign how about ten i said will you have the energy if i dont ill fake it she said i laughed youre sure we can do it another time another time isnt a concept i admire she said sorry for the shuffle a crisis is a crisis finally she said someone who gets it night three of the surveillance found petra stationed up the road from a gordon shulls house not nearly as close as stahl had gotten because fewer vehicles were parked on the street and she had to blend in but she still had a nice clear view of the gates stahl had suggested she take the hillside position while he stayed down in the city in the rental suv just about the only thing hed said to her all of yesterday he seemed more distant than ever if that was possible he was down on franklin in a bronco a cute shiny black thing petra had admired in the station parking lot nice eric stahls response was to produce an oily rag bend down and rub the cloth on the greasy asphalt flick off flecks of grit and begin dirtying the broncos side panels and windows soon the poor thing looked as if it had been driven all day from arizona schoelkopf mustve been in a good mood said petra okaying cool wheels stahl picked up more parking lot dirt continued to filthy the bronco i didnt ask him you paid for this with your own money yup you might still be able to collect she said if you put in the voucher soon stahl did something with his head that mightve been a nod if you were looking for a nod he opened the broncos driver door said let me know when youre all set got in drove off they maintained contact every hour using a tactical band on the radio four calls tonight so far each the same nothing okay it was a quarter to eleven and shull whom they assumed was home hadnt emerged staying in just as he had last night that had been a downer sitting waiting fighting drowsiness the crushing boredom petra detested at least shull wasnt out killing anyone then she flashed an evil grin too bad shull wasnt out for the kill this case had been nothing but false starts and dead ends and way too much of nothing and lord forgive her she craved some action was willing to trade public safety for a little adrenaline fix whats a little attempted murder between friends a voice in her head said naughty girl she said up yours just to hear the sound of her own voice at pm she shared another twoword communication with eric the dead sat back and stared at the black sky above the gates shed avoided fluids well before the surveillance but by now her bladder was cramping not easy for a girl not that shed ever complain to anyone she was considering her urinary options when shulls gate swung open and headlights stared out at the night the bmw or the expedition she was down in her seat when it passed neither a cadillac dark gray shiny despite her surprise she was able catch to the license number whispered it out loud in order to commit it to memory stahl had said only two vehicles were registered to shull interesting she got back on the tac band told stahl what to look for hed be the primary tail now because she was going to call in the plates soon she had it fiveyearold sedan deville registered to william f trueblood pasadena address shulls rich stepfather she put truebloods name into the system got two more dmv hits a oneyearold eldorado and a jaguar stepdaddy gets a new caddy donates the old one to junior william f trueblood hadnt bothered to change the registration meaning he was probably still paying the license fees and the insurance nice gift for gordie free and clear the cadillac offered shull the use of a completely legal unregistered set of wheels spoiled brat petra started up her honda turned around headed down to the city the first clean safe rest room she spotted was at a frenchtype café on franklin seven blocks west of beachwood she left her car with the valet tipped him and told him to keep it there the restaurant had a bar and a few tables was jammed and noisy and rich with the smell of ratatouille and shellfish she elbowed her way through a crush of laughing flirting pretty people picking up bits of stale pickup dialogue and smiling despite herself then resenting the fact that some people had lives and she didnt on the way to the ladies room someone pinched her butt normally shed have dealt with it tonight she found the attention welcome by the time she was back in her car and calling in she expected stahl and shull to be miles away but stahl said im on fountain near vermont he stopped somewhere he drove straight to fountain has cruised up and down three times past the snake pit revisiting the scene she said memory trophy has he gone into the alley where he did baby boy not yet said stahl he just drives by does a threepoint heads up the block drives by again the streets dead i cant get that close where are you stahl pinpointed his location petra said ill come in from the west end cruise through at a moderate speed if he leaves before i get there let me know she drove to western turned left on fountain the street was empty dark eerie when she was three blocks from the snake pit stahl called hes finished heading your way petra spotted two sets of headlights not stahl no way would he be following that obviously she maintained her speed as her windshield whitened a pickup truck then the cadillac in her rearview she watched shull continue to western catch an amber light and sail through the intersection moments later the rental bronco sped by petra hung a u followed at a safe distance they picked up the cadillac on wilton heading south moderate traffic made their life easier and they alternated positions first the bronco would lag three or four cars behind then stahl would slow and petras accord would fill in were dancing she thought this was as intimate as she ever wanted to get with stahl shull drove to wilshire turned right continued west maintaining a nice steady pace within ten miles of the speed limit driving as recreation when petra was the primary tag she got close enough to notice that the cadillacs windows had been tinted nearly black she couldnt see an old guy from pasadena doing that shull had customized the car the sedan deville drove through beverly hills and veered right at the junction of wilshire and santa monica staying on wilshire shull continued into westwood then headed north on san vicente hugging the western perimeter of the veterans administration grounds passing the cemetery studded with white crosses and stars of david then the boutiquelatte jungle that made up lower brentwood shull took another northern turn on bundy followed by a left on sunset too few cars for cover now stahl was in front and he took his time before following took so long petra was certain theyd lost sight of the caddy she called in any idea where he is nope great but i can guess said stahl he sped ahead of her drove a while turned right onto bristol the site of the levitch murder petra entered the lush street very slowly looked for the bronco and spotted it parked a half block up lights off she killed her beams rolled several yards up pulled to the curb stahl said dont know if hes here so what we just wait petra kept her mouth shut looked around admired the mansions the massive deodar cedars the grassy treeshrouded turnarounds that slowed traffic and gave the neighborhood character your perfect uppercrust suburban scene if you had a sevenfigure income lights glimmered in some of the big houses she caught glimpses of crystal chandeliers rich paintings crown moldings outside herds of sleek cars luxuriated in commodious driveways then lights in the distance moving enlarging maybe two blocks up could be anyone it was shull heading their way pausing at the turnaround making an easy slow circle and retracing northward back and forth back and forth drinking in the scenes of his crimes there was a sexual nature to it and she wondered if the fool was playing with himself should we get closer said petra annoyed with herself for consulting stahl she was the senior partner but stahl had been the one whod figured out shulls intentions its a risk he said still if he doesnt return within five im going to have a look okay four minutes later the cadillac reappeared passed the turnaround continued to sunset and made a quick right turn stahls lights switched on she followed him and they both put on speed and spotted the cadillac as it continued into the palisades back to the beach shull had taken a girl to a motel in malibu but as far as they knew hed never killed anyone there as far as they knew at pacific coast highway shull reversed direction again turning left south away from malibu and toward the lights of the santa monica pier zig and zag up and down they followed him up the drive to ocean avenue when shull got to colorado he drove east past the noise and activity of the promenade and over to lincoln where he headed south again toward the airport the route hed taken when he stashed kevin drummonds car if hed stashed kevin too maybe this would tell them where at rose shull surprised her yet again turning back toward the ocean and driving all the way to the venice walkway where he pulled toward the right side of the street but didnt park idling lights on she hung back at pacific maintained her distance stahl dimmed his lights and got within a block of the cadillac the caddy made a ponderous threepoint turn sped back toward them by the time they were in gear all three vehicles were back on lincoln for this guy driving was something way beyond getting from one place to another shull drove past the marina and playa del rey not far from where hed dumped armand mehrabian then into the bleak industrial wasteland on the outskirts of el segundo great dump ground and the isolation made it terrible for a tail both detectives had switched their lights off a half mile back shull lowered his speed as he glided past empty fields oil derricks marshland kevins final resting spot nope here shull was again speeding continuing another mile then east to sepulveda another right turn driving rapidly into inglewood definitely lax but as if thumbing his nose at petras theories shull slowed three blocks short of the airport and jerked the caddy suddenly onto a side street this was walking distance from where kevin drummonds car had been found the caddy chewed up four more blocks before pulling over on both sides of the street were warehouses and small factories poor lighting and petra knew what else a hooker strip she settled a hundred feet behind stahl he called in ive got binocs on him hes out of the car now walking talking to a woman whats she look like said petra remembering what small and schlesinger had said about working an unsolved streetwalker murder in this neighborhood shes wearing hot pants said stahl she said im getting closer a gordon shull talked to the prostitute a chubby woman the hot pants were red and so was her top nothing but talk he got back in the cadillac petra radioed stahl im going to stay behind and check her out you continue at pm as i left to pick up allison at her office the phone rang i decided to let the service pick up but as i drove my cell phone beeped milo said im on my way to pasadena got a panic call from kippers girlfriend stephanie cranner kipper knocked her around pretty badly then took some pills i d pasadena pd but i wanna go over there myself she seemed like a nice kid here we go good freeways nice and clear heres the latest on the main stuff my baby ds came through i had them go over every single name on the levitch invitation list call each invitee make sure they were actually there turns out one couple old folks from san gabriel couldnt make it and gave their tickets away guess what theyre on the board of charter college and pals of mr and mrs william trueblood shull got the tickets whod he go with no one only one ticket was used its not proof positive shull was actually there he could always claim he gave the ticket away too but it was enough along with my assurances that were highly likely to pull a dna match to the hairs on mehrabian to nudge judge foreman into granting me a limited warrant for shulls house after im through in pasadena im driving out to foremans house after that we converge on faithful scrivener foreman lives out in porter ranch so im figuring at least three four hours before everythings in place wheres shull now last time i talked to petra he was still home but that was hours ago the plans for an earlymorning surprise say am if he night crawls stahl and petra tail and we take the house if hes home we all party how limited is the warrant ive requested permission to confiscate all written materials as well as personal belongings of victims low e guitar strings and weapons reason im calling is i want to know if youve got any other suggestions before i complete the application audio and videotapes i said sketch pads drawings paintings any medium in which shull might express himself youre saying he recreates the killings theres a good chance he does okay he said thanks this is good im up for it time to give him a bad review as i neared montana street the cell beeped again this time i ignored it thinking what a beautiful night it was wondering what allison would be wearing slow night a couple of driveby trawlers no takers and some of the women were lounging in the shadows smoking petra left her accord two blocks down continued on foot found a vantage point near some garbage bins outside a toy warehouse and watched for a while the air stank of vinyl and fuel every so often jumbo jets roared overhead assaulting the sky she took her mm out of her purse and transferred it to the lightweight mesh holster that rode her hip concealed by a loose black jacket richard tyler markdown a real bargain way too nice for this kind of thing but the way her life had been going a bit of couture was her sole link to civilization what would tyler think seeing his duds on prostie avenue she decided to make her move walked toward the hookers aiming for nonchalance but feeling the chill of anxiety as she passed the first two women both black they dangled their cigarettes and stared one said hey sister you like to munch giggles cause i ready for anything petra continued walking one of the women called out you aint even thinking of setting up here skinnylegs cause this is private property and you dressed for beverly hills more laughter but an edge to it someone with a high nasal voice said privates property receptive audience for the wisecrack petra looked for the comedian a big smirk said it was her quarry the stocky brunette white girl in the red vinyl ensemble smiling at petra petra smiled back and the woman cocked a hip the hot pants were tight ruby sausage casing for flaccid pale flesh the womans face was broad coarse appeared well beyond middle age though petra guessed her age as late twenties hey she said red vinyl said what can i do for you petra smiled again and the womans hands balled what you lookin at petra stepped close flashed the badge the woman said so i want to talk to you talks by the hour here or at the office said petra your choice for whut for your safety checking to see that none of the other hookers had inched closer and keeping her eye on the brunette petra produced a business card and her penlight and directed a beam on the small print the prostitute turned her head refused to read petra said take a look red vinyl finally complied lips moving laboriously home hom icide someone got killed a jet killed the silence then staccato clatter as the other hookers hurried over they crowded around petra but she felt safe they were scared whusup said someone petra said that guy who was just here in the gray cadillac oh him said red vinyl you know him he bad he never been bad to me i never liked him said one of the black women he dont go for you said red vinyl shaking her bosoms prostiepride but forced petra said whats his thing whatd he do insisted red vinyl petra smiled red vinyl said you dont need to do that do what said petra smile like that its freaky she drew the woman aside wrote down the undoubtedly phony name printed on an impressively statesealed bogus california id alexis gallant alleged address in westchester all gallant could or would tell her was that a gordon shull was a somewhatregular customer with mundane sexual tastes one to three times a month oral sex no kinky demands no complications he takes a little long but big deal if they were all like him my life would be easy petra shook her head what gallant protested you aint tellin me nothin and what i know is he likes to be blowed what about the girl who was murdered around here a while back shaneen that was a pimp thing my colleagues say she and her pimp got along your colleagues got they heads up they asses and thats all im sayin suit yourself alexis but mr caddys bad news you say why you being stubborn alexis the woman mumbled something whats that it aint easy makin a livin aint that the truth said petra stahl followed the cadillac to the street where kevin drummonds car had been abandoned a gordon shull parked but kept his engine idling got out of his car raised his arms to the sky and stretched stahl heard something sickening shull howling at the moon waving a fist as he did it starring in his own private movie stahls hands were cool on the steering wheel just the two of them so easy he sat there and shull shook his head like a wet dog returned to the cadillac continued another five blocks west to a selfstorage unit the sign said twentyfourhour access but shull just slowed down didnt stop stahl made a note of the address as the cadillac put on speed zipped another half mile then took a sidestreet route that forced stahl to cut his lights again they emerged on howard hughes boulevard where shull switched direction yet again north back toward the city back to venice where shull once again drove west on rose asshole was on a memoryjog what memories were here back to the walkway again had shull done someone here but this time instead of continuing to the end of the road the cadillac swung a right onto a side street rennie dark block of onestory bungalows and tiny houses shull cruised up down up down stahl wanted to follow but the narrow quiet street made it way too risky he remained on rose close enough to the corner to follow shulls headlights taillights back and forth the memory of the howl reverbed in stahls head bastard saw himself as a big bad predator allison was waiting for me outside her office black suit orange scarf her hair was tied up in a chignon she got into the car before i could come around and open the door before the dome light switched off i saw that the suit was actually dark green great color black emerald glad you like it i bought it for tonight she pecked my cheek you hungry im famished the bel air dining rooms one of those places that can be nearly full but still quiet irish coffee for her gin and tonic for me the complimentary ramekins of soup then salad rack of lamb dover sole a bottle of pinot grigio a real waiter not a prettyface biding time till the next big break a man i recognized one of the salvadoran busboys whod earned his way up doing the job well wed made it to dessert when he approached the table looking pained sorry doctor theres a call for you who your answering service they insist i used the phone in the bar the operator said this is june im sorry to bother you dr delaware but this guy keeps on calling claims its urgent he sounds pretty agitated so i figured the phone ring id ignored in the car detective sturgis no a mr tim plachette did i do right sure i said wondering put him through tim said where is she robin who else he was talking loud nearly shouting and his gorgeous voice had lost its silk i have no idea tim dont screw with me alex last i heard she was in san francisco with you pause youd better be leveling with me im out to dinner tim im going to hang up now no he shouted please i took a deep breath he said im sorry i assumed it was logical what was robin being with you she left this morning we had a fight i figured shed run back to you im sorry where is she if i knew id tell you tim if you asked me what the fight was about i couldnt tell you one minute we were getting along and the next my fault i was too damn busy didnt pay her enough attention this lousy show im sure youll work it out tim you didnt i let that ride sorry he said im being a total asshole im really sorry its just that she was so angry with me i assumed she went back because the truth is she still feels for you alex its something ive been dealing with its not easy you have nothing to worry about i said im having dinner with another woman someone ive been seeing for a while the psychologist robin told me she talks about you more than she realizes tries be casual about it im willing to put up with it if its just a matter of time i really love her alex shes a great woman she is she is goddamn if shes not with you where the hell is she her flight got in at five i gave her an hour and a half to get home called got no answer called again kept calling try her friend debby in san diego i did she hasnt heard from robin either she probably just needs time by herself i said feeling my stomach knot i know i know okay ill keep trying listen thanks alex sorry for being such a moron i shouldnt have presumed dont worry about it i said easier said than done when i got back to the table allison said you look like you just handled a crisis i suppose i did anything youd care to talk about my mind was racing and shutting her out seemed wrong i recounted tims call nice of you to calm him down she said thats me father teresa she sidled over showed me the dessert menu whatever youre in the mood for i said allison said too full for dessert no im just not picky okay then chocolate or nonchocolate whatever you know she said im pretty full no lets go for it she shook her head i changed my mind its getting late ive spoiled it not at all baby chocolate i said she patted her tummy i really am full please call for the check and then lets drive to venice what youre worried she said im sure its nothing she probably doesnt want to take his call but lets make sure and set your mind at ease i stared at her its okay she said some date its been more than dating for a while we left the hotel allison was smart and perceptive enough to know id been concerned but i hadnt told her the extent of it the nagging sickening chain of thought set off by tims call china and baby boy two victims robin had worked for the breakin only cheapie electrics stolen except for baby boys acoustic shull fancied himself a guitarist the instruments were ideal trophies and robin had just gotten some nice publicity the guitar player profile gp was a specialty magazine but just the kind of thing shull with his selfimage as a musician an insider an arbiter of art might be likely to read i sped to venice allison switched on the radio tuned the music low pretended to listen leaving me to my thoughts something shull had said when id interviewed him in his office came back to me for some reason your names familiar soon after id asked shull if hed noticed any change in kevin drummonds writing style how so he seems to have gone from simple and direct to wordy and pretentious id had no idea at the time but that had been a direct assault upon shulls massive ego and shull didnt respond well to deflation how had he taken it calm smiling an awshucks smileouch on the contrary the little i saw of kevins development seemed to indicate improvement then hed dismissed me a pathologically jealous psychopath and id slapped him across the face for some reason your names familiar from time to time i made the papers not in any big way just a bit player in crime stories some psychopaths followed crime pieces had shull was his memory good enough to pounce upon my name then i got it baby boys cd a record shull was likely to own researching his quarry i pictured him listening to the disc repeatedly poring over the liner notes drinking in the details milo a casual listener had come across robins name and mine in the smallprint credits shull wouldve been sure to see it baby boy thanking the beautiful guitar lady for keeping his instruments in fine shape thanking dr alex delaware for keeping the guitar lady happy all those pictures of robin in the magazine the adulation rising star i told it all to allison overactive imagination huh its a spooky case youre entitled lets call her now maybe shes in and thatll be that i used the cell no answer tried milos desk away a machine answered his cell number then i remembered he was out in porter ranch with the judge angling for a signature on a warrant application i phoned the hollywood station petra was out too i didnt have her cell allison said you can put on some speed robins street was quiet dark little houses tucked in and put to bed lots of parked cars the brine of the ocean there i said her trucks in the driveway you were right shes not taking calls her lights are on everything looks fine if you want to check on her its okay said allison what is this the bond of sisterhood hardly i dont know her dont even know if id like her this is for you my dear if anythings going to keep you up tonight i want it to be me youre okay waiting sure she said big grin or i can get out and flaunt my jimmy choos and my blackemerald hoohah as i looked for a parking space she said ill bet shes beautiful id rather talk about you that means shes beautiful oh well allison yeah yeah she laughed theres a space right behind that cadillac i started to tell her something to this day i dont remember what a scream cut me short i left the seville in the middle of the road doubleparked blocking the cadillac jumping out i ran to robins house up the pathway the screams continued louder when i reached the door no no stop who are you whoareyou stop stop i shouldered the door but it swung open and i lost my balance tumbled caught myself on my palms shot up continued running dark house but for a triangle of light up the hall to the left the studio the screams i rushed in nearly tripped over a man on the floor black clothes facedown blood pooling beneath him robin was crouched at the far end up against the wall holding her hands out protectively she saw me pointed to the left a man in black came from around the door advanced on her wielding a knife big kitchen knife one of robins i recognized it id bought the set she screamed he kept coming ski mask over a black sweatshirt and nylon pants benetton logo on the shirt the things you notice something in robins eyes made him whirl he took a halfsecond to decide charged me slashing i jumped back as robin lunged for her worktable picked something up wrapped both hands around it and lunged for him a chisel she missed lost her grip the tool clattered out of reach he glanced at it but not long enough to give me an advantage returned his attention to me played with the knife i danced away from the blades tiny arcs robin got hold of something else i looked for a weapon too far from the bench a few feet away a couple of guitars in disrepair were propped in stands robin screamed again and his head moved back involuntarily he saw the hammer in her grip moved on her changed his mind and returned back to me then her me her predator pick off the small ones he charged her running full force the knife arm extended robin threw the hammer at him missed dropped to the ground rolled under the workbench he bent his knees reached under got hold of her hand slashed missed lost his grip she scooted toward the center of the bench i got hold of his free arm he tried to shake me off couldnt wheeled and faced me and drew me close facetoface the embrace i broke free made a grab for one of the guitars mexicanmade strat a cheap one solid ash body i swung it like a bat and hit him full face his knees gave way he went down on his back the knife flew through the air right at me i dodged it and it hit the floor skittered away he stayed down lying still one leg curled beneath his body white filled the eyeholes of the ski mask his breathing was rapid and steady i peeled back the mask felt the fabric snag on whiskers gordon shulls rugged face looked as if hed kissed a lawn mower a small voice behind me said who is he robin shaking teeth chattering i wanted to hold her but couldnt shull had begun to stir and moan he bore my full attention i searched for the knife found it purpling of the steel blade snapped my attention at the wounded man id jumped over when i came in kevin drummond a twoman game how had robin gotten the best of him his chest was inert the blood pool had widened oh my god we have to help him said robin i thought that was curious said call she ran out and i went to examine drummond dark hair no mask faint pulse in his neck i rolled his head carefully not drummond eric stahl the blood beneath him was copious rich red syrupy his skin was taking on that greengray cast i ripped off my coat and set it gently beneath the wound i saw no signs of respiration but his pulse was still going i said keep going eric youre doing great because you never know what they hear several feet away shull stirred again his bent leg quivered i jumped to my feet just as allison appeared in the doorway hes the bad guy i said this ones a cop robins calling make sure shes okay shes on the phone with them right now shes doing fine she walked in carefully stepping around the blood on her deep green jimmy choos little chrome friend in her hand cool unwavering appraisal in her blue eyes not afraid annoyed shull groaned and flexed his right hand his eyes opened allison was at his side in a flash shull tried to punch her but his fingers refused to clench hers didnt she hit his arm hard pressed the barrel of the gun against his temple you need to be quiet or ill shoot you she said in the calm voice of a therapist petra hung out in the icu observation area doing nothing the closest shed gotten to eric was looking at him through the glass wall no new information since an hour ago when the trauma surgeon a goodlooking guy named lavigne who looked like a tv doctor had told her hell probably make it probably hes not in imminent danger right now but with abdominal wounds you never know the key is preventing infection theres also the blood loss hes almost been totally replaced he was in shock out could go in again thanks she said something in her tone made lavigne frown im being honest only way to be she turned her back on him shortly after that milo came by with rick and he used his md credentials to read the chart confer with the staff behind closed doors he came out looking doctorly and said no promises but my instinct is hell pull through great said petra drained weak useless guilty thinking hope your instincts are worth a damn when she stepped out into the waiting room the only other person there was a blond woman in her midthirties sitting in a corner with a copy of elle wearing a tight black ribbed turtleneck equally snug white jeans highheeled sandals pink toenails this one had it all the hair the chest a onceflawless face now only terrific dress for distress she and petra exchanged glances then petra sat down and the woman said excuse me are you a police person yes maam the woman stood and walked over petra recognized her fragrance bal a versailles lots of it pink nails too a lighter pearlescent shade she wrung her hands nonstop can i help you im a i know eri detective stahl the hospital called me because he had my number on a piece of paper in his pocket and they the woman trailed off petra stood and extended her hand petra connor kathy magary is he all right hes doing better kathy magary let out a long whiff of spearmint breath thank goodness you and eric are friends more like acquaintances magary was blushing i mean we just met thats why he had my number you know stahl you don juan may you live long enough to keep surprising me petra said sure magary said i mean i didnt know if i should come over but they called me i felt kind of an obligation eric needs friends said petra the woman seemed confused given the circumstances that seemed the appropriate state of mind i do hope he gets okay hes a nice guy he is what exactly happened eric was involved in a police incident said petra apprehending a suspect he got stabbed in the abdomen magarys hand flew to her perfect mouth omigod all they told me is he was hurt and then when i got here they said i couldnt go inside pointing to the icu door i guess you got in because youre a police person im his partner said petra oh magarys eyes got wet im so so sorry hes going to be all right said petra with phony confidence magary relaxed and smiled thats great maybe thought petra i picked the wrong career theres always telemarketing magary said i guess ill go now think its okay if i come back tomorrow maybe hell be better and i can go in there its more than okay kathy like i said he needs all the support he can get something about that knocked magary down a notch its still real bad isnt it even though hes going to make it he incurred a serious injury hes getting really good care good said magary the only doctor i know is my orthopedist im a dancer ah said petra well said magary ill be going ill come back tomorrow if eric wakes up tell him i was here she kissed her fingertips waved them at the icu door smiled at petra and sashayed down the hall shortly after that petra spotted dr lavigne exit an elevator talking to two grayhaired people the three of them stopped and continued their conversation out of her earshot the man was in his sixties short slight wore a brown sport coat a white shirt under a tan sweater and pressed beige slacks gray crew cut steelrimmed glasses the woman was tiny maybe five feet tall also slender blue sweater gray slacks lavigne said something that made both of them nod they followed him past petra into the icu lavigne emerged a half hour later ignoring petra as he hurried by a quarter hour after that the grayhaired couple came out petra had been slumped in a horrid orange naughahyde chair that squeaked every time she exhaled trying to chase away her thoughts by reading a magazine the words might as well have been swahili the woman said detective connor petra stood were erics parents this is the reverend stahl and im mary bob said her husband petra reached for mary stahls hand covered it with both of hers im so sorry maam they say hell be all right reverend bob stahl said well be praying we sure will said petra how did it happen mary stahl asked her if you know what i know said petra is that your sons a hero what she thought was it didnt need to happen stahl had stopped calling in an hour before the confrontation with shull shed tried reaching him twice on the tac band but couldnt get through meaning hed ignored her or switched off his radio why she sat with bob and mary stahl for over an hour before the answer took shape learning they lived in camarillo where eric had grown up a short drive from the beach eric had been a good student lettered in baseball and track loved junk food played the trumpet surfed on weekends so her initial guess hadnt been that off after all she suppressed a smile suppressing wasnt hard thinking of eric lying there his abdomen stitched from sternum to navel shulls blade had ravaged his intestines missed the diaphragm by millimeters mary stahl said erics always been a good boy never a lick of trouble never bob agreed almost too good if you know what i mean petra urged them on with a smile mary stahl said i wouldnt say that dear youre right said reverend bob but you know what i mean to petra the pk syndrome preachers kids its hard for them keeping up the image or thinking they need to we never pressured eric were presbyterian as if that explained it petra nodded reverend bob said still some kids feel the pressure my other son did put himself under serious pressure and sowed some wild oats hes a lawyer now steve lives on long island said mary stahl works at a big firm in manhattan hell be flying in tomorrow he and eric used to surf together eric never seemed to be bothered by the pressure said her husband really easygoing i used to joke that hed better get upset about something or he wouldnt have any blood pressure mary stahl burst into tears petra sat there as reverend bob comforted her pardon me she said when she recovered her composure nothing to pardon dear eric needs me to be strong i dont like making a scene petra smiled smiling seemed the only damn thing she could do she hoped it came across real because it sure didnt feel real mary stahl smiled back cried some more said a few years ago erics life changed mary said bob shes his partner dear she should know bobs eyes flickered behind his trifocals yes youre right mary sighed touched her hair sat back became rigid again eric used to have a family detective connor back when he was in the army in special forces a wife and two children heather danny and dawn danny was five and dawn was two and a half they were all living in riyadh saudi arabia eric was assigned to the american embassy he never really told us for what its like that in special forces you cant talk about what you do of course not they killed his family said mary one of the royal family cousins in a fast car a ferrari heather was walking the children in a stroller on a main street near a big shopping mall this person came speeding through and hit them and they were all killed my god said petra our grandchildren said mary reverend bob said on top of the trauma what bothered eric was the way the government our government treated him the killer was never punished the saudis claimed heather had been jaywalking it was her fault the saudis offered eric a cash payment one hundred fifty thousand dollars fifty thousand for each life said mary bob said eric turned to the army and the embassy for support he wanted prosecution the army and the state department told him to accept the money in the national interest eric resigned said mary he was different after that i can understand that said petra i wish hed talked about it said mary to me his father anyone before that he could always talk we had an open family or at least i thought so she shook her head bob said we did darling something of that magnitude you cant prepare for youve been working with him how long mary asked petra a few months ill bet he doesnt talk much does he no maam petra flashed on something the stricken look in erics eyes after the interview with uncle randolph drummond eric had taken an instant dislike to the man a drunk whod crashed and killed his family mary stahl said now this i dont know what this is going to do to him hell heal up said bob who knows maybe this will get him to open up maybe said mary doubtfully the main thing right now is that he heals up dear he gets so depressed said mary weve got to do something to petra are you a mother no maam maybe one day said mary maybe one day youll know she stayed with the stahls for another three hours day broke and the parents left for an hour to make personal calls petra entered the icu a nurse said hes doing a lot better detective amazingly better actually vitals are good temperatures just slightly elevated he mustve been in really great shape yup said petra cops said the nurse we love you guys hate when this happens petra said thanks can i go in the nurse glanced through the glass sure but gown up and ill show you how to wash your hands clad in a yellow paper gown she approached erics bed he was draped from neck to toe tip connected to multiple iv lines and catheters backed by a bank of hightech gizmos eyes closed mouth slightly parted oxygen tubes running up his nose so vulnerable young with the gut wound obscured he looked okay if you blanked out the apparatus he could be sleeping peacefully she placed a gloved hand on his fingers his color was better still pale pale was his normal state but none of that creepy green around the edges you had an adventure she whispered eric kept breathing evenly his vitals remained steady no dramatic movieoftheweek response to the sound of her voice he couldnt hear her which was fine not a badlooking guy when you got past his personality shed thought him weird now she knew him as another victim life was like a prism what you saw depended on how you turned the glass his mother described him as depressed sometimes depressed people duked it out with the police wanting to end it all but lacking the courage and hoping to force the polices hand suicide by cop they called it had eric chosen suicide by perp experienced guy like that all that special forces experience how had he ended up getting shanked by a ninny like shull it made you wonder she looked down at him not a badlooking guy at all kind of handsome really she tried to picture him younger tan easygoing as he rode the waves eric she said youre going to pull out of this no response just like when they rode together petra stroked his fingers feeling warmth through the latex of her gloves you are definitely going to pull though detective stahl and then you and i are going to talk allison and i were naked on her bed my left hand rested on the nape of her neck her nails grazed my arm she released a long exhalation freed herself slipped under the covers lifting her hair above her head she knotted it loosely hows robin doing better good could you hand me that water please sure thank you moments ago wed been lost in each other now we were having a civilized conversation i said robins on your mind im not preoccupied with her i feel for her she drank water placed the glass down carefully darling eventually youre going to have to deal with it with what saving her what it means to her tims with her shes getting support id stopped by the house in venice two days ago tim had met me at the door wanting to say something the words had frozen in his throat vocal guru struck mute he clasped my hand shook it hard walked out leaving robin and me alone in the living room strange to see her just sitting there as long as id known her shed had trouble doing nothing she accepted a hug thanked me told me she was okay i agreed that she was both of us getting through the moment i stayed for a while then left allison said im not talking about support darling i said the way i see it i didnt save her far from it tims the hero his call got the ball rolling i didnt even answer the first time he tried to reach me and if it wasnt for you who knows if id have followed through if not for me youd have been there sooner she smiled what a group effort she said thats how you see it i got up on my elbow is this the best time to have this discussion what better time tonight i said i was thinking more of a romantic evening to my mind honestys part of romance she said at least a bit of it she rolled toward me took my face in her hands kissed my lips id better not argue i said woman with a gun and all that she smiled again lay back down got up on her elbows kissed me in a new way an ironic tale for when they write my biography said milo finishing his sandwich i get my warrant am feeling like an ace and the show goes on without me shulls mommy hired a good lawyer i said it aint over till its over true he said wiping his face the sandwich was a doityourself project turkey and steak and cold meatballs and whatever vegetables hed found in my fridge stuffed between slabs of handcut rye big enough to require a building permit still he said i confess to optimism theres a switch you see alex i am open to change you are indeed he folded his napkin it kills me that i missed it nothing like catching one in the act in twenty years i can count the times the act had been robin i said nothing stahls doing better he said rick says hell definitely live guys lucky and stupid going oneonone with shull no call for backup petra says his explanation is everything happened too fast thank god he was there to slow shull down thank god you were there i owe that to allison thinking robin owes tim and allison thinking life is complicated hows robin doing he said shes coping he played with his napkin i went by to see her right after she looked pretty numb i got up and poured myself a cup of coffee anyway said milo this morning stahl talked a bit more to petra not a word about getting stabbed and she didnt want to stress him what he was anxious to tell her was that before shull drove to robins he headed for a vacant lot in inglewood not far from where kevins car was found we found the place dispatched a couple of cadaver dogs and they went nuts couple of hours ago we dug up some bones techies are headed over to encino right now to get dental records on kevin sad i said yeah he worked on his sandwich took a breath we went through shulls place with the proverbial teeny little comb great big house for one guy all this old expensive furniture he got from mommy but he lived liked a pig didnt take care of anything he had a camera hooked up to remote took photos of himself and hung them all over the place all dudded up posed like some ralph lauren sophisticate but there was rotten food and roaches on the floor we found all the good stuff in a basement storage roomcombowine cellar shull kept a nice collection of vintage reds there from the empties all over the floor looks like he sampled frequently along with copious amounts of happy powder he tapped the side of his nose pills too pharmaceuticals some still with hospital tags so you were right about that he knew the area where he picked up erna because he bought medical dope what was ernas role i said i thought youd tell me im not sure well ever know my best guess is he thought of her as his crazy cousin who he could use exploited her instability her love of art we know he expropriated her name for bylines that allowed him to cover his tracks in case the articles were connected to the victims he probably figured erna would be too incoherent to do any damage if she was ever linked to the byline eventually he changed his mind and killed her i think he also used her as a red herring he said sending her over to the gallery and maybe to other sites too figuring people would notice her get sidetracked and he could skulk around check out the scene which is exactly what happened except that it backfired because looking into ernas death is what finally connected us to him bestlaid plans of psychopaths and all that he unfolded the napkin patted it flat put it aside youre probably right his main motivation was fooling with ernas head for the fun of it like he did with kevin drummond pretending to mentor the kid helping to finance grooverat so he could keep kevin delusional about his chances as a publisher meanwhile shull had an outlet for his own crappy articles again with his tracks covered this making sense to you perfect sense i said and once again he got too cute having kevin call petra for details on baby boy he probably told kevin it would be great material for a followup piece unless kevin was in on the killings and the call was for his pleasure too so far we havent turned up a shred indicating kevin was anything but a dupe unless we do he remains a victim give his parents at least a little comfort he got up paced the kitchen shull saw himself as a cut above but hes nothing but a cookiecutter power freak before he made his move on robin he spent hours driving around revisited the snake pit szabo and lohs place the marina where he dumped mehrabian snacking on memories working up the arousal one thing does puzzle me though he changed his technique up until robin he did the smooth bit walking up friendly slipping the knife in doing it in public places taking risks with robin its like he regressed covert breakin blitz attack which is probably what he did to angelique bernet any idea why he wouldve preferred the smooth bit i said being subtle and dramatic meshed with his sense of theater he probably decided to be cautious because of my questions about kevin he didnt feel threatened enough to stop but he knew we were getting closer guess so he said
