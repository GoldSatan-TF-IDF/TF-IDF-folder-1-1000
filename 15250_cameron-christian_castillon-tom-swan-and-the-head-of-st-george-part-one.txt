tom swan and the head of st george part one castillon christian cameron foreword theres something very historical about writing an historical serial for epublication if its been done recently i havent heard about it and yet it has impeccable historical credentials before we had the epub we had the magazine and in that format dumas did it and conan doyle and a host of other authors with magnificent credentials harriet beecher stowe for example and charles dickens its a fine format instead of a single pulse of seven hundred manuscript pages the author can write in blocks with independent storylines that may still have an arc and a complex interweb of characters and motivations i was resistant but not for long so here is tom swan my first serial character tom is firmly based in history italy was full of itinerant englishmen especially soldiers throughout the period and so was greece i confess that the man who forms the basis for the character was not english but italian cyriac of ancona sometimes known as the grandfather of archaeology who roved the levant in search of antiquities and manuscripts that he could beg borrow or steal for the pope and other rich clients in their burning zeal to rediscover the ancient world ancient manuscripts were then and remain incredibly valuable recent rediscovery of a complete text of archimedes in a palimpsest shows that such manuscripts are still out there and give us an idea of the kind of treasures for which tom swan and cyriac of ancona searched if this serial has some success ill write more the format as i say is fun and allows me to explore some nooks and crannies of history and even some characters that id love to take to greater depth philokles in the tyrant series archilogos arimnestoss ionian adversary in the long war series geoffrey de charny in the late middle ages the list goes on and on and ill add pieces rapidly perhaps even one a month readers of my other books are aware that im a passionate reenactor and also a military veteran and that these experiences inform my writing those who are new to me deserve the following reassurance ive worn the clothes and armour and shot the bows and rowed and even ridden some of the horses in the process of working as an intelligence professional i met people who exercise real power every day and i got an idea of how they work and how history works but i dont do this in a vacuum and i receive an amazing level of support from friends fellow reenactors veterans academics crafts people and artists in those last categories id like to thank dario wielec who drew the illustrations he has a passion for historical detail that delights me every time i see his drawings from any period and you can see more of his stuff at httpdariocaballerosblogspotca finally the covers for the tom swan series are provided by albion swords who are to me the premier manufacturers of accurate replica swords in north america i use their products every day how many people can say that about swords chris cameron toronto june tom swan part one castillon for good or ill thomas swan had been one of the first men into the french gun positions and one of the last to be taken so he was on the right of the line of captives as the bloodmaddened crowd of peasants and foot soldiers killed englishmen swan was too tired to struggle he thought about it by the time hed watched them kill a couple of menatarms worth far more than he was worth he realised that they were all going to die he took a breath and wondered somewhat idly how many he had left a frenchwoman killed an archer by cutting off his penis with an eating knife the archer screamed utterly wretched and the crowd cheered her swan took another breath it was his first battle his first campaign in france his first time out of london but hed heard enough from his mothers brothers to guess why the frenchwoman had killed the archer a big man a really big man shouted at the french mob in french swans french was quite good the man didnt even sound english he heckled them and when two french gunners came for him he picked one up the man stabbed at him with a long knife the big man shrugged after the frenchman put a knife in him and threw him into the crowd off to the right was a party of men on horseback they were pushing through the line of wagons that guarded the back of the gun emplacement the big man was still fighting the frenchmen had scattered and one was loading a handgun another aimed a crossbow and pulled the lever but his aim was poor and the arrow killed a third frenchman a francarcher at the edge of the crowd swan felt the frenchman behind him shift his weight and hunched for the blow he couldnt help it he thought of twenty wrestling tricks his uncles had taught him to take the mans sword but he could barely raise his arm hed fought talbot was dead it was all unbelievable he thought damn it im here to make my fortune im only eighteen he took another breath and waited to die the horsemen pressed into the crowd swords drawn armoured knights and a cardinal swan knew what the round red hat meant two francsarchers grabbed an english archer tore his shirt and then beheaded him in three gory strokes of their short swords the knights did nothing to stop it and swans hopes died the crowd bayed like a hunting pack and pushed towards the latest killing and the cardinal was almost unhorsed he shouted at them and the crowd moved again two of the knights pulled their horses up on either side of him protecting him the nearer of the french knights reached out and cut a french soldier with his sword the man flinched away swan pushed through his despair it couldnt hurt it might even help kyrie eleison pater kyrie agie pater he shouted in greek all that learning ought to be good for something the cardinals head snapped around his eyes searching a frenchmans fist crashed into swans head he stumbled now and in the hour of our death amen he was hit again fell to the earth and thomas swan awoke to crisp linen sheets and light his whole body hurt good christ i im alive he said aloud and felt like an idiot but he was very much alive certain parts were insisting they were alive he looked around there were palettes laid on a wooden floor and whitewashed walls a monastery then one of the english devils is moving said a womans voice in french a burly monk appeared with a staff swan bowed he was naked which put him at a disadvantage tom swan at your service he said then switching languages he said serviteur in good gascon french the monk pointed one end of the staff at swan and called help help it might have been funny except for the real possibility he was about to be killed swan bowed again my interests are entirely in food friends he said other men on palettes of straw and clean sheets were stirring swan had to assume that the big man in the bandages was the fleming who had fought the frenchmen the man wasnt moving he had one arm out over his sheet and that arm was covered in massive bruises he counted sixteen sixteen men good christ he said the burly monk continued to threaten ineptly with the butt of the staff he shouted for help again and there were distant footsteps a slim man older but with angelic blond hair and a less than angelic face appeared from behind the monk you are the barbarian who speaks greek he asked its difficult to appear dominant or even charming when you are naked and covered in dried blood and bruises swan shrugged greek french italian english latin he smiled in what he hoped was an ingratiating manner because he really wanted to live the blond man nodded come with me then he said in latin swan spread his hands as if to indicate his nudity the blond man was dressed foppishly like an italian tight hose tight short jacket a tiny hat perched on his curls he had a very effective sneer his eminence has seen a naked man before he said perhaps not as gamy as you but still move the fop drew a dagger from behind his back swan considered the possibility of taking the mans weapon and running he didnt have the boneweary feeling of defeat his joints ached he had bruises but he could fight the slim blond man looked as if he knew what he was about he kept his empty hand between them and the dagger well back swan walked along the brightly lit corridor a nun saw him and turned her back then she moved quickly down the corridor and shouted ahead that a naked man was coming she turned back and looked at him and spat he almost laughed he took a deep breath they were at a closed door the thin man stepped out of the way if you do anything i do not like ill put this in your arse he said flicking the point of the dagger from side to side understand englishman swan nodded say something in greek for me the man said his grin wasnt friendly oinos o phili pais swan said he smiled eh the other man said not the way greeks say it but still in you go swan was ushered through the door every monastery has a room for receiving rich or noble visitors panelled in wood lined in tapestries sometimes with precious silver and gold in a cupboard carved with lives of the saints this house of god was no exception except that the cupboard had no carved doors and no silver the cardinal was sitting in the sun swan shrugged id like something to wear he said your eminence the cardinal nodded you speak greek he asked yes swan answered in french what in heavens name suggested that you should call out to me in greek the cardinal asked swan fingered his beard and tried to think youre a cardinal he said from italy the cardinal raised both eyebrows people in italy study things in greek my greek master was italian swan was suddenly babbling my sword master was italian too but the cardinal barked a sharp laugh as it happens i am greek he said swan took a deep breath racked his brain for the greek for to save σας ευχαριστώ που με έσωσες αγιότητα σας thank you for saving me eminence i am very pleased to have saved such a young scholar are you hmm someone important worth a fine ransom it occurred to swan to tell the truth but he couldnt risk it oh yes he said my father will pay a thousand ducats for me the cardinal nodded i told alessandro you were a noblemans son he doubted me a thousand ducats excellent ill see you well lodged then im going to paris do you have friends in paris swan shrugged i had hoped to go to the sorbonne he said it didnt work out do you read hebrew asked the cardinal swan had to shake his head no he said with real regret have you read plato asked the cardinal my greek master had a copy of aristotles de anima and xenophons apologia thats really all ive read it was an astounding piece of truth for swan but bessarion was difficult to lie to youll enjoy paris the cardinal said and waved his hand as swan turned to leave he said dont do anything hasty this place was burned by the english some of the nuns were raped all the silver taken yes you understand they would like to kill you outside the door the thin blond looked him up and down ill find you clothes he said he sneered but youre not worth a copper centivo much less a thousand venetian ducats are you swan raised an eyebrow i most certainly am he said eh said the italian well see back in the cells where the men lay on palettes they were waking up there were a dozen francsarchers in the corridor eyeing the nuns the nuns glared at him with unconcealed hate one of the frenchmen tripped him as he went by he went down and rolled avoiding another kick the italian punched the frenchman in the ear so fast that swan was very glad indeed he hadnt grabbed for the dagger the punch went in uncontested and the archer fell and his legs kicked once my prisoner the italian said in french his dagger was out again and he gestured with it dont make me hurt any of you the frenchmen growled but they didnt do anything more do you have a servant asked the italian his eyes on the frenchmen no swan admitted and then narrowed his eyes yes he said he paused if he survived the italian looked over the men most of whom were still on their palettes one of these he asked swan reached out and pointed at the fleming who was still unconscious if hes alive the italian looked at him it was a long look eye to eye really he said the faintest sign of a smile flickered at the corner of his mouth the english devil that all the frenchmen are waiting to hang is your servant eh swan shrugged and licked his lips hes not english he said hes flemish the italian raised an eyebrow eh bien if you say i will do my best to keep him from being shorter by a head he shrugged you are clever englishman i give you this for free swan nodded sometimes he said not yesterday by god an hour later he was on a bad horse wearing a bad doublet and a foul shirt and a pair of braes that had shit stains and hose with holes in them soled hose and no shoes thomas swan had spent his life being the poorest boy among rich boys he knew what good clothes were like he just never seemed to have them the kit in which hed been sent to france was the very limit of what his mother could afford and it was gone every stitch down to his eating knife and his belt purse the fleming was head down over a mule wearing a shirt and braes and nothing else they sat mounted in the courtyard there were raised voices in the portico the cardinal was insisting that the english prisoners were not to be murdered the italian picked at his beard theyll all be dead before were at amiens he said swan took a couple of shallow breaths the italian spat dogs he said swan looked around might i have a sword he said as im a gentleman on ransom the italian looked at him a dagger swan asked he wished he had something with which to bargain the italian drew his dagger and started to clean his nails he looked up their eyes met why he asked swan shrugged oh as to that he said the italian laughed tell me your name english devil swan bowed in the saddle thomas swan esquire of london and yours the man smiled alessandro di brachio he said courtier he smiled formerly of venice and now of the world it was a very unpleasant smile he reached behind him into the leather roll behind his saddle and rooted about his hand emerged with a long slim dagger he held it out swan reached for it the italian whipped it away and tapped him on the head with the hilt swan reached for it and missed again he almost fell out of his saddle alessandro laughed well see he said and put the long dagger back in his bedroll bastard swan spat alessandro nodded yes he said when he grinned his gold tooth caught the sun and you it was such a good answer that swan had to laugh the italian laughed back you are almost as fast as a venetian he said but not quite the cardinal came out from under the portico the abbott bowed and all of the nuns came and kissed his ring along with some of the monks it seemed incongruous that under his robes the man wore boots with spurs but he did and he mounted his big warhorse easily come he said and alessandro prodded the convoy into motion four wagons a dozen soldiers and an entourage of priests and servants swan found himself riding with a pair of notaries who conversed in latin and ignored him all they spoke of was church politics and what a waste of time the attempt to negotiate with the english had been we thought wed win swan said as much to indicate that he knew what they were talking about as because he really wanted to contribute the nearer man all but fell off his pony you speak latin he asked oh swan said i thought we were speaking english the notary on his right rolled his eyes you are pleased to make light of us he said swan nodded passes the time he said why are the english such barbarians then asked the first notary war war and war you kill your own kings and then come to france to kill theirs our king is the king of france swan said automatically an untenable position said the righthand notary he held out his hand giovanni accudi he grinned my grandfather was english he said swan took the offered hand the man on the other side of him relented cesare di brescia he said im sure i had a grandfather he mocked the other and spat who the devil knows who he was the english probably killed him swan raised an eyebrow im sorry to see how unpopular the english are he said he didnt sound contrite violent people a sword in every hand killers every one of them giovanni nodded like florentines and brescians like fucking milanese cesare shot back wine giovanni asked and held out a glass flask swan drank some he tried not to be greedy messire accudi i must tell you that yesterday i thought i was about to die without ever tasting wine again accudi nodded welcome to life he said have another drink but leave some for cesare hes far more dangerous than i am fuck your mother di brescia said but he smiled listen giovannis a gentleman he doesnt even need this work im a simple working man i actually read books for my degree then why dont you know more accudi asked give me the flask if you are going to talk damn you to hell its empty you sodomite are you two sure youre not soldiers swan said oh no cesare choked out he was laughing so hard he was having trouble staying on his horse were lawyers cant you tell the sun was past high in the sky and it was brutally hot the horses were flagging the notaries had run out of wine and were debating the role of the trinity in a manner so blasphemous that swan who thought himself worldly and jaded had to ride a little behind them in a vague superstitious belief that lightning from the sky would kill them all but when theyd stopped cursing god he rode back up to them why dont we stop at an inn swan asked an inn here in france accudi laughed you english have burned them all fat lot you know swan said this is the dordogne this is english frenchmen burned all this the italians laughed its hard to tell you apart its true after a while longer some of their soldiers left the convoy and rode ahead when they crested the next ridge he saw a town in the distance fully walled closer he saw the convoys horseman talking to a farmer by the road he came and spoke to the cardinal hat in hand and kissed his ring the gate to his walled farm opened and they rode in men came with water and the horses drank noisily swan drank water too he went over to the fleming and lifted his head the man looked at him eyes open and swan felt the mans body tense im a friend he said my name is thomas swan i claimed that youre my servant he spoke low and fast the fleming moaned alessandro appeared at his elbow he is awake your servant he asked give him some water here i put a little wine in it swan took the cup and put it to the flemings lips he drank greedily and moaned again he is your master this englishman the italian asked the fleming uhh uhhh the fleming moaned there was blood coming out of his side the fleming met swans eye and just for a moment youre drowning him swan snapped trying to sound as authoritative as his father master muttered the fleming alessandro looked at swan and raised an eyebrow heh he said the next evening they came down a ridge into périgeux passed the gates after a cursory inspection and a great deal of fawning and made their way to the abbey of chancelade as swan heard said repeatedly the town didnt seem to boast an inn but the abbey was huge like a palace there were wagons parked all along one wall and the stables were full swan ate with the notaries and poured watered wine into his servant after some consideration he went to the kitchens what do you want shitstain bellowed a huge woman he bowed to be your lover madame she screeched youd need a prick two feet long she said she eyed his stained braes and i dont think you have one eh something tells me you are not a nun swan said something tells me you are not a gascon the woman replied she laughed eh tilda theres an englishman a younger horsefaced woman came out of the fireplace what do you want then she said in english swan turned his charm on her honey a goodsized dollop if you would be so kind he bowed for medicine medicine is it and honey so dear tilda had an armload of firewood i could carry wood for you he said tilda nodded you can have your honey just for hearing the sound of english spoken but i wouldnt mind having you carry the wood after he had carried enough to fill the kitchens giant maw of a fireplace many times over she pointed to a stool sit brother she said she handed him some wine which was decent enough he watched the kitchen staff and listened carefully most of them were locals a few were from the south and he saw several of the cardinals italian servants move through one pinched a girl and got a clout on the ear for his pains another grabbed a loaf of bread and laughed tilda brought him a plate of cut tongue and bread and another cup of wine tell me what medicine you make with honey she said swan smiled at her she was quite pretty in a homey kind of way she had big bones and a strong waist and large breasts she was no beauty and yet her straight back and her graceful carriage would have made her seem so even if he hadnt been on the brink of death a day before the white honey is not formed of pure thyme but is good for the eyes and for wounds according to aristotle he told her she nodded and smiled like enough she said likewise my mater always said so she sat back with her wooden cup of wine youre a prisoner he nodded sir john talbot was defeated at castillon she said its common knowledge they were killing the prisoners he said he hadnt planned to say that he planned to be light hearted or evasive or perhaps heroic he shrugged i lived the cardinal took me in she nodded poor dear but soldiers live by the sword die by the sword he laughed you have a hard heart madame she shook her head i followed the armies for a year or two dint i ive known a soldier or two she shrugged ill get some honey for you she paused as if weighing him up come back when ive served the gentles dinner and ill see your linens get washed she added her eyes met his just for a moment swan walked out to the stable he caught alessandros eye the man was obviously watching him and waved honey at him the italian manatarms came over you have a sweet tooth for my servants wounds swan said the italian nodded whats his name this servant of yours he held out a hand no never mind why complicate this whats the honey for swan shrugged its in aristotle good for wounds alessandro shook his head are you really another bookman aristotle is so full of shit about so many things he thrust his chin at the fleming lying on his blanket but my first captain put honey on wounds the turks do it lets see the italian soldier helped him fetch hot water and watched as he bathed the fleming washed his wounds dried them with the mans shirt and then pasted honey over them pushing it boldly into the suppurating hole in his side where the frenchmans dagger had gone in hell probably live alessandro said that knife hit his ribs and went up not down ill tell him that swan said his italian wasnt that good and alessandro made him feel a little light headed you ought to wrap it now that youve cleaned it and put the salve on alessandro looked at him one eye raised i dont happen to have a spare bolt of linen in my baggage swan said alessandro gave him a lopsided smile perhaps god will provide he said he swaggered out and returned a little later with a long piece of linen i found it he said swan wrapped the fleming and alessandro actually lifted the man while swan got the bandage under him he made it as tight as he dared the fleming moaned a few times but remained resolutely unconscious when they were done swan was too conscious of his sweatsoaked shirt and his shitstained braes to strip and he felt dirty and unfashionable with the dapper professional soldier but his mother had taught him that the best defence was a good offence if you keep helping me like this ill have to assume you arent a complete bastard he said alessandro smiled maybe i am though i am a bastard if i thought you meant that as an insult id kill you swan shrugged me too he said ah alissandro said swan realised hed said too much but the manatarms bowed and walked out the stable door when the italian was gone the fleming opened an eye peter he said if the bastard asks again swan dropped the end of the bandage youre awake you just rolled me over and shoved something sticky inside my fucking body the fleming said peter honey yes swan put his hand on the other mans head everything he knew about medicine was from books peter opened his eyes he was a big man with a heavy brow but his eyes held a great deal of intelligence im an archer and a fucking good one he said he said fucking as if it was two words fuck ink but i suppose i can be your servant at least until were out of this they kill everyone else swan shrugged i think so peters eyes closed and then opened thanks for saving me you saved me swan said when you went for the francsarchers i was next peter grinned kilt one didnt i oh yes swan said bring me some unwatered wine eh master peter asked swan nodded im thomas swan he said peter shut his eyes again aye got it swan ate with the notaries they had to buy wine and swan had no money and he suspected he was going to wear out his welcome eventually but for the moment he drank they were at the very last table in the hall the lowest of the gentles in fact some of the upper servants the cardinals steward for example sat above them swan didnt mind the food was cold and served on bad pewter with too much lead in it but he didnt mind that either he saw tilda at another table she didnt serve directly but directed the younger girls and boys as they waited on the tables he couldnt catch her eye she stood with her back determinedly to him that didnt bode well for clean linens or for wine for peter the two lawyers wandered off into an argument about the merits of the judicial duel again into a bit of theology so tedious that swan couldnt or wouldnt follow them and he took the chance to look around well off to his right on a dais at the head of the hall the cardinal sat with a dozen local worthies mostly men below them sat his household alessandro for example was only two tables from the prince of the church in the next row of trestles there was a crowd of french merchants mostly young men with daggers but a handful of older men in fine clothes and one importantlooking manatarms who sat proud as lucifer despite his old coat and looked angrily at the high table where as swan could see he clearly felt he belonged swan nudged cesare who are they he asked giovanni shrugged rich merchants who cares cesare shook his head merechault was the kings officer for wagons i think he will have made a packet off the campaign he looked around the manatarms no one i know the man in the blue velvet is messire marcel loustier he is a parisian wine merchant my father deals with him swan nodded do you play piquet giovanni asked only when i have money swan admitted cesare smiled wolfishly best get some money then he said swan left them to it when the florentine was up by thirty ducats they both took their gaming seriously and they were playing for sums ten times those that swan had ever played for swan used the time to learn the game and to watch the french manatarms he was plainly dressed but there were details to him that didnt go well with his old fustian arming coat and his unmatched wool hose his sword and dagger were worth a fortune plain hilted in the french style but beautiful swan fancied himself a connoisseur of swords and shoes a lifetime of sizing up a tip caused him to look at the mans shoes elegant fitted black with a narrow piping of red leather at the instep they were utterly at variance with the mans plain garments swan rose stretched and watched the young men taking down the trestle tables and moving the chairs from the dais the cardinal was long gone so were the merchants the manatarms sat and drank alone swans curiosity almost got the better of him but the possibility of clean clothes won out over the possibility of hearing stories of chivalry however genuine the man was interesting a sort of problem a challenge but not as interesting as the kitchens however it took no great daring or sleight of hand to pick a pewter cup full of wine off the sideboard and carry it out across the yard to the stable in any great hall theres always someone too rich too drunk or too stupid to remember his cup swan carried it to peter and left it by his head then he walked along the edge of the french merchants wagons no one challenged him wagons especially unattended wagons interested him almost as much as tales of war and chivalry he walked slowly along them tapping them idly with his fist he wasnt able to stop and search any of them the courtyard was far too full of monks and visitors but it was interesting that at least one wagon was empty he walked on around the back of the great central building past the herb garden and the dispensary to the back of the kitchen the heat pouring out of the kitchen was visible as ripples in the air and the summer night was hot enough to melt wax most of the trestles were now here in the back and a bagpiper was playing while a circle of men danced there was a lot of food swan smiled he walked in boldly and took a large chunk of pork he didnt even have an eating knife so he had to eat it in chunks like a dog youre really just an overgrown boy arent ye tilda said but youre a gent i saw you up there i tried to catch your eye he said you ignored me she shrugged you werent an archer were ye he shook his head too many teeth she said i should ha known you have all your teeth he said she shrugged hugged herself despite the night airs warmth but you know were here eh you know your way around a kitchen and a cook tilda smiled but it was a hesitant smile as if a wall had grown between them he smiled and nodded and you arent going to tell me any more she said a few feet away a very thin girl hit a man so hard he went down everyone laughed im a bastard son i havent a penny and ive promised the cardinal that my father will pay a thousand florins for me he shrugged its the truth he looked at her from under his eyelashes to see her reaction she was smiling a little and looking elsewhere im thomas he said thats the truth too she nodded pursed her lips and nodded again i can find you a pricker and an eating knife maybe she said i admit it i like that you sound like a gent he decided to risk telling the truth id rather have clean clothes he said she looked at him just out of the corner of her eye the way grown women look if i do your clothes youll be naked she said he tingled i could perhaps live with that if you wont sell me to the cardinal naked she asked im told its what he likes swan quipped she nodded mmm she laughed ive been a fool twicet youngling once i followed a soldier what told me hed marry me and then to atone for a life o sin i thought id work in the abbey she rolled her eyes godly people she shook her head there are some i allow and some as ought to have done what i done a heavy pottery jar of hard cider was thrust into swans hands he took a drink and handed it to tilda who drank then she took his hand hers was a curious mixture of rough and smooth it took time to get a fire lit in the laundry there were coals from the days fire but no wood in the hamper and again he was carrying wood he stopped for more cider and another slice of pork there were a hundred people dancing cesare was leaning against the cool stone of the abbey watching he put a hand on swans shoulder if you work like a servant theyll treat you like a servant he said in italian swan smiled i know he said with far too much honesty im getting clean clothes cesare smiled in understanding ah he said he looked at swan would you wash me a shirt he looked embarrassed ill cover your wine we poor men of letters have to stick together swan said he wondered if it would sound better in latin pauperes homines de litteris opus haereat iuncto he made a face opus pauperes scriptores manere simul cesare said and i agree he pulled off his doublet and his shirt and tossed swan the shirt then he pulled on his doublet over his hairy chest swan looked at the crowd of dancing servants do you know any of these people he asked cesare smiled bitterly not really when you are a lawyer you are not a gentleman and not a servant he shrugged i know the men that serve loustier but not well enough to share a cup of wine theyre most of them in the blue and red livery of the paris guilds eh see swan felt foolish i thought that they were soldiers you must have a low opinion of soldiers marechaults men are in blue and gold his wagoners are hired men so no livery we travelled with them at the tail end of winter again ive seen them before but i dont know any of the wagon men swan shrugged his theory about the french knight was dashed ill see your shirt is clean he said ill be in your debt english cesare said swan went back to the laundry it was dark except for a pair of rush lights going in the corner by the hearth strip said tilda i have an extra shirt to wash swan said tilda shrugged a womans work is never done she said the whole laundry area was hung with linens many of them religious there were chasubles and surplices and altar clothes shifts for nuns long and coarse and mens shirts and braes wouldnt it dry faster outside swan asked hed stepped between the rows to strip thieves she said we hardly ever get thieves here it does happen mind she said she emerged in front of him and pulled a shirt off the line and held it up to him it was a fine lawn shirt with embroidered cuffs hes a right bastard she said and a bad priest pity thieves took both his shirts and his braes she leaned over and kissed him on the lips hed expected or rather hoped for something of the sort but the moment of contact was lovely very exciting she vanished amidst the laundry he followed her unlace me theres a dear she said the water in the smaller copper is clean which is more than i can say of you wash jesus and the saints is that blood swan poured warm water into a shallow bowl and used a coarse cloth a dry clean coarse cloth to wash his left arm had an enormous bruise and a long cut even in the flickering rushlight it looked bad she got out of her kirtle and helped him wash the arm so you are a soldier she said he shrugged my first battle was very nearly my last she kissed him it went along nicely and then she broke off and gave him some wine then without shame she pulled her shift over her head might as well do my own while im about it she said and put all the linens in a larger copper swan was wakened by the first cockcrow he was in no hurry to leave nor was she in a hurry to be rid of him but eventually he was dressed clean by god and out the door with a clean and ironed shirt over his arm he walked back down the line of merchants wagons and again was not challenged this time the courtyard was empty and his investigations were a little more thorough he found cesare asleep and snoring peter too seemed to be sleeping the pewter cup was empty he hung the shirt on a peg for horse harness over cesares head and went back out to the courtyard to look at the wagons there were heavy tarpaulins treated with beeswax over every wagon the wagons themselves were taller than a man their sides heavily sloped outwards like fortress walls their wheels as tall as a big mans shoulders two were clearly living spaces they had tall covers and doors swan had an apple from the kitchen and he ate it while he looked them over then he went back into the stable took his two new and very pretty shirts and rolled them tightly he put a piece of coarse sacking around them tied the bundle tight and put it into one of the cardinals carts and went back to his apple he had to eye the carts with a certain regret as they prepared to ride away he was much cleaner but rest food and a bath only sharpened his annoyance at his poor clothes and illfitting soiled hose he was lucky the notaries even treated him like one of them on a lighter note peter was riding sitting up he ate porridge at breakfast and smiled at everyone like a man with a new lease on life swan caught sight of tilda in the yard she came up boldly not disowning me by light of day messire she asked for an answer he leaned down and kissed her on the mouth giovanni whistled and cesare clapped his hands swan frowned thats how we say goodbye to friends in england he said cesare rubbed his beard for the first time i want to visit england then he said are you the lady to whom i owe this beautifully clean and ironed shirt which smells a little of lavender tilda cast her eyes down and swayed back and forth like a girl you are too kind sir she said in french the cardinal came out he looked angry he wasnt wearing a red hat or a cassock he looked like an athletic man of sixty in boots and a tight jacket he spoke at length to the french knight he didnt like what he heard and finally shook his head when he was mounted he rode down the convoy to where the notaries were i need a letter he said in latin were going to be late to paris and i have work to do cesare bowed in the saddle so swan felt he should do the same giovanni reached into his wallet and took out a beautiful pair of wax tablets set in rosewood and a gold stylus at your service eminence polite opening addressed to the bishop of paris english army defeated countryside full of brigands forced to travel slowly with armed escort please send news from outside world ill bring some wine two weeks at best flowery signature bessarion giovanni nodded suddenly swan saw that cesare had also copied down the cardinals words they looked at each other an hour at least eminence said cesare alessandro rode up to the cardinals shoulder delay eminence the count insists we travel with his convoy he said the valleys ahead are full of brigands or so he claims swan thought it was worth trying his luck the convoy wont be quick he said im a passable sword leave me a weapon and ill escort these gentlemen when theyve done your letter the cardinal looked at him and for a moment swan thought the greek could read his mind he had the oddest look the slightest lift of one corner of his mouth the cardinal looked at his own manatarms who in turn looked at swan the cardinal smiled it is very kind of you my prisoner i accept alessandro find him a sword and a pair of boots brigands might not be afraid of a barefoot man on a spavined horse alessandro trotted down the column to the last wagon dismounted and rooted under the cover he was back in no time while the two scribes convinced a monk to lend them a desk and the cardinal rode to his place at the front of the column the boots were very good thigh high goatskin waxed to a deep black my spares and my secondbest sword the italian said i dont trust you but i think i might have to like you so let me be honest if you dont come back i love these boots which means i will find you and kill you for wasting my time if you do come back i will lend you both sword and boots until we get to paris he smiled it was the first real smile swan had received from the mercenary do we understand each other swan reached out and took the boots and the sword a damned good sword he was pleased to see then he held out his hand i understand you perfectly he said alessandro nodded i thought you might he said and rode away tilda watched him go what was that about she asked swan gave her a lopsided smile he thinks i may be a rogue he said tilda smiled hes sharp she swayed back and forth again i can make an hour if you dont have any other appointments swan stretched im so tired mistress i feel as if i was up all night perhaps a nap would do you good she said will you come back and visit me he grinned do you have a dozen of us out there on the roads coming in rotation she shrugged and if i do he laughed it must be honesty day lets play at napping he took her hand of course ill come back she rolled her eyes an hour later booted and wearing a sword and carrying a dirty but presentable pair of gloves that hed picked up off a sidetable in the abbey he leaned against a pillar in the stable eating another apple the two notaries came out of the scriptorum do you know how long it takes to write a formal letter between two princes of the church cesare said disgustedly about an hour swan said here have an apple messires accudi caught his in the air got a leg over his horse and stretched i have a sword of my own messire swan he said swan shrugged now i do too he said the two notaries laughed they left the abbey easily enough trotting through the outskirts of the town which was just filling with french soldiers pouring in from the south swan wasnt particularly worried about being lynched on the spot but he rode more freely once he was in the countryside to the north and east of the town and out from under the walls at noon they stopped at a roadside shrine with the lisle river flowing at their feet and ate good sausage and bread with local soft cheese swan had a good leather bottle now thanks to tilda and he shared it freely your ladyfriend provided the wine eh cesare said swan smiled and didnt answer he was watching the hills they werent steep but they rose well above the valley you look concerned giovanni said swan raised an eyebrow something shiny and of steel was on that hillside he said after lunch they rode quickly the notaries were as usual excellent company and for more than an hour all conversation degenerated into latin jokes most of them bawdy in a little hamlet of perhaps a hundred villagers swan asked the two lawyers to wait under the tree in the central square while he asked directions he rode into a walled compound he leaned down from the saddle in front of the stone house that seemed to function as the auberge have you seen a convoy of wagons he asked the man sitting on the bench maybe and maybe not the man said who are you swan shook his head and made a face no one of any importance he said but i wish to catch my master how long ago did they pass before noon hey give me a penny master the man was suddenly wheedling he got up off his bench i told you what you wanted to know swan shrugged i dont have a penny of my own friend the man glared i guess if that horse is all you have you dont have much he nodded your boots are nice swan nodded is that a professional opinion he asked he didnt order wine he backed his horse out of the yard the two italians were looking at him he waved a hand and they moved out of the village at a trot brigandi swan said and touched his heels to his horses flanks they rode for almost a mile before swan pulled up where asked cesare what are you talking about the peasant in the auberge was no peasant he was a soldier slumming wearing a peasant smock swan was watching the hillsides how do you know giovanni asked swan shrugged i cant tell you maybe that he was so bad at begging his hands were clean he had wrists like me but i cant pin it down but youre sure giovanni said yes sure enough to go back and find another way cesare asked swan looked back and forth between the two italians messires you are both older than i am he said humbly but if you will be guided by me in this you will not go back what do you propose giovanni asked that we move fast and stop for nothing we ignore mothers with wounded sons and priests who only need a moment of our time swan suited action to word and touched his bootheels to his horse which responded with a burst of what in a better horse might have been a canter the three of them rode along leaving a dust cloud for ten minutes by then swans horse was flagging and he felt like a fool he reined in perhaps you two are better without me he said nonsense giovanni said they went on at a walk swan looked behind them gentlemen ive made a number of mistakes the dust cloud he pointed behind them is like a red flag cesare winced why us he asked what brigand wants us they were climbing steadily and swan could see a long sharp slope ahead a set of rapids in the river and tall bluffs he stood in his stirrups trying to make out the path of the road the road crosses the river at a ford he said before a nun could say three paternosters they were across on the far side just where the road turned rocky as it passed over the end of the eastern ridge was a wagon it was one of the wine merchants wagons and there were four men by it they looked uncertainly at the new arrivals they were not any of the men whod been dancing the night before and none of them wore livery thirty yards away by the streambed swan saw a pool of blood and an arm sticking out of the weeds the arm was blue and red its a trap he said quietly when i attack them ride like lightning why asked giovanni cesare muttered swans horse was tired so he rode straight up to the nearest man from a few yards away he called out wheel trouble the man nodded but he didnt speak he was watching swan as a cat watches a mouse and yet he was utterly confounded when swan whipped his sword from his scabbard and cut him down with a powerful blow from above the other three men stood rooted to the spot giovanni who had a fine arab put his spurs to her and she went straight to a gallop cesare did the same but aimed his arabs head at one of the men by the wagon and rode him down swan whirled and his horse misstepped swan cursed and slid from her back ducked and moved with her a few horse lengths while the other three men shouted at each other he burst round the end of the wagon catching the man cesare had knocked down by surprise and rammed his sword into the mans gut despite his coat of plates he almost died trying to get it out the point was wedged between two plates the third man had a falchion a heavy sword like a scimitar and he cut overhand at swan an untrained blow but nevertheless a powerful one swan saw the twitch in the mans stance that heralded the blow and pulled on his hilt with a sudden burst of strength the swordpoint grated and came free and swan got his guard up and wished he had a buckler the two swords rang together the man was essentially untrained and obviously scared to death swan was scared but he did as hed been taught he pivoted his weight let the heavier sword win the bind and cut sharply down with little more than the pressure of his wrist two of the scimitarwielders fingers fell away and the man dropped his sword and screamed swan stepped in and drove his pommel into the mans mouth teeth sprayed and the wounded man was down even as the fourth man ran at him from beyond the wagon team swan plunged his sword through the body of the man writhing on the ground his mothers brothers all said you had to do it dont leave anyone behind you they said when they drilled the fourth man had a spear swan got into a low guard his knees were weak hed practised this it hadnt usually gone all that well but the spearman was no better trained than the falchion man and he thrust ineptly a tentative attack which swan beat remorselessly aside with all the energy of doubt and fear he stepped through got a hand on the shaft and killed the man with a simple cut to the neck and then cut him twice more as his body fell he stood breathing like a bellows he could hear hooves and the sounds of shouting i killed them all he was kneeling beside the last man he wanted to vomit wanted to take some action wanted to pray it was all more personal than the battle had been he watched his hands cut the mans belt and take his purse and dagger then he went to the falchion man and did the same he tottered to his horse and tried to get a foot over the old things back he was shaking too badly to mount but the hoofbeats were still distant across the ford he could see dust and more steel moving on the hillside beyond the ford he had a little time he went to the first man hed cut down there was a stunning amount of blood around the man a pool like a small lake of a red opaqueness like magic wine hed never seen so much blood he threw up into the pool of blood his horse and saddle saved him and he stood there one hand in his stirrup leather for as long as a man would say a benison without the horse hed have fallen in the blood then he unbuckled the mans belt and took his purse and dagger he had to touch the blood but he did then he put all three purses in the leather sack the first man had been carrying even in the shocked reaction to his first real killing he eyed the wagon the canvas was split and he could see the cargo on the wagon box where the drover sat was a chest with iron reinforcement it had a lock theyd been trying to force the lock when he came up but he didnt need trouble and the distant hoofbeats were getting closer it seemed a waste though he got mounted and convinced his antique horse to trot he was no sooner moving than a dozen mounted men appeared in front of him three of them fully armoured with lances they rode at him hard it was not a fight he could win so he was very pleased when he recognised the french manatarms from the abbey and behind him he could see the two notaries he saluted the french knight rode up raising first his lance and then his visor messire he said you are one of the cardinals men yes said swan have you been attacked said another of the menatarms in blue and red he sounded hopeful swan pointed at the road behind him brigands attacked one of your wagons im afraid they killed the wagoner we happened on them he shrugged cesare was waving from farther up the road you burst through them asked the manatarms no said swan theres more of them coming we outran them at this the party whooped and set out for the wagon swan left them to it he rode until he caught up with cesare and giovanni the two notaries were clearly pleased to see him it steadied him what happened cesare asked i left them swan said he shrugged his hands were shaking we should keep going by nightfall they caught the convoy well north of the valley of the lisle the wagons and carts were drawn in a circle and the three of them were challenged on approach cardinal bessarion sent for them as soon as their presence was known alessandro came to fetch them he gave swan a civil nod you came back he said i have your boots swan said you managed to get a swordcut on them alessandro said swan looked down and was disconcerted to find that the tan top of his right boot had a cut right through the leather uh sorry he shook his head he stayed and fought them he killed at least one brigand giovanni said proudly did you alessandro said he looked at swan with renewed interest bessarion was sitting on three camp stools reclining with a book he didnt sit up but merely waved his book at them and a servant fetched wine swan was grateful for wine and he drank his too fast while the notaries read their letter aloud bessarion nodded sharply well done he said in italian you had trouble with brigands giovanni bowed messire swan dealt with them eminence bessarion extended his hand to swan he knelt and kissed the cardinals ring it was apparently what foreigners did with cardinals the cardinals hand clasped his lightly that was well done messire swan i wont insult you with payment but swan winced in his persona as a great mans son he couldnt accept payment it was true it is a pleasure to serve he said bessarions eyes seemed to twinkle it was probably a trick of the firelight but swan had the feeling that he amused the cardinal the prince of the church held out the book hed been reading carefully marking his place with a ribbon do you know it he asked swan almost dropped it when he opened it it was a small volume bound in whitened parchment and between the covers it was very ancient it wasnt a copy or at least not a recent copy the lettering was alien the hand almost square but the first page clearly said that it was about the stars swan flipped it open turned a page and shook his head its not aristotles greek its about mathematics he felt foolish i cant even find a title page bessarion smiled thats because it isnt a modern copy young englishman this is at least five hundred years old monks made it perhaps when alexandria in egypt was still christian swan sucked in a difficult breath oh he grinned its beautiful oh indeed i see you have the heart of a true connoisseur he extended his hand and swan put the book reverentially in it its by ptolemy swan felt he was being tested king ptolemy he asked one of them bessarion said i have trouble reading it too its about mathematics the mathematics of measurement angles as relations to other distances he shrugged there are men in italy who understand this sort of thing he nodded to swan who took that for a dismissal he retreated from the cardinals tent area and went to find peter peter was awake and better swan changed his bandage and got them both supper from the cardinals cooks he sat on the ground to eat and felt his eyelids closing unroll your blankets you fool or youll freeze at midnight peter hissed his oddly sibilant dutchenglish and his slightly too careful pronunciation made him sound as if he was giving orders swan went and fetched his blanket roll and the sack hed filled with purses he used it as a pillow but before he could get to sleep he heard horses and then he was summoned by alessandro the italian dusted the leaf mould off his back you killed four of them he asked quietly swan met his eye yes alessandro whistled you werent going to mention it he asked swan shrugged and you robbed them alessandro asked swan realised he hadnt thought this through they were dead alessandro nodded i dont mind but the french think that someone else killed them and took their money how do you want to play this swan looked at the italian even through a haze of sleep he could tell that he was worried and further was not telling him something let them think that swan said alessandro shook his head if i do my master must travel slowly for days if i say you did it the french have no reason to go slowly because all the brigands are dead he waved come swan followed him unwillingly but consoled himself that he still had the sword they walked to a different fire where the french soldiers were gathered alessandro was well known here they handed him wine this is your fearsome englishman asked the count swan bowed did you kill four armed brigands by yourself boy why didnt you tell me when we rode up to you the big knight took a step towards him swan looked at the ground i killed them yes i wasnt thinking so well after the knight winced but he did not sneer this i believe did you take their purses swan shrugged im not sure why he said the count nodded it this your first time in battle he asked second swan admitted mm said the count so this one to you messire alessandro we have no more brigands that we know of but i will beg you to ride with us another day or so alessandro shrugged wearily if you insist he bowed and the two of them walked back towards swans sleeping roll did you see anything when you fought the brigands alessandro asked i am phrasing this badly did something alert you swan stretched a dead man if thats what you mean we saw the wagon and it looked as if it had broken down and then i saw a body in the bushes i knew he shrugged it felt like a trap alessandro put a hand on his shoulder this i must ask did you open the wagon swan looked at the ground no alessandro said im not trying to insult you englishman but something doesnt add up swan met his eye in the dark i took their purses you know i have no money it is within the laws of war alessandro laughed laws of war messire swan for the first time i think perhaps you are a young gentleman he looked into the darkness it was one of my men on that wagon and he is dead swan nodded but he wore the blue and red i saw him cesare says it is the paris livery he paused im sorry alessandro frowned you notice a great deal englishman yes i dressed him as a parisian i hoped to learn something swan scratched under his beard you distrust the count he said yes well well see i do not suspect you i merely wish you had seen more he paused fingering his dagger why do you ask if i distrust the count swan looked around carefully he pretends poverty alessandros eyes narrowed he lost his patrimony in the kings wars or so he says his sword is worth five hundred florins his shoes are as good as the shoes the king of england wears swan shrugged alessandro nodded you see a great deal i missed the sword but yes ill give you this much there is something not quite right about messire the count he waved they had arrived at peters fire go to sleep swan would have thought about it more but the moment he had his blanket on his shoulders he was asleep the next morning he fed peter gruel from a copper pot the fleming laughed when he was done i think perhaps it is you who are my servant he said swan shrugged where are you from peter asked london swan said peter nodded i thought so you are schooled swan smiled yes he said bishops school inns of court i never went to oxenford he leaned closer you i am an archer once i was a cloth fuller but the trade fell off my wife died he shrugged theres money in war i have no money but when i have a chance to go through the purses he paused peter nodded i heard about your heroic deed of arms young sir he met swans eye if you make this a habit fighting four men you will soon be dead swan flashed on the pool of blood im it just sort of happened peter nodded can you ride again today alessandro acts like a prick but i suspect hed put you on a wagon if i asked nicely swan shook his leather bottle it was empty i can ride you know im on a better horse than you are he looked at swan who blushed damn another of alessandros little tests he made a sign to avert evil keep it you need to ride easy my plug will keep me going swan had never undressed he pulled his boots on laced them to his doublet and played with the hang of his sword until he liked it he tied the leather sack behind his saddle and mounted no sooner was he up than alessandro rode over to him a good day to you messire i wonder if i might ask a favour in the cardinals name he bowed and swan returned the bow i am a man short would you be an outrider id like a better horse my servant needs the courser alessandro nodded you have my spare boots and my spare sword why not my spare mount listen messire at this rate youll marry my sister alessandros spare mount was an average riding horse nothing to look at but well enough trained and sturdy swan spent three hours prowling the high ground to the west of the convoy with another of the cardinals guards a greek named giannis who couldnt initially understand a word of swans greek but was happy to converse in italian at the midmorning halt the two of them reined in several hundred feet above the convoy giannis dismounted and with consummate professionalism produced a stolen cooked chicken do we take turns on watch swan asked like christ and his angels watching over sinful man giannis said with a gaptoothed smile but ill share the boss says you gutted the bastards who killed our dmitrios swan was queasy at the praise they tried to kill me they werent very good giannis shrugged bandits seldom are the real killers go to the mercenary companies he shrugged but there are some villains among them heres to dmitrios hell be singed in hell before he goes anywhere near heavan but he was a good comrade for a fucking schismatic i beg your pardon swan laughed then he pretended to stretch dont move too fast but theres a man with a crossbow hes not aiming now he fall flat giannis fell flat and by the time the bolt was rattling among the rocks he was already on his horse swan was riding flat out for the crossbowman his ugly horse skimmed the rocks like a goat the man on foot had no chance swan cut him off giannis rode him down swan slipped from his horse and slammed his swordhilt into the back of the mans head while he tried to ward off the greek like the turks giannis said except thered be ten of them theyd have horn bows and theyd be set to cover each other he shook his head if you keep charging men like that you wont live long swan immediately looked around they were on top of the ridge that ran parallel to the road and the man had been in the cover of a large rock he felt foolish the greek was right if the man had had a partner hed have been dead he took the mans purse it held two french ecus in silver a decent sum swan showed them to his partner and tossed him one the greek caught it and grinned glad i shared my chicken with you he said he ran his hands over the man pinned to the inside of the mans coat was a lead badge such as pilgrims wore he took that he also took the mans crossbow and his bolts they rode down to the column carefully swan with the crossbowman across his saddle the count rode out to meet them who what do you have there he looked angry another of the lice alessandro was riding towards them his galloping horse throwing up dust swan wondered why he was in such a hurry two of the counts archers had the unconscious man giannis bowed my lord he shot at us with his weapon and my young friend here was too foolish to let him get away the count glanced at swan and swan didnt like his look alessandro arrived is that a prisoner he asked giannis nodded yes boss the count shrugged ill hang him i have the right let me question him first alessandro said my lord count why asked the count scum like this will say anything best rid the world of him and send him to hell he made a motion with his hand and one of the archers drew a knife i would very much like to question him my lord alessandro said but the man was beyond questioning alessandro glared at the french knight i thought you intended to hang him swan gave his horse a little knee and turned in between the knight and the italian manatarms messires i feel i should be back at my duty do you have any further orders the count shook his head swan rode away all but towing alessandro the italian was angry he did that on purpose he said swan shrugged when they were out of sight of the count he handed over the pilgrim badge alessandro let out a sigh of pure frustration when i saw it i thought it might be a livery badge he said i dont think of brigands as the kind of men who go on pilgrimages swan said giannis handed his boss the crossbow a fine weapon he said well kept swan looked down at the column just coming into sight below them as they climbed does the cardinal have an enemy in rome yes here alessandro shook his head giannis looked at his capitano but he has valuable things with him swan reined in you have years of experience but if it was up to me id guess that the count means the cardinal harm he looked down the column or one of these other gentlemen alessandro nodded an interesting thought one perhaps you should not share alessandro looked at giannis who shrugged expressively despite his breast and backplate he managed to convey in a single shrug that he was interested in the subject but would not discuss it the rest of the afternoon passed without incident and swan was tired and covered in dust when he returned to the convoy at sunset they were rolling into the courtyard of an inn peter took his horse wincing as he reached up for the bridle you should take more time swan said peter wagged his head back and forth im bored pain is pain listen master i opened the purses swan looked around he wasnt comfortable discussing it well theres a charge for straw and another for wash water i thought as the fleming raised an eyebrow tell me said swan i wont say as were rich but if you kill one bandit a day and take his purse well be able to keep eating peter shrugged swan winced he reached into his shirt and came up with the silver ecu peter took it and bit it nice he said you have some useful skills for a gentleman peter said ooseful skils otherwise his english was near perfect swan dismounted and curried the horse with peter while they were working giannis came out and got to work on his own horse giannis this is my man peter swan said giannis grinned sure he said when the horses were curried and fed giannis unrolled his cloak i want to keep the crossbow he said he handed swan a dark red leather belt with a red leather purse it had nice buckles and a pair of cast decorations to weight the rain cover it wasnt fine like a noblemans purse but it was good work it also had a good heavy knife german work with an eating knife and a pricker in the scabbard theres his belt giannis said thats a fine knife i throw in the purse as he smiled his gaptoothed smile as you dont seem to have a purse swan looked at peter peter walked over and lifted the crossbow thats a nice piece he said the goatsfoot lever was built into the stock he ratcheted it back with an effort and a grunt of pain that cost he looked at swan who was this man thats a fine knife the crossbow and the knife are both low german i know the makers mark on that knife he sells in antwerp its not the gear a brigand would have he might if he just killed someone for it swan said you haf never been a brigand haf you peter said in a matteroffact tone swan translated into italian for giannis giannis nodded hes no fool this man of yours he said he owes you on this deal even with the knife peter said swan turned on giannis my man says youre trying to cheat me he said giannis shrugged cheat is a harsh word he said smiling you are a rich boy i am a poor manatarms what will you do with the crossbow hunt killer sparrows he shrugged listen you did the work i admit it but i cant afford even half this machine i just want it swan looked at peter he wants it he admits its worth more get him to buy our wine tonight and call it a deal peter said listen swan said to giannis im as poor as a slave right now buy our wine tonight at dinner and ill take the dagger and purse and were even giannis offered his hand and they shook in the common room of the tavern swan sat on a trestle with his back against peters and worked on the belt the lawyers came in and waved and he waved back but they were forced by the flow of patrons to sit near the fire he had to ask around to get a needle heavy thread some resin and some wax but as he expected a tavern was the place to buy all these small necessities and for the first time in his life he had cash and a purse in which to put it he tried not to keep drawing the heavy hunting knife and fondling it but in truth it was the finest thing hed ever owned killing people and taking their goods was looking better and better alessandro came and stood over him while he cut off part of the belt stripped its tip of some white metal and used the anvil in the barn to reset the rivets then he resewed the edge of the belt alessandro spent most of the time talking to giannis but when swan returned from the barn a second time he turned you seem to know your way around a needle he said swan shrugged my masteratarms said a gentleman who couldnt sew was going to be very unhappy on campaign when i was a royal page alessandro shook his head dont claim you were a royal page swan looked up why not easy to prove or disprove in paris if true you are worth more yes if false he shook his head ah swan said he bit his thread peter says he knows this knife maker he said and drew the knife and handed it to the italian soldier who took it by the hilt and tossed it in his hand from the assassin yes he asked swan nodded hmm alessandro grunted he hefted it it was as long as a mans forearm elbow to the tips of his fingers with a thumbrest that doubled as a guard alessandro took out the bye knifethe small eating knife that rested in the scabbard he nodded nice work not as nice as the crossbow peter said alessandro smiled out of the corner of his mouth the room was loud and growing louder as the towns four prostitutes had just come in wearing red dresses and with flowers in their hair they were particularly unappetising to swan but the rest of the men clapped and hooted swan leaned closer to alessandro i would like to propound a theory he said the venetian bit his lip glanced around the room and nodded outside i think they didnt exactly slip outside as several men growled when they pushed by but they made it into the stable yard the merchants carts were lining the south wall and the counts carts lined the west wall propound away my young scapegrace alessandro said swan glanced around you went to university sir alessandro nodded yes padova with messire accudi in fact so you know that the very best kind of theory is that which can be tested swan asked alessandro nodded get on with it you weary me with all this talk of school swan nodded the count is a fraud hes a brigand a good actor and possibly a genuine knight hes not after us hes after merechault weve become a nuisance by appearing with a dozen menatarms they walked slowly along arm in arm like two old friends fascinating alessandro said and your proof swan stopped in front of one of the counts wagons now that he knew the liveries he knew that the counts wagons were the three that were not marked if i take my knife and slit the tarpaulin youll find nothing inside of any value he said but heres a lesser proof he pointed at the merchants wagons two of the wagoners sat on the boxes watching the counts wagons are never guarded because all his men know theres nothing in them alessandro grunted he turned both of them back towards the inn it would help to explain something which has vexed me he said swan paused yes alessandro shrugged i understand that there was a great deal of theft at the abbey a priest lost his shirts other things went missing cesare said someone stole a rich monks riding gloves the abbot tried to blame us as foreigners it made the cardinal angry swan set his face like stone i do not care very much what you might be but if you are a thief leave my boots and my sword and ride off into the night said the italian swan took another step im no thief he said im a gentleman and a soldier of course alessandro said where did you get a pair of riding gloves i found them in the road swan said their eyes met in the darkness and swan didnt flinch and in that moment his plan crystallised after alessandro went off he had a brief conversation with the youngest of the prostitutes he caught alessandro watching him and winked while he pressed money into the girls hand that much again when were done he said after dinner he played piquet with the lawyers for an hour his luck was fair and he ended the game a few silver sequins ahead of when he started most of the rest of the inn was in bed and the menatarms had gone to the stables to sleep swan walked out through the kitchen there was one slattern watching the fire a second washing cups and a third providing personal services to one of the french merchants men the whore hed spoken to earlier swan walked past and out through the kitchen door into the darkness of the yard the merchants wagons were unguarded he walked all the way down the line of wagons and made himself walk all the way back to the kitchen he wasnt challenged his heart beat like a drum in a dance but he drew his new knife stepped up to the last wagon in the row and slit the tarpaulin across a quarter of an hour later he met the whore in the portico of the church why here he asked she shrugged i do most of my fucking here she said its dry he handed her a whole silver ecu she laughed now you run he said if you are here to be found in the morning he hardened his voice ill kill you myself she laughed you aint the killing type lad she bit the coin im gone now ill find another town she looked at him youre a funny one though you didnt steal anything he grabbed her wrist ouch listen i was done fucking the archer and i watched you through the door you moved things but you didnt take anything he shrugged he bent her arm back the way his uncles had taught him i can break your arm and then cut your throat he said he must have looked the part she whimpered he let go and she ran he was careful he went up and over the wall into the inn yard waited until the wagon guard was looking elsewhere and crept into the stable his greatest fear was that alessandro would be there waiting for him but the capitano was not there swan got into his blankets peters hand gripped his arm like a vice he put his lips almost against swans ear swan froze i owe you but i wont swing for you he said swan turned very slowly he was so close that it made him uncomfortable this was like whispering with a girl in the loft of his mothers inn his heart was hammering we wont swing he said peter grunted swan lay awake trying to tell himself that his plan was foolproof but now the whore and the fleming could kill him and he was still awake when the light showed through the roof and the cock crowed there was a scream and a roar of anger from the yard his heart beat double time and he thought im an idiot hed just seen the flaw in his plan and it was far too late to fix it cardinal bessarion listened to the angry remonstrances of the count and the endless gush of invective from the injured merchant for an hour eventually he bowed to both men and left them mounting his destrier and riding at the head of his own convoy out of the inn yard and on to the road he rode side by side with his captain for a mile swan watched them from the middle of the convoy where he rode with the lawyers as the road was deemed safe enough without him he managed a blank face he made some latin jokes that fell flat and he tried to engage giannis who waved and rode away he was scared enough that every apparent slight seemed to him to show that everyone knew what he had done he saw alessandro nod to the cardinal and ride back down the column and he knew immediately that the capitano was coming for him he straightened his back the italian turned his horse neatly and waved the blessing of the day to you messire swan the cardinal begs the honour of your company swan bowed in the saddle nothing could give me greater pleasure than his company unless possibly your own he said in italian cesare slapped him on the back the courtiers motto if you must rub your nose in a mans arse do it with elegance swan flushed and cesare laughed never mind him said alessandro they rode along the column to the cardinal without another word good morning messire my prisoner said the cardinal swan bowed and accepted the proffered hand kissed the ring bessarion smiled how did you do it he asked swan realised that the italian manatarms was very close to his back listen said bessarion alessandro thinks you did it and i think you did it alessandro leaned into his back if you did it without stealing then you have done us a noble service and it is an act of lets say an act of war a feat of arms tell swan hesitated because he had made a mistake and once he told the cardinal reached out and put a hand on his arm you took goods from the merchants wagons and put them in the counts empty wagons swan looked back and forth between the two men if i were to say that i found the counts wagons empty he said alessandro laughed i thought so he said punching the air cardinal bessarion frowned messire merechault claims that he is missing six bales of goods as well as four pieces of carved ivory from a parisian maker to be delivered in burgundy swan shrugged hed learned that shrug through hard practice he could shrug like that even when his uncles were hitting him with a belt i imagine the counts men have them he said bessarion leaned over i would be very disappointed to find that anything else was true he leaned back but i am in your debt messire the count will be tied up in law for a week even the merchant i think owes you some gratitude it is a pity they cant find the girl alessandro said girl the cardinal asked that sly rogue the count the supposed count paid a whore to distract the night guard while his men stole from the wagons alessandro looked at swan who shrugged again or so says the night guard swan said perhaps he was bribed bessarion nodded what i cannot fathom he said quietly is why the supposed count would be fool enough to put the goods in his own wagons under merechaults nose swan writhed alessandro came to his rescue par dieu eminence hes arrogant enough to haul empty wagons across four fords as if we would never notice them he thought he might get away with it thats all it occurred to swan at that point that he was going to get away with it and a feeling of joy flooded him unmixed with any reserve whatsoever no school prank no petty thievery in cheapside would ever have the satisfaction of this pulled off under the very eyes of the enemy bessarion nodded swan found that he liked these strange foreign men and he looked back and forth at them after a few more paces he said i must confess a thought i have had the cardinal bowed slightly i can provide absolution he said swan tried to see a way to tell the truth without owning to his part in it if someone had hmm put the count in this unenviable position he said ahem if the count imagined that he had been slighted get on with it muttered alessandro what is to keep the count from revenge he asked he must suspect er us alessandro raised an eyebrow swan went on hed had all morning to think it through at some point merechault will call for the i dont know what they are called in france but in london wed call him the sheriff and the count will find himself in a difficulty he was speaking too fast he will too alessandro said so he kills merechault and sets fire to the inn and rides away to kill us swan finished as he has more menatarms than we do ourselves why kill us the cardinal asked alessandro looked at the young englishman perhaps he doesnt believe his own men were fools enough to place the bales of cloth in his wagons perhaps he cant afford any witnesses swan said perhaps he is so well born that he can weather any legal action alessandro said slowly bessarion raised a hand looked alessandro in the eye and said see to it alessandro nodded put a hand on swans bridle and turned them out of the column as he rode down the column he gathered men half his soldiers giannis another greek called stefanos a third called giorgos and two italians ramone and marcus he turned to swan youre coming with me you made this mess you can help clean up but despite his acerbic tone he smiled and put an hand on swans arm you did well enough he shrugged i think you are too cautious i think the socalled count will simply ride away swan shook his head that was my mistake he said alessandro made a face what mistake they were just passing a low bluff on their right covered in big trees oaks and some beech alessandro was looking at it the first night i was with you at dinner i saw him sitting with the merchants men at a middle table he was as angry as a mad dog swan was looking at the horizon alessandro shrugged so he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the trees he was angry he hadnt been given a place at the high table swan said he really is a count alessandros face went still just for a moment then his eyelids came down a little he turned away from the high woods then we must in fact clean this up very carefully he said quietly is your servant an archer he raised an eyebrow do you even know hes a very good archer swan said hoping it was true good i have a couple of english bows i bought at castillon from the victors he turned and beckoned to peter who rode out of the column we need to hurry swan said he pointed at a column of smoke rising from the town on the next ridge just three leagues away thats the inn alessandro nodded right here will do he said he opened his purse and dumped it in the road twenty silver ecus and some gold glinting in the summer sun the two wagons and twenty retainers rolled on sedately unthreatened by the rising smoke behind them at their head rode the cardinal his red hat prominently displayed the little convoy raised dust that could be seen from ridge to ridge for several leagues the counts party moved quickly raising a column of dust that could be seen from the convoy the cardinal turned in his saddle from time to time to watch the counts progress his force of menatarms rode down into the valley splashed across the ford and started up the long ridge now just a league away closing the distance the cardinal gave an order and the convoy began to move faster he turned to watch as the counts cavalcade drew abreast of the oak woods on the bluff above the road we must kill them all alessandro said his voice was as hard as steel the greek and italian menatarms all nodded marcus and stefanos the bestarmoured men after alessandro himself rode away moving slowly so as not to raise dust the rest of them dismounted in the trees where they were bedevilled by insects for an uncomfortable hour peter took the two bows from the capitano and strung them with swans help he drew first one and then the other and winced on both draws he made a face good bows ill take this one he put the bow by him and unstrung the other and swan handed it to the capitano alessandro looked at him do you shoot he asked peter rested his back against the bole of a giant oak and prepared to go to sleep but he raised his face to swan toe nou id be surprised if he didnt shoot peter said swan shrugged i can use a bow he admitted peter nodded as if a mystery were solved or perhaps as if swan could now be taken seriously ive never met an englishman who could not shoot he said and went to sleep giannis spanned his crossbow put an arrow into the trough and lay down giorgos and ramone stayed with the horses they had no armour and no bows always be sure of your retreat alessandro said even when the odds are heavily in your favour the insects droned peter snored there were hoofbeats near the ford and the sound of harness and armour and suddenly peter was awake bow in hand standing behind the bole of his tree swans heart beat too hard he was tired he wanted to sleep but he was too afraid too full of something that made his nerves tingle his stomach flip over his bowels twitch alessandro just chewed on a grass stem and watched the road the counts men led by the unmistakable figure of the count came on at a fast trot the count passed the silver in the road but the next man reined in and suddenly they were all stopped and men were dismounting alessandro smiled much as the fox might smile when the hen comes to find its missing egg he snapped his fingers peter tensed and swan took a war arrow from the bundle at his feet placed it to the string and drew to his ear cocking his head slightly to engage the muscles in his back giannis loosed his crossbow made a flat snap one of the men in the scrum over the coins flipped off his horse before his demise was noticed peter drew his great bow to his ear and loosed his arrow hit the counts charger and sank all the way to the fletchings in the horses side and the great horse screamed and fell swans arrow wobbled in the air as it arched swan didnt watch the fall he knew hed missed his loose as soon as his fingers released the string every head among the counts men turned to the woods on the bluff peters second arrow took a blackbearded man in full plate armour under his arm while he waved at the woods he fell backward in a rattle of plate his horse stood stock still in the road peters third arrow plunged into the withers of a francarchers horse the horse bolted ran a few steps and fell in a spectacular crash flinging his unlucky rider the length of a horse down the road swans second arrow struck one of the counts routiers in the helmet the arrow sprang away but the man slumped the count was demanding that another manatarms give him his horse three men turned and bolted and the rest turned towards the wood and started to ride up the steep slope giannis finished spanning and took careful aim he muttered a prayer to the virgin in greek he loosed his bolt took an armoured man full in the breastplate and flipped him out of his saddle peters fourth arrow killed an archers horse the count gave up demanding a horse and started to run for the trees a hundred yards away peter missed with his fifth arrow swan had just raised his eyes from fumbling for his third arrow and he was having trouble nocking it all of the nonarchers were watching peters accuracy was remarkable so when he missed they all groaned the riders were close now peter plucked his sixth arrow from the ground whipped the nock on to the string drew and loosed in a single long motion and his bodkin point drove into a mans unarmoured face swan put his third arrow into a horse the horse reared its feet flailed at the air and together horse and man fell to earth peter plucked his seventh arrow and the remaining three riders were close enough to discover that there were too many men in the woods for them to defeat swan reached for his fourth arrow but alessandro shook his head to horse with me he gestured swan dropped his bow atop the arrows and got a foot in the nearside stirrup peter and giannis loosed together by bad luck they both picked the same target and a young squire died with two heavy arrows in his body get them alessandro said he and swan were now mounted and the two of them charged the survivors swans heart hammering away the two men were turning to run their horses had galloped up the steep hill and now they were blown alessandro was like an arrow his horse passed across the two fleeing opponents front and he cut back into them in his first pass he killed the horse of the lead man with a flick of his sword and a dainty montante into the animals unprotected neck he and the second man swaggered swords heavy downward cuts ringing together swan rode up on the mans left side and thrust under the arm while his full intention was on the italian he turned mouth open to scream and alessandro ran him through the mouth the blow cut away his jaw as he fell off the sword alessandro gave swan a short salute hilt to his lips then he rode across the face of the hill and waved up at giannis make sure they are all dead he called giannis waved and aimed and loosed his quarrel hit the count still running towards them it knocked him down but in a second he was up his armour was good enough to turn a light crossbow peters arrow struck him a few paces farther on it bounced off his breastplate leaving a dent visible to swan on his horse twenty paces away swan unarmoured had no intention of engaging the count his sword high he swept wide of the armoured man riding carefully to stay clear of the archers line of fire face me roared the count you sons of bitches he had his visor open another arrow hit him missed his face by a handspan and struck full on his lifted visor ripping it away from the helmet swan angled towards him trying to draw his attention away from alessandro who was coming up from behind the armoured man but alessandro caused him to turn and then swept by to the right his horse labouring on the hillside giannis shot a bolt into the back of the mans unprotected thigh at twenty yards the count screamed and went down alessandro rode up and dismounted even as swan dismounted himself alessandro handed the englishman his reins ill do this he said he shrugged arrhhh arrhhh the count grunted he was rolling back and forth his left hand scrabbling at the quarrel that had penetrated his thigh broken the bone and probably lodged against his thigh armour in front he was clearly in incredible pain his head thrashed back and forth alessandro walked over to him and suddenly the man dropped the pretence and got to one knee his sword sweeping low in an attempt to cut one of alessandros legs alessandro blocked some of it with a sweeping downward parry but the cut was low and he had no leg armour and he stumbled and went down fuck you you bitch screamed the count ill kill every fucking one of you you whores he was on one knee he began to drag himself to alessandro who tried to roll away swan had no armour and he had a feeling that the count was far out of his league as an opponent and he wasnt sure he owed alessandro anything he considered intervening and thought i dont have to do this but he wanted to be a knight and not a thief he had a feeling in a long moment between stillness and an explosive leap that this was his moment to choose as was so often the case in one moment of decision he dared himself i dont have to do this i really dont have to do this he leaped over the italian the count cut down he caught the cut on his high guard as his uncles had taught him the count twisted but he was on one knee and probably not as powerful as he was used to being and their blades locked the two keen edges biting into each other just a little swan had the enormous advantage of being on his feet armour or no armour he lunged with his left foot and rotated his sword on the point where the two blades were locked and punched his pommel into the counts unprotected face he was very fast people always underestimated his speed the counts teeth exploded over his pommel and the man fell back and swan almost as surprised as the count by his own success cut wildly his point bouncing up from the counts gorget and cutting across the mans lips and left eye he stumbled back the count screamed a long drawnout scream swan had only ever heard such a scream from a woman in childbirth he looked like some sort of nightmare monster the count got his good leg under him and powered himself to his feet his scream now a roar peters arrow struck his breastplate right over the heart it didnt penetrate but it knocked the count back and he unbalanced and fell down again and the spell was broken giannis was shouting in italian get out of the way get out of the way but swan stood between the monster in armour and alessandro who he wasnt sure he liked alessandro was staunching the flow of blood from his ankle you have to kill him he said swan walked over to the count who was lying on his back with one leg cocked and the other flat on the ground he was breathing as if hed run a race je me rends he said heavily je me rends he waved his swordhand swan put his right foot on the hand pinning it to the earth jesu get off it you little bitch i have yielded the fire in the counts eyes was unholy even with a foot on the mans swordarm his face ruined by the pommel strike a crossbow bolt in his thigh he was terrifying in his full plate and his size swan feared him even now pray messire count you are about to die swan placed his swordpoint near the mans face and found that his point was wobbling from the trembling of his hand im worth a thousand ducats sodomite get off my hand pray messire swan found his hand was steadying god is a fucking lie boy the man lay there his one good eye staring swan wished he would make one more attempt to rise to fight anything to justify what he was about to do his point wavered alessandro said just kill him for the love of god he took a deep breath and giannis leaned over and pulled the latch on his crossbow and his quarrel blew through the mans skull and killed him instantly theres money wasted he said cheerfully you hit bad messire peter was hobbling favouring his side in the distance four dust clouds on the plain gradually merged to two and then to one by the time stefanos came riding back alessandro was on horseback one foot out of the stirrup and dangling with swans neck cloth around his ankle stefanos had marcus over his horse he shrugged at his capitano bad luck he said alessandro shook his head dead he asked stefanos nodded what a waste alessandro said you get them both yes stefanos said where are the bodies alessandro asked in the river in armour what do you think i was born yesterday the greek spat any of them have anything worth taking those two had nothing but their swords leave it take nothing but coins nothing to mark us what about the horses giannis asked with a whine in his voice alessandro was in pain and his temper was short what did i just say fuck what do we get out of this complained stefanos marcus is dead i got less than an ecu alessandro glared giannis swan ramone and giorgos dragged each corpse into the wood it was hard work and disgusting ramone put a knife into each corpses neck under the chin just to be sure and searched the corpses for cash peter picked up the counts sword leave it alessandro said its a fine weapon peter said putting a touch of v into the w of weapon a vine veapon it could get us all beheaded alessandro said swan noted that the capitano spoke to peter almost as a peer peter nodded the way a man nods when he disagrees utterly he dropped the sword in the grass in twenty minutes they were done put fire to the wood alessandro said the soldiers got a fire going and spread it the summer woods caught very fast lets go alessandro said paris was dull after the road alessandros ankle cut was worse than it had looked in the field and he had to go to a surgeon to be bled the cardinal had apartments in the louvre but the rest of them were housed in the convent of the ursilines and the cardinal introduced swan to the kings librarian he was shocked to be given the run of the royal library days passed very quickly while he read he did little but read that was good because every night he dreamed he dreamed of the four men on the road of the counts one remaining eye of the blood every night sometimes in the day he fantasised about every young nun in the convent went out with the notaries and drank too much on the silver of the men hed killed and diced and played cards until he felt tired enough to sleep without dreams it never worked after theyd been in paris a week the cardinal summoned him a servant fetched him from aristotle and he walked up through the labyrinth of halls to the cardinals apartment he bowed was summoned forward and kissed the cardinals ring your eminence he said bessarion smiled he looked strained i am about to trade you he said i believe you said you were worth a thousand florins swan noted that alessandro was lying on the cardinals bed he waved an idle salute swan twitched as to that he said smiling apologetically half that the cardinal said he was already writing im trading you to the kings librarian he wants you as his prisoner hell use you in the library until your father arranges your release he paused of course well need your fathers name he looked at alessandro im sorry for this young man i had thought of releasing you without ransom after your daring on the road but the truth is weve had a disaster bessarion the very model of decorum or romanstyle gravitas had a catch in his voice swan realised the man was on the edge of tears a disaster swan asked alessandro rose on his elbow constantinople fell to the turks in may bessarion buried his head in his hands my city swan was at a loss constantinople was a name redolent with magic a wonderful place a schismatic heretical place a palace of wonders babylon he had to imagine that the fleshandblood bessarion thought of the great city as as home home like london bessarion raised his head now swan could see that he had aged his lips were thin his hair greyer suddenly i am cut off from revenue so im afraid i must sell your ransom young man he shrugged im sorry swan shrugged tell him alessandro said suddenly theres no point in pretence boy tell him whats this bessarion asked alessandro shook his head hes not worth a sou of ransom hes someones bastard thats all bessarion continued to look at swan is this true do you know this to be true he asked swan was frozen but if he said his fathers name it would all become instantly clear anyway cardinal bessarion nodded ah of course what nobly born boy speaks greek he looked at swan tell us boy my father is dead he said he shrugged his shrug he was a cardinal he wanted me educated for the church kemp asked the cardinal his voice sharp kemp had a mistress swan lowered his eyes cardinal beaufort eminence alessandro whistled from the bed youre a bastard of that bastard he snorted bessarion pursed his lips and raised an eyebrow you arent worth a sou alessandro laughed aloud so you were a royal page swan spread his hands not for long he admitted i played a prank bessarion shook his head raised his eyes from his hands and looked at his capitano i can sell the ptolemy he said it will get us the money to go to rome alessandro nodded bessarion looked at swan you did me good service young man despite your lies ahh spare me a lie is a lie go ill see to it you get a safe conduct swan sighed greatly daring he met the cardinals eye then he looked at alessandro and shifted his glance back to the cardinal id rather have a job he said if its all the same to you theres nothing for me in england bessarion shook his head but he laughed im not sure i have what would be required to save your soul he said alessandro nodded ill take him he said he has a weak stomach for the killing but ill take him at least he can read greek bessarion said and cesare likes him the news that swan was going to accompany them to rome didnt seem to be the thunderbolt that swan had expected it to be he told giovanni at the convent and the lawyer clasped his hand kissed him on one cheek and laughed welcome to the very gates of heavan he said the gates of the inferno is more like it cesare was a large man and paris in midsummer was hot smelly and stifling you are not the missing prince of wales after all eh swan bit his lip we had a joke about you in the early days giovanni said you were either an impostor a peasant playing at being a lord or the other way round a great lord playing at being a lesser light but we could never guess which you were too easy with the servants cesare said he shrugged the way i am i grew up as a servant eh swan nodded my mother owns a tavern he said i waited tables as soon as i was old enough to carry the cups giovanni laughed but your latin is impeccable cesare grunted oh my father had me educated swan said he shrugged i even did a little jousting he added the lawyers shook their heads youll be happy in italy cesare predicted here in the north the idiots think birth matters in italy were making a new world where a man is what he is giovanni looked down his long nose at his friend birth is birth he said and then relented but its true were not hunting dogs cesare proves that anyone can go to university and emerge a man of letters he ducked a thrown inkwell which splattered against the whitewashed wall you just made some young novice very unhappy my friend ill just imagine her on her knees none of your impiety you blasphemer working her little heart out stop swan left them to it he walked to his own cell a tiny room the size of a blanket chest which is what his bed seemed to be as he expected peter was sitting on it reading the psalms copybooks short tracts meticulously written out by copyists were quite cheap in paris he sat on the blanket box he took the cardinals livery badge from his purse and put it on the box ive taken service with the cardinal he said im going to rome he smiled youve been very good to me i think were even eh peter smiled slipped a strip of linen tape into his tract and sat back im fired just like that just when ive figured out how to get the nuns to wash our shirts swan waggled his head nervously youre a master archer im a penniless git he looked up i havent really got anything to pay you with peter folded his hands you mean except for the carved ivories you have rolled up in your blanket or had you forgotten those swan rose from his seat as if hed been pinched peter laughed i thought you were saving them to pay your ransom he said he didnt bother to hide his laugh they must be worth a thousand florins maybe a thousand ducats swan shifted nervously maybe he said he was becoming tired of getting caught the adult world was much more complex that then world of pages peter sat back so maybe id like to stay with you if youll have me he grinned and maybe if the pay is good ant maybe iff te paiy iis gut swan couldnt believe what he was hearing are you kidding peter shook his head no i think maybe it is time to settle down he nodded the war is over thats what they say in paris england has lost everything except calais i could go home to antwerp and what full cloth he smiled ill go to rome pray in st peters if you and i dont get along so well then ill come home thats excellent swan smiled and they clasped hands like soldiers peter you really are i mean thanks who knows peter said in time perhaps i learn to be a servant he got up by the way dont try and sell the ivory until we are on the road south avignon ought to be good he leaned past his master i have a gift for you for saving my life swan laughed you dont owe me a thing it is not much of a life but the only one i haf peter said here dont wear it until avignon he opened the linen stocking that held his bow and took out the counts sword swan took it it was a fine weapon a single sword a riding sword the crosshilt was plain steel but it had the two finger rings of the new style and a pair of deep fullers running down the doubleedged blade it was longer than alessandros borrowed sword and heavier in the hilt differently balanced with a complex ricasso the blade was virtually unnicked a fine piece of steel eastern i think bohemia perhaps peter looked it over i almost kept it for myself he shrugged i watched you you are very fast swan nodded thanks youve had some training yes peter asked even in the close confines of the nuns cell swan was thrusting and cutting peter pretended to cower careful master he whined swan laughed but you could be much better the fleming continued swan stopped really he said not entirely pleased he imagined himself a good blade watch alessandro some time when his ankle is healed peter said perhaps in rome we can take lessons we swan asked he grinned we peter said once again they shook they rode hard out of paris once the cardinal had settled his debts they had no wagons and only four servants the lawyers and the soldiers they made twenty leagues a day and if the servants complained the soldiers enjoyed the pace peter had assumed theyd stop in avignon for a week but they didnt come close to the formal papal city instead they went east into the mountains crossing savoy leaving turin swan buckled on the counts sword for the first time they were a mile on the road before alessandro saw it he frowned at swan who nodded peter picked it up he said i never wore it before today alessandro frowned but later in the day he rode up and smiled im used to getting my way all the time he said it is still a risk a fine sword let me see swan watched him roll the weapon around with his wrist moulinetto stramazone he knew those italian terms from his own italian master beautiful he said as good as my own heres your spare back swan said suiting action to words alessandro accepted his blade what about my nice boots he asked i need to earn some money to buy my own i think theyre about the same value as my life which i think perhaps you saved alessandro nodded so keep them i dont know they have a cut in the thigh swan grinned they rode down into italy
