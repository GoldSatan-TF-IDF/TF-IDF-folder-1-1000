peter robinson final account for sheila dry bones that dream are bitter they dream and darken our sun w b yeats the dreaming of the bones chapter the uniformed constable lifted the tape and waved detective chief inspector banks through the gate at two fortyseven in the morning bankss headlights danced over the scene as he drove into the bumpy farmyard and came to a halt to his left stood the squat solid house itself with its walls of thick limestone and mossy flagstone roof lights shone in both the upstairs and downstairs windows to his right a high stone wall buttressed a copse that straggled up the daleside where the trees became lost in darkness straight ahead stood the barn a group of officers had gathered around the open doors inside which a ball of light seemed to be moving they looked like the cast of a fifties scifi film gazing in awe on an alien spaceship or lifeform when banks arrived they parted in silence to let him through as he entered he noticed one young pc leaning against the outside wall dribbling vomit on his size twelves inside the scene looked like a film set peter darby the police photographer was busy videotaping and the source of the light was attached to the top of his camera it created an eerie chiaroscuro and sudden sickening illuminations as it swept around the barns interior all he needed banks thought was for someone to yell action and the place would suddenly be full of sound and motion but no amount of yelling would breathe life back into the grotesque shape on the floor by which a wheyfaced young police surgeon dr burns squatted with a black notebook in his hand at first the position of the body reminded banks of a parody of moslem prayer the kneeling man bent forward from the waist arms stretched out in front bum in the air forehead touching the ground perhaps facing mecca his fists were clenched in the dirt and banks noticed the glint of a gold cufflink initialled kar as darbys light flashed on it but there was no forehead to touch the ground above the charcoal suit jacket the bloodsoaked collar of the mans shirt protruded about an inch and after that came nothing but a dark coagulated mass of bone and tissue spread out on the dirt like an oil stain a shotgun wound by the look of it patches of blood bone and brain matter stuck to the whitewashed stone walls in abstractexpressionist patterns darbys roving light caught what looked like a fragment of skull sprouting a tuft of fair hair beside a rusty hoe banks felt the bile rise in his throat he could still smell the gunpowder reminiscent of a childhood bonfire night mixed with the stink of urine and feces and the rancid raw meat smell of sudden violent death what time did the call come in he asked the pc beside him one thirtyeight sir pc carstairs from relton was first on the scene hes still puking up out front banks nodded do we know who the victim was dc gay checked his wallet sir names keith rothwell thats the name of the bloke who lived here all right he pointed over to the house arkbeck farm its called a farmer nay sir accountant some sort of businessman anyroad one of the constables found a light switch and turned on the bare bulb which became a foundation for the brighter light of darbys video camera most regions didnt use video because it was hard to get good enough quality but peter darby was a hardware junkie forever experimenting banks turned his attention back to the scene the place looked as if it had once been a large stone yorkshire barn with double doors and a hayloft called a field house in those parts originally it would have been used to keep the cows inside between november and may and to store fodder but rothwell seemed to have converted it into a garage to bankss right a silvergray bmw parked at a slight angle took up about half the space beyond the car against the far wall a number of metal shelf units held all the tools and potions one would associate with car care antifreeze wax polish oily rags screwdrivers spanners rothwell had retained the rural look in the other half of the garage he had even hung old farm implements on the whitewashed stone wall a mucking rake a hay knife a draining scoop and a tom spade among others all suitably rusted as he stood there banks tried to picture what might have happened the victim had clearly been kneeling perhaps praying or pleading for his life it certainly didnt look as if he had tried to escape why had he submitted so easily not much choice probably banks thought you usually dont argue when someone is pointing a shotgun at you but still would a man simply kneel there brace himself and wait for his executioner to pull the trigger banks turned and left the barn outside he met detective sergeant philip richmond and detective constable susan gay coming from around the back nothing there sir far as i can tell said richmond a large torch in his hand susan beside him looked pale in the glow from the barn entrance all right banks asked her im okay now sir i was sick though richmond looked the same as ever his sangfroid was legendary around the place so much so that banks sometimes wondered if he had any feelings at all or whether he had come to resemble one of those computers he spent most of his time with anyone know what happened banks asked pc carstairs had a quick word with the victims wife when he first got here said susan all she could tell him was that a couple of men were waiting when she got home and they took her husband outside and shot him she shrugged then she became hysterical i believe shes under sedation now sir i fished his wallet from his pocket anyway she went on holding up a plastic bag says his names yes i know said banks have we got an exhibits officer yet no sir susan answered then both she and phil richmond looked away exhibits officer was one of the least popular jobs in an investigation it meant keeping track of every piece of possible evidence and preserving a record of continuity it usually went to whoever was in the doghouse at the time get young farnley on the job then banks said pc farnley hadnt offended anyone or cocked up a case but he lacked imagination and had a general reputation around the station as a crashing golf bore clearly relieved richmond and susan wandered off toward the sceneofcrime team who had just pulled into the farmyard in a large van as they piled out in their white boiler suits they looked like a team of government scientists sent to examine the alien landingspot pretty soon banks thought if they werent all careful there would be a giant spider or a huge gooey blob rolling around the yorkshire dales gobbling up everyone in sight the night was cool and still the air moist tinged with a hint of manure banks still felt halfasleep despite the shock of what he had seen in the garage maybe he was dreaming no he thought of sandra warm at home in bed and sighed detective superintendent gristhorpes arrival at about threethirty brought him out of his reverie gristhorpe limped over from his car he wore an old donkeyjacket over his shirt and he clearly hadnt bothered to shave or comb his unruly thatch of gray hair bloody hell alan he said by way of greeting tha looks like columbo theres the pot calling the kettle black banks thought still the super was right he had thrown on an old raincoat over his shirt and trousers because he knew the night would be chilly after banks had explained what he had found out so far gristhorpe took a quick look in the barn questioned pc carstairs the first officer at the scene then rejoined banks his usually ruddy pockmarked face a little paler lets go in the house shall we alan he said i hear pc weavers brewing up he should be able to give us some background they walked across the dirt yard above them the stars shone cold and bright like chips of ice on black velvet the farmhouse was cozy and warm inside a welcome change from the cool night and the gruesome scene in the barn it had been renovated according to the yuppie idea of the real rustic look with exposed beams and rough stone walls in an open splitlevel living room all earthy browns and greens the remains of a log fire glowed in the stone hearth and beside it stood a pair of antique andirons and a matching rack holding poker and tongs in front of the fire banks noticed two hardbacked chairs facing one another one of them had fallen over or had been pushed on its side beside both of them lay coils of rope one of the chair seats looked wet banks and gristhorpe walked through into the ultramodern kitchen which looked like something from a color supplement where pc weaver was pouring boiling water into a large red teapot nearly ready sir he said when he saw the cid officers ill just let it mash a couple of minutes the kitchen walls were done in bright red and white patterned tiles and every available inch of space had been used to wedge fitted microwave oven fridge dishwasher cupboards and the like it also boasted a central island unit complete with tall pine stools banks and gristhorpe sat down hows his wife gristhorpe asked theres a wife and daughter here sir said weaver the doctors seen them theyre both unharmed but theyre suffering from shock hardly surprising when you consider they found the body theyre upstairs with wpc smithies apparently theres also a son rambling around america somewhere who was this rothwell bloke banks asked he must have had a bob or two anything missing we dont know yet sir weaver said he looked around the bright kitchen but i see what you mean he was some sort of financial whizkid i think these newfangled kitchens dont come cheap i can tell you the wifes got in the habit of leaving the mail on sunday supplement open at some design or another her way of dropping hints like and about as subtle as a blow on the head with a hammer the price of them makes me cringe i tell her the one weve got is perfectly all right but she as he talked weaver began to pour the tea into the row of cups and mugs he had arranged but after filling the second one he stopped and stared at the door banks and gristhorpe followed his gaze and saw a young girl standing there her slight figure framed in the doorway she rubbed her eyes and stretched hello she said are you the detectives id like to talk to you my names alison rothwell and someone just killed my father she was about fifteen banks guessed but she made no attempt to make herself look older as many teenagers do she wore a baggy gray sweatshirt advertising an american football team and a blue tracksuit bottom with a white stripe down each side apart from the bruiselike pouches under her light blue eyes her complexion was pale her mousy blonde hair was parted in the center and hung in uncombed strands over her shoulders her mouth with its pale thin lips was too small for her oval face can i have some tea please she asked banks noticed she had a slight lisp pc weaver looked for direction go ahead lad gristhorpe told him give the lass some tea then he turned to alison rothwell are you sure you wouldnt rather be upstairs with your mum love alison shook her head mumll be all right shes asleep and theres a policewoman sitting by her i cant sleep it keeps going round in my mind what happened i want to tell you about it now can i of course gristhorpe asked pc weaver to stay and take notes he introduced banks and himself then pulled out a stool for her alison gave them a sad shy smile and sat down holding the mug of tea to her chest with both hands as if she needed its heat gristhorpe indicated subtly that banks should do the questioning are you sure you feel up to this banks asked her first alison nodded i think so would you like to tell us what happened then alison took a deep breath her eyes focused on something banks couldnt see it was just after dark she began about ten oclock quarter past or thereabouts i was reading i thought i heard a sound out in the yard what kind of sound banks asked i i dont know just as if someone was out there a thud like someone bumping into something or something falling on the ground carry on alison hugged her cup even closer at first i didnt pay it any mind i carried on reading then i heard another sound a sort of scraping maybe ten minutes later then what did you do banks asked i turned the yard light on and looked out of the window but i couldnt see anything did you have the television on some music no thats why i could hear the sounds outside so clearly usually its so quiet and peaceful up here all you can hear at night is the wind through the trees and sometimes a lost sheep baaing or a curlew up on the moors werent you scared being by yourself no i like it even when i heard the noise i just thought it might be a stray dog or a sheep or something where were your parents at this time they were out its their wedding anniversary their twentyfirst they went out to dinner in eastvale you didnt want to go with them no well i mean it was their anniversary wasnt it she turned up her nose besides i dont like fancy restaurants and i dont like italian food anyway its not as if it was home alone or something i am nearly sixteen you know and it was my choice id rather stay home and read i dont mind being by myself perhaps banks guessed they hadnt invited her carry on he said after you turned the yard light on what did you do when i couldnt see anything i just sort of brushed it off then i heard another noise like a stone or something hitting the wall i was fed up of being disturbed by then so i decided to go out and see what it was you still werent frightened a bit maybe by then but not really scared i still thought it was probably an animal or something like that maybe a fox we get them sometimes then what happened i opened the front door and as soon as i stepped out someone grabbed me and dragged me back inside and tied me to the chair then they put a rag in my mouth and put tape over it i couldnt swallow properly it was all dry and it tasted of salt and oil banks noticed her knuckles had turned white around the mug he worried she would crush it how many of them were there alison he asked two do you remember anything about them she shook her head they were both dressed all in black except one of them had white trainers on the other had some sort of suede slipons brown i think you didnt see their faces alison hooked her feet over the crossbar no they had balaclavas on black ones but they werent like the ones youd buy to keep you warm they were just made of cotton or some other thin material they had little slits for the eyes and slits just under the nose so they could breathe banks noticed that she had turned paler are you all right alison he asked do you want to stop now and rest alison shook her head her teeth were clenched no ill be all right just let me she sipped some tea and seemed to relax a little how tall were they banks asked one was about as big as you she looked at banks who at only five foot nine was quite small for a policeman just over regulation height in fact but he was fatter not really fat but just not you know wiry like you the other was a few inches taller maybe six foot and quite thin youre doing really well alison banks said was there anything else about them no i cant remember did either of them speak when he dragged me back inside the smaller one said keep quiet and do as youre told and we wont hurt you did you notice his accent not really it sounded ordinary i mean not foreign or anything local yorkshire yes but not dales maybe leeds or something you know how it sounds different more citified good youre doing just fine what happened next they tied me to the chair with some rope and just sat and watched television first the news was on then some horrible american film about a psycho slashing women they seemed to like that one of them kept laughing when a woman got killed as if it was funny you heard them laugh just one of them the tall one the other one told him to shut up he sounded like he was in charge the smaller one yes thats all he said shut up yes was there anything unusual about the taller mans laugh i i dont i cant remember alison wiped a tear from her eye with the sleeve of her sweatshirt it was just a laugh thats all its all right dont worry about it did they harm you in any way alison reddened and looked down into her halfempty mug the smaller one came over to me when i was tied up and he put his hand on my breast but the other one made him stop it was the only time he said anything how did he make him stop what did he do he just said not to that it wasnt part of the deal did he use those exact words alison did he say its not part of the deal yes i think so i mean im not completely sure but it was something like that the smaller man didnt seem to like it being told what to do by the other but he left me alone after that did you see any kind of weapon banks asked yes the kind of gun that farmers have with two barrels a shotgun who had it the smaller man the one in charge did you hear a car at any time no only when mum and dad came home i mean i heard cars go by on the road sometimes you know the one that goes through relton and right over the moors into the next dale but i didnt hear anyone coming or going along our driveway what happened when your parents came home alison paused and swirled the tea in the bottom of her mug as if she were trying to see into her future it must have been about half past eleven or later the men waited behind the door and the tall one grabbed mum while the other put his gun to dads neck i tried to scream and warn them honest i did but the rag in my mouth i just couldnt make a sound she ran her sleeve across her eyes again and sniffled banks gestured to pc weaver who found a box of tissues on the windowsill and brought them over thank you alison said im sorry you dont have to go on if you dont want banks said it can wait till tomorrow no ive started i want to besides theres not much more to tell they tied mum up the same as me and we sat there facing each other then they went outside with dad then we heard the bang how long between the time they went out and the shot alison shook her head dreamily she held the mug up close to her throat the sleeves of her sweatshirt had slipped down and banks could see the raw red lines where the rope had cut into her flesh i dont know it seemed like a long time but all i can remember is we just sat looking at each other mum and me and we didnt know what was happening i remember a nightbird calling somewhere not a curlew i dont know what it was and it seemed like forever like time just stretched out and mum and i got really scared now looking at one another not knowing what was going on then we heard the explosion and and it was like it all snapped and i saw something die in mums eyes it was so so alison dropped the mug which clipped the corner of the table then fell and spilled without breaking on the floor the sobs seemed to start deep inside her then she began to shake and wail banks went over and put his arms around her and she clung onto him for dear life sobbing against his chest it looks like his office banks said when gristhorpe turned on the light in the last upstairs room two large desks formed an lshape on one of them stood a computer and a laser printer and on a small table next to them stood a fax machine with a basket attached at the front for collecting the cutoff sheets at the back of the computer desk a hutch stood against the wall the compartments were full of boxes of disks and software manuals mostly for word processing spreadsheets and accounting programs along with some for standard utilities the other desk stood in front of the window which framed a view of the farmyard sceneofcrime officers were still going about their business down there taking samples of just about everything in sight measuring distances trying to get casts of footprints sifting soil in the barn their bright arc lamps had replaced darbys roving light this was the desk where rothwell dealt with handwritten correspondence and phone calls banks guessed there was a blotter which looked new no handy wrongwayaround clues scrawled there a jamjar full of pens and pencils a blank scratchpad an electronic adding machine of the kind that produces a printed tape of its calculations and an appointment calendar open at the day of the murder may the only things written there were dr hunter beside the am slot make dinner reservation marios pm below that and written in capitals all across the afternoon flowers banks had noticed a vase full of fresh flowers in the living room an anniversary present sad when touching gestures like that outlive the giver he thought of sandra again and suddenly he wanted very much to be near her to bridge the distance that had grown between them to hold her and feel her warmth he shivered all right alan gristhorpe asked fine someone just walked over my grave look at all this gristhorpe pointed to the two metal filing cabinets and the heavyduty shelves that took up the rooms only long unbroken wall business records by the looks of it someones going to have to sift through it he looked toward the computer and grimaced wed better get phil to have a look at this lot tomorrow he said i wouldnt trust myself to turn the bloody thing on without blowing it up banks grinned he was aware of gristhorpes luddite attitude toward computers he quite liked them himself of course he had only the most rudimentary skills and never seemed to be able to do anything right but phil richmond phil the hacker as he was known around the station ought to be able to tell them a thing or two about rothwells system finding nothing else of immediate interest in the office they walked out to the rear of the house which faced north and stood in the back garden the hems of their trousers damp with dew it was after five now close to dawn a pale sun was slowly rising in the east behind a veil of thin cloud that had appeared over the last couple of hours mauve on the horizon but giving the rest of the sky a light gray wash and the landscape the look of a watercolor a few birds sang and occasionally the sound of a farm vehicle starting up broke the silence the air smelled moist and fresh it was certainly a garden they stood in and not just a backyard someone rothwell his wife had planted rows of vegetables beans cabbage lettuce all neatly marked a small area of herbs and a strawberry patch at the far end beyond a drystone wall the land fell away steeply to a beck that coursed down the daleside until it fed into the river swain at fortford the village of fortford about a mile down the hillside was just waking up below the exposed foundations of the roman fort on its knoll to the east the cottages with their flagstone roofs huddled around the green and the squaretowered church already smoke drifted from some of the chimneys as farm laborers and shopkeepers prepared themselves for the coming day country folk were early risers the whitewashed front of the sixteenthcentury rose and crown glowed pink in the early light even in there someone would soon be in the kitchen making bacon and eggs for the paying guests especially for the ramblers who liked to be off early at the thought of food his stomach rumbled he knew ian falkland the landlord of the rose and crown and thought it might not be a bad idea to have a chat with him about keith rothwell though he was an expatriate londoner like banks ian knew most of the local dalesfolk and given his line of work he picked up a fair amount of gossip finally banks turned to gristhorpe and broke the silence they certainly seemed to know what was what didnt they he said i dont imagine it was a lucky guess that the girl was in the house alone youre thinking along the same lines as i am arent you alan said gristhorpe an execution a hit call it what you will banks nodded i cant see any other lines to think along yet everything points to it the way they came in and waited the position of the body the coolness the professionalism of it all even the way one of them said touching the girl wasnt part of the deal it was all planned yes i think it was an execution it certainly wasnt a robbery or a random killing they hadnt been through the house as far as we could tell everything seems in order and if it was a robbery theyd no need to kill him especially that way the question is why why should anyone want to execute an accountant hmm said gristhorpe unhappy client maybe someone he turned in to the inland revenue nearby a peewit sensed their closeness to its ground nest and started buzzing them piping its highpitched call one of the things we have to do is find out how honest an accountant our mr rothwell was gristhorpe went on but lets not speculate too much yet alan we dont know if theres anything missing for a start rothwell might have had a million in gold bullion hidden away in his garage for all we know but youre right about the execution angle and that means we could be dealing with something very big big enough to contract a murder for sir at that moment one of the soc officers came into the garden through the back door gristhorpe turned yes weve found something sir in the garage i think youd both better come and have a look for yourselves they followed the officer back to the brightly lit garage rothwells body had mercifully been taken to the morgue where dr glendenning the home office pathologist would get to work on it as soon as he could two men from the soc team stood by the barn door one was holding something with a pair of tweezers and the other was peering at it closely what is it banks asked its wadding sir from the shotgun said the soco with the tweezers you see sir you can buy commercially made shotgun cartridges but you can also reload the shells at home plenty of farmers and recreational shooters do it saves money is that what this bloke did banks asked looks like it sir to save money typical yorkshireman like a scotsman stripped of his generosity cheeky southern bastard said gristhorpe then turned to the soco go on lad well sir i dont know how much you know about shotguns but they take cartridges not bullets banks knew that much at least and he suspected that gristhorpe from dales farming stock knew a heck of a lot more but they usually found it best to let the socos show off a bit were listening said gristhorpe emboldened by that the officer went on a shotgun shells made up of a primer a charge of gunpowder and the pellets or shot theres no slug and theres no rifling in the barrel so you cant get any characteristic markings to trace back to the weapon except from the shell of course which bears the imprint of the firing and loading mechanisms but we dont have a shell what we do have is this he held up the wadding commercial wadding is usually made of either paper or plastic and you can sometimes trace the shells manufacturer through it but this isnt commercial what exactly is it asked banks reaching out the soco passed him the tweezers and said dont know for certain yet but it looks like something from a color magazine and luckily its not too badly burned inside only charred around the edges its tightly packed but well get it unfolded and straightened out when we get it to the lab then maybe well be able to tell you the name date and page number then all well have to do is check the list of subscribers said banks and itll lead us straight to our killer dream on the soco laughed were not miracle workers sir has anyone got a magnifying glass banks asked the assembly at large and i dont want any bloody cracks about sherlock holmes one of the socos passed him a glass the rectangular kind that came with the tinyprint twovolume edition of the oxford english dictionary banks held up the wadding and examined it through the glass what he saw was an irregularly shaped wad of crumpled paper no more than about an inch across at its widest point at first he couldnt make out anything but the blackened edge of the wadded paper but it certainly looked as if it were from some kind of magazine he looked more closely turning the wadding this way and that holding it closer and further then finally the disembodied shapes coalesced into something recognizable bloody hell he muttered letting his arm fall slowly to his side what is it alan gristhorpe asked banks handed him the glass youd better have a look for yourself he said you wont believe me banks stood back and watched gristhorpe scrutinize the wadding knowing that it would be only a matter of moments before he noticed as banks had done part of a pink tongue licking a dribble of semen from the tip of an erect penis chapter traditional police wisdom has it that if a case doesnt yield leads in the first twentyfour hours then everyone is in for a long tough haul in practice of course the period doesnt always turn out to be twentyfour hours it can be twentythree nine fourteen or even fortyeight thats the problem when do you scale down your efforts the answer banks reminded himself as he dragged his weary bones into the boardroom of eastvale divisional police headquarters at ten oclock that morning is that you dont the suzy lamplugh case was a good example it started as a missingpersons report one lunchtime a young woman left the estate agents office in fulham where she worked and disappeared only after over a years intensive detective work which resulted in more than six hundred sworn statements thousands of interviews index cards and nobody knew how many manhours was the investigation wound down suzy lamplugh was never found either alive or dead by the time banks arrived at the station superintendent gristhorpe had appointed phil richmond office manager and asked him to set up the murder room where all information regarding the keith rothwell case would be carefully indexed crossreferenced and filed at first gristhorpe thought it should be established in fortford or relton close to the scene but later decided that they had better facilities at the eastvale station it was only about seven miles from fortford anyway richmond was also the only one among them who had training in the use of the holmes computer system acronym for the home office major enquiry system with a superfluous l for effect holmes wasnt without its problems especially as not all the countrys police forces used the same computer languages still if no developments occurred before long richmond s skill might prove useful gristhorpe had also given a brief press conference first thing in the morning the sooner photographs of keith rothwell and descriptions of the killers balaclavas and all were sitting beside the publics breakfast plates or flashing on their tv screens the sooner information would start to come in the news was too late for that mornings papers but it would make local radio and television the yorkshire evening post and tomorrows national dailies of course gristhorpe had given hardly any details about the murder itself at first he had even resisted the idea of releasing rothwells name after all there had been no formal identification and they didnt have his fingerprints on file for comparison on the other hand there was little doubt as to what had happened and they were hardly going to drag alison or her mother along to the mortuary to identify the remains gristhorpe had also been in touch with the antiterrorist squad at scotland yard yorkshire was far from a stranger to ira action people still remembered the m bomb in when a coach carrying british servicemen and their families was blown up killing eleven and wounding fourteen many even claimed to have heard the explosion from as far away as leeds and bradford more recently two policemen had been shot by ira members during a routine traffic check on the a the antiterrorist squad would be able to tell gristhorpe whether rothwell had any connections however tenuous that would make him a target as an accountant he could for example have been handling money for a terrorist group in addition forensic information and details of the modus operandi would be made known to the squad who would see if the information matched anything on file while gristhorpe handled the news media and richmond set up the murder room banks and susan gay had conducted a breakfasttime housetohouse of relton and fortford including a visit to the rose and crown and a generous breakfast from ian falkland trying to find out a bit about rothwell and whether anyone had seen or heard anything unusual on the night of the murder gristhorpe richmond and susan gay were already in the room when banks arrived and poured himself a large black coffee the conference room was nicknamed the boardroom because of its wellpolished heavy oval table and ten stiffbacked chairs not to mention the coarsetextured burgundy wallpaper which gave the room a constant aura of semidarkness and the large oil painting in ornate gilt frame of one of eastvales most successful nineteenthcentury wool merchants looking decidedly sober and stiff in his tightfitting suit and starched collar right said gristhorpe time to get up to date alan banks slipped a few sheets of paper from his briefcase and rubbed his eyes not much so far im afraid rothwell was trained as an accountant at least weve got that much confirmed some of the locals in relton and fortford knew him but not well apparently he was a quiet sort of bloke kept to himself who did he work for selfemployed we got this from ian falkland landlord of the rose and crown in fortford he said rothwell used to drop by now and then for a quick jar before dinner never had more than a couple of halves wellliked quiet decent sort of chap anyway he used to work for hatchard and pratt the eastvale firm until he started his own business falkland used him for the pubs accounts i gather rothwell saved him a bob or two from the inland revenue banks scratched the small scar by his right eye theres a bit more to it than that though he went on falkland got the impression that rothwell owned a few businesses as well and that accountancy was becoming more of a sideline for him we couldnt get any more than that but well be having a close look at his office today gristhorpe nodded and thats about it banks said the rothwell family had been living at arkbeck farm for almost five years they used to live in eastvale he looked at his watch im going out to arkbeck farm again after this meeting im hoping mrs rothwell will have recovered enough to tell us something about what happened good any leads on the two men not yet but susan spoke to someone who thinks he saw a car gristhorpe looked at susan thats right sir she said it was around sunset last night before it got completely dark a retired schoolteacher from fortford was coming back home after visiting his daughter in pateley bridge he said he liked to take the lonely roads over the moors where did he see this car at the edge of the moors above relton sir it was parked in a turnoff just a dip by the side of the road i think it used to be an old drovers track but its not used anymore and only the bit by the road is clear the rest has been taken over by moorland anyway sir the thing is that the way the road curves in a wide semicircle around the farm this spot would only be about a quarter of a mile away on foot remember that copse opposite the farmhouse well its the same one that straggles up the daleside as far as this turnoff it would provide excellent cover if someone wanted to get to the farm without being seen and alison wouldnt have heard the car approaching if it had been parked way up on the road sounds promising said gristhorpe did the witness notice anything about the car yes sir he said it looked like an old escort it was a light color for some reason he thought pale blue and there was either rust or mud or grass around the lower chassis its hardly the bloody stretchlimousine you associate with hit men is it gristhorpe said more of a yorkshire version said banks gristhorpe laughed aye better follow it up then susan get a description of the car out i dont suppose your retired schoolteacher happened to see two men dressed in black carrying a shotgun did he susan grinned no sir rothwell didnt do any farming himself did he gristhorpe asked banks no only that vegetable patch we saw at the back he rented out the rest of his land to neighboring farmers theres a fellow i know farms up near relton i want to talk to pat clifford he should know if there were any problems in that area good said gristhorpe as you know a lot of locals dont like newcomers buying up empty farms and not using them properly gristhorpe banks knew had lived in the farmhouse above lyndgarth all his life perhaps he had even been born there he had sold off most of the land after his parents died and kept only enough for a small garden and for his chief offduty indulgence a drystone wall he worked on periodically which went nowhere and fenced nothing in anyway gristhorpe went on theres been some bad feeling i cant see a local farmer hiring a couple of killers people like to take care of their own around these parts but stranger things have happened and remember shotguns are common as cowclap around farms anything on that wadding yet banks shook his head the labs still working on it ive already asked west yorkshire to make a few enquiries at the kind of places that sell that sort of magazine i talked to ken blackstone at millgarth in leeds hes a di there and an old mate good said gristhorpe then turned to richmond phil why dont you go up to arkbeck farm with alan and have a look at rothwells computer before you get bogged down managing the office yes sir do you think we should have it brought in after ive had a quick look gristhorpe nodded aye good idea he scratched his pockmarked cheek look phil i know youre supposed to be leaving us for the yard at the end of the week but its all right sir richmond said i understand ill stick around as long as you need me good lad susan did you find anything interesting in the appointment book susan gay shook her head not yet sir he had a doctors appointment for yesterday morning with dr hunter i called the office and it appears he kept it routine physical no problems im working my way through he didnt write much down or maybe he kept it on computer but theres a few names to check out mostly local businesses i must say though sir he didnt exactly have a full appointment book there are plenty of empty days maybe he didnt need the money maybe he could afford to pick and choose have a word with someone at his old firm hatchard and pratt theyre just on market street they might be able to tell us something about his background gristhorpe looked at his watch okay weve all got plenty to do better get to it im afraid my mothers still in bed alison told banks at arkbeck farm i told her you were here she shrugged that was odd banks thought surely a mother would want to comfort her daughter and protect her from prying policemen have you remembered anything else he asked alison rothwell looked worn out and worried to death she wore her hair unwashed and a little greasy tied back emphasizing her broad forehead a plain white tshirt and stonewashed designer jeans she sat with her legs tucked under her and as she talked she fiddled with a ring on the little finger of her right hand i dont know she said the lisp made her sound like a little girl they sat in a small cheerful room at the back of the house with ivorypainted walls and wedgwood blue upholstery a bookcase stood against one wall mostly full of paperbacks their spines a riot of orange green and black against the wall opposite stood an upright piano with a highly lacquered cherrywood finish on top of it stood an untidy pile of sheet music wpc smithies who had stayed with the rothwells sat discreetly in a corner notebook open phil richmond was upstairs in keith rothwells study clicking away on the computer the large bay window open about a foot to let in the birdsongs and fresh air looked out over fortford and the dale beyond it was a familiar enough view to banks he had seen it from maggies farm on the other side of relton and from the house of a man called adam harkness on the valley bottom the sight never failed to impress though even on a dull day like today with the graybrown ruins of devraulx abbey poking through the trees of its grounds the village of lyndgarth clustered around its lopsided green and towering over the patchwork of pale green fields and drystone walls that rose steeply to the heights the forbidding line of aldington edge a long limestone scar streaked with fissures from top to bottom like gleaming skeletons teeth i know its painful to remember banks went on but we need all the help we can get if were to catch these men i know im sorry do you remember hearing any sounds between the time they went outside and when you heard the bang alison frowned i dont think so no sounds of a struggle or screaming no it was all so quiet thats what i remember no talking i didnt hear any and you dont know how long they were out there before the explosion no i was scared and i was worried mum was sitting facing me i could see how frightened she was but i couldnt do anything i just felt so powerless when it was all over did you hear any sounds then i dont think so try to remember did you hear what direction they went off in no any sounds of a car she paused i think i heard a car door shut but i cant be sure i mean i didnt hear it drive away but i think i kept sort of drifting in and out i think i heard a sound like the slam of a car door in the distance do you know which direction it came from further up the daleside i think relton way good now can you remember anything else about the men one of them the one who touched me ive been thinking about it he had big brown eyes a sort of light hazel color and watery theres a word for it like a dog spaniel yes thats it spaniel eyes or puppy dog he had puppydog eyes but theyre usually you know they usually make you feel sorry for the person but these didnt they were cruel did either of the men say anything else no did they go anywhere else in the house any other rooms no did you see them take anything at all alison shook her head when your father saw them and later went outside with them how did he seem what do you mean was he surprised when he first came in and they grabbed him yes but after i i dont know he didnt do anything or say anything he just stood there do you think he recognized the men how could he they were all covered up did he seem surprised after the immediate shock had worn off i dont think he did no just resigned was he expecting them i i dont know i dont think so do you think he knew them knew why they were there how could he she spoke with such disbelief that banks wondered if she had noticed that her father really wasnt so shocked or surprised and it confused her do you think he knew what was happening he pressed why it was happening maybe no i dont know he couldnt possibly could he she screwed up her eyes i cant see it that clearly i dont want to see it clearly all right alison its all right im sorry but i have to ask i know i dont mean to be a crybaby she rubbed her bare arm over her eyes youre being very brave just one more question about what happened and then well move on okay okay did your father go quietly or did they have to force him no he just walked out with them he didnt say anything did he look frightened he didnt look anything she reddened and he didnt do anything he just left mum and me all tied up and let them take him and and kill him like an animal all right alison calm down how did you get free from the chair after theyd gone alison sniffled and blew her nose it was a long time she said finally hours maybe some of the time i just sat there but not really there if you know what i mean i think mum had fainted theyd really tied us tight and i couldnt feel my hands properly as she spoke she rubbed at her wrists still ringed by the burnmarks in the end i tipped my chair and crawled over near the table where my mothers sewing basket was i knew there were scissors in there i had to rub my hands for a long time so they could feel properly and i dont know how but in the end i cut the rope then i untied mum she shifted her position im worried about mum shes not herself she doesnt want to eat whats going to happen to her im all right alison dear theres no need to worry the voice came from the doorway and banks turned for his first glance of mrs rothwell she was a tall woman with short gray hair and fineboned angular features the small nose perhaps just a little too sharply chiselled there seemed an unusually wide space banks thought between her nose and her thin upper lip which gave her tilted head a haughty imperious aspect banks could see where alison got her small mouth from her chestnutbrown eyes looked dull tranquilizers prescribed by dr burns banks guessed they would help to explain her listless movements too her skin was pale as if drained of blood though banks could tell she had put some makeup on in fact she had made a great effort to look her best she wore black silk slacks over her thin boyish hips and a cableknit jumper in a rainbow pattern which looked to bankss untutored eye like an exclusive design at least he had never seen one like it before even in her sedated grief there was something controlled commanding and attentiondemanding about her a kind of tightly reinedin power she sat down in the other armchair crossed her legs and clasped her hands on her lap banks noticed the chunky rings on her fingers diamond clusters a large ruby and a broad gold wedding band banks introduced himself and expressed his condolences she inclined her head slightly in acceptance im afraid i have some difficult questions for you mrs rothwell he said not about last night she said one bejewelled hand going to her throat i cant talk about it i feel faint my voice goes and i just cant talk mummy said alison ive told him about about that havent i and she looked at banks as if daring him to disagree yes he said actually it wasnt that i wanted to ask about specifically its just that we need more information on your husbands movements and activities can you help she nodded im sorry chief inspector im not usually such a mess she touched her hair i must look dreadful banks murmured a compliment did your husband have any enemies that you knew of he asked no none at all but then he didnt bore me with the details of his business i really had no idea what kind of people he dealt with her accent banks noticed was eastvale filtered through elocution lessons elocution lessons he hadnt thought people took those in this day and age so he never brought his business home so to speak no did he travel much do you mean abroad anywhere well he did go abroad now and then on business and of course wed holiday in mexico hawaii or bermuda he also travelled a lot locally in the course of business he was away a lot where did he go oh all over leeds manchester liverpool birmingham bristol sometimes to london europe he had a very important job he was a brilliant financial analyst much in demand he could pick and choose his clients could keith he didnt have to take just any old thing that came along you mentioned financial analysis what exactly did he do she picked at the wool on her sleeve with long bony fingers as i said he didnt tell me much about work not about the details anyway he qualified as a chartered accountant of course but that was only part of it he had a genius for figures he advised people what to do with their money helped businesses out of difficulties i suppose he was a kind of troubleshooter if you like a very exclusive one he didnt need any new clients and people only found out about him by word of mouth that all sounded sufficiently vague to be suspicious to banks on the other hand what did he do investigate crimes yes but to do so he chatted with locals over a pint interviewed bereaved relatives pored over fingerprints and blood samples it would all sound rather nebulous and aimless to an outsider and you never met any of his business associates we had people for dinner occasionally but we never talked business maybe if you have a moment later you could make a list of those you entertained most frequently she raised her eyebrows if you want now mrs rothwell banks said wishing he could have a cigarette in what was obviously a nonsmoking household this next question may strike you as rather indelicate but were there any problems in the family of course not were a happy family arent we alison alison looked at banks yes mother she said banks turned back to mrs rothwell had your husband been behaving at all unusually recently he asked had you noticed any changes in him she frowned he had been a bit edgy tense a bit more preoccupied and secretive than usual i mean he was always quiet but hed been even more so for how long she shrugged two or three weeks but he never told you what was wrong no did you ask my husband didnt appreciate people prying into his private business affairs chief inspector not even his wife i assumed that if and when he wanted to tell me he would do so what did you talk about over dinner yesterday she shrugged just the usual things the children the house extension we wanted to have done i dont know really what do you talk about when youre out for dinner with your wife good question banks thought it had been so long since he and sandra had gone out to dinner together that he couldnt remember what they talked about did you have any idea what he might have been worried about he asked no i suppose it was one of the usual business problems keith really cared about his clients what business problems i thought he didnt talk to you about business he didnt chief inspector please dont twist what i say he just made the occasional offhand comment you know maybe hed read something in the financial times or something and make a comment i never understood what he meant anyway i think one of the companies he was trying to help was sinking fast things like that always upset him do you know which company no itll be on his computer he put everything on that computer suddenly mrs rothwell put the back of one ringed hand to her forehead in what seemed to banks a gesture from a nineteenthcentury melodrama her forehead looked clammy im afraid i cant talk anymore she whispered i feel a bit faint and dizzy i alison alison helped her up and they left the room banks glanced over at wpc smithies have you picked up anything at all from them he asked sorry sir she said nothing ill tell you one thing though theyre a weird pair its an odd family i think theyre both retreating from reality in their own ways trying to deny what happened or how it happened but you can see that for yourself yes banks listened to a clock tick on the mantelpiece it was one of those timepieces with all its brass and silver innards showing inside a glass dome a couple of minutes later alison came back im sorry she said mummys still weak and in shock the doctor gave her some pills thats understandable alison said banks id almost finished anyway just one last question do you know where your brother is well have to get in touch with him alison picked up a postcard from the top of the piano gave it to banks and sat down again the card showed the san francisco golden gate bridge which looked orange to banks he flipped it over postmarked two weeks ago it read dear ali love california and san francisco is a great city but its time to move on im even getting used to driving on the wrong side of the road this sightseeings a tiring business so im off to florida for a couple of weeks just lying in the sun ah what bliss also to check out the motion picture conservatory in sarasota im driving down the coast highway and flying to tampa from la on sunday more news when i get there love to mum tom how long has he been gone six weeks just over he left on march st what does he do what was that about a motion picture conservatory alison gave a brief smile he wants to work in films he worked in a video shop and saved up hes hoping to go to film college in america and learn how to become a director how old is he twentyone banks stood up all right alison he said thanks very much for all your help wpc smithies will be staying here for a while so if you need anyone and ill ask the doctor to pay your mother another visit thank you please dont worry about us banks looked in on richmond who sat bathed in the bluish glow of rothwells monitor oblivious to the world then went out to his car and lit a cigarette he rolled the window down and listened to the birds as he smoked birds aside it was bloody quiet up here how he wondered could a teenager like alison stand the isolation as wpc smithies had said the rothwells were an odd family as he drove along the bumpy track to the relton road he slipped in a tape of dr john playing solo new orleans piano music he had developed a craving for piano music any kind of piano music recently he was even thinking of taking piano lessons he wanted to learn how to play everything classical jazz blues the only thing that held him back was that he felt too old to embark on such a venture his fortyfirst birthday was coming up in a couple of weeks in relton a couple of old ladies holding shopping baskets stood chatting outside the butchers shop probably about the murder banks thought again about alison rothwell and her mother as he pulled up outside the black sheep what were they holding back and what was it that bothered him no matter what mrs rothwell and alison had said there was something wrong in that family and he had a hunch that tom rothwell might know what it was the sooner they contacted him the better laurence pratt delved deep in his bottom drawer and pulled out a bottle of courvoisier vsop and two snifters im sorry he apologized to dc susan gay who sat opposite him at the broad teak desk its not that im a secret tippler i keep it for emergencies and im afraid what youve just told me most definitely constitutes one youll join me no thank you not on duty sometimes susan said but not today very well he poured himself a generous measure swirled it and took a sip a little color came back to his cheeks ah thats better if we could get back to mr rothwell sir yes yes of course but you must understand miss miss gay sir dc gay she saw the inadvertent smile flash across his face people often smiled like that when she introduced herself gay had been a perfectly good name when she was a kid her nickname for a while had been happy gay but now its meaning was no longer the same one clever bugger had actually asked did you say ac or dc gay she comforted herself with the thought that he was doing three to five in strangeways thanks largely to her court evidence yes he went on a frown quickly displacing the smile id heard about keiths death of course on the radio this lunchtime but they didnt say how it happened thats a bit of a shock to be honest you see i knew keith quite well im only about three years older than he and we worked here together for some years he left the firm five years ago is that right about right a big move like that takes quite a bit of planning quite a bit of organizing there were client files to be transferred that sort of thing and he had the house to think of too he was a partner yes my father jeremiah pratt was one of the founders of the firm hes retired now i understand the family used to live in eastvale is that right yes quite a nice house out toward the york roundabout catterick street why did they move mary always fancied living in the country i dont know why she wasnt any kind of nature girl i think perhaps she wanted to play lady of the manor oh whys that pratt shrugged just her nature what about her husband keith didnt mind i should imagine he liked the solitude i dont mean he was exactly antisocial but he was never a great mixer not lately anyway he travelled a lot too pratt was in his midforties susan guessed which did indeed make him just a few years older than keith rothwell quite goodlooking with a strong jaw and gray eyes he wore his white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and his mauve and green tie clipped with what looked like a silver american dollar sign his hairline was receding and what hair remained was gray at the temples he wore blackframed glasses which sat about halfway down his nose did you ever visit him there yes my wife and i dined with the rothwells on several occasions were you friends pratt took another sip of cognac put his hand out and waggled it from side to side hmm somewhere between friends and colleagues id say why did he leave hatchard and pratt pratt broke eye contact and looked into the liquid he swirled in his snifter ambition maybe straightforward accountancy bored him he was fond of abstractions very good with figures he certainly had a flair for financial management very creative does that imply fraudulent pratt looked up at her she couldnt read his expression i resent that implication he said was there any bad feeling i dont know what you mean when he left the firm had there been any arguments any problems good lord this was five years ago even so pratt adopted a stiffer tone no of course there hadnt everything was perfectly amicable we were sorry to lose him of course but he wasnt fired or anything no did he take any clients with him pratt shuffled in his chair there will always be clients who feel they owe their loyalty to an individual member of the firm rather than to the firm as a whole are you sure this didnt cause bad feeling no of course not while its unprofessional to solicit clients and woo them away most firms do accept that they will lose some business whenever a popular member leaves to set up on his own say for example you visit a particular dentist in a group practice you feel comfortable with him he understands how you feel about dentists you feel safe with him if he left and set up on his own would you go with him or stay and take your chances susan smiled i see what you mean do you think you could provide me with a list of names of the clients he took pratt chewed his lower lip for a moment as if debating the ethics of such a request then said i dont see why not you could find out from his records anyway thank you he must have made a fair bit of money somehow susan said how did he do it pratt who if truth be told susan thought suppressing a giggle might not be entirely happy about his name either made a steeple of his hairy hands the same way we all do i assume he said hard work good investments excellent service arkbeck farm was in pretty poor shape when they bought it you know it didnt cost a fortune and hed no trouble arranging a fair mortgage he put a lot into that house over the years susan looked at her notes and frowned as if she were having trouble reading or understanding them i understand mr rothwell actually owned a number of businesses do you know anything about this pratt shook his head not really i understand he was interested in property development as i said keith was an astute businessman did mrs rothwell work mary good heavens no well not in the sense that she went out and made money mary was a housewife all the way well perhaps house manager or lady of leisure would be a more appropriate term as she didnt actually do the work herself except for the garden you must have seen arkbeck how clean it is how well appointed im afraid i had other things on my mind when i was there sir susan said but i know what you mean pratt nodded for mary he went on everything centered around the home the family and the immediate community everything had to be just so to look just right and it had to be seen to look that way i imagine she was a hard taskmaster or should that be taskmistress of course she didnt spend all her time in the house there were the womens institute the church committees the good works and the charities mary kept very busy i can assure you good works charities there was something positively victorian about this susan pictured an earnest woman striding from hovel to hovel in a flurry of garments long dress trailing in the mud distributing alms to the peasants and preaching selfimprovement yes she collected for a number of good causes you know the rspca nspcc cancer heart foundation and the like nothing political i mean no ban the bomb or anything and nothing controversial like aids research just the basics she was the bosss daughter after all she had certain conservative standards to keep up the bosss daughter yes didnt you know her maiden name was mary hatchard she was old man hatchards daughter hes dead now of course so keith rothwell married the bosss daugher susan mused aloud i dont suppose that did his career any harm no it didnt but that was more good luck than good management if you ask me keith didnt just marry the bosss daughter he got her pregnant first with tom as it turns out then he married her how did that go over pratt paused and picked up a paperclip not very well at first old man hatchard was mad as hell he kept the lid on it pretty well of course and after hed had time to consider it i think he was glad to get her off his hands he could hardly have her married to a mere junior though so keith came up pretty quickly through the ranks to full partner pratt twisted the paperclip he seemed to be enjoying this game susan thought he was holding back toying with her she had a sense that if she didnt ask exactly the right questions she wouldnt get the answers she needed the problem was she didnt know what the right questions were they sat in his office over winstons tobacconists looking out on north market street and susan could hear the muted traffic sounds through the doubleglazing look pratt went on i realize im the one being questioned but could you tell me how mary is and alison i do regard myself as something of a friend of the family and if theres anything i can do thank you sir ill make sure they know can you think of any reason anyone might have for killing mr rothwell no i cant not in the way you described what do you mean well i suppose i could imagine a burglar say perhaps killing someone who got in the way you read about it in the papers especially these days or an accident some kids joyriding but this it sounds like an assassination to me when was the last time you saw him about a month ago no earlier in march i think shortly after st patricks day the wife and i went for dinner marys a splendid cook did they entertain frequently not that i know of they had occasional small dinner parties maximum six people keith didnt like socializing much but mary loved to show off the house especially if shed acquired a new piece of furniture or something so they compromised last time it was the kitchen we had to admire they used to have a countrystyle one aga and all but someone started poking fun at agalouts in the papers so mary got annoyed and went for the modern look i see what about the son tom what do you know of him tom hes travelling in america i understand good for him nothing like travel when youre young before you get too tied down tom was always a cheerful and polite kid as far as i was concerned no trouble not in any real sense no i mean he wasnt into drugs or any of that weird stuff at worst id say he was a bit uncertain about what he wanted to do with his life and his father was perhaps just a little impatient in what way he wanted tom to go into business or law something solid and respectable like that and tom toms the artsy type but hes a bright lad with his personality he could go almost anywhere he just doesnt know where yet after he left school he drifted a bit still is doing it seems would you say there was friction between them you cant be suggesting im not suggesting anything susan leaned back in the chair look mr pratt as far as we know tom rothwell is somewhere in the usa were trying to find him but it could take time the reason im asking you all these questions is because we need to know everything about keith rothwell yes of course im sorry but what with the shock of keiths death and you asking about tom susan leaned forward again is there any reason she asked why you should think i was putting forward tom as a suspect stop trying to read between the lines theres nothing written there it was just the way you were asking about him thats all tom and his father had the usual fatherson arguments but nothing more where did tom get the money for a trip to america what i dont know saved up i suppose you say you last saw keith rothwell in march yes have you spoken with him at all since then no did he seem in any way different from usual then worried about anything nervous no not that i can remember it was a perfectly normal evening mary cooked duck à lorange tom dropped in briefly all excited about his trip alison stayed in her room did she usually do that alisons a sweet child but shes a real loner very secretive takes after her father shes a bit of a bookworm too what did you talk about that evening oh i cant remember the usual stuff politics europe the economy holiday plans who else was there just us this time and mr rothwell said nothing that caused you any concern no he was quiet unusually so he was usually quiet secretive pratt swivelled his chair and gazed out of the window at the upper story of the victorian community center susan followed his gaze she was surprised to see a number of gargoyles there she had never noticed before when he spoke again pratt still didnt look at susan she could see him only in profile ive always felt that about him yes he said thats why i hesitated to call him a close friend there was always something in reserve he turned to face susan again and placed his hands palms down on the desk oh years ago wed let loose once in a while go get blind drunk and not give a damn sometimes wed go fishing together but over time keith sort of reined himself in cut himself off i dont really know how to explain this it was just a feeling keith was a very private person well lots of people are but the thing was i had no idea what he lived for did he suffer from depression did you think pratt waved a hand no no youre getting me wrong he wasnt suicidal thats not what i meant can you try and explain ill try its hard though i mean id be hard pushed to say what i live for too theres the wife and kids of course my pride and joy and we like to go hanggliding over semerwater on suitable weekends i collect antiques i love cricket and we like to explore new places on our holidays see what i mean none of thats what i actually live for but its all part of it he took off his glasses and rubbed the back of his hand over his eyes and the bridge of his nose then put them back on again i know im getting too philosophical but i told you it was hard to explain susan smiled im still listening well all those are just things arent they possessions or activities things we do things we care about but theres something behind them all that ties them all together into my life who i am what i am with keith you never knew he was a cipher for example im sure he loved his family but he never really showed it or spoke much about it i dont know what really mattered to him he never talked about hobbies or anything like that i dont know what he did in his spare time its more than being private or secretive its as if there was a dimension missing a man with a hole in the middle he scratched his temple this is ridiculous please forgive me keith was a perfectly nice bloke wouldnt hurt a fly but you never really knew what gripped him about life what his dream was i mean mines a villa in portugal but a dream doesnt have to be a thing does it i dont know maybe he valued abstractions too much he paused as if he had run out of breath and ideas susan didnt really know what to jot down but she finally settled for dimension missing interests and concerns elusive it would do she had a good memory for conversations and could recount verbatim most of what pratt had said if banks wished to hear it lets get back to mr rothwells work with your firm is there anything you can tell me about his style shall we say his business practices you want to know if keith was a crook dont you she did of course though that wasnt why she was asking still she thought never look a gift horse in the mouth she gave him a you caught me at it smile well was he of course not oh come on mr pratt surely in your business you must sail a little close to the wind at times i resent that remark especially coming from a policeman susan let that one slip by touché she said pratt seemed pleased enough with himself let him feel hes winning she thought then hell tell you anyway just to show he holds the power to do so she was still sure he was holding something back but seriously mr pratt she went on im not just playing games bandying insults if there was anything at all unusual in mr rothwells business dealings i hardly need tell you it could have a bearing on his murder hmm pratt swirled the rest of the brandy and tossed it back he put the snifter in his out tray no doubt for the secretary to take and wash i stand by what i said he went on keith rothwell never did anything truly illegal that i knew of certainly nothing that could be relevant to his death but he sighed well maybe i wasnt entirely truthful earlier i suppose id better tell you about it hadnt i youre bound to find out somehow susan turned her page im listening she said chapter the black sheep was the closest swainsdale had to a wellkept secret most tourists were put off by the pubs external shabbiness those who prided themselves on not judging a book by its cover would more often than not pop their heads around the door see the even shabbier interior and leave the renowned surliness of the landlord larry grafton kept them away in droves too there was a rumor that larry had once refused to serve an american tourist with a glenmorangie and ginger objecting to the utter lack of taste that led her to ask for such a concoction banks believed it larry was dales born and bred not one of the new landlords up from london so many were recent immigrants these days like ian falkland in the rose and crown that was a tourist pub if ever there was one banks thought probably selling more lager and lime pork scratchings and microwaved curries than anything else the black sheep didnt advertise its pub grub but anyone who knew about it could get as thick and fresh a ham and piccalilli sandwich as ever theyd want from elsie larrys wife and on some days if her arthritis hadnt been bothering her too much and she felt like cooking she could do you a fryup so good you could feel your arteries hardening as you ate as usual the public bar was empty apart from one table of old men playing dominoes and a couple of young farmhands reading the sports news in the daily mirror as banks had expected pat clifford also stood propping up the bar pat was a hard stout man with a round head stubble for hair and a rough red face burned by the sun and whipped by the wind and rain for fifty years hello stranger said pat as banks stood next to him long time no see banks apologized for his absence and brought up the subject of keith rothwell so tha only comes when tha wants summat is that it pat said but he said it with a smile and over the years banks had learned that yorkshire folk often take the sting out of their criticisms that way they put a sting in their compliments too on those rare occasions they get around to giving any in this case banks guessed that pat wasnt mortally offended at his protracted absence he only wanted to make a point of it let banks know his feelings and then get on with things banks acknowledged his culpability with a mild protest about the pressures of work as expected then listened to a minute or so of pats complaining about how the elderly and isolated were neglected by all and sundry when pats glass was empty an event which occurred with alarming immediacy at the end of the diatribe bankss offer to buy him another was grudgingly accepted pat took a couple of sips put the glass down on the bar and wiped his lips with the back of his grimy hand he came in once or twice did mr rothwell local like nobody objected how often once a week mebbe sometimes twice larry and he asked the landlord the same question larry who hardly had a charabanc full of thirsty customers to serve came over and stood with them he still treated banks with a certain amount of disdain after all banks was a southerner and a copper but he showed respect too banks had never tried too hard to fit in to pretend he was one of the crowd like some of the other incomers he knew there was nothing annoyed a dalesman so much as pretentiousness airs and graces and that there was nothing more contemptible or condescending than a southerner appropriating dales speech and ways playing the expert on a place he had only just come to banks kept his distance kept his counsel and in return he was accorded that particular yorkshire brand of grudging acceptance just at lunchtimes like larry said never saw him of an evening hed come in for one of elsies sandwiches and always drink half a pint just one half mind you did he talk much larry drifted off to dry some glasses and pat picked up the threads nay he werent much of a chatterbox werent mr rothwell bit of a dry stick if you ask me what do you mean was he stuckup noo just had nowt to talk abaht thats all he tapped the side of his nose if you listen as much as i do he said you soon find out what interests people theres not much when it comes down to it tha knows he started counting on the stubby fingers that stuck out of his cutoff gloves telly thats number one sport number two and sex thats number three after that theres nobbut money and weather left banks smiled what about politics he asked pat pulled a face only when them daft buggers in tcommon market ave been up to summat with their common agricultural policy then he grinned showing stained crooked teeth aye i suppose thats often enough these days he admitted counting it off politics number four and what did mr rothwell talk about when he was here banks asked nowt thats what im telling thee lad oh i spose seeing as he was an accountant he was interested in money but he kept that to himself hed be standing there all right just where you are munching on his sandwich supping his halfpint and nodding in all the right places but he never had owt to say it seemed to me as if he were really somewhere else and he didnt know neighbours from coronation street if you ask me or leeds united from northampton theres not a lot of difference as far as their performances go over the last few weeks if you ask me pat pat grunted so you didnt really know keith rothwell banks asked no nobody did thats right mr banks added larry as he stood by them to pull a pint he said he came for the company what with working alone at home and all that but i reckon as he came to get away from that there wife of his then he was gone bearing the pint banks turned to pat what did he mean ah take no notice of him pat said with a dismissive wave in graftons direction mebbe he was a bit henpecked at that it must be hard working at home when the wifes around all the time never get a minutes peace you wouldnt but larrys lass cathy did for mrs rothwell now and again like and she says she were a bit of an interfering mistress if you know what i mean standing over young cathy while she worked and saying that werent done right or that needed a bit more elbow grease i nobbut met mrs rothwell once or twice but my grace speaks well of her and thats enough for me banks thought he might have a word with larrys lass cathy he noticed pats empty glass another oh aye thank you very much banks bought him a pint but decided to forgo a second himself much as the idea appealed there were one time when i comes to think on it pat said that mr rothwell seemed a bit odd when was this abaht two or three weeks ago he came in one lunchtime as usual like but he must have had a couple of pints not alves anyroad he got quite chatty told a couple of jokes and we all had a good chuckle didnt we larry aye shouted larry from down the bar that sounded odd to banks according to mrs rothwell her husband had been tense and edgy over the past three weeks if he could chat and laugh at the black sheep then maybe the problem had been at home is that all he asked all well it were summat for us to see him enjoying himself for once id say that were enough wouldnt you did he say anything unusual no he just acted like an ordinary person an ordinary happy person as if hed received some good news or something he didnt say owt about that banks gave up and moved on i know theres been a bit of ill feeling among the hillfarmers about incomers lately he said did any of it spill over to mr rothwell pat sniffed you wouldnt understand mr banks he said softly offering an unfiltered cigarette banks refused it and lit a silk cut its not that theres any ill feeling as such we just dont know where we stand how to plan for the future one day the government says this the next day its something else agricultural policy europe grugh he spat on the floor to show his feelings either nobody noticed or the practice was perfectly welcome in the black sheep another reason why people stayed away it needs years of experience to do it right does hillfarming pat went on continuity passed on from father to son when too many farms fall to weekenders and holidaymakers pasture gets abused walls get neglected live and let live thats what i say but we want some respect and some understanding and right now were not getting any but what about the incomers aye hold thy horses lad im getting to them were not bloody parkkeepers tha knows we dont graft for hours on end in all tweather god sends keeping stone walls in good repair because we think they look picturesque tha knows theyre to keep old harry cobbs sheep off my pasture and to make sure theres no hankypanky between his breed and mine banks nodded fair enough pat but how deep did the feeling go keith rothwell bought that farm five years ago or thereabouts ive seen what hes done to it and its not a farm anymore aye well at least mr rothwells a swainsdale lad even if he did come from eastvale nay there were no problems he sold off his land i got some of it and so did frank rowbottom if youre thinking me or frank did it then no nothing like that banks said i just wanted to get a sense of how rothwell fitted in with the local scene if he did well he did and he didnt said pat he was here and he wasnt and thats all i can tell thee he could tell a joke well enough when he put his mind to it though pat chuckled at the memory as puzzled as he was before banks said goodbye and went outside on the way back he slipped in a cassette of busonis bach transcriptions the precise ordered music had no influence on the chaos of his thoughts back in his office banks first glanced at dr glendennings postmortem notes generally there was no such thing as a preliminary postmortem report but dr glendenning usually condescended to send over the main points in laymans language as quickly as possible he also liked to appear at the scene but this time he had been staying overnight with friends in harrogate there was nothing in the notes that banks hadnt expected rothwell hadnt been poisoned before he was shot the stomach contents revealed only pasta and red wine dr glendenning gave cause of death as a shotgun wound to the occipital region the back of the head most likely a contact wound given the massive damage to bone and tissue he also noted that it was lucky they already knew who the victim was as there wasnt enough connected bone or tissue left to reconstruct the face and though the tooth fragments could probably be collected and analyzed it would take a bloody long time the blood group was o which matched that supplied by rothwells doctor as well as that of about half the population rothwell had most likely been killed in the place and position they found him dr glendenning pointed out because what blood remained had collected as purplish hypostasis around the upper chest and the ragged edges of the neck he estimated time of death between eleven and one the previous night a cadaveric spasm had caused rothwell to grab and hold onto a handful of dust at the moment of death and banks thought of the ts eliot quotation i will show you fear in a handful of dust which he had come across as the title of an evelyn waugh novel rothwell had been in generally good shape dr glendenning said and the only evidence of any ill health was an appendix scar rothwells doctor dr hunter was able to verify that rothwell had had his appendix removed just over three years ago when banks had finished he phoned sandra to say he didnt know when he would be home she said that didnt surprise her then he went over to the window and looked down on the cobbled market square most of which was covered by parked cars the gold hands against the blue face of the church clock stood at a quarter to four banks lit a cigarette and watched the local merchants taking deliveries and the tourists snapping pictures of the ancient market cross and the norman church front it was fine enough weather out there sports jacket warm but the gray wash that had come at dawn still obscured the sunshine on bankss dalesman calendar the may photograph showed a field of brilliant pink and purple flowers below great shunner fell in swaledale so far the real may had been struggling against showers and cool temperatures sitting at his rattly metal desk banks next opened the envelope of rothwells pocket contents and spread them out in front of him there were a few business cards in a leather slipcase describing rothwell as a financial consultant in his wallet were three credit cards including an american express gold the receipt from marios on the night of his anniversary dinner receipts from austicks bookshop a computer supplies shop and two restaurants all from leeds and all dated the previous week and photos of alison and mary rothwell happy families indeed in cash rothwell had a hundred and five pounds in his wallet in new twenties and one crumpled old fiver other pockets revealed a handkerchief good quality silk and monogrammed kar like the cufflinks on the body bmw keys house keys a small pack of rennies two buttons a gold cross fountain pen an empty leatherbound notebook and horror of horrors a packet of ten benson and hedges six of which had been smoked banks felt a surge of respect for the late keith rothwell but perhaps the cigarettes helped to explain something too banks was certain that mary rothwell would never have permitted her husband to pollute the house with his filthy habit smoking then could be the main reason he liked to sneak off to the black sheep or the rose and crown every now and then it certainly wasnt drinking a secret smoker then or did she know he found no gold lighter only a sulfurous old box of pilot matches and rothwell was the kind of person who put his spent matches back in the box facing the opposite direction from the live ones it was almost six when the phone rang vic manson calling from the forensic lab vic spent almost as much time with the sceneofcrime team from north yorkshire headquarters in northallerton as he did at the lab and though banks knew vic was a fingerprints expert he sometimes wasnt sure exactly what he did or where he really worked what have you got for us banks asked hold your horses social call is it then not exactly then what the wadding for a start what about it we managed to get some more of the paper unfolded it wasnt too badly burned inside anyway the document analysts say its good magazine quality probably german no prints nothing but blurs its not your commonorgarden girlie magazine but its not hardcore perversion either the fullest picture we could get seemed to be a shaved vagina with a finger touching the clitoris bright red nail varnish the fingernail that is that must be the other side of what i saw said banks does it help it might do apparently there are people who have a fetish about shaved vaginas its something to go on anyway banks sighed or maybe our killers just got a warped sense of humor we can check with the pnc anyway see if theres been any similar incidents what about the weapon twelvegauge doublebarrel judging by the amount of shot weve collected the bastard who did it must have used both of them anything from the house no prints if thats what you mean they wore gloves and there was nothing special about the rope they used to tie up the wife and daughter either by the way remember one of the chairs was wet the one overturned by the table yes it was urine the poor lass must have been so scared she pissed herself banks swallowed that was alisons chair she was the one who had eventually made her way to the sewing basket and toppled her chair any footprints he asked were still working on it but dont hold your breath the ground had pretty much dried out after last weeks rain okay vic thanks for calling keep at it and keep me informed okay will do after he had hung up banks lit another cigarette and walked over to the window again most of the tourists were getting in their cars removing the crooklocks and driving home the cobbles cross and church front looked slate gray in the dull afternoon light at the far side of the square the el toro coffee bar and joplin s newsagents seemed to be doing good business banks thought of alison who had shown so much courage in telling them about what had happened at arkbeck farm someone had scared her so much she had sat in her own urine probably for hours the idea of her indignity and humiliation made him angry he vowed he would find whoever was responsible for doing that to her and make damn sure they suffered the queens arms was always busy at six oclock on a friday and it was only through good luck and quick reflexes that banks and susan gay managed to grab a coppertopped table by the window when a party of cashiers from the natwest bank gathered their things and left as happened so often in the dales the weather had changed dramatically over a very short period a light breeze had sprung up and blown away the clouds now the early evening sunlight glowed through the red and amber panes and shot bright rays through the clear ones lighting on a foaming glass of ale and highlighting the smoke swirling in the air the sunlight and smoke reminded banks of the effect the projection camera created at the cinema when smoking was allowed there as kids he and his friends used to put their money together for a packet of five woodbines then go to the morning matinee at the palace a three stooges short a buck rogers or flash gordon serial and a blackandwhite western maybe a hopalong cassidy slumped down in their seats they would smoke wild woodies until they felt sick he smiled at the memory and reached for a silk cut conversation and laughter ebbed and flowed all around them and the general mood was ebullient after all it was the weekend for most people in the pub there would be no work until monday morning they could go off shopping to york or leeds wallpaper the bedroom visit aunt maisie in skipton or just lounge around and watch football or racing on telly it was cup final day tomorrow banks remembered fat chance hed get of watching it the best he could hope was that he would get home before too late tonight and spend some time with sandra it was the ideal opportunity for a bit of bridgebuilding tracy was away in france on a school exchange and brian was at portsmouth polytechnic so they had the house to themselves for once he would be too late for a shared dinner but maybe a nice bottle of claret a few chopin nocturnes candlelight then who knew what might follow it was a nice fantasy but right now he was waiting for gristhorpe and richmond here to combine the pleasure of a pint and a steakandkidney pud with the business of swopping notes and fishing for leads at an informal meeting once in a while through the laughter and the arguments banks heard the rothwell case mentioned did you hear about that terrible murder up near relton hear about that bloke got shot out in the dale i heard they blew his head right off his shoulders by now of course everyone had had a chance to read the yorkshire evening post and people were only too willing to embroider on the scant details the newspaper gave rumor and fantasy were rife what gristhorpe hadnt told the media so far was that rothwell had been executed gangland style and that the weapon used was a shotgun the best the press could manage so far was local businessman murdered not more than a mile above the peaceful swainsdale village of fortford a mildmannered accountant was shot to death in his own garage in the early hours of this morning there followed an appeal for information about two men in black and a photograph of keith rothwell looking exactly like a mildmannered accountant with his thinning fair hair combed back showing the slight widows peak his high forehead slightly prissy lips and the wirerimmed glasses the glasses banks knew had been found shattered to pieces along with the other wreckage of rothwells skull banks waved to gristhorpe and richmond who nudged their way through the crowd to join them at the table while he was on his feet richmond went to get a round of drinks and put in the food orders at least we dont have to worry about civilians overhearing classified information gristhorpe said as he sat down and scraped his stool forward along the worn stone flagging i can hardly even hear myself think when richmond got back with the tray of drinks gristhorpe said right phil tell us what you found they huddled close around the table richmond took a sip of his st clements there are several items that have been either encrypted or assigned passwords he said some are complete directories and ones just a document file in a directory hes called it letter can you get access gristhorpe asked not easily no sir not unless you type the password at the prompt believe me ive tried every trick and all ive got for my pains is gibberish all right gristhorpe coughed and waved away bankss smoke with an exaggerated gesture lets assume he had some special reason for keeping these items secret that means were definitely interested you said you couldnt gain access easily but is there a way richmond cleared his throat well yes there is actually there are two ways come on then lad dont keep us in suspense we could bring an expert i mean a real expert like someone who writes the programs aye and the other option well its not much known for obvious reasons but i went to a seminar once and the lecturer told me something that struck me as very odd what well theres a company that sells bypass programs for various software security systems that would probably be cheaper and quicker wouldnt it said gristhorpe can you get hold of a copy yes sir but its not cheap actually its quite expensive how much about two hundred quid gristhorpe whistled between his teeth then he said we dont have a lot of choice do we go ahead order one i already have done sir and theyre based in akron ohio but they told me theres a distributor in taunton devon who has some in stock it could take a while to get it up here tell the buggers to send it by courier then we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb lord knows what the dcc will have to say come accounting time maybe if it helps us solve the case banks chipped in hell increase our budget gristhorpe laughed in a pigs arse he will go on phil thats all really said richmond in the meantime ill keep trying and see what i can do people sometimes write their passwords down in case they forget them if rothwell did the only problem is finding out where and in what form interesting banks said ive got one of those plastic cards the ones you use to get money at the hole in the wall i keep the number written in my address book disguised as part of a telephone number in case i forget it exactly said richmond short of trying every name and number in rothwells address book gristhorpe said is there any quick way of doing this i dont think so sir richmond said but often the password is a name the user has strong affinities with rosebud banks suggested right said richmond that sort of thing maybe something from his childhood woodbines said banks sorry phil just thinking out loud but it could be anything the name of a family member for example or a random arrangement of letters spaces numbers and punctuation marks it doesnt have to make any sense at all bloody hell gristhorpe ran his hand through his unruly thatch of gray hair all i can say is leave it with me sir ill do what i can and ill ask the software distributor to put a rush on it all right susan anything from hatchard and pratt susan leaned forward to make herself heard just as she was about to start cyril called out their food number and richmond and banks went through to bring back the trays after a few mouthfuls susan started again yes she said dabbing at the side of her mouth with a napkin as it turns out rothwell was asked to leave the firm asked to leave gristhorpe echoed does that mean fired not exactly sir he was a partner you cant just fire partners he was also married to the bosss daughter mary rothwells maiden name is hatchard he was asked to resign they didnt want a fuss interesting said gristhorpe what was it all about then susan ate another mouthful of her cornish pasty then washed it down with a sip of britvic orange and pushed her plate aside laurence pratt was reluctant to tell me about it she said but i think he knew hed be in more trouble if we found out some other way it seems rothwell was caught padding the time sheets its not a rare fiddle according to pratt and he doesnt regard it as strictly illegal but it is unethical and its bad luck for anyone who gets caught rothwell got off lucky what happened asked gristhorpe this was about five years ago rothwell was doing a lot of work for a large company pratt wouldnt tell me who it was but i dont think that really matters the point is that pratts father was looking over the billings and noticed that rothwell had doubled up on his hours here and there at times he couldnt have been working on their account because hed been on another job or out of town what did he do isnt there some regulatory board he should have been reported to yes sir there is but remember rothwell was married to hatchards daughter mary theyd been together nearly sixteen years by then had two kids old man hatchard would hardly want his soninlaw struck off and his family name dragged through the mud which is probably what would have happened if rothwell had been reported i also got the impression that it might have been marys demands that set rothwell padding his accounts in the first place nothing was directly stated you understand sir just hinted imagine the headlines accountant fired for padding books to keep bosss daughter in the manner to which she was accustomed hardly bears thinking about does it anyway laurence pratt and rothwell were quite close friends then so pratt interceded and stuck up for him rothwell was lucky he had a lot going for him and theres another reason they didnt want a hue and cry which is confidence and confidentiality sir if it got out to the large company that rothwell was fiddling then it would put the partnership in an awkward position much better they dont find out and rothwell simply decides to move on keep it in the family theyd never question the bills or miss the money i see gristhorpe rubbed his whiskery chin its something that could have led to a motive isnt it sir greed dishonesty aye said gristhorpe it is that which makes me think even more that these secret files might prove interesting reading he tapped the tabletop good work susan lets make rothwells business affairs a major line of enquiry ill get in touch with the fraud squad ive heard from the antiterrorist squad by the way and theyve come up with nothing so far they want to be kept up to date of course but i think we can rule out rothwell dealing arms or money to the ira anything to add alan i think we should follow up on the wadding there could be a porn connection rothwell in the porn business its possible after all he had plenty of money didnt he he must have got it from somewhere im not suggesting he was a front player one who got his hands dirty maybe he just made some investments or handled finances take the lid off that can of worms video nasties prostitution and the like and it wouldnt surprise me to find murder perhaps the wadding was a kind of signature a symbol it sounds a bit too fanciful to me said gristhorpe but i take your point its all tied together anyway isnt it if he was in the porn business then that makes porn part of his business affairs well follow up on it ds hatchleys coming back on monday said banks i think hed be a good man for the job remember he spent a while working on the vice squad for west yorkshire besides hed enjoy it gristhorpe snorted i suppose he would but keep him on a tight leash hes like a bloody bull in a china shop banks grinned he knew that gristhorpe and hatchley didnt get along jim hatchley was a big bluff burly boozy roastbeef sort of yorkshireman a rugby prop forward until cigarettes and drink took their toll more at home playing darts in the public bar than chatting in the lounge he was the kind of person everyone underestimated and that often worked to the advantage of the eastvale cid and he also had a valuable countywide network of lowlife quasicriminal informers that nobody had been able to penetrate the rothwells are an interesting family banks went on after a sip of theakstons mrs rothwell assured me everything was fine and dandy on the domestic front but methought the lady did protest too much i wonder how much communication there really was between them all its nothing i can put my finger on but theres something bothering me i think the son tom might have something to do with it i got that impression too said susan it all looks fine on the surface but id like to know what life at arkbeck farm was like after id talked to laurence pratt i got to thinking that if tom was the reason keith and mary rothwell had to get married and rothwell was unhappy in his marriage then he might blame tom irrational of course but things happen like that id leave the psychology to jenny fuller said gristhorpe susan reddened susans right said banks the sooner we find tom rothwell the better gristhorpe shrugged its up to the florida police now weve passed on all the information weve got come on alan surely you dont think the wife and daughter had anything to do with it it would be hard to believe wouldnt it on the other hand weve only their word for what happened nobody else saw the two men in black what if alison and her mother did want rid of rothwell for some reason next youll be telling me the wife and daughter were making porno films for rothwell you talked to alison you could see the lass was upset alison might not have had anything to do with it you mean mrs rothwell wasnt she in shock so im told i didnt get to see her until late this morning that gave her plenty of time to compose herself work up an act but the soc team went through the place as thoroughly as they usually do hayloft and all they couldnt find any traces of a weapon im not saying she shot him what then she hired a couple of killers to do it for her i dont know she could certainly afford it i suppose im playing devils advocate trying to look at it from all angles i still maintain theyre an odd family alison was genuinely terrified i know that but theres something not quite right about them all and id like to know what that is i knew when i drove away from arkbeck farm that something id seen there was bothering me nagging away but i didnt know what it was until a short while ago and asked gristhorpe it was toms postcard from california it was addressed to alison he called her ali and at the end he wrote love to mum there was no mention of his father hmm said gristhorpe it doesnt have to mean anything maybe not but thats not all when i looked through rothwells wallet a while back i found photos of mary and alison but none of tom not one chapter a nights sleep is supposed to refresh you not make you feel as if youre recovering from a bloody anesthetic thought banks miserably on saturday morning never a morning person at the best of times he sat over his second cup of black coffee and a slice of whole wheat toast and seville marmalade newspaper propped up in front of him trying to muster enough energy to get going as a background to the radio traffic reports he could hear sandra having a shower upstairs banks hated the contraption he always seemed to get a lukewarm dribble rather than a hot shower but sandra and tracy swore by it banks preferred a long hot bath with a little quiet background music and a good book after catching up with paperwork he hadnt got home until almost eleven the previous night he wished sandra had been angry that theyd had to miss the claret the chopin and the candlelight but she hadnt seemed to care he didnt know whether she was pretending or she really didnt care in fact she said shed just got back from a reception at the community center herself it was getting to be par for the course they had seen so little of one another lately that they were fast becoming strangers it seemed to banks that what had been a strength in their relationship their natural independence was quickly becoming a threat and while sandra had slept like a log banks had tossed and turned all night beside her worried about the rothwell case with only brief fitful periods of sleep full of shifting images the pornographic wadding the headless corpse now it was eightthirty the next morning and his eyes felt like sandpaper his brain stuffed with cotton wool the national dailies and radio news carried stories on the keith rothwell killing sandwiched between a bloodthirsty putdown of riots on a caribbean island where another dictator was nearing the end of his reign of terror and a male member of parliament caught in flagrante with a sixteenyearold rentboy on clapham common it probably wouldnt even have made the papers if it had happened somewhere a bit more upmarket like hampstead heath banks thought the rothwell murder would be on television too no doubt amidst all the speculation on that afternoons cup final but banks had never been able to bring himself to turn the thing on during daylight hours now hints were appearing in the media that the killing was more than a runofthemill domestic disagreement or a burglary gone wrong according to the radio scotland yard interpol and the fbi had been called in that banks reflected was a slight exaggeration the americans had been asked to help trace tom rothwell though as far as banks knew it was the florida state police not the fbi interpol was something the reporters always threw in for good measure these days and scotland yard was an outright lie banks scanned the yorkshire post and the independent reports to see if either newspaper knew more than the police sometimes they did and it could be damned embarrassing all round not this time though to them rothwell was as much the quiet unassuming local accountant and businessman as he was to the rest of the world more coffee banks looked up to see sandra standing at the machine in her navyblue bathrobe wet hair hanging over the terrycloth at her shoulders he hadnt heard her come down please he held his cup out sandra poured then put some bread in the toaster and picked up the yorkshire post after she had read about rothwell she whistled is this what kept you out so late last night hmm murmured banks the toast popped up sandra put the paper down and went to see to it ive met her a couple of times you know she said over her shoulder buttering toast banks folded the independent and looked at sandras profile when it was wet her hair looked darker of course but one of the things banks found attractive about her was the contrast between her blonde hair and black eyebrows this time when he looked at her he felt an ache deep inside who he asked mrs rothwell mary rothwell how on earth did you come across her at the gallery sandra ran the local gallery in the eastvale community center where she organized art and photography exhibitions i didnt know she was the artistic type shes not really i think for her it was just the thing to do womens institute sort of stuff you know organize cultural outings sandra sat down with her toast and wrinkled her nose banks laughed sensing a definite thaw in the cold war snob what me she hit him lightly with the folded newspaper anyway banks said the poor womans on tranquilizers both she and her daughter saw rothwells body before they called us and you can take my word for it thats enough to give anyone the heebiejeebies hows the daughter alison not quite so bad at least not on the surface banks shrugged more resilient maybe or she could just be repressing it more tina smithies says shes worried theyre both losing touch he looked at his watch id better go sandra followed him to the door and leaned against the bannister she nibbled her toast as she watched him put on his light gray sports jacket and pick up his briefcase i cant say i know her well enough to get any kind of impression she said holding her dressinggown at the collar when banks opened the door but i did sense that shes the kind who well she puts on a few airs and graces not so much as to be a complete pseud but you can tell theres a touch of the lady muck about her imperious and she likes people to know shes not short of a bob or two you know she flashes her rings jewelry stuff like that she also struck me as being a very cold woman i dont know why all sharp edges like a drawer full of kitchen knives banks leaned against the door jamb its a bloody strange family altogether he said sandra shrugged just thought id put in my two pennorth i dont suppose you know when youll be back no sorry got to dash banks risked a quick kiss on the lips they tasted of strawberry jam can you leave me the car today sandra called after him theres a watercolor exhibition i want to see in ripon one of our locals is exhibiting i dont know when ill be back either okay said banks wincing at the barb he could always sign a car out of the pool if he needed one it wouldnt have a cassette deck but then this was hardly the best of all possible worlds was it at least it should have a radio he set off determined after a miserable night not to let things get him down it was a beautiful morning calendar weather may as he knew it had finally arrived the sky was a cloudless blue apart from a few high milky swirls and even this early in the morning the temperature seemed to have risen a few notches since yesterday banks wouldnt be surprised if it were shirtsleeves weather before the day was out as he walked he plugged in his earphones and switched on the walkman in his briefcase the tape started at the jazzy forlane section of ravels le tombeau de couperin not bad for a walk to work on a fine spring morning it was only about a mile to the station along market street and banks liked the way the townscape changed almost yard by yard as he walked at his end of town the road was broad and the area was much like the outer part of any town center the main road with its garage supermarket school zebra crossings and roundabouts surrounded by residential streets of tall victorian houses most of them converted to student flats all with names like mafeking avenue sebastopol terrace crimea close and waterloo road and a strong smell of petrol and diesel fumes pervading the air but the closer market street got to the actual marketplace the more it narrowed and turned into a tourist attraction with its overhanging firstfloor bays where people could almost shake hands with someone across the street the magnifyingglass windows of twee souvenir shops an expensive walkers gear shop with orange goretex clothing hanging by the doorway and a stand of walkingsticks out on the pavement a waterstones bookshop the streets most recent addition the mingled aromas from hambletons tea and coffee emporium and farleighs bakery across the street an oddbins wine shop the golden grill café and a newsagents with a rack of newspapers out front some of them folded over at rothwells grainy photograph and a display of local guides and ordnance survey maps in the window this narrow part of market street was always jammed with honking traffic too mostly visitors and delivery vans halfway through the menuet section banks arrived at the station a threestory tudorfronted building facing the market square first he called in at the murder room and talked to phil richmond the florida state police had tracked down the car rental company tom rothwell had used at tampa airport at least it was a start now the police had a license number to look for among the millions of cars parked at the thousands of florida hotels motels and beach clubs the pnc reported nothing doing on the use of pornographic wadding at other crime scenes gristhorpe was in a meeting with inspector macmillan of the fraud squad and susan gay was in her hutch phoning around the list of rothwells clients laurence pratt had given her banks poured a coffee and went to his office he opened his window and sniffed the air then lit a cigarette and stood looking down on the early tourists in their bright anoraks and cagoules milling about the cobbled square it was ten past nine on a saturday morning marketday in eastvale and the vendors at their canvascovered stalls like the old wildwest wagon trains hawked everything from flat caps and multipocketed fishing jackets to burglar alarms spark plugs and nonstick ovenware the cheese van was there as usual and banks thought he might nip out and buy a wedge of coverdale or wensleydale blue if he got the chance if banks mulled over what sandra had told him about mary rothwell so far he had an impression of her as an ostentatious and overbearing woman who put too much value on appearances and of keith rothwell as an unassuming yet sly and greedy man easily prey to temptation greed as susan gay had remarked is often a way of making dangerous enemies and a habit of secrecy is a damn good way of making things difficult for the police but did the greed originate in rothwell himself or had he felt pushed into it by the demands of his wife there had certainly been hints in what both ian falkland and larry grafton had said that rothwell had been something of a henpecked husband escaping to the pub for a halfpint and a quiet smoke whenever he could in bankss experience such people often developed rich and secret fantasy lives which sometimes imposed on reality with messy and unpredictable results keith rothwell had supplied his wife and children with all the conveniences and many of the luxuries they wanted what did he get out of it what did he have going for himself nobody seemed to know or care what made him tick banks moved away from the window and stubbed out his cigarette there was at least one thing he could do right now he thought reaching for a pen and notepad wanted he wrote male caucasian about five feet nine slight paunch large wet brown eyes commonly described as spaniel or puppy dog eyes fondness for shotguns cant keep his hands off young girls and probably has a taste for pornography of the shaved pussy variety he could just imagine the laughter and the nudgenudges in police stations around the country as that went out over the pnc just as he was about to start working on a revised version the phone rang and sergeant rowe put him through to a distraught woman asking for the ubiquitous someone in charge can i help you banks asked her they said theyd put me through to someone in charge are you in charge depends what you mean said banks in charge of what whats it about the man in the paper this morning the one who was killed suddenly banks pricked up his ears was he mistaken or was she sobbing as she spoke yes he said go on i knew him you knew keith rothwell no no she sobbed again then came back on the line youve got it wrong thats not his name his name is robert robert calvert thats who he is youve got it all wrong is robert really dead the back of his neck tingling banks gripped his pen tight between his fingers i think wed better have a talk love he said the sooner the better would you like to give me your name and address susan gay drove the unmarked police fiesta to leeds with banks beside her tapping his fingers on his knees it wasnt because of her driving ordinarily he would enjoy such a trip and take his time if there were no rush but today he was anxious to interview the woman who had phoned pamela jeffreys he wasnt smoking either and that also made him jittery he refrained in deference to susan though she magnanimously said it was okay if he opened the windows there wasnt much worse in his experience than trying to enjoy a cigarette in a car next to a nonsmoker with a force nine gale blowing all around you no matter how good the weather as banks had hoped though the car had no cassette player it did have a radio and he was able to lose himself in a poulenc chamber concert on radio three as he considered the implications of what he had just heard how are we going to play this sir susan asked as she turned onto the inner ring road and went into the yellowlit tunnel banks dragged himself out of a passage in the sextet where a sense of sadness seemed to pervade the levity of the woodwinds by ear he said they had already called di ken blackstone out of courtesy for intruding on his patch and ken had found nothing on pamela jeffreys in records hardly surprising banks thought as there was no reason to suppose she was a criminal he glanced out of the window and saw they were crossing the bridge over the river aire and the leedsliverpool canal the dirty sluggish water looked especially vile in the bright sunlight do we tell her anything susan asked if shes read the papers shell know almost as much about keith rothwells life as we do whether shell believe it or not is another matter what do you think its all about i havent a clue well soon find out susan negotiated the large roundabout on wellington road above them the dark medieval fortress of armley jail loomed on its hill susan veered right at the junction with tong road passed the disused crown bingo hall the medical center and the new wortley cemetery and headed toward armley it was an area of waste ground and boardedup shopfronts with the high black spire of st bartholomews visible above the decay she slowed to look at the street names found wesley road turned right then right again and looked for the address pamela jeffreys had given this is it sir she said finally pulling into a street of terraced backtobacks nicely done up each with a postagestamp lawn behind a privet hedge some with new frostedglass or woodpanel doors and dormer windows number twenty twentyfour here it is she pulled up outside number twentyeight the row of houses stood across the street from some allotments behind a low stone wall where a number of retired or unemployed men worked their patches stopping now and then to chat someone had rested a transistor radio on the wall and banks could hear the preamble to the cup final commentary not far down the street was an old chapel which according to the sign had been converted into a sikh temple they walked down the path to number twentyeight and rang the doorbell the woman who opened the door had clearly been crying but it didnt mar her looks one bit banks thought perhaps the whites of her almond eyes were a little too red and the glossy blueblack hair could have done with a good brushing but there was no denying that she was a woman of exceptional beauty northern indian banks guessed or perhaps from bangladesh or pakistan she had skin the color of burnished gold with high cheekbones full finely drawn lips and a figure that wouldnt be out of place in playboy revealed to great advantage by skintight iceblue jeans and a jadegreen tshirt tucked in at her narrow waist around her neck she wore a necklace of manycolored glass beads she also wore a gold stud in her left nostril she looked to be in her midtwenties her fingers banks noticed as she raised her hand to push the door shut were long and tapered with clear nails cut very short a spiral gold bracelet slipped down her slim wrist over her forearm on the other wrist she wore a simple timex with a black plastic strap she had only one ring and that was a gold band on the middle finger of her right hand light down covered her bare brown arms the living room was arranged for comfort a small threepiece suite with burgundy velour upholstery formed a semicircle around a thick glass coffeetable in front of the fireplace which may once have housed a real coal fire but now was given over to an electric one with three elements and a fake flamingcoals effect on the coffeetable the new mary wesley paperback lay open face down beside a copy of the radio times and an earthenware mug half full of milky tea a few family photographs in gilt frames stood on the mantelpiece on the wall above the fire hung a print of ganesh the elephant god in a brightly colored primitive style in the corner by the front window stood a television with a video on a shelf underneath the only other furniture in the room was a mini stereo system and several racks of compact discs a glassfronted cabinet of crystalware and a small bookcase mostly full of modern fiction and books about music but it was the far end of the room that caught bankss interest for there stood a music stand with some sheet music on it and beside that on a chair lay what he first took to be an oversized violin but quickly recognized as a viola the woman sat on the sofa curling her legs up beside her and banks and susan took the armchairs are you a musician banks asked yes she said professional uhhuh im with the northern philharmonia and i do a bit of chamber work on the side why just curious banks was impressed the english northern philharmonia played for opera north among other things and was widely regarded as one of the best opera orchestras in the country he had been to see opera norths superb production of la bohème recently and must have heard pamela jeffreys play ms jeffreys he began after a brief silence i must admit that your phone call has us a bit confused not half as much as that rubbish in the newspaper has me confused she had no indian accent at all just west yorkshire with a cultured university edge banks slipped a recent goodquality photograph of keith rothwell from his briefcase and passed it to her is this the man were talking about yes i think this is robert though he looks a bit stiff here she handed it back theres a mistake isnt there it must be someone who looks just like him thats it what exactly was your relationship she fiddled with her necklace were friends maybe we were more than that at one time but now were just friends were you lovers yes for a while for how long three or four months until when six months ago so youve known him for about ten months altogether yes how did you meet in a pub the boulevard on westgate actually i was with some friends robert was by himself we just got talking like you do have you seen him since you stopped being lovers yes i told you we remained friends we dont see each other as often of course but we still go out every now and then purely platonic i like robert hes good fun to be with even when we stopped being lovers look whats all this in when did you last see him ms jeffreys pamela please call me pamela let me see it must have been a month or more ago look is this some mistake or what we dont know yet pamela susan gay said we really dont love youll help us best get it sorted out if you answer chief inspector bankss questions pamela nodded was there anything unusual about mr about robert the last time you saw him banks asked no he didnt say anything tell you about anything that was worrying him no robert never seemed to worry about anything except he hated being called bob so there was nothing at all different about him well i wouldnt say that oh its just a guess like what was it i think hed met someone else another woman i think he was in love banks swallowed hardly able to believe what he was hearing this couldnt be dull dry mildmannered keith rothwell surely rothwell wasnt the kind of man to have a wife and children in swainsdale and a beautiful girlfriend like pamela jeffreys in leeds whom he could simply dump for yet another woman dont get me wrong pamela went on im not bitter or anything we had a good time and it was never anything more we didnt lie to each other neither of us wanted to get too involved and one thing robert doesnt do is mess you around thats why we can still be friends but he made it clear it was over between us at least in that way and i got the impression it was because hed found someone else did you ever see this woman no did he ever speak of her no i just knew a woman can tell about these things thats all did you ask him about her i broached the subject once or twice what happened he changed it she smiled he has a way how often did you see each other when we were going out yes just once or twice a week mostly late in the week weekends sometimes he travels a lot on business anyway hes usually at home every week at some time at least for a day or two whats his business dunno thats another thing he never said much about i cant say i was really that interested either i mean its boring isnt it talking about business i liked going out with robert because he was fun he could leave his work at home did he smoke what an odd question yes as a matter of fact not much though what brand benson and hedges i dont mind people smoking encouraged banks slipped his silk cut out of his pocket pamela smiled and brought him a glass ashtray what was he like banks asked what kind of things did you used to do together pamela looked at banks with a glint of naughty humor in her eyes and raised her eyebrows banks felt himself flush i mean where did you used to go he said quickly yeah i know hmmm well wed go out for dinner about once a week brasserie you know down by the river or la grillade until it moved he likes good food lets see sometimes wed go to concerts at the town hall if i wasnt playing of course but hes not very fond of classical music to be honest prefers that dreadful trad jazz and sometimes wed just stay in order a pizza or a curry and watch telly if there was something good on or rent a video he likes oldies casablanca the maltese falcon that kind of thing so do i let me see wed go to napoleons every once in a while napoleons yeah you know the casino and he took me to the races a couple of times once at pontefract and once at doncaster thats about it really oh and we went dancing now and then quite fleet on his feet is robert banks coughed and stubbed out his cigarette dancing the casino yes he loves a flutter does robert it worried me sometimes the way hed go through a hundred or more some nights she shrugged but it wasnt my place to say was it i mean it wasnt as if we were married or anything or even living together and he seemed to have plenty of money not that thats what interested me about him she pulled at her necklace again cant you tell me whats going on chief inspector its not the same person that was murdered is it i was so upset when i saw the paper this morning tell me its a case of mistaken identity banks shook his head i dont know maybe he had a double did he ever say anything about being married no never did he have an appendix scar this time pamela blushed yes she said yes he did but so do lots of other people i had mine out when i was sixteen when you spent time together banks said did he always come here to your house didnt you ever visit him at his hotel she frowned hotel what hotel the one he stayed at when he was in town i assume did you always meet here of course not sometimes he came here certainly ive nothing to be ashamed of and i dont care what the neighbors say bloody racists some of them you know my mum and dad came over to shipley to work in the woollen mills in nineteen fiftytwo they even changed their name from jaffrey to jeffreys because it sounded more english can you believe it i was born here brought up here went to school and university here and some of them still call me a bleeding paki she shrugged what can you do anyway you were saying i was asking why you never saw him at his hotel oh thats easy i dont know what youre talking about you see it cant be the same person can it that proves it she leaned forward quickly and clapped her hands the bracelet spiralled you see robert didnt stay at any hotel sometimes he came here yes but not always other times i went to his place his flat hes got a flat in headingley banks turned the yale key in the lock and the three of them stood on the threshold of robert calverts headingley flat it was in the nice part of headingley more west park banks noted not the scruffy part around hyde park that was honeycombed with student bedsits it hadnt been easy getting in pamela jeffreys didnt have a key so they had to ask one of the tenants in the building to direct them to the agency that handled rentals naturally it was closed at four oclock on a saturday afternoon so then they had to get hold of one of the staff at home and arrange for her to come in grumbling all the way open up the office and give them a spare key and no she told them she had never met robert calvert the man was a model tenant he paid his rent on time and that was all that mattered one of the secretaries probably handed him the key but hed had the place about eighteen months and turnover in secretaries was pretty high however if banks wanted to come back on monday morning still banks reflected as they stood at the front door all in all it had taken only about an hour and a half from the first time they had heard of the place so that wasnt bad going better not touch anything banks said as they stood in the hallway which is the living room he asked pamela that one on the left the door was ajar and banks nudged it open with his elbow the bottom of the door rubbed over the fitted beige carpet susan gay and pamela walked in behind him theres only this room a bedroom kitchen and bathroom pamela said its not very big but its cozy the living room was certainly not the kind of place banks could imagine mary rothwell caring much for equipped with all the usual stuff tv video stereo a few jazz compact discs books armchairs gas fireplace it smelled of stale smoke and had that comfortable livedin feel banks had never sensed at arkbeck farm perhaps it was something to do with the old magazines mostly jazz and racing strewn over the scratched coffeetable the overflowing ashtray the worn upholstery on the armchair by the fire or the framed photographs of a youngerlooking rothwell on the mantelpiece on the wall hung a framed print of monets waterloo bridge grey day they went into the bedroom and found the same mess the bed was unmade and discarded socks underpants and shirts lay on the floor beside it there was also a small desk against one wall on which stood a jar of pens and pencils a roll of sellotape and a stapler in addition to several sheets of paper some of them scrawled all over with numbers is this the kind of thing youre looking for pamela asked carefully banks opened the drawer and found a wallet without disturbing anything he could see through the transparent plastic holder inside credit cards in the name of robert calvert he put it back a couple of suits hung in the wardrobe along with shirts ties casual jackets and trousers banks felt in the pockets and found nothing but pennies sales slips a couple of felttip pens matches betting slips and some fluff as wood doesnt usually yield fingerprints he didnt have to be too careful opening cupboards and drawers calverts dresser contained the usual jumble of jeans jumpers socks and underwear a packet of condoms lay forlornly next to a passport and a selection of dutch french greek and swiss small change in the drawer of the bedside table the passport was in the name of robert calvert there were no entry or exit stamps but then there wouldnt be if he did most of his travelling in europe as the coins seemed to indicate on the bedside table was a shaded reading lamp and a copy of the economist the kitchen was certainly compact and by the sparsity of the fridges contents it looked as if calvert did most of his eating out a small winerack stood on the counter banks checked the contents a white burgundy veuve clicquot champagne a rioja calverts bathroom was clean and tidy his medicine cabinet revealed only the barest of essentials paracetamol tablets aspro milk of magnesia alka seltzer fishermans friend elastoplast cotton swabs hydrogen peroxide old spice deodorant and shaving cream a packet of orange disposable razors toothbrush and a halfused tube of colgate calvert had squeezed it in the middle banks noticed not from bottom to top could this be the same man who returned his used matches to the box come on banks said wed better use a callbox i dont want to risk smudging any prints there may be on the telephone whats going on pamela asked as they walked down the street im sorry susan said to her we really dont know were not just putting you off were as confused as you are if we can find some of roberts fingerprints in the flat then we can check them against our files and find out once and for all if its the same man but it just cant be pamela said im sure of it a pub on the main road advertised a beer garden at the back and as they were all thirsty banks suggested he might as well make the call from there he phoned the station and phil richmond said he would arrange to get vic manson to the flat as soon as possible that done he ordered the drinks and discovered from the barman that arsenal had won the fa cup good for them banks thought when he had lived in london he had been an arsenal supporter though he always had a soft spot for peterborough united his hometown team struggling as they were near the bottom of the first division the beer garden was quiet they sat at a heavy wooden bench beside a bowling green and sipped their drinks two old men in white were playing on the green and occasionally the clack of the bowls disturbed the silence banks and susan shared salted roast peanuts and cheeseandonion crisps as neither had eaten since breakfast the sun felt warm on the back of bankss neck you can go home whenever you want banks told pamela as she took off the tan suede jacket she had put on to go out we have to stay here but well pay for a taxi im sorry we had to ruin your day for you pamela squinted in the sun reached into her bag and pulled out a pair of large pinkrimmed sunglasses its all right she said picking up her gin and tonic i know it wasnt robert they were talking about in the paper who was this man this keith rothwell he was an accountant who got murdered banks told her we cant really say much more than that did you ever hear the name before pamela shook her head the papers said he was married yes robert didnt act like a married man what do you mean guilt secrecy fleeting visits furtive phone calls the usual stuff there was none of that with robert we went about quite openly he wasnt tied down he was a dreamer besides you just know she took her glasses off and squinted at banks ill bet youre married arent you yes said banks and saw he hoped a hint of disappointment in her eyes told you she put her sunglasses on again banks noticed susan grinning behind her glass of lemonade he gave her a dirty look a clack of bowls came from the green and one of the old men did a little dance of victory so you see pamela went on it cant be the same man if im sure of one thing its that robert calvert definitely wasnt a married man with a family banks picked up his pint and raised it in a toast i hope youre right he said looking at her brave smile and remembering the scene in rothwells garage only two nights ago i sincerely hope youre right chapter there was always something sad about an empty farmyard banks thought as he got out of the car in front of arkbeck farm again there should be chickens squawking all over the place the occasional wandering cow maybe a barking sheepdog or two he thought of the nest egg he had held at his uncle lens farm in gloucestershire on childhood family visits they used it to encourage hens to lay he remembered and when his aunt chloe had handed it to him in the coop it had still felt warm banks also remembered the smells of hay and cow dung the shiny metal milk churns sitting by the roadside waiting to be picked up as he rang the doorbell he doubted that the rothwells felt the same way about empty farmyards the place seemed to suit alisons introspective nature her father had no doubt appreciated the seclusion and the protection from prying eyes and questions it offered and mary rothwell well banks could hardly imagine her mucking out the byre or feeding the pigs he couldnt imagine her handing a child a warm porcelain egg either do come in mary rothwell said opening the door banks followed her to the splitlevel living room today she wore a white shirt that buttoned on the mans side and a loose gray skirt that reached her ankles alison lay sprawled on the sofa reading on the way to arkbeck farm he had considered what to say to them regarding his talk with pamela jeffreys in leeds but he hadnt come up with any clear plan vic manson hadnt got back to him yet about the prints so he still couldnt be absolutely certain that robert calvert and keith rothwell were the same person best play it by ear he decided how are you doing he asked mary rothwell could be worse she replied he noticed her eyes were baggy under the makeup i havent been sleeping well despite the pills and im a mass of nerves but if i keep myself busy time passes i have the funeral to organize please sit down banks had come partly to explain that a van was on its way to pick up keith rothwells computer disks and business files and spirit them off to the fraud squads headquarters in northallerton where a team of suits would pore over them for months maybe years costing the taxpayers millions he didnt put it like that of course just as he had finished explaining he heard the van pull up out front he went to the front door and directed the men to rothwells office then returned to the living room shutting the door firmly behind him it was dark in the room and a little chilly despite the fine weather outside they shouldnt bother us he said perhaps a little music mary rothwell nodded and turned on the radio engelbert humperdinck came on singing release me banks often regretted that humans hadnt been born with the capacity to close their ears as they did their eyes he did his best anyway and reflected that it was all in a good cause blanking out the sounds of keith rothwells office being dismantled and carried away have you found tom mary rothwell said sitting down she sat at the edge of the armchair banks noticed and twisted her hands in her lap a mass of gold and precious stones she seemed so stiff he wished someone would give her a massage her skin he felt would be brittle as lacquered hair to the touch banks explained that they had tracked down the car rental agency he had used and that it wouldnt be long before someone spotted the car he should be home she said we need him theres the funeral all the arrangements were doing our best mrs rothwell of course i didnt mean to imply anything its all right are you up to answering a few more questions i suppose so as long as you dont want to talk about what i went through the other night i couldnt bear that her eyes moved in the direction of the garage and banks could see the fear and horror flood into them no not that she would have to talk about it sometime banks almost told her but not now not yet its mr rothwell i want to talk about we need a better idea of how he spent his time well its hard to say really she began when he was here he was up in his office most of the time i could hear him clicking away on the computer did you ever hear him on the phone he had his own line up there i didnt listen in if thats what you mean no i didnt mean that but sometimes you just cant help overhearing something anything no he always kept the door shut i could hear his voice like i could hear the keyboard but it was muffled even if i was passing by the office so you never knew who he was talking to or what he was saying no did he have many calls in the days leading up to his death not so much as i noticed no more than usual i could always hear it ring you see even from downstairs she stood up would you like a cup of tea i can not at the moment thank you banks said he didnt want her crossing the path of the removal team for one thing it would upset and distract her and for another she would start telling them off about trailing dirt in and out she walked over to the fireplace straightened a porcelain figurine then came and sat down in the same position alison went on reading her book it was villette by charlotte brontë banks noticed surely a bit heavy for a fifteenyearold i understand your husband would drop in at the black sheep or the rose and crown now and then banks asked yes he wasnt much of a drinker but he liked to get out of the house for an hour or so you do when you work at home dont you you get to feel all cooped up hed usually walk there and back it was good exercise businessmen often dont exercise enough do they living such sedentary lives but keith believed in keeping in good shape he swam regularly too in eastvale and he would sometimes go for long runs she started picking pieces of imaginary lint from her skirt banks heard a thud from the staircase and this time he couldnt stop her from dashing to the door and yanking it open watch what youre doing you clumsy little man she said just look at this youve gouged a hole in my wall the plasters fallen off youll have to pay for that you know ill be talking to your superior she popped her head back around the door and said ill make that tea now shall i then disappeared into the kitchen banks still sitting noticed alison look up and raise her eyes shes been like this since yesterday she said cant sit still its even worse than usual shes upset banks said its her way of dealing with it or not dealing with it i saw him too you know do you think i can forget so easily youve got to talk to each other banks said he noticed the book was shaking in her hands and she was making an effort to keep it still if tom doesnt come home soon im going to run away she said i cant stand it any longer shes always going on about something or other and running about like a headless chi she put her hand to her mouth my god what a thing to say im awful arent i oh i hope tom comes back soon he must or ill go mad well both go mad a bit melodramatic banks thought but perhaps to be expected from a young girl on a steady diet of charlotte brontë mary rothwell came in bearing a tea tray and wearing a brave smile alison picked up her book again and lapsed into moody silence while her mother poured the tea into delicate china cups with handpainted roses on the sides and gold around the rims banks always felt clumsy and nervous drinking from such fine china he was afraid he would drop the cup or break off the flimsy handle while lifting it to his mouth why are they taking all keiths files anyway mary rothwell asked were beginning to think that your husband might have been involved in some shady financial dealings banks explained and they could have something to do with his murder shady she said it as lady bracknell said a handbag he might not have known what he was involved in banks lied its just a line of enquiry we have to follow i can assure you that my husband was as honest as the day is long mrs rothwell can you tell me anything about what your husband did when he was travelling on business how would i know i wasnt there which hotels did he stay in you must have phoned him no he phoned me occasionally he told me it was better that way for his tax expenses she shrugged well he was the businessman ive already told you he travelled all over the place you never went with him no of course not i have an aversion to lengthy car rides besides they were business trips one doesnt take ones spouse on business trips so youve no idea what he got up to in leeds or wherever she put down her cup are you implying something chief inspector keith didnt get up to anything banks was dying for a cigarette he finished the weak tea and put his cup and saucer down gently on the coffeetable do you know if your husband was much of a gambler he asked gambler she laughed good heavens no keith never even bet on the grand national and most people do that dont they no money for my husband was too hard earned to be frittered away like that keith had a poor childhood you know and one learns the value of money quite early on what sort of childhood his father was a small shopkeeper and they suffered terribly when the supermarkets started to become popular he eventually went bankrupt keith didnt like to talk about it banks remembered the cigarettes he had found among the contents of rothwells pockets did you know that your husband smoked he asked one minor weakness mary rothwell said turning up her nose its a smelly and unpleasant habit as well as a possibly fatal one i certainly wouldnt let him do it in the house and i was always trying to persuade him to stop ill bet you were banks thought have you ever heard of a woman called pamela jeffreys he asked mary rothwell frowned for the first time she sat back in the chair and gripped its arms with both hands no why banks saw suspicion and apprehension in her eyes outside the van door closed and the engine revved up banks noticed mrs rothwell glance toward the window theyre finished he said what about robert calvert does the name mean anything to you she shook her head no nothing look whats this all about are these the people you think killed keith are these the ones who got him involved in this criminal scheme you were talking about banks sighed i dont know he said maybe but i dont know why dont you go and arrest them instead of bothering us banks didnt think he was likely to get anything else out of mary rothwell or out of alison he stood up im sorry we had to bother you he said well be in touch as soon as we track down your son and please let us know if you hear from him first dont worry ill see myself out and he left maybe she hadnt heard of pamela jeffreys he thought as he got in the car but he was certain that she suspected her husband might have been seeing another woman it was there in her eyes in the whiteness of her knuckles he slipped a thelonious monk tape in the deck and set off for his next appointment as the edgy repetitive figure at the opening of raise four almost pushed his ears to the limits of endurance he wondered how long mary rothwell would be able to maintain her thinlylacquered surface before the cracks started to show well now if it aint mr banks again said larry grafton when banks walked into the black sheep that lunchtime with the sunday times folded under his arm twice in one week we are honored what can we do for you this time you could start with a pint of best bitter and follow it with a plate of your elsies delightful roast beef and yorkshire pud and you could cut the bloody sarcasm grafton laughed and started pulling elsies sunday lunches were another wellkept secret and only a privileged few got to taste them banks didnt fool himself that he was an accepted member of the elite he knew damn well that publicans liked to keep on the good side of the law and he said when larry handed him his pint id like a word with your cathy if i might about the rothwells is it yes aye well shes just having her dinner ill send her through when shes done thanks banks took his drink and sat by the tiled fireplace before he sat he glanced at the collection of butterflies pinned to a board in a glass case on the wall the pub wasnt as busy as most on a sunday lunchtime of course there was no sandwichboard outside advertising traditional sunday lunch bankss roast beef and yorkshires came as good as ever not for the first time he reflected that elsies was the only roast beef in yorkshire apart from sandras that was pink in the middle as he ate he propped the paper against a bottle of hp sauce and began to read an analysis of the growing political unrest on an obscure caribbean island feeling an irrational rage grow in him as he read christ how he loathed these tinpot dictators the ones who stuffed their maws with the best of everything while their subjects starved who tortured and murdered anyone who dared to complain just as he had picked up the books supplement he noticed a tourist couple walk in and look around they went to the bar and the man asked larry grafton what food he offered nowt said grafton we dont do food the man looked toward banks but hes got some last plate the man looked at his watch but its only twelvethirty grafton shrugged besides you said you dont do food youre contradicting yourself you heard him didnt you darling his wife said nothing she just stood there looking embarrassed he had the kind of upperclass accent that expects immediate subservience but he obviously didnt know there could be nothing more calculated to get right up a yorkshiremans nose look said grafton does the want a drink or doesnt tha we want food the man said his wife tugged at his sleeve come on darling she whispered just in bankss range of hearing dont cause a fuss lets go there are plenty of other pubs but i the man glared petulantly at grafton who stared back stonefaced then followed his wifes advice really banks heard him say on his way out youd think these people didnt want to make an honest living theyre supposed to be in the service industry larry grafton winked at banks and ambled off to serve one of the locals banks reflected that maybe the tourist was right what the hell was wrong with larry grafton nowt so queer as folk he decided and went back to his roast beef a couple of minutes later when he had just finished cathy grafton came from the back and joined him he folded up his newspaper pushed his empty plate aside and lit a cigarette cathy was a plump girl of about sixteen with a fringe and a blotchy complexion as if she had been sitting too close to the fire too long she also had the longest curliest and most beautiful eyelashes banks had ever seen dad says you want to talk to me she said wedging herself into a chair her accent was thick and banks had to listen closely to understand everything she said even though he had been in swainsdale for four years you helped mary rothwell do the housework at arkbeck farm didnt you aye i do for a few folk around here i know i should be paying more mind to school like but mum says we need tmoney banks smiled not surprising given the way grafton scared business away what was it like working at arkbeck he asked cathy frowned what do you mean did you like working there it were all reet how about mary rothwell did you get along well with her cathy wouldnt meet his eyes she shifted in her chair and looked down at the scored table cathy i heard its just i was always told not to speak ill of the dead mary rothwell isnt dead no of me employer am i to take it that you didnt get along then take it as you will mr banks cathy this could be very important mr rothwell was killed you know aye i know its got nowt to do with her though does it we still need to know all we can about the family cathy contemplated the table for a while longer more locals came in one or two looked in bankss direction nudged their friends and raised their eyebrows she were just bossy thats all cathy said at last mary rothwell was aye shed stand over you while you were working with her arms folded like this and tell you youd missed a bit or you werent polishing hard enough i used to hate doing for her will i still have to do you think i dont know banks said what about alison what about her youre about the same age surely you must have had things in common things to talk about pop stars and the like cathy emitted a loud snort little miss ladida she sneered then shook her head no i cant say as we did she always had her nose stuck in a book you never chatted with her no every time she saw me she turned up her nose stuckup little madam how did the family members get along with one another i werent there often enough to notice not when they was all together like but you must have some idea from your observations they didnt say much it were a quiet house he were in his office when he were at home like and i were never allowed up there who cleaned it dunno maybe he did it himself i know he didnt like people to go in look mr banks ive got to get back and help me mum is there anything else did you notice any changes in the family recently did they behave any differently not so far as i could tell what about tom the son did you know him he were tbest of the lot cathy said without hesitation always had a smile and a goodmorning for you she blushed hes been away for a while now did you notice any changes before he left they used to argue who did him and his father what about how would i know i didnt listen sometimes you couldnt help but hear hear what just their voices when they were shouting like did you ever hear what they were arguing about once tdoor were open a bit and i heard his dad mention a name then say something like im disappointed in you he said shame too what was a shame no just the word i just heard the word shame thats all i could tell mr rothwell were very angry but he sounded cold you know did he say why he was disappointed she shook her head what was the name he mentioned sounded like aston or afton or summat like that did you hear what tom said back he said youre a right one to talk about being disappointed in me did you hear anything more no the chair scraped along the stone flags as she stood up ive got to go really me mumll kill me and she hurried back behind the bar with surprising agility vic manson matched prints from the calvert flat with the ones from the body gristhorpe explained back at the station later that afternoon there were a couple of other sets too mostly smudged not on file it was hot and banks was standing by the open window of his office gristhorpe sat with his feet up on the desk so rothwell was calvert and calvert was rothwell banks said it certainly looks that way aye banks leaned against the window frame and shook his head i still cant believe it all right so we know rothwell had a secretive side to his nature and he was greedy or desperate for cash to the point of dishonesty once but this calvert sounds to me like some sort of playboy if you could have heard pamela jeffreys casinos races dancing bloody hell and you should have seen her the one he chucked over so youve told me already two or three times at least gristhorpe said with a smile a proper bobbydazzler by the sound of her ill take your word for it well she dazzled this bobby anyway said banks sitting opposite gristhorpe he sighed i suppose we just have to accept it rothwell led a double life like alec guinness in that film about the ships captain the captains paradise thats the one the question we have to ask ourselves now is what if anything does that fact have to do with his murder has the girlfriend dazzled you so much you havent considered she might have a part to play the thoughts crossed my mind once or twice yes i just cant see how apparently roth calvert found another woman five or six months ago pamela jeffreys seemed to think hed fallen in love its her we need to find but she hasnt come forward yet theres always jealousy as a motive then i dont think so its possible though maybe mary rothwell found out about him and arranged a hit i was thinking more about this pamela jeffreys couldnt afford it shes a classical musician besides she didnt really strike me as the jealous type she said calvert was just fun to be with they never made any commitments she could be lying i suppose so and dont forget the possible porn connection if rothwell was mixed up with beautiful women even under another identity who knows banks couldnt believe it but he didnt bother protesting to gristhorpe ill have to talk to her again anyway he said poor you what did the fraud squad have to say gristhorpe scratched his hooked nose funny lot arent they he said i spent a good part of this morning with di macmillan used to be in banking boring little bugger but you should have seen his eyes light up when he heard about the locked files anyway theyve had a quick look at the stuff from arkbeck farm and macmillan and i had another chat about an hour ago they havent much to go on yet of course and theyre as anxious as young phil for that bypass software but macmillans even more excited now where has the software got to by the way on its way according to phil apparently they were out of stock but they managed to scrounge around sorry what did macmillan have to say well he said he wont know anything for certain until they manage to open some of those locked directories he thinks thats where the really interesting stuff is but even some of the written documents in the filing cabinets gave him enough to suspect rothwell was heavily into moneylaundering or abetting tax evasion apparently there was a fair bit of cryptic correspondence with foreign banks liechtenstein netherlands antilles jersey switzerland the cayman islands among others dead giveaway macmillan said tax havens said banks isnt that what they are gristhorpe held up a finger aha that was my first thought too but theyre only tax havens because they have strict secrecy policies and a very flexible attitude toward whom they take on as their clients in other words offered banks if you want to deposit a lot of money with them theyll take it no questions asked thats about it aye within the law of course they do insist that they verify the moneys source is legal when it comes down to it though banks are basically run on greed arent they i wont argue with that so keith rothwell was putting a lot of money in foreign banks macmillan thought he might have been acting for a third party he could hardly have made that much money himself its a very complicated business as i said either he was involved in aiding and abetting some pretty serious tax evasion or he was part of a moneylaundering scheme there are still more questions than answers did macmillan tell you how this moneylaundering business works banks asked aye a bit according to him its basically simple its only in the application it gets complicated what happens is that somebody gets hold of a lot of money illegally and he wants it to look legal so he can live off it without raising any suspicions gristhorpe paused go on banks urged gristhorpe ran his hand through his hair well thats about it really i told you it was basically simple macmillan said it would take forever to explain all the technicalities of doing it as far as legal money is concerned he said you can either earn it borrow it or receive it as a gift when youve laundered your dirty money it has to look like it came to you one of those ways i assume were talking about drug money here banks said or the profits from some sort of organized crime prostitution pornography loan sharks gristhorpe nodded you know as well as i do alan that the top cats in the drug trade pull in enormous wads of cash every day you cant just walk into a showroom and buy a rolls in cash without raising a few eyebrows and the last thing you want is any attention from the police or the inland revenue banks walked over to the window again and lit a cigarette most of the cars were gone from the cobbled square now and the hush of an early sunday evening had fallen over the town a young woman in jeans and a red tshirt struck a pose by the ancient market cross as her male companion took a photograph then they got into a blue nissan micra and drove off whats in it for the launderer banks asked according to macmillan hed get maybe four percent for laundering the safer sort of funds and up to ten percent for seriously dirty money percent of what depends said gristhorpe on a cursory glance macmillan estimated between four and six million quid he said that was conservative over how long thats four to six a year alan jesus christ money worth murdering for isnt it in addition to rothwells legitimate earnings as a financial consultant if he were in this moneylaundering racket he also stood to earn lets say five percent of five million a year to make it easy how much is that quarter of a million quid aye my arithmetic was never among the best well no wonder the bugger could afford a bmw and a new kitchen he rubbed his hands together and thats about it macmillan said theyll start putting a financial profile together first thing in the morning bank accounts credit cards building societies inland revenue loans investments the lot he said they shouldnt have any trouble getting a warrant from the judge given the circumstances hes also getting in touch with the yard this is big alan what about calvert banks asked well theyll have to cover him too now wont they a sharp knock at the door was immediately followed by phil richmond holding a small package ive got it he said an excited light in his eyes the bypass software give me a few minutes to study the manual and well see what we can do they all followed him to the computer room once a cupboard for storing cleaning materials and stood around tensely in the cramped space while he booted up and consulted the instructions all rothwells computer gear and records were with the fraud squad but richmond had made backup disks of the relevant files susan gay popped her head around the door and finding no room left inside stood in the doorway banks watched as richmond went through a series of commands dialogue boxes appeared and disappeared drive lights flashed on and off the machine buzzed and hummed banks noticed gristhorpe chewing on his thumbnail got it richmond said then a locked file called summary came to the screen what the hell is all that about banks asked it looks like financial records for the last quarter of gristhorpe said companies banks dates maybe numbered accounts keep going phil try that letter file you mentioned richmond highlighted the locked file tapped at the keyboard again and the file appeared unscrambled for all to see it was a letter dated may and addressed to a mr daniel clegg solicitor of park square leeds and on first glance it seemed innocuous enough dear mr clegg in the light of certain information that has recently come to my attention i regret that we must terminate our association yours faithfully keith rothwell thats it gristhorpe asked are you sure you didnt lose anything richmond returned to the keyboard to check then shook his head no sir thats it banks backed toward the door interesting he said i wonder what information that was he looked at gristhorpe who said get it printed out will you phil before it disappears into the bloody ether chapter in park square on that fine monday morning in may with the pink and white blossoms still on the trees banks could easily have imagined himself a regency dandy out for a stroll while composing a satire upon the princes latest folly opposite the town hall and the court center but hidden behind westgate park square is one of the few examples of elegant lateeighteenthcentury leeds remaining unlike most of the fashionable west end squares it survived benjamin gotts bean ing mills an enormous steampowered woollen factory which literally smoked out the middle classes and sent them scurrying north to the fresher air of headingley chapel allerton and roundhay away from the soot and smoke carried over the town on the prevailing westerly winds banks faced the terrace of nicely restored two and threestory georgian houses built of red brick and yellow sandstone with their black iron railings queen anne pediments and classicalstyle doorways with columns and entablatures very impressive he thought finding the right house as expected it was just the kind of place to have several polished brass nameplates beside the door one of which read daniel clegg solicitor a list on the wall inside the open front door told him that the office he wanted was on the first floor he walked up saw the name on the frostedglass door then knocked and entered he found himself in a dim anteroom that smelled vaguely of paint where a woman sat behind a desk sorting through a stack of letters when he came in he noticed a look of fear flash through her eyes quickly replaced by one of suspicion can i help you she asked as if she didnt really want to she was about thirty banks guessed with curly brown hair a thin olivecomplexioned face and a rather long nose her pale green eyes were pink around the rims she wore a loose fawn cardigan over her white blouse despite the heat banks introduced himself and showed his card id like to see mr clegg he said is he around hes not here do you know when hell be back no it sounded like dough do you know where he is no whats your name elizabeth elizabeth moorhead im mr cleggs secretary everyone calls me betty she took a crumpled paper tissue from the sleeve of her cardigan and blew her nose cold she said godda cold in may can you believe it i hate summer colds id like to see mr clegg betty banks said again is there a problem i should say so can i help she drew back a bit as if still deciding whether to trust him what do you want him for banks hesitated for a moment then told her at least he would get some kind of reaction i wanted to ask a few questions about keith rothwell her brow wrinkled in a frown mr rothwell yes of course poor mr rothwell he and mr clegg had some business together now and then i read about him in the papers it was terrible what happened did you know him well mr rothwell no not at all not really but hed been here in this office i mean i knew him to say hello to when did you see him last just last week it was tuesday or wednesday i think he was standing right there where you are now isnt it terrible banks agreed that it was can you try and remember which day it was it could be important she muttered to herself about appointments and flipped through a heavy book on her desk finally she said it was wednesday just before i finished for the day at five mr rothwell didnt have an appointment but i remember because it was just after mr hoskins left a client mr rothwell had to wait out here a few moments and we chatted about how lovely the gardens are at this time of year thats all you talked about yes then what then mr clegg came out and they went off do you know where no but i think they went for a drink they had business to discuss so rothwell had visited clegg in leeds the day before his murder almost two weeks after the letter ending their association why it certainly hadnt been noted in his appointment book how did mr rothwell seem he asked no different from usual and mr clegg fine why are you asking did you notice any tension between them no has anything odd been happening around here lately has mr clegg received any strange messages for example noo some hesitation there he would get back to it later banks glanced around the small tidy anteroom does everything go through you mail phone calls most things yes but mr clegg has a private line too i see how did he react to the news of mr rothwells death she studied banks closely then appeared to decide to trust him she sighed and rested her hands on the desk palms down thats just the problem she said i dont know i havent seen him since hes not here i mean hes not just out of the office right now but hes disappeared into thin air disappeared have you told the local police she shook her head i wouldnt want to look a fool has he done anything like this before no never but if he has just gone off you know with a woman or something i mean he could have couldnt he when did you last see him last thursday he left the office about half past five and that was the last i saw of him he didnt come in to work on friday morning have you tried to call him at home yes but all i got was the answering machine did he say anything about a business trip banks asked no and he usually tells me if hes going to be away for any length of time do you know what kind of business relationship mr clegg had with keith rothwell no im only his secretary mr clegg didnt take me into his confidence all i know is that mr rothwell came to the office now and then and sometimes theyd go out to lunch together or for drinks after work i knew mr rothwell was an accountant so i supposed it would be something to do with tax mr clegg specializes in tax law you see im sorry i cant be of more help maybe you can be it seems a bit of a coincidence doesnt it mr rothwell getting killed and mr clegg disappearing around the same time she shrugged i didnt hear about mr rothwells death until saturday i just never thought have you ever heard of someone called robert calvert no are you sure did mr clegg never mention the name no he wasnt a client im sure id remember why didnt you get in touch with the police when you realized mr clegg had disappeared and you heard about mr rothwells murder why should i mr clegg had a lot of clients he knew a lot of businessmen but they dont usually get murdered she sneezed no as i said its tragic what happened but i dont see how as it connects with mr clegg maybe it does and maybe it doesnt banks said but dont you think thats for us to decide i dont know what you mean she reached for the tissue again this time it disintegrated when she blew her nose she dropped it in the wastepaper bin and took a fresh one from the box on her desk banks regarded her closely he didnt think she was lying or evading the issue she simply didnt understand what he was getting at he sometimes expected everyone to view the world with the same suspicious mind and jaundiced eye as he did besides she didnt know about the letter rothwell had left in the locked file he sat on the edge of the desk right betty lets go back a bit when i came in you were frightened why she paused for a moment then said i thought you might be one of them again one of whom on saturday morning i was here doing some filing and two men came in and started asking questions about mr clegg they werent very nice is that what you were thinking of when i asked you earlier if anything odd had been going on yes why didnt you tell me then it i i didnt connect it youve got me all confused all right betty take it easy did they hurt you of course not or i certainly would have called the police you see sometimes in this business you get people who are well less than polite they get upset about money and sometimes they dont care who they take it out on and these men were just rude yes well just a bit brusque really nothing unusual i mean im only a secretary right im not important they can afford to be short with me so what bothered you why does it stick in your mind why were you frightened did they threaten you not in so many words but i got the impression that they were testing me to see what i knew i think they realized early on that i didnt know anything if theyd thought differently im sure they would have hurt me dont ask me how i know i could just feel it there was something about them some sort of coldness in their eyes as if theyd done terrible things or witnessed terrible things she shivered i dont know i cant explain they were the kind of people you look away from when they make eye contact what did they want to know about where mr clegg was thats all yes i asked them why they wanted to know but they just said they had important business with him id never seen them before and im sure id know if they were new clients did they leave their names no what did they look like just ordinary businessmen really one was black and the other white they both wore dark suits white shirts ties i cant remember what colors what about their height both about the same around six foot id say but the white one was burly you know he had thick shoulders and a round chest like a wrestler or something he had very fair hair but he was going bald on top he tried to disguise it by growing the hair at the side longer and combing it right over but i just think that looks silly dont you the black man was thin and fit looking more like a runner than a wrestler he did most of the talking banks got her to describe them in as much detail as she could and took notes they certainly didnt match alison rothwells description of the two men in black who had tied her up and killed her father what about their accents he asked not local the black one sounded a bit cultured well educated and the other didnt speak much i think he had a slight foreign accent though i couldnt swear to it and i cant tell you where from youve done fine betty i have banks nodded theres something else she said when i came in this morning i got the impression that someone had been in the place since then again i cant say why and i certainly couldnt prove it but in this job you develop a feel for the way things should be you know files documents that sort of thing and you can just tell if somethings out of place without knowing what it really is if you follow my drift were there any signs of forced entry no nothing obvious nothing like that not that it would be difficult to get in here its hardly the tower of london i locked myself out once when mr clegg was away on business and i just slipped my visa card in the door and opened it she put her hand to her mouth oops i dont suppose i should be telling you that should i banks smiled its all right betty ive had to get into my car with a coathanger more than once was anything missing not so far as i can tell its pretty secure inside theres a good strong safe and it doesnt look as if anyone tried to tamper with it could it have been mr clegg i suppose so he sometimes comes in on a sunday if theres something important in progress then she shook her head but no if it had been mr clegg id have known things would have looked different they looked the same but not quite the same if you know what i mean as if someone had messed things up and tried to restore them to the way they were originally yes do you employ a cleaning lady yes but she comes thursday evenings it cant have been her did she arrive as usual last thursday yes may i have a look in the office betty got up took a key from her drawer and opened cleggs door for him he stood on the threshold and saw a small office with shelves of law books box files and filing cabinets clegg also had a computer and stacks of disks on a desk at right angles to the one on which he did his other paperwork the window closed and locked banks noticed looked out over the central square with its neatly cut grass shady trees and people sitting on benches the office was hot and stuffy certainly nothing looked out of the ordinary banks was careful not to disturb anything soon the fraud squad would be here to pore over the books and look for whatever the link was between rothwell and clegg better keep it locked he told betty on his way out therell be more police here this afternoon most likely may i use the phone betty nodded banks phoned ken blackstone at millgarth and told him briefly what the situation was ken said hed send a car over right away next he phoned superintendent gristhorpe in eastvale and reported his findings gristhorpe said hed get in touch with the fraud squad and see if they could coordinate with west yorkshire he turned back to betty youll be all right here he said ill wait until the locals arrive theyll need you to answer more questions just tell them everything you told me whats your address in case i need to get in touch she gave him the address of her flat in burmantofts what do you think has happened she asked reaching for her tissue again banks shook his head you dont think anythings happened to him do you its probably nothing banks said without conviction dont worry well get to the bottom of it its just that melissa will be so upset whos melissa oh didnt you know its mrs clegg his wife after a hurried bowl of vegetable soup in the golden grill susan gay walked out into the street with its familiar smells and noises petrol fumes of course car horns fresh coffee bread from the bakery a busker playing a flute by the church doors in the cobbled market square she noticed an impromptu evangelist set up his soapbox and start rabbiting on about judgment and sin it made her feel vaguely guilty just hearing him and as she went into the station she contemplated asking one of the uniforms to go out and move him on there must be a law against it somewhere on the books disturbing the peace of an overworked dc charity prevailed and she went up to her office it faced the car park out back so she wouldnt have to listen to him there first she took out the blue file cards she liked to make notes on and pinned them to the corkboard over her desk it was the same board she remembered that sergeant hatchley had used for his pinups of pagethree girls with vacuous smiles and enormous breasts now hatchley was due back any moment what a thought then after she had made another appointment to talk to laurence pratt she luxuriated in the empty office stretching like a cat feeling as if she were in a deep warm bubblebath out of the window she could see the maintenance men with their shirtsleeves rolled up washing the patrol cars in the large car park sun glinted on their rings and watchstraps and on the shiny chrome they polished it spread rainbows of oily sheen on the bright windscreens one of the men in particular caught her eye wellmuscled but not overbearingly so with a lock of blond hair that slipped over his eye and bounced as he rubbed the bonnet in long slow strokes the telephone broke into her fantasy she picked it up hello eastvale cid can i help you to whom am i speaking detective constable susan gay is the superintendent there im afraid not and chief inspector banks out of the office can i help you whats this about i suppose youll have to do my name is mary rothwell ive just had a call from my son tom you have where is he hes still in florida a hotel in lido key wherever that is apparently the british newspapers are a couple of days late over there and hes just read about his fathers murder its only eight in the morning there he cant get a flight back until this evening anyway he said he should get into manchester at about seven oclock tomorrow morning im going to meet him at the airport and bring him home thats good news mrs rothwell susan said you do know wed like to talk to him yes though i cant imagine why youll pass the message on to the chief inspector will you yes good and by the way ive made funeral arrangements for wednesday that is still all right isnt it of course very well is there anything else mrs rothwell no goodbye then well be in touch susan hung up and stared into space for a moment thinking what an odd woman mary rothwell was imperious highly strung and businesslike probably a real tartar to live with but was she a murderess though it would take the fraud squad a long time to work out exactly how much rothwell was worth and to separate the legal from the illegal money it was bound to be a fortune money worth killing for the problem was though susan could imagine mary rothwell being coldblooded enough to have her husband killed she could not imagine her having it done in such a bloody dramatic way the image of the kneeling headless corpse came back to her and she tasted the vegetable soup rise in her throat no she thought if the wife were responsible rothwell would have been disposed of in a neat sanitary way poison perhaps and he certainly wouldnt have made such a mess on the garage floor what was the phrase you dont shit on your own doorstep it was too close to home for mary it would probably taint arkbeck farm for her forever still there was a lot of money involved susan had seen rothwells solicitor that morning and according to him rothwell had owned or partowned about fifteen businesses from a shipping company registered in the bahamas to a dry cleaners in wigan not to mention various properties dotted around england spain portugal and france of course the solicitor assured her they were all legitimate she suspected however that some had served as fronts for rothwells illegal activities as susan was wondering if robert calverts money would now simply get lumped in with keith rothwells she became aware of a large shadow cast over her desk by a figure in the doorway she looked up startled right into the smiling face of detective sergeant jim hatchley so soon she thought with a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach now she knew there really was no god hello love said hatchley lighting a cigarette i see youve taken my pinups down well have to do something about that now im back to stay at onethirty the hot smoky pub was still packed with local clerks and shopkeepers on their lunch break when banks had phoned pamela jeffreys before leaving for leeds that morning she had suggested they meet in the pub across from the hall in west leeds where she was rehearsing with a string quartet there was no beer garden she said but the curry of the day was usually excellent though he had to admit to feeling excitement at the thought of seeing pamela again this wasnt a meeting banks was looking forward to she hadnt arrived yet so banks got himself a pint of shandy at the bar just the thing for a hot day and managed to grab a small table in the corner by the dartboard fortunately not in use there he mulled over daniel cleggs disappearance and the mysterious goons betty moorhead had seen there was no end of trouble a lawyer could get himself into banks speculated especially if he were a bit crooked to start with so maybe there was no connection between cleggs disappearance and rothwells murder but there were too many coincidences the letter the timing the shady accounts and banks didnt like coincidences which meant that there were two sets of goons on the loose the ones who killed rothwell and the ones who scared cleggs secretary but did they work for the same person he was saved from bashing his head against a brick wall any longer by the arrival of pamela jeffreys looking gorgeous in black leggings and a long white tshirt with the opera north logo on front she had her hair tied back and wore blackrimmed glasses as she sat down she smiled at him the professional musicians look she said keeps my hair out of my eyes so i can read the music would you like a drink banks asked just a grapefruit juice with an icecube please if theyve got any i have to play through death and the maiden again this afternoon while he was at the bar banks also ordered two curries of the day whats been happening pamela asked when he got back plenty said banks hoping to avoid the issue of calverts identity for as long as possible but ive no idea how it all adds up first off have you ever heard of a man called daniel clegg she shook her head no i cant say as i have hes a solicitor hes not mine actually i dont have one are you sure robert never mentioned him no and i think id remember but i already told you he never talked about his work and i never asked what do i know or care about business she looked at him over the top of her glass as she sipped her grapefruit juice thin black eyebrows raised did you ever introduce robert to any of your friends no he never seemed really interested in going to parties or having dinner with people or anything so i never pushed it they probably wouldnt have got on very well anyway most of my friends are young and artsy roberts more mature why did you ever meet anyone he knew when you were out together say in a restaurant or at the casino no not that i can recall so you didnt have much of a social life together no we didnt just a bit of gambling the occasional day at the races then it was mostly concerts or a video and a pizza that was a bit of a problem really robert was a lot of fun but he didnt like crowds im a bit more of a social butterfly myself i dont mean to embarrass you banks said slowly but did robert show any interest in pornography did he like to take photographs make videos anything like that she looked at him openmouthed then burst out laughing sorry sorry she said patting her chest you know most girls might be insulted if you suggested they moonlighted in video nasties but its so absurd i cant help but laugh so the answers no dont look so embarrassed of course its no you silly man the very thought of it she laughed again and banks felt himself blush their curries came and they tucked in they were as pamela had said delicious delicately spiced rather than hot with plenty of chunks of tender beef they exchanged small talk over the food edging away from the embarrassing topic banks had brought up earlier when they had finished pamela went for more drinks and banks lit a cigarette was she going to ask now he wondered or was he going to have to bring it up maybe she was avoiding the moment too finally she asked did you find out anything you know about robert and this rothwell fellow very casual but banks could sense the apprehension in her voice he scraped the end of his cigarette on the rim of the red metal ashtray and avoided her eyes a group at the next table burst into laughter at a joke one of them had told well he looked up it looks very much as if robert calvert and keith rothwell were the same person he said we found fingerprints that matched im sorry for a while she said nothing banks could see her beautiful almond eyes fill slowly with tears shit she said shaking her head and reaching in her bag for a tissue sorry this is stupid of me i dont know why im crying we were just friends really can we i mean she gestured around of course banks took her arm and they left the pub fifty yards along the main road was a park pamela looked at her watch and said ive still got a while yet if you dont mind walking a bit not at all they walked past a playground where children screamed with delight as the swings went higher and higher and the roundabout spun faster and faster a small wadingpool had been filled with water because of the warm weather and more children played there splashing one another squealing and shouting all under their mothers or fathers watchful eyes nobody let their kids play out alone these days as they used to do when he was a child banks noticed being in his job knowing what he knew he didnt blame them pamela seemed lost in her silent grief head bowed walking slowly its crazy she said at last i hardly knew robert and things had cooled off between us anyway and here i am behaving like this banks could think of nothing to say he was aware of the warmth of her arm in his and of her scent jasmine he thought what the hell did he think he was doing walking arm in arm in the park with a beautiful suspect what if someone saw him but what could he do the contact seemed to form an important link between pamela and something real something she could hold onto while the rest of her world shifted under her feet like fine sand and he couldnt deny that the touch of her skin meant something to him too i was wrong about him wasnt i she went on dead wrong he was married you say kids a son and a daughter i should know i read it in the paper but it didnt sink in because i was so sure it couldnt have been him robert seemed so such a free spirit maybe he was she glanced sideways at him what do you mean they stopped at an icecream van and banks bought two cornets it was a different life he lived with you he said i cant begin to understand a man like that its not that he had a split personality or anything just that he was capable of existing in very different ways what ways pamela stuck out her pink tongue and licked the icecream the people in swainsdale knew him as a quiet unassuming sort of bloke bit of a dry stick really robert she gasped a dry stick not robert keith rothwell the hardworking cleanliving accountant the man who put his spent matches back in the box in the opposite direction to the unused ones but robert was so alive he was fun to be with we laughed a lot we dreamed we danced banks smiled sadly there you are then keith rothwell probably had two left feet are you saying it wasnt the same man i dont know what im saying just that your memories of robert calvert wont change shouldnt change hes who he was to you what he meant to you dont let this poison it for you on the other hand i need to know who killed keith rothwell and it looks as if there might be a connection she put her arm in his again and they walked on there was hardly any breeze at all but they passed a boy trying to fly a redandgreen kite he couldnt seem to get it more than about twenty feet off the ground before it came flopping down again what do you mean a connection pamela asked shifting her gaze from the kite back to banks maybe something in his life as robert calvert spilled over into his life as keith rothwell are you sure you didnt know he was married you didnt suspect it she shook her head no ive been a right bloody fool havent i muggins again but you were sure hed found a new girlfriend ninetynine percent certain yes how did you feel about that what his new girlfriend how did you feel about her on the one hand you tell me you shouldnt be so upset you hardly knew robert calvert and your relationship had cooled off anyway on the other hand it seems to me from what you say and the way you behave that you were extremely fond of him maybe in love with him whats the truth how did you really feel when someone else came along and stole him from you surely you must have felt hurt angry jealous pamela pulled back her arm and stepped aside from him an expression of pain and anger shadowing her face she dropped her icecream it splattered on the tarmac path whats that got to do with anything what are you saying what are you getting at first you imply that im some kind of porn actress and now youre implying that i killed robert out of jealousy no said banks quickly no nothing like that but she was already backing away from him hands held up palms out as if to ward him off yes you are how could you even i thought you banks stepped toward her thats not what i mean pamela im just but she turned and started to run away wait banks called after her please stop one or two people gave him suspicious looks as he set off walking quickly after her a childs colored ball rolled in front of him and he had to pull up sharply to avoid knocking into its diminutive owner whose large father fast approaching from the nearest bench didnt seem at all happy about things pamela reached the park exit and dashed across the road dodging her way through the traffic back toward the hall banks stood there looking after her the sweat beading on his brow the remains of his icecream had started to melt and drip over the flesh between his thumb and first finger shit he cursed under his breath then louder shit the little boy looked up puzzled and his father loomed closer chapter the merrion centre was one of the first indoor shopping malls in britain built on the northern edge of leeds city center in it now seems something of an antique a monument to the heady sixties days of slum clearance tower blocks and council estates covered on top but open to the wind at the sides it also suffers competition from a number of more recent fully enclosed central shopping centers such as the st johns centre directly across merrion street and the plush dark green and brass luxury of the schofields centre right on the headrow still the merrion centre does have a large morrisons supermarket le phonographique discotheque the longest surviving disco in leeds a number of small specialty shops a couple of pubs a flea market and the classical record shop which is how banks had come to know the place quite well and on a warm windless may afternoon it can be pleasant enough banks found cleggs wines and spirits easily enough he had phoned melissa clegg an hour or so earlier still smarting over his acrimonious parting with pamela jeffreys in the park and she had told him she could spare a little time to talk it was odd he thought that she hadnt seemed overly curious about his call he had said that it concerned her husband yet she had asked for no details he opened the door and found himself in a small shop cluttered with bottles and cases there were a couple of bins of specials on the floor by the door mostly bulgarian romanian and south african varietals and some yellow marked down cards on a few of the racks that lined the walls to his right and left including a rioja a côtes du rhône and a claret banks looked at the racks and thought he might take something home for dinner assuming that he and sandra ever got the chance to sit down to dinner together again and assuming that she wanted to perhaps they could have that wine candlelight and chopin evening he had had to cancel when the rothwell enquiry got in the way behind the counter ranged the bottles of single malt scotch knockando blair athol talisker glendronach evocative names but he mustnt look too closely he had a weakness for single malt that sandra said hit them too hard in the pocket besides he still had a drop of laphroaig left at home the spotty young man behind the counter smiled can i help you sir he wore a candystriped shirt with the sleeves rolled up and his tie loose at the neck the way banks always wore his own when he could get away with it his black hair had so much gel or mousse on that it looked like an oil slick boss around banks asked showing his card in the back he lifted up the counter flap and banks went through stepping over and around cases of wine he walked along a narrow corridor then saw on his left a tiny office with the door open a woman sat at the desk talking on the phone it sounded to banks as if she were complaining over nondelivery of several cases of hungarian pinot noir when she saw him she waved him in and pointed to a chair piled high with papers banks moved them to the edge of the desk and she grinned at him over the mouthpiece there were no windows and it was stuffy in the back room despite the whirring fan the office smelled of freshly cut wood banks took his jacket off and hung it over the back of the chair he could feel the steady draft of the fan on the left side of his face finally she put the phone down and rolled her eyes some suppliers she was wearing a yellow sundress with thin straps that left most of her nicely tanned and freckled shoulders and throat bare about forty banks guessed she looked as if she watched what she ate and exercised regularly tennis probably her straight blonde hair parted in the middle hung just above her shoulders framing a heartshaped face with high cheekbones it was a cheerful face one to which a smile was no stranger and the youthful uneven fringe suited her but banks also noticed marks of stress and strain in the wrinkles under her bluegray eyes and around her slightly puckered mouth a pair of nononsense glasses with tortoiseshell frames dangled on a cord around her neck your phone call piqued my curiosity she said leaning back in her chair and linking her hands behind her head banks noticed the shadow of stubble under her arms what has dannyboy been up to now im sorry said banks i dont follow didnt betty tell you tell me what oh god that woman gormless about danny and me were separated have been for about two years now it was all perfectly amicable of course of course banks thought how often had he heard that if it was all so bloody amicable he wondered then why arent you still together i didnt know he said then im sorry youre probably on a wild goose chase she changed her position resting her hands on the desk and playing with a rubber band there were no rings on her fingers anyway im still intrigued she said i am still fond of danny i would be concerned if i thought anything had happened to him it hasnt has it do you still see one another from time to time when did you last see him hmm she pursed her lips and thought a couple of months ago we had lunch together at whitelocks how did he seem fine she stretched the rubber band tight look youve got me worried all this interest in danny all of a sudden first those clients of his now you banks pricked up his ears what clients on saturday saturday afternoon just a couple of businessmen wondering if i knew where he was did they know you were separated yes they said it was a long shot and they were sorry to bother me but theyd had an appointment scheduled with him that morning and he hadnt shown up hed mentioned me and the shop at some time or other of course he often does by way of sending me business what a sweetheart anyway they asked if i had any idea where he was if hed suddenly decided to go away for the weekend as if id know it all seemed innocent enough is something wrong what did they look like she described the same two men who had visited betty moorhead it wouldnt have been difficult for them to find out about melissas shop perhaps even betty had told them and if they were looking for clegg it was reasonable to assume that his exwife might know where he was she must have convinced them quickly that she neither knew nor cared the rubber band snapped look she said ive a right to know if somethings happened to danny havent i we dont know if anything has happened to him banks said hes just gone missing she breathed a sigh of relief so thats all banks frowned his secretary seems worried enough she says its unusual oh bettys a nice enough girl but she is a bit of an alarmist danny always did have an eye for the ladies thats one reason were no longer together i should imagine if hes gone missing then something came up so to speak she grinned showing slightly overlapping front teeth wouldnt he at least let his secretary know where he was ill admit that is a bit unusual while danny was never exactly tied to his desk he didnt like to be too far from the action you know the type always on his car phone to the office who knows maybe hes having a midlife crisis maybe he and his bit of crumpet have gone somewhere where there are no telephones hes such a romantic is danny the phone rang and mrs clegg excused herself for a moment banks caught her half of the conversation about an order of méthode champenoise a couple of minutes later she put the phone down sorry where were we mrs clegg we think your husband might have been mixed up in some shady dealings and that might have had something to do with his disappearance she laughed shady dealings that hardly surprises me do you know anything about his business activities no but dishonest in love she let the thought trail then shrugged danny never was one of the most ethical or faithful of people careful usually yes but hardly ethical would you say he was the type to get mixed up in something illegal she thought for a moment frowning then answered yes yes i think so if he thought the returns were high enough is he a greedy man noo not in so many words no i wouldnt call him greedy he just likes to get what he wants women money whatever its more a matter of power manipulation he just likes to win what about the risk she tipped her head to one side theres always some risk isnt there chief inspector if somethings worth having dannys not a coward if thats what you mean did you know keith rothwell yes not well but i had met him poor man i read about him in the paper terrible youre not suggesting theres any link between his murder and dannys disappearance are you shes quicker on the ball than betty moorhead banks thought we dont know i dont suppose youd be in a position to enlighten us about their business dealings sorry no i havent seen keith since danny and i split up even then id just bump into him at the office now and then or when he helped with my taxes so youve no idea what kinds of dealings they were involved in no as i said keith rothwell did my accounts a couple of times you know the wine business when dan and i were together before things became awkward and our personal life got in the way he was a damn good accountant he saved me a lot of money from the inland revenue all above board now it doesnt take a sherlock holmes to figure out that if the two of them were in business together it probably involved tax havens of one kind or another and that they both probably did quite well from it have you ever heard of a man called robert calvert calvert no i cant say i have should i have look im really sorry i cant help you chief inspector and i certainly didnt mean to sound callous at all but knowing danny im sure hes popped off to paris for the weekend with some floozie or other and just got too overexcited to remember to let anyone know hell turn up banks stood up i hope youre right mrs clegg and if he gets in touch please let us know he gave her his card she stood up as he left the office he turned in the doorway and smiled one more thing yes could you recommend a decent claret for dinner not too pricey of course if youre not absolutely stuck on bordeaux try a bottle of the chateau de la liquiere it s from faugères in languedoc very popular region these days lots of character she smiled and you can even afford it on a policemans salary after banks thanked her he made his way back down the corridor dodging the wine cases and bought the bottle she had suggested not an entirely wasted visit he thought at least hed got a decent bottle of wine out of it and then there was the classical record shop just around the corner he couldnt pass so closely without going in besides he needed balm for his wounds he was still feeling annoyed with himself after the way he had messed things up with pamela jeffreys the new cd of the khachaturian piano concerto if they had it might just help make him feel better as he walked outside with his bottle of wine he felt a large hand clap down on his shoulder well if it isnt my old mate banksy a voice said in his ear banks spun round and saw the source of the voice detective superintendent richard dirty dick burgess from scotland yard what the hell was he doing here i hope you havent been accepting bribes burgess said pointing to the wine then he put his arm around bankss shoulders come on he said we need to go somewhere and have a little chat laurence pratt was waiting in his office again with his shirtsleeves rolled up blackframed glasses about halfway down his nose fingers forming a steeple on the neat desk in front of him his white shirt was more dazzling than any susan had seen in a detergent advert susan felt stifled the temperature outside was in the twenties and the window was closed pratt seemed less easy in his manner this time susan observed and she guessed it was because he had given too much away on her last visit this was going to be a tough one she thought taking her notebook and pen out of her handbag they had discovered a lot more about keith rothwell since friday and this time she didnt want to give too much away susan opened her notebook resisting the impulse to fan her face with it and unclipped her pen the last time i talked to you mr pratt she began you told me you saw the rothwells for the last time in march thats right carla and i were out to arkbeck for dinner duck à lorange if i remember correctly and the new kitchen ah yes we all admired the new kitchen can you be a bit more precise about the date pratt frowned and pulled at his lower lip not exactly it was just after st patricks day i think hang on a sec he fished in his briefcase by the side of the desk and pulled out a filofax be lost without it he grinned even in the computer age i mean you dont want to turn the computer on every time you need an address do you as he talked he flipped through the pages ah there it is he held up the open page for susan to see march dinner with keith and mary and you said tom dropped in to talk about his trip yes from where what oh i see from his room i suppose at least i think hed been up there he just came in to say hello while we were having cocktails is he back from america by the way no harm in telling a family friend that susan thought hes on his way she said what was the atmosphere like between tom and his father that night they didnt talk as i remember did you notice any antagonism or tension between them i wouldnt say that no i told you before that their relationship was strained because tom drifted off the course his father had set for him was anything said about that on the night you were there no im certain of it they didnt talk to one another at all tom was excited about going to america i think hed been upstairs poring over a map planning his route and keith rothwell said nothing during your little chat no he just sat there rather pofaced now you mention it that was a bit odd i mean youd hardly call old keith a live wire these days but hed usually take a bit more interest than he did that night especially as his son was off on a big adventure so his behavior was strange a little unusual on reflection yes what about tom did he say anything to or about his father pratt shook his head slowly susan noticed a few beads of sweat around his temples where his hairline was receding she could feel her own sweat tickling her ribs as it slid down her side so much for the expensive extradry longlasting antiperspirant she had put on after her morning shower this didnt happen to the highpowered women executives and airline pilots in the television adverts on the other hand they didnt have to deal with the return of sergeant hatchley it had taken her a good five minutes to stop shaking after he had left the office she asked pratt to open the window he complied but it didnt do much good the air outside was still and hot even the gargoyles on the upper walls of the community center looked grumpy and sweaty did mr rothwell ever express any interest in pornography pratt raised his eyebrows good lord how do you mean as a business venture or for personal consumption either not in my presence as i said i dont know about the extent of his business interests but he always struck me as rather say sexless when we were younger of course wed chase the lasses but since his marriage have you ever met a solicitor called daniel clegg no the name doesnt sound familiar are you sure he practices in eastvale youve never met him i told you ive never even heard of him why do you ask is there some did mr rothwell ever mention him is there some connection did mr rothwell ever mention him pratt stared at susan for about fifteen long seconds then said no not that i recall susan ran the back of her hand across her moist brow she was beginning to feel a little dizzy what about robert calvert never heard of him either is this another business colleague of keiths i told you we never talked about his business he played his cards close to his chest did he ever mention a woman called pamela jeffreys pratt raised an eyebrow a woman keith another woman good lord no i told you he didnt strike me as the type not these days anyway besides mary would have killed him oh my god its all right mr pratt susan said slip of the tongue jealous type is she he pushed his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose mary well id guess so yes but you dont know for certain no its just the impression she gives how everything centered around keith the house the family if anything came along to jeopardize that threaten it then shed be a formidable enemy possessive selfish id say definitely is that the same thing susan closed her notebook and stood up thank you mr pratt thank you very much again youve been most helpful then she hurried out of the hot stuffy office before she fainted they walked down to stumps under the museum and made their way to the bar where burgess ordered a pint of mcewans lager and banks a pint of bitter it wasnt theakstons but it would have to do as it was a warm day they took their drinks outside and found a free table there was a broad tiled area between the museumlibrary complex and the buses roaring by on the headrow and pedestrians hurried back and forth some heading for the court centre or the town hall and some taking shortcuts to calverley street and the civic hall a group of people stood playing chess with oversize figures on a board drawn on the tiles scaffolding covered the front of one of the nineteenthcentury buildings across the headrow banks noticed another renovation banks felt both puzzled and apprehensive at burgesss arrival on the scene the last time they had locked horns was over the killing of a policeman at an antigovernment demonstration in eastvale back in the thatcher era burgess had fitted in just fine back then an east ender son of a barrow boy he had fought his way up from the bottom with a fierce mixture of ego ambition cunning and a total disregard for the rules most people played by he also felt no sympathy for those who had been unable to do likewise now at about bankss age he was a detective superintendent working for a scotland yard department that was not quite special branch and not quite m but close enough to both to give banks the willies in a period when a fully functioning human heart was regarded as a severe disability he had been one of the new golden breed of workingclass conservatives up there in the firmament of the new britain alongside the bright young things in the city the insider traders and their like cops and criminals it didnt seem to make a lot of difference as long as you were successful but then it never did to some people nobody could gainsay burgesss abilities intelligence and physical courage being foremost among them but the end justifies the means could have been written just for him the end was some vague sort of loyalty to whatever the people in power wanted done for the preservation of order as long as the people in power werent liberals or socialists of course and as for the means the sky was the limit maybe he had changed banks wondered after all the recent inquiries and commissions a policeman could surely no longer walk into a pub pick up the first group of irish people he saw and throw them in jail as terrorists could he or walk down brixton road and arrest the first black person he saw running according to the publicrelations people todays policeman was a cross between santa claus and a hotel manager on the other hand perhaps that was only according to the pr people truth in advertising caveat emptor and the rest besides if there was one thing not likely to make the slightest impression on burgesss obsidian consciousness it was political correctness banks lit a cigarette and held out his lighter as burgess fired up one of his tom thumb cigars he was still in good shape though filling out a bit around the belly he had a square jaw and slightly crooked teeth his black slickedback hair was turning silver at the temples and sideboards and the bags under his seenitall gray eyes looked as if they had taken on a bit more weight since banks had last seen him about six feet tall casually dressed in black leather jacket openneck shirt and gray cords he was still handsome enough to turn the heads of a few thirtyish women and had a reputation as something of a rake it wasnt entirely unfounded banks had discovered the last time they worked together banks reached for his pint to what do i owe the honor he asked he had never dignified burgess with the sir his rank demanded and he was damned if he was about to start now burgess swigged some lager swished it around his mouth and swallowed well said banks enough bloody theatrics for christs sake i dont suppose youd believe me if i said id missed you get on with it right thought not ever heard of a place called st corona of course its a caribbean island been in the news a bit lately clever boy thats the one population about four point eight million area about seven thousand square miles chief resources bauxite limestone aluminum sugar cane plus various fruits and spices fish and a bit of gold silver and nickel a lot of tourism too or there used to be so youve been studying whitakers almanac said banks now what the bloody hell is this all about a tipsy youth bumped into the table and spilled some of burgesss lager the youth stopped to apologize but the look burgess gave him sent him stumbling off into the bright afternoon sunlight before he could get the words out fucking lager lout burgess muttered wiping the beer off the tabletop with a handkerchief gone to the dogs this country where was i oh yes st corona imports just about everything you need to live including the machinery to make it lots of television sets radios fridges washing machines he paused and whistled between his teeth as a young redhead in a miniskirt walked by now thats not bad he said which reminds me have you rogered that young redhead in eastvale yet you know the psychologist he flicked the stub of his cigar toward the gutter it hit the wall just above with a shower of sparks burgess meant jenny fuller as he knew damn well banks managed a smile remembering what happened the last time those two met st corona he said you were saying burgess pouted youre no fun know who the president is what is this bloody mastermind martin churchill now if youve got something to tell me get it off your chest and let me go home its been a long day back to that lovely wife of yours eh sandra isnt it all right all right st corona is a republic and youre right martin churchill is president for life good name for the job dont you think ive read about him yes well the poor sods a bit beleaguered these days what with the opposition parties raking up the muck and the independence and liberation movements going from strength to strength he sighed i dont know it seems people just dont believe in a good old benevolent dictatorship anymore benevolent my arse said banks hes been bleeding the country dry for ten years and now theyre closing in on him what am i supposed to do cry burgess glared at banks through squinting eyes still the bloody pinko huh still the limpwristed kneejerking liberal he sighed somehow banks i hadnt expected you to change thats partly why im here anyway whatever you or i might think about it the powers that be decided it was a good idea to have a stable government in that part of the world someone we could trust of course it doesnt seem quite so important now with the russkies swapping their rusty old atomic warheads for turnips but other threats exist anyway britain france canada the states and a few others pumped millions into st corona over the years so you can estimate how important it is to us banks listened intently there could be no rushing burgess he would get where he was going in his own sweet time churchills finished burgess went on with a sweeping hand gesture its just a matter of time weeks months he knows it we know it the only thing now is for him to get out alive with his family while he still can and take up life in exile and he wants to come here burgess looked around at the chess players and the headrow well i dont think hes got the north of england in mind specifically but youre on the right track maybe a nice little retirement villa in devon or cornwall the english riviera somewhere where the weathers nice cultivate his herbaceous borders live out his days in the contemplation of nature prepare himself for the life hereafter make his peace with the almighty that kind of thing somewhere he wont do any more harm burgess lit another little cigar and spat out a flake of loose tobacco the yanks have said no but then theyve got a good record of turning their backs on their mates the french are dithering and jabbering and waving their arms about as usual theyd probably sneak him in the back door like the good little hypocrites they are if they had any real incentive left and the canadians well theyre just too fucking moral for their own good the bottom line banks is that theres a lot of pressure on our government to take him in as quietly as possible of course sneak him in the back door you mean like the hypocritical french if you like his human rights record is appalling banks said the infant mortality rate in st corona is over fifteen percent for a start life expectancy isnt much more than fifty for a man and sixty for a woman oh dear dear youve been reading the guardian again havent you banks and other papers the storys the same well you should know better than to believe all you read in the papers shouldnt you burgess looked around conspiratorially and lowered his voice nobody seemed in the least bit interested in them laughter and fragments of conversation filled the air have you ever wondered he said why women always seem to have a higher life expectancy rate than men dont they have as many bad habits as we do maybe they just dont work as hard dont suffer as much stress maybe its all that slimming and aerobics eh maybe theres something in it anyway back to mr churchills predicament and this is classified by the way there are some people in power who want him here who feel we owe him and there are some who dont who feel hes a lowlife scumbag and deserves to die as slowly and painfully as possible as usual burgess liked to show off his american slang he went to the states often on courses oh come off it said banks if they want him here its not out of any sense of duty its because hes got something they want or because hes got something on them burgess scratched his cheek cynic he said but youre partly right hes not a nice man as far as i can gather hes a glutton a boor a murderer and a rapist sodomy preferred but thats not the issue at all the problem is that we educated him made him what he is eton and cambridge he read law there did you know that he went through school and university with a lot of important people banks cabinet ministers bankers power brokers backroom boys you know how people can behave indiscreetly when theyre young do things they wouldnt want to come back and haunt them when theyre in the public eye and were talking about people who have the power to loosen the government purse strings now and then whenever st corona asks for more aid and rumor has it that hes also got quite a nice little savings account that wont do our economy any harm at all let me guess said banks laundered money burgess raised his eyebrows well of course which brings me to the murder of keith rothwell you are senior field investigator i understand yes thats why i thought id better deal with you in person i know you banks youre still a pinko liberal as youve proved time and time again in fact as soon as they told me you were on the case i thought oh fuck were in trouble youve no respect for the venerable institutions of government or for the necessity of secrecy in some of their workings youve got no respect for tradition and you dont give a toss about preserving the natural order of things you probably dont even stand up for god save the queen in short youre a bloody bolshie troublemaker and a menace to national security banks smiled thanks for the compliment he said but i wouldnt go quite that far burgess grinned maybe i exaggerate but you get my point loud and clear good thats why im going to tell you something very very important and very very secret and im going to trust you with it weve been keeping an eye on the st corona situation and anything that could possibly have to do with martin churchill gets flagged now we just got a report from your fraud squad late yesterday evening that they found something on keith rothwells computer that indicates he may have been laundering money for martin churchill lots of trips to the channel islands and the caribbean some very dodgy bank accounts some very dodgy banks too for that matter anyway theres a pattern and a time period that matches exactly the sort of thing weve been looking for weve known this was going on for some time but until now we hadnt a clue who was doing it theres no proof it was rothwell yet the fraud squad still has a lot of work to do chasing down transactions and what have you but if im right then were talking about a lot of money something in the region of thirty or forty million pounds over three or four years mostly money that was originally provided as aid by leading western nations its the same kind of thing baby doc did in haiti and you think this might have something to do with rothwells murder burgess shook his head i dont really know but the odds are that theres some kind of connection dont you think especially considering the way he was killed i mean it was hardly a domestic was it possibly banks agreed do you have any leads on the killers no more than you im only suggesting that churchill might be behind them and if he is watch your back banks thought about that for a moment he wasnt sure who constituted the greatest threat to his exposed back churchill or burgess i must say this is pretty quick work on your part he said burgess shrugged like i said orders to flag when i called your station superintendent gristhorpe told me where you were i missed you at the solicitors office but the secretary told me you were coming here whats daniel cleggs connection with all this we dont know yet we dont even know if there is one i only just found out about his disappearance its early days yet two other men have been looking for him too one black one white are they your lot burgess frowned no theyre nothing to do with me know anything about them no he was lying banks was certain so why are you here he asked what do you want me to do nothing just carry on as normal i simply wanted to warn you to tread very carefully thats all that things might be more complicated than they appear on the surface and to let you know theres help available if you want it of course naturally if you get close to uncovering the killers identities id be interested in talking to them why because im interested in everything to do with martin churchill as i told you burgess looked at his watch good lord is that the time already he said then knocked back the rest of his pint winked and stood up got to be off now be seeing you and he strutted off over the square toward park row banks lit a cigarette and brooded over the meeting as he finished his pint wondering what the hell the bastard was up to he didnt trust burgess as far as he could throw him and he was convinced that all that stuff about offering help and giving a friendly warning was rubbish burgess was up to something at a guess he wanted to be one of the first to get to the killers so he could find a way of hushing them up the last thing he would want was a big story about churchill hiring assassins to murder a yorkshire accountant splashed all over the press churchill might well be up to much worse things on st corona but this was england after all still no matter what burgess suspected and whether or not martin churchill was behind it all banks still had two killers to find locals by the sound of them and he wasnt going to do that by sitting around in stumps fretting about dirty dick burgess banks didnt expect to find anything new in calverts headingley flat but for some reason he felt the need to revisit the place after he had picked up the khachaturian compact disc west yorkshire police had talked to the other tenants who all said they knew nothing about mr calvert or keith rothwell they never really saw much of him he was out a lot and yes now you mention it there was a resemblance but it was only a newspaper photo and mr calvert didnt look quite the same besides calvert wasnt an eastvale accountant was he he lived in leeds couldnt argue with that banks headed upstairs the only immediate difference he noticed was the thin layer of fingerprint powder on surfaces of metal or glass around the gas fireplace on the glasstopped coffeetable and the tv set this time banks examined the books more closely there werent many and most of them were the usual bestseller list paperbacks tom clancy clive cussler ken follett robert ludlum there was also some espionage fiction len deighton john le carré adam hall ian fleming plus a couple of agatha christies and an oddly outofplace copy of middlemarch which looked unread hardly surprising banks thought having given up on even the television adaptation the only other books were palgraves golden treasury the first part of william manchesters churchill biography and a concise oxford dictionary the small compact disc collection concentrated entirely on jazz mostly kenny ball acker bilk and a few collections of bigband music banks noticed some decent stuff louis bix johnny dodds bud powell on the whole though judging from the monet print over the fireplace the palgrave and the music robert calvert had agreed with philip larkin about the evils of parker pound and picasso in the bedroom all the papers had been removed from the desk as had the wallet with the calvert identification and credit card the fraud squad would be working already on calverts financial profile now they knew that he and rothwell were one and the same the magazines and coins were still there the bed still unmade why had rothwell needed calvert banks wondered simple escapism according to what everyone said he was a different person altogether at arkbeck farm and in the wider community of swainsdale most people there spoke of him as a rather dull chap maybe a bit henpecked then there was robert calvert the dancing gambling laughing funloving lothario and dreamer the man who had attracted and bedded the beautiful pamela jeffreys the man who squeezed his toothpaste tube in the middle so which was the real keith rothwell both or neither in a sense banks guessed he needed both worlds did that make him a jekyll and hyde figure did it mean he was mad banks didnt think so he remembered susans account of her interview with laurence pratt in which pratt had indicated that rothwell had changed over the years cut himself off penned himself in perhaps he had once been the kind of person who liked gambling dancing and drinking then he had been pushed into marriage with the bosss daughter and marriage had changed him it happened often enough people settled down but for some reason rothwell had felt the need for an outlet one that would not interfere with his family life or with his local image as a respectable decent citizen banks could think of one good reason why it was important for rothwell to maintain this fiction rothwell was a crook he certainly didnt want to draw attention to himself by high living as calvert he could relive his youth as much as he wished and enjoy the proceeds of his moneylaundering perfect did mary rothwell know about her husbands other life she had probably suspected something was wrong time and time again over the last few years but denied and repressed the suspicions in order to maintain the illusion of happy affluent family values in the community she probably needed to believe in the lies as much as her husband needed to live them but you can only maintain an illusion for so long banks thought then cracks appear and the truth seeps in you can ignore that for a long time too but ultimately the wound begins to fester and infect everything thats when the bad things start to happen did alison know or tom it would be interesting to meet the lad he looked through the wardrobe and dresser drawers again most of calverts clothes were still there though the condoms had gone genuine scientific testing banks wondered or a sceneofcrime officer with a hot date and no time to get to the chemists he looked under chairs under the bed on top of the wardrobe in the cistern and in all the usual hiding places before he realized that vic manson and his lads had probably already done most of that even though the flat wasnt a crime scene per se and that he didnt know what he was looking for anyway he paused by the front window which looked out onto a treelined sidestreet off otley road fool he told himself he had been looking for keith rothwell in robert calverts flat but he wasnt there he wasnt anywhere he was just a slab of chilled meat waiting for a man with his collar on the wrong way around to chant a few meaningless words that might just ease the livings fear of death until the next time it touched too close to home for comfort as he glanced out of the window he glimpsed two men in suits across the street looking up at him they were partially obscured by trees but he could see that one was black the other white he hurried down to the street when he got there nobody was about except a young man washing his car three houses down banks approached him and showed his identification the man wiped the sweat off his brow and looked up at banks shielding his eyes from the glare sunlight winked on the bubbles in his bucket of soapy water did you see a couple of blokes in business suits pass by a few minutes ago banks asked yeah said the man yeah i did i thought it was a bit odd the way they stopped and looked up at that house to be honest though the way they were dressed i thought they were probably coppers banks thanked him and went back to the car so he wasnt getting paranoid how did the saying go just because you think theyre out there following you it doesnt mean they arent chapter tom rothwell resembled his father more than his mother banks thought sitting opposite him in the splitlevel living room at arkbeck farm the following morning though his hair was darker and longer he had the same thin oval face and slightly curved nose and the same gray eyes as banks had seen in the photograph his sulky mouth though owed more to early elvis presley and was no doubt more a result of artifice than nature his light brown hair fell charmingly over one eye and hung in natural waves over his ears and the collar of his blue denim shirt both knees of his jeans were torn and the unlaced white trainers on his feet were scuffed and dirty the best of the lot cathy grafton had said and it wasnt hard to guess why a rather plain girl like her would value a smile and a kind word from a handsome lad like tom but right from the start banks sensed something else about him an aura of affected arrogance as if he were condescending from a great intellectual and moral height to answer such stupid questions as those relating to his fathers murder it was rebellious youth in part and banks certainly understood that also tom seemed to exhibit that mix of vanity and overconfidence that banks had often encountered in the wealthy in addition there was a hell of a lot of the wariness and subterfuge that he usually associated with someone hiding a guilty secret toms body language said it all long legs stretched out crossed at the ankles arms folded high on his chest eyes anywhere but on the questioner susan gay sat in the background to take notes banks wondered what she thought about tom did you have any problems getting a flight banks asked no but i had to change at some dreary place in carolina and then again in new york i know you must be tired i remember from my trip to toronto the jet lags much worse flying home im all right i slept a little on the plane i can never seem to manage that tom said nothing banks wished that alison and mary rothwell werent flanking tom on the sofa and again the room felt dark and cold around him though it had windows they were set or angled in such a way that they didnt let in much natural light and they were all closed i imagine youre upset about your father too he said naturally we wanted to talk to you so soon banks said because we hoped you might be able to tell us something about your father something that might help lead us to his killers how would i know anything ive been out of the country since the end of march its possible banks said weighing his words carefully that the roots of the crime lie farther back than that thats ridiculous you lot have far too much imagination for your own good oh what do you think happened tom curled his lip and looked at the carpet it was clearly a robbery gone wrong or a kidnap attempt dad was quite well off you know banks scratched the scar beside his right eye kidnapping eh wed never thought of that can you explain well thats your job isnt it but its hardly difficult to see how it could have been a kidnap attempt gone wrong my father obviously wouldnt cooperate so they had to kill him why not just knock him out and take him away tom shrugged perhaps the gun went off by accident then why not take the body and pretend he was still alive till they got the money how would i know youre supposed to be the professionals i only said thats what it might have been i also suggested a bungled robbery look tom this is a pointless game were playing believe me weve covered all the possibilities and it wasnt a kidnap attempt or a bungled burglary i realize how difficult it is for the family to accept that a member may have been involved in something illegal but all the evidence points that way absurd spat mary rothwell keith was an honest businessman a good person and if you persist in spreading these vicious rumors well have to contact our solicitor mrs rothwell banks said im trying to talk to your son id appreciate it if you would keep quiet more than once he had thought about breaking the news that her husband led another existence as robert calvert but he held back in the first place it would be cruel and in the second gristhorpe said the chief constable wanted it kept from the press and family if possible at least until they developed a few more leads on the case mary rothwell glared at him lips pressed so tight they were white around the edges banks turned back to tom were you close to your father close enough he wasnt tom turned up his nose he wasnt a clinging emotional sort of person but you were on good terms yes of course then you might know something that could help us i still dont see how but if i can be of any use ask away did he ever mention a man called martin churchill churchill no do you know who he is that chap in the caribbean yes are you serious tom looked puzzled you are arent you the answers no of course he didnt why would he did you ever see your father with two welldressed men both about six feet tall one black one white tom frowned no look im sorry but i dont know what youre talking about did he ever talk to you about business no did you ever meet any of his business associates only if they came over to dinner and even then i wasnt generally invited tom looked at his mother i had to find something else to do for the evening which usually wasnt much trouble he glanced over at susan and banks sensed a softening in his expression as he did so he seemed interested in her presence curious about her the radio had been playing a request program quietly in the background and banks suddenly picked out the haunting chorus of delibess viens mallika dôme épais popularized as the rower duet by a television advert even trivialization couldnt mar its beauty and clarity after pausing for a moment he went on when did you leave for your holiday march he said the thirtyfirst but i dont see what about your job what job the one in the video shop in eastvale oh that i packed it in what kind of videos did they deal in all sorts why underthecounter stuff oh come off it chief inspector suddenly my fathers a crook and im a porn merchant you should be writing for television alison looked up from her book and giggled tom smiled at her obviously pleased with his insolence it was called monster videos that place in the arcade by the bus station ask them if you dont believe me why did you leave banks pressed on not that its any of your business but it was hardly a fast track to a career is that what you want im going to film school in the states i see i want to be a movie director was that what your father wanted i dont see that what he wanted has anything to do with it it was there the rancor banks thought time to push a little harder its just that i understood you had a falling out over your career choice i gather he wanted you to become an accountant or a lawyer but he thought you preferred to be an idle shiftless sod how dare you mary rothwell jumped to her feet its all right mother tom sneered sit down its all part of their game they only say things like that to needle you into saying something youll regret just ignore it he looked at susan again as if expecting her to defend banks but she said nothing he seemed disappointed mary rothwell sat down again slowly alison at the other side of tom glanced up from villette again for a couple of seconds raised the corners of her lips in what passed for a smile then went back to her book well said banks well what what is it that i might needle you into regretting you said clever it was just a figure of speech all right did you and your father have such an argument you must know as well as i do tom said that fathers and sons have their disagreements sure dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps but i had my own ideas hes not big on the arts isnt dad except when its good for business to get tickets for the opera or the theater or something to impress his clients where did you travel in america all over new york chicago los angeles san francisco miami tampa how did you get around plane and car rental where is this did you visit the caribbean st corona no i didnt how did you finance the trip what you heard me you were over there a month and a half and youd still be there now if it werent for your fathers death all that travelling costs money you cant have earned that much working in a video shop especially one that only deals in legal stuff how could you afford a lengthy trip to america tom shifted uncomfortably my parents helped me out banks noticed a confused look flit across mary rothwells face did you banks asked her why yes of course he could tell from the hesitation that she knew nothing about it do you mean your father helped you he asked tom he was the one with all the money wasnt he so your father financed your trip how what do you mean how did he finance it cash check he got me the ticket some travellers checks and a supplementary card on his american express gold account you can check the records if you havent done already banks whistled between his teeth american express gold eh not bad judging by the look on mary rothwells face it was news to her alison didnt seem to care she turned a page without looking up why would he do that banks asked im his son its the kind of thing parents do isnt it why not banks had never spent so much on brian and tracy but then he had never been able to afford it was he usually so generous he asked he was never mean banks paused when the silence had made tom restless he went on just before you went away you had an argument with your father in which he expressed great disappointment in you now i know why that is youve just told me you didnt want to follow the career he set out for you but you also expressed disappointment in him why did you do that i dont remember any argument come on tom you can do better than that tom looked at susan again and banks noticed a plea for help in his eyes he looked left and right for support too but found none his mother seemed lost in thought and alison was still deep in her charlotte brontë im telling you tom said i dont know what youre talking about why were you disappointed in your father tom tom reddened i wasnt i dont know what you mean did you find out something incriminating about his business dealings is that what you think youd better tell me tom it could help us a lot what was he up to tom seemed to relax nothing i dont know youre way off beam does the name aston or afton mean anything to you banks was sure he saw a flicker of recognition behind toms eyes recognition and fear no tom said never heard of him banks decided they would get nothing more out of this situation not with the whole family closing ranks it would be best to leave it for now no doubt when banks and susan left the rothwells would fall into an argument for mary rothwell wasnt looking at all pleased with the return of her prodigal son tom could stew over whatever it was that confused him plenty of time it was a gorgeous morning in the dale banks put a bill evans solo piano tape in the cassette player as he drove through fortford gold and green in the soft slanting light to their left the lush fields of the leas were full of buttercups and here and there the fishermen sat still as statues lines arcing down into the river swain what do you think he asked susan hes lying sir thats obvious enough but why what about i dont know everything i just got a strange feeling me too next time i think it might be a good idea if you talked to him alone maybe i can catch him after the funeral you were thinking of going damn half a mile before the road widened at the outskirts of eastvale a farmer was moving his sheep across from one pasture to another there was nothing to be done they simply had to stop until the sheep had gone stupid creatures banks said i think theyre rather cute in a silly way susan said anyway i thought i might go you never know the murderers might turn up to pay their respects like they do in books banks laughed do you know that actually happened to me once he said what it did honest down in london there was a feud between two families the kinghorns and the franklins none of them exactly intellectual giants been going on for years anyway old man franklin gets shot in broad daylight and theres half a dozen witnesses say they saw billy kinghorn the eldest son do it only trouble is billy does a bunk until the funeral that is then there he is young billy black tie armband and all face as long as a wet sunday come to pay his last respects what happened we nabbed him susan laughed the sheep kept wandering all over the road despite the ministrations of an inept collie which looked a bit too long in the tooth for such exacting work i thought there had to be a reason for going susan said anyway i quite like funerals my auntie mavis died when i was six and my mum and dad took me to the funeral it was very impressive the hymns the readings i couldnt understand a word of it at that age of course but it certainly sounded important anyway when we got outside i asked my mum where auntie mavis was and she sniffled a bit then said in heaven i asked her where that was and she pointed up at the sky it was a beautiful blue sky a bit like today and there was only one cloud in it a fluffy white one that looked like a teddy bear from then on i always thought when people died they became clouds in a perfect blue sky i dont know it made me feel happy somehow i mean i know funerals are solemn occasions but i dont seem to mind them so much after that the last sheep finally found the gate and scrambled through the farmer held up his hand in thanks as if banks had had any option but to wait and closed the gate behind him banks set off rather you than me he said i cant stand them anyway see if you can take young tom aside take him for a drink or something ive a feeling he really wants to tell us what he knows did you notice the way he kept looking at you yes think he fancies you no susan said after a pause for thought no somehow i dont think it was that at all banks crunched the last pickled onion of his plowmans lunch and swilled it down with a mouthful of theakstons bitter then he lit a cigarette he would have to resort to a polo mint if he found himself interviewing anyone in the afternoon superintendent gristhorpe sat opposite him in the queens arms cradling a halfpint it was the first time they had been able to get together since banks had met burgess so gristhorpe said according to burgess rothwell was laundering money for martin churchill looks that way said banks he said he couldnt be certain but i dont think hed come all the way up here if he wasnt do you knowing how little burgess thinks of the north no but i still dont think we should overlook the possibility of rothwells involvement in some other kind of organized crime most likely drugs prostitution or porn even if he were laundering money for churchill he could have been into something else dirty too we cant assume it was the churchill link that got him killed until we know a hell of a lot more i agree said banks better do as burgess says and watch your back though dont worry sir i will anyway gristhorpe went on ive just had a meeting with inspector macmillan and he tells me that daniel clegg acted as robert calverts reference for his bank account and his credit card in leeds the account has about twenty thousand in it interesting isnt it play money banks said aye i wouldnt mind that much to play with myself anyway according to inspector macmillan the bank employees didnt recognize rothwells picture as calvert because they hardly saw him he used a busy branch in the city center and the only person who did make the connection when macmillan pushed it said calvert looked and dressed so differently she wouldnt have known thank the lord for pamela jeffreys then aye or we might never have known what does his family have to say banks sighed and put the edge of his hand to his throat ive had it up to here with the bloody rothwells he said they give a whole new meaning to dysfunctional theres the victim laundering illegal money and leading a double life just for a hobby theres the daughter whod rather bury her face in a book than face reality now that the shock and the tiredness have worn off theres a son with more than a few guilty secrets hidden away and then watching over them all theres the queen bee who just wants to keep up the usual uppermiddleclass appearances and swears the sun shone out of her husbands arse what do you expect her to do alan her worlds fallen apart she must be having a hell of a job just holding things together have a bit more bloody compassion lad banks took a drag at his cigarette and blew the smoke out slowly youre right he said im sorry ive just had it with the bloody rothwells thats all what do they know its hard to tell i think the wife suspects something weird was going on but she doesnt know what and she doesnt want to know she denies it especially to herself could they have any involvement ive thought about it banks said and ive discussed it with susan in the final analysis i dont really think so mary rothwell might well hit out at anything that threatens her comfortable world and if she thought her husband were profiting from porn for example i cant see her just sitting still and accepting it he shook his head but not this way this brings her exactly the kind of attention she doesnt want i dont know how shed deal with him susan guessed poison maybe or an accident but it wouldnt be like this hmm try this for size said gristhorpe one lets assume that rothwell and clegg are in the moneylaundering business together for martin churchill or whoever banks nodded it makes sense clegg being a tax specialist and all and well leave robert calvert out of it as say just a personal aberration on rothwells part at least for the moment a red herring right okay something goes wrong rothwell finds out something that makes him want to get out of it so he writes to clegg ending their association and said banks churchill or whoever it is theyre working for doesnt like this at all makes sense doesnt it so far keep going rothwell gets scared either hes been cheating on his masters and theyve found out or theyre afraid hes getting nervous and is going to blow the whistle so what do they do take out a contract right and thats the end of rothwell gristhorpe paused as a couple of officeworkers on a lunch break brushed past them and sat down at the next table cyrils cash register rang up another sale he could have been cheating on them to finance his life as calvert said banks i know we were going to leave him out of the equation but it fits he had twenty grand in the bank you say and he liked to gamble according to pamela jeffreys true but lets stick to the simple line whats important is that rothwell has become a liability or a threat and his masters want him dead theyve got enough money to be able to pay for the privilege without getting their own hands dirty which brings us to mr daniel clegg the killers had a fair bit of information about rothwell they seemed to know that he and his wife would be out celebrating their wedding anniversary for example clegg could probably have told them that they knew rothwell had a daughter too and that she would be at home she wasnt part of the deal remember and they knew where he lived the layout everything clegg gristhorpe nodded lets put it this way if rothwell were laundering money for someone thered be little if any contact between him and his masters wouldnt there that would seem to be one point of a laundering operation banks agreed certainly tom rothwell seemed genuinely puzzled when i brought up martin churchill right and clegg was the only other person we suspect was involved and he had information about rothwells personal life so you reckon clegg was behind it its a theory isnt it they werent exactly friends alan not according to what youve told me they were business colleagues different thing it was a matter of you scratch my back ill scratch yours strange bedfellows maybe and crooked too its an odd thing is a professional gone bad they talk about bent coppers but what about bent lawyers bent accountants bent doctors if push came to shove would you expect one crooked businessman to stick up for another so you think clegg was not just involved in the laundering business but in rothwells murder too aye he could be our link and his disappearance scarpered he knew what was coming knew when maybe they paid him well it doesnt matter whether he was scared of us or them the result was the same he took his money and ran collected two hundred pounds when he passed go didnt go to jail then his bosses couldnt get in touch with him so they sent their two goons to find him the timings right what about this scenario banks offered maybe churchill had clegg killed too with rothwell gone clegg might just be a nuisance who knew too much a loose cannon on the deck if churchill is planning on coming here maybe he wanted a clean break gristhorpe took a sip of his beer possible ill grant you you know its just struck me said banks but do we know if clegg ever practiced criminal law seems to be the only kind he practiced replied gristhorpe then held up his hand and grinned as banks groaned all right all right alan i promise no more bad lawyer jokes as far as we know he didnt hes a solicitor not a barrister so he didnt represent clients in court but people might have come to him and he could have referred them why i was just wondering where a man like clegg might meet a killer for hire local conservative club probably said gristhorpe but i see what you mean its a loose end weve got to pursue if we assume clegg was involved in arranging for rothwells murder then we can look through his contacts and his activities to find a link with a couple of likely assassins weve got that and the wadding not very much is it no said banks what if cleggs dead nothing changes west yorkshire police keep looking for a body and we keep nosing around asking questions we could get in touch with interpol see if hes holed up somewhere in spain he looked at his watch look alan id better get finished and be off ive got another meeting with the chief constable this afternoon okay ill be over in a minute gristhorpe nodded and left but no sooner had banks started to let his imagination work on clegg meeting two hired guns in a smoky saloon than the superintendent poked his head around the door again they think theyve found the killers car he said abandoned near leeds city center ken blackstone asks if you want to go and have a look banks nodded all roads lead to leeds he sighed i might as well bloody move there and he followed gristhorpe out chapter a tape of saties piano music especially the trois gymnopédies kept banks calm on his way to leeds even though the a was busy with juggernauts and commercial travellers driving too fast he found the car park without too much difficulty it was an old school playground surrounded by the rubble of demolished buildings just north of the city center cheers alan said detective inspector ken blackstone you look like a bloody villain with those sunglasses on hows it going cant complain banks shook his hand and took off the dark glasses he had met blackstone at a number of courses and functions and the two of them had always got along well enough and hows west yorkshire cid overworked as usual bit of a bugger isnt it said blackstone the weather i mean banks scratched the scar beside his right eye sometimes when it itched it was trying to tell him something other times like this it was just the heat i remember an american once told me that all we english do is complain about the weather he said its either too hot or too cold for us too wet or too dry blackstone laughed true still the station could do with a few of those airconditioner thingies the yanks use its hotter indoors than out sends the crime figures up you know a heat wave natives get restless a light breeze had sprung up from the west but it did nothing to quell the warmth of the sun banks took off his sports jacket and slung it over his shoulder as they walked across the soft tarmac to the abandoned car his tie hung askew as usual and his top shirt button was open so he could breathe easily he could feel the sweat sticking his white cotton shirt to his back this weather was following a pattern he recognized it would get hotter and hazier until it ended in a storm what have you got he asked youll see in a minute despite the weather ken blackstone looked cool as usual he wore a lightweight navyblue suit with a gray herringbone pattern a crisp white shirt with a stiff collar and a garish silk tie secured by a gold tieclip in the shape of a pair of handcuffs banks was willing to bet that his top button was fastened blackstone was tall and slim with light brown hair thin on top but curly over the ears and a pale complexion definitely not the sunworshipping kind his cupids bow lips and wirerimmed glasses made him look about thirty when he was in fact closer to bankss age he had a long dour sort of face and spoke with a local accent tempered by three years at bath university where he had studied art history blackstone had in fact become something of an expert on art fraud after his degree and he often found himself called in to help out when something of that nature happened in addition he was a fair landscape artist himself and his work had been exhibited several times banks remembered blackstone and sandra getting into a long conversation about the preraphaelites at a colleagues wedding once and remembered the stirrings of jealousy he had felt though he was eager to learn read look and listen as much as his time allowed banks was always aware of his workingclass background and his lack of a true formal education they arrived at a car guarded by two hotlooking uniformed constables and banks stood back to survey it ancient but not old enough to attract attention as an antique the light blue ford escort was rusted around the bottom of the chassis and had spiderleg cracks on the passenger side of the windscreen it matched the description as far as that went how longs it been here banks asked dont know said blackstone our lads didnt notice it until last night when they ran the number they found it was stolen banks knelt by the front tire flat there was plenty of soil and gravel lodged in the grooves they could have it analyzed and at least discover if it came from around arkbeck farm he looked through the grimy window the beige upholstery was dirty cracked and split a mcdonalds coffee cup lay crushed on the floor at the drivers side but apart from that he could see nothing else inside weve looked in the boot said blackstone nothing not even a jack or a spare tire ive arranged for it to be taken to our police garage for a thorough forensic examination but i thought youd like a look at it in situ first thanks said banks i dont expect well get any prints if they were pros but you never know whos the lucky owner bloke called ronald hamilton when did he report it missing blackstone paused before answering friday morning said he left it in the street as usual after he got in about five or six in the evening and it was gone when he went out at ten the next morning thought it was maybe kids joyriding theres been a lot of it on the estate lately its not the safest place in the city he lives on the raynville estate in bramley ring any bells banks shook his head pamela jeffreys lived in armley which wasnt far away and daniel clegg lived in chapel allerton a fair distance in both miles and manners most likely the killers had picked it at random a good distance from where they lived thats four days ago ken said banks and nobody spotted it before last night again blackstone hesitated hamilton s an unemployed laborer he said finally hes got at least one wife and three kids that we know of and lately hes been having a few problems with the social hes also got a record dealing aggravated assault you thought hed arranged to have it nicked for the insurance blackstone smiled something like that i wasnt involved personally i dont know what you lot do but here in the big city we dont send detective inspectors out on routine traffic incidents banks ignored the sarcasm it was just blackstones manner so your lads didnt exactly put a rush on it thats right blackstone glanced toward the horizon and sighed any idea alan how many car crimes weve got in the city now you yokels wouldnt believe it so when some scurvy knave comes on with a story about a beatup old escort you think hed have to pay somebody to steal that piece of shit so let the fucking insurance company pay they can afford it in the meantime weve got joyriding kids real villains and organized gangs of car thieves to deal with im not making excuses alan yeah i know banks leaned against a red orion the metal burned through his shirt so he stood up straight again didnt you once tell me you came up from the met for a peaceful time in rural yorkshire blackstone asked banks smiled i did getting it i can only suppose its got proportionately worse down there blackstone laughed indeed business is booming have you talked to hamilton yes this morning he knows nothing believe me hes so scared of the police hed sell his own mother down the tubes if he thought we were after her blackstone made an expression of distaste you know the type alan belligerent one minute yelling that youre picking on him because hes black then arselicking the next makes you want to puke wheres he from jamaica hes legit we checked been here ten years whats his story saw nothing heard nothing knows nothing to tell you the truth i got the impression hed driven back from the pub after a skinful then settled in front of the telly with a few cans of lager while his wife fed the kiddies and put them to bed after that he probably passed out whole bloody place smelled of shitty nappies and rollups and worse we could probably do him for possession if it was worth our while at ten the next morning he staggers out to go and sign on finds his car missing and bobs your uncle does the outraged citizen routine on the local bobby whos got more sense thank the lord blackstone stood slightly hunched with his hands in his pockets and kicked at small stones on the tarmac you could see your face in his shoes do me a favor ken and have another go at him you said he was done for dealing uhhuh small stuff mostly cannabis a little coke its probably just a coincidence that the car used belongs to a drug dealer but pull his record and have another go at him all the same find out who his suppliers are and see if he has any connections with st corona friends family whatever there might be a drug connection or a caribbean connection in rothwells murder and its a remote possibility that mr hamilton might have done some work for the organization behind it whoever they are you mean he might have loaned his car its possible i doubt it i think were dealing with cleverer crooks than that but wed look like the rear end of a pantomime horse if we didnt check it out will do have you questioned the neighbors were doing a housetohouse nothing so far nobody sees anything on these estates so thats that looks like it for the moment anyway no carpark attendant no blackstone pointed to the rubble as you can see its just an old schoolyard with weeds growing through the tarmac the school was knocked down months ago banks looked around to the southwest he could see the large dome of the town hall and the builtup city center to the west stood the high white obelisk of the universitys brotherton library and the rest of the horizon seemed circled with blocks of flats and crooked terraces of backtobacks poking through the surrounding rubble like charred vertebrae i could use a break on this ken banks said aye well give it our best hey up the lads have come to pick up the car banks watched the police towteam tie a line to the escort id better be off he said youll let me know just a minute said blackstone what are your plans im checking into the holiday inn for tonight at least theres a couple of people i want to talk to again in connection with clegg and rothwell cleggs secretary and his exwife for a start id like to get a clearer idea of their relationship now weve got a bit more to go on holiday inn well ladidah isnt that a bit posh for a humble copper banks laughed i could do with a bit of luxury maybe theyll give me the sack when they see my expenses these days we cant even afford to do half the forensic tests we need tell me about it anyway if youre going to be sticking around id appreciate it if we could have a chat there seems to be a lot going on here i dont know about theres a lot i dont know about too still id appreciate it if you would fill me in no problem blackstone hesitated and shifted from foot to foot look he said id like to invite you over for a bit of homecooking but connie left a couple of months ago im sorry to hear that said banks i didnt know yeah well it happens right comes with the territory still taking care of that lovely wife of yours you wouldnt think so by the amount of time weve spent together lately i know what you mean that was one of the problems she said we were living such separate lives we might as well make it official anyway im not much of a cook myself besides connie got the house and im in a rather small bachelor flat for the moment but theres a decent indian restaurant on eastgate near the station if you fancy it its called the shabab about half past six seven oclock we might have something on hamilton and the car by then too all right said banks youre on make it seven oclock and alan said blackstone as banks walked away you watch yourself hotels give married men strange ideas sometimes i suppose its the anonymity and the distance from home if you know what i mean anyway theres some seem to act as if the normal vows of marriage dont apply in hotels banks knew what blackstone meant and he felt guilty as an image of pamela jeffreys flashed unbidden through his mind susan gay heard sergeant hatchley burp before she had even opened the office door after more fruitless interviews with rothwells legitimate clients she felt apprehension churn in her stomach like a badly digested meal she could not work with hatchley she just couldnt hatchley sat at his desk smoking the small stifling room stank of stale beer and pickled onions the warped window was open about as far as it would go but that didnt help much if this oppressive weather didnt end soon susan felt she would scream and by god hes repulsive she thought there was his sheer bulk for a start a rugby prop forward gone to fat then there was his face brickred complexion white eyelashes and piggy eyes straw hair thinning a bit at the top a smattering of freckles over a broadbridged nose fleshy lips tobaccostained teeth to cap it all he wore a shiny wrinkled blue suit and his red neck bulged over his tight shirt collar from the corner of her eye susan noticed the colored picture on the corkboard long blonde hair exposed skin without even stopping to think she walked over and pulled it down so hard the drawingpin shot right across the room oy said hatchley what the hell do you think youre playing at im not playing at anything susan said waving the picture at him with all respect sir i dont care if you are my senior officer i wont bloody well have it a hint of a smile came to hatchleys eyes calm down lass he said youve got steam coming out of your ears maybe youre being a bit hasty no im not its offensive i dont see why i should have to work with this kind of thing stuck to the walls you might think its funny but i dont sir susan look at it no why susan slowly susan turned the picture over and looked at it there in all her maternal innocence carol hatchley with her long blonde hair hanging over her shoulders held her naked newborn baby to her breast which was covered well beyond the point of modesty by a fleshtone tshirt susan felt herself blush all she had seen were the womans face hair and a lot of skin color i i thought she could think of nothing else to say i know what you thought said hatchley you thought my daughters head was a tit you could apologize susan felt such a fool she couldnt even bring herself to do that all right hatchley said putting his feet up on the desk then you can listen to me now nobodys ever going to convince me that looking at a nice pair of knockers is wrong since time immemorial since our ancestors scratched images on cave walls men have enjoyed looking at womens tits theyre beautiful things nothing dirty or pornographic about them at all but theyre private susan blurted out dont you understand theyre a womans private parts you dont see pictures of mens privates all over the place do you you wouldnt like people staring at yours would you susan love if i thought it would make you happy id drop my trousers right now but thats not the point what im saying is its my opinion that theres nowt wrong in admiring a nice pair of bristols a lot of people agree with me too but you dont like it he held up his large hand all right now i might not be the most sensitive bloke in christendom and i certainly reserve my right to disagree with you but im not that much of a monster that id use my rank to expose you to something you feel offends you day in day out however wrongheaded i think you are i respect your opinion i dont agree with you and i never will but i respect it i can live without and another thing i know youre a bugger about smoking ill try and cut down on the cigarettes in the office too but dont expect miracles and dont expect its going to be all bloody give and no take on my part you dont like my smoke i dont like your perfume it makes my nose itch and its probably rotting my lungs as we speak but for better or for worse lass weve got to work together and weve got to do it in the same damn little cubbyhole for the time being mebbe one day well have separate offices myself i can hardly wait but for now lets just keep the window open and make a bit of an effort to get along all right susan nodded she felt all the wind go out of her sails she swallowed all right sorry sir hatchley swung his legs to the floor and rubbed his hands together well say no more then now about that wadding yes sir hatchley burped again and put his hamlike hand to his mouth shaved pussies smooth and shiny as a babys bottom yes sir susan felt herself blush again and hated herself for it hatchley smiled at her he seemed to be enjoying himself her spirits sank she had thought for a moment that he might be getting serious about the case but here he was simply creating another opportunity to embarrass her aye now i know thats not a lot to go on but at least we know its not kiddie porn or the bum brigade and weve got penetration and a clear image of a penis in an excited state as it says in the book so this is definitely underthecounter stuff true sir and as far as i can tell he went on theres no sign of dogs or cats either sir can you get to the point susan couldnt keep the impatience out of her voice hold your horses lass he started to laugh get that no animals hold your horses never mind the point is shaved pussies arent exactly ten a penny though if wed come up with something really kinky it would have made my job a lot easier i mean there arent many people sell photos of rottweilers bonking thirteenyearold girls that we dont know about i still dont see what youre getting at sir said susan a little calmer she should have known that if anyone was hatchley would be an expert on pornography surely most of that stuff is sent through the mail from abroad or from london not all of it theres a fair chance it was bought under the counter somewhere when i did my stint on vice with west yorkshire a few years back i made one or two useful contacts now if were assuming these lads were at all local the odds are theyre from the city as there arent that many killersforhire living in rural areas too exposed that means leeds bradford manchester maybe newcastle or liverpool at a stretch now if the boss thinks this clegg chap from leeds was involved then leeds is as good a choice as any agreed susan nodded yes the daughter alison thought the man had a leeds accent she could be wrong about that of course not everyones accurate on voices i dont reckon i could tell the difference but it looks like theyve found the car used for the job there anyway as ive already told you west yorkshire s got some men asking around have had for days well you know how i hate sitting idle hatchley said guess where ive been this lunchtime the queens arms sir hatchley smiled not far off well make a detective of you yet lass ive been having drinks with an old informer of mine in the oak thats what he touched the side of his nose lives in eastvale now but he used to live in leeds gone straight see i thought i probably remembered a few purveyors of this kind of porn if theyre still around that is and its odds on that some wetbehindtheears young pansy dc fresh from university doesnt even know they exist there arent as many as you think you know at least not selling shaved pussy porn it is something of a specialist taste anyway theres still plenty prefer the friendly old corner shop to the impersonal supermarket if you get my drift im not talking about sex shops i imagine theyve all been checked already just regular newsagents that sell a bit of imported stuff from under the counter along with their womans weeklys and gardening magazines harmless enough hardly any reason for our lads to be interested really so i asked my old friend and yes theyre still in business still selling the same kind of stuff to the same old customers some of them anyway a couple have retired some have moved on and ones dead heart attack not business related the point is i knew these blokes were a bit bent but i left them alone in exchange theyd pass on the odd tip if anyone came hawking really serious stuff like kiddie porn or snuff films live and let live now what i propose is that you and me go to leeds and ask a few questions of our own he looked at his watch tomorrow of course dont worry ill arrange permission from the super and from west yorkshire cid are you game susan was aware of her jaw dropping he made sense all right and that was the problem she was about to go on a porn hunt with sergeant hatchley she could feel it in her bones but it could pay off if it led to the owner of the wadding that would be feathers in both their caps she swallowed its a hell of a long shot she said hatchley shrugged nothing ventured nothing gained what do you say susan thought for a moment all right she said but youve got to convince superintendent gristhorpe right lass hatchley beamed rubbing his hands together youre on oh my god thought susan with that sinking feeling a porn hunt what have i let myself in for by the looks of it the heat had drawn one or two refugees from the magistrates court over to the park square two skinheads stripped to the waist dozed on the grass under a tree one lying on his back had tattoos up and down his arms and scars crisscrossing his abdomen old knife wounds by the look of them the other on his stomach boasted a giant butterfly tattoo between his shoulderblades in cleggs offices betty moorhead was still holding the fort and fighting off her cold oh mr banks she said when he entered the anteroom its nice to see a friendly face theres been nothing but police coming and going since you were last here and nobody will tell me anything had she forgotten he was a policeman too he wondered or was it just that he had been the first to arrive and she had somehow latched onto him as a lifeline some men in suits took most of his papers she went on and theres been others asking questions all day theyve got someone keeping an eye on the building as well in case those two men come back then there was that man from scotland yard i dont know whats what they all had identification cards of course but i dont know whether im coming or going banks smiled dont worry betty he said i know it sounds complicated but were all working together she nodded and pulled a tissue from the box in front of her and blew her nose it looked red raw from rubbing is there any news of mr clegg she asked nothing yet were still looking did you talk to melissa yes how is she banks didnt really know what to say he wasnt used to giving out information just digging it up but betty moorhead was obviously concerned she didnt seem unduly worried he said shes sure hell turn up bettys expression brightened well then she said there you are do you mind if i ask a few more questions oh no id be happy to be of help good banks perched at the edge of her desk and looked around the room sitting here he said youd see everyone who called on mr clegg wouldnt you everyone who came in and out of his office yes and if people phoned youd speak to them first well yes but i did tell you mr clegg has a private line did he receive many calls on it i cant say really i heard it ring once in a while but i was usually too busy to pay attention im certain he didnt give the number out to just anyone so you didnt unintentionally overhear any of the conversations i know what youre getting at she said and you can stop right there im not that sort of a secretary what sort the sort that listens in on her bosss conversations besides she added with a smile the walls are too thick these are old houses solidly built you cant hear whats being said in mr cleggs office with the door shut even if two people are having a conversation in there even then or arguing not that it happened often but you can only hear the raised voices not what theyre saying did you ever hear mr clegg arguing with mr rothwell i dont remember i dont think so i mean if they ever did it would certainly have been a rarity normally they were all cordial and businesslike mr clegg specializes in tax law doesnt he yes how many clients does he have thats very hard to say i mean there are regular clients and then people you just do a bit of work for now and then roughly fifty a hundred closer to a hundred id say any new ones hes been too busy to take on much new work this year so theres been no new clients in say the past three months not really no hes done a bit of extra work for friends of friends here and there but nothing major what im getting at banks said leaning forward is whether theres been anyone new visiting him often or phoning in the past two or three months not visiting no theres been a few funny phone calls though what do you mean funny well abrupt i mean i know i told you people are sometimes rude and brusque but usually they at least tell you what they want since you were here last ive been thinking trying to remember you know if there was anything odd my heads so stuffed up i can hardly think straight but i remembered the phone calls i told the other policeman too thats okay tell me what did this brusque caller say i dont know if it was the same person each time and it only happened two or three times it was about a month ago over what time period what oh just a couple of days what did he say i assume it was a he yes hed just say clegg and if i said mr clegg was out or busy hed hang up i see what you mean what kind of voice did he have i couldnt say thats all i ever heard him say it just sounded ordinary but clipped impatient in a hurry and this happened two or three times over a couple of days yes you never heard the voice again i never had that sort of call again if thats what you mean nobody visited the office who sounded like the man she sneezed then blew her nose no but i told you i dont think i would recognize it it wasnt anything like one of the men who came around asking questions i dont know i dont think so im sorry thats all right whats going on we dont know banks lied he was testing gristhorpes theory about cleggs involvement in rothwells murder but he didnt want betty moorhead to realize he suspected her boss of such a crime certainly the odd phone calls could have been from someone giving him orders or from the people he hired to do the job the timing was about right do you think mr clegg might have given this caller his private number she nodded thats what must have happened the first two times mr clegg was out or with a client the third time i put the caller through and he never called me again and youre sure you never put a face to the voice no banks stood up and walked around the small room welltended potted plants stood on the shelf by the small window at the back that looked out onto narrow park cross street clegg had obviously been careful where betty moorhead was concerned if he had been mixed up with hired killers and caribbean dictators he had been careful to keep them at arms length he turned back to betty is there anything else you can tell me about mr clegg i dont know what you mean how would you describe him as a person well i wouldnt know you never socialized she blushed certainly not had he been depressed lately no did mr clegg have many women calling on him not as far as i know what are you suggesting did you ever see or hear mention of a woman called pamela jeffreys an asian woman she looked puzzled no she wasnt a client did he have a girlfriend i wouldnt know he kept his private life private banks decided to give up melissa clegg might know a bit more about her husbands conquests or ken blackstones men would question his colleagues and perhaps come up with something it was after five and he was tired of running around in circles betty moorhead clearly didnt know anything else or if she did she didnt realize its importance getting at information like that was like target practice in the dark why not just accept gristhorpes theory that clegg had arranged for rothwell to be killed and that they hadnt a hope in hell of finding either clegg or the killers and what could they do to martin churchill if indeed he was behind it all banks didnt like the feeling of impotence this case was beginning to engender on the walk back to his hotel banks picked up a halfbottle of bell s it would be cheaper than using the minibar in his room as he threaded his way among the office workers leaving the british telecom building for their busstops on wellington street banks wished he could just go home and forget about the whole cleggrothwellcalvert mess after leaving blackstone at the car park he had phoned pamela jeffreys at home halfhoping she might be free for a drink that evening but he had only got her answering machine she was probably playing with the orchestra or something he had left a message anyway telling her which hotel he was staying at and now he was feeling guilty he remembered blackstones warning about hotels on the surface he wanted to apologize for their misunderstanding yesterday but if truth be told he had let himself get a bit too carried away with his fantasies would he do anything if he had the chance if she agreed to come back to his hotel room for a nightcap would he try to seduce her would he make love to her if she were willing he didnt know he remembered his attraction to jenny fuller a professor of psychology who occasionally helped with cases and wondered what his life would be like now if he had given in to his desires then would he have told sandra would they still be together would he and jenny still be friends no answer came rather glumly he recalled the bit at the beginning of the trollope biography he was reading where trollope considers the dreary sermons persuading people to turn their backs on worldly pleasure in the hope of heaven to come and asks if such is really the case then why are women so lovely that set him thinking again about pamelas shapely golden body her bright personality and her passion for music well at least he had a curry with ken blackstone to look forward to and time for a shower and a rest before that he thought he might even check out the hotels health and leisure club maybe have a swim take a sauna or a whirlpool there were no messages banks went straight up to his room took off his shoes and flopped on the bed he phoned sandra who wasnt in then called the eastvale station again and spoke to susan gay nothing new except that she sounded depressed after a brisk shower much better than the tepid dribble at home he poured himself a small scotch and put the television on while he dried off and dressed he caught the end of the international news and heard that the st corona riots had been put down swiftly and brutally by martin churchills forces and burgess wanted to give the man a retirement villa in cornwall after that he was only half paying attention to the local news but at one point he saw a house he recognized and heard the reporter say when she failed to report for rehearsals today police are still at the scene and so far have refused to comment it was pamela jeffreyss house and outside it stood two patrol cars and an ambulance stunned banks sat on the side of the bed and tossed back his scotch then he got his jacket out of the cupboard and left the room so fast he forgot to turn off the television chapter it was hard to imagine that anything terrible could happen on such a fine spring evening but the activity around the little terrace house in armley indicated that evil made no allowances for the weather three police cars were parked at angles in front of the house beyond the line of white tape reporters badgered the pcs on guard duty one of whom jotted down bankss name and rank before he let him through neighbors stood on their doorsteps or by privet hedges and gazed in silence arms folded faces grim and the people working their allotments stopped to watch the spectacle a small crowd also stood gawping from the steps of the sikh temple down the street banks stood on the threshold of the living room whatever had happened here it had been extremely violent the glass coffee table had been smashed in two the threepiece suite had been slashed and the stuffing ripped out books lay torn all over the carpet pages reduced to confetti the glass front of the cocktail cabinet was shattered and the crystalware itself lay in bright shards the music stand lay on the floor with the splintered pieces and broken bow of pamelas viola beside it even the print of ganesh over the fireplace had been taken from its frame and torn up worst of all though was the broad dark stain on the cream carpet blood one of the officers cracked a racist joke about ganesh and another laughed the elephant god was supposed to be the god of good beginnings banks remembered upstairs someone was whistling laras theme from doctor zhivago who the hell are you banks turned to face the plainclothes man coming out of the wreckage of the kitchen press he went on before banks had time to answer youre not allowed in you ought to bloody well know that bugger off he grabbed bankss arm and steered him toward the door what does that fucking useless pc think hes up to letting you in ill have his bloody balls for christmas tree decorations hang on banks finally managed to get a word in and jerk his arm free of the mans grasp he showed his card the man relaxed oh sorry sir he said detective sergeant waltham i wasnt to know then he frowned whats north yorkshire want with this one if you dont mind my asking he was in his early thirties perhaps a few pounds overweight about three inches taller than banks with curly ginger hair he had a prominent chin a ruddy complexion and curious catlike green eyes he wore a dark brown suit white shirt and plain green tie behind him stood a scruffylooking youth in a leather jacket probably his dc banks guessed first things first said banks what happened to the woman who lives here pamela jeffreys know her what happened to her is she still alive oh aye sir just someone worked her over a treat broken ribs broken nose broken fingers multiple lacerations contusions in fact multiple just about everything and it looks as if she broke her leg when she fell she was in a coma when we found her first officer on the scene thought she was dead banks felt a wave of fear and anger surge through his stomach bringing the bile to his throat when did it happen he asked were not sure sir theres a clock upstairs was smashed at twenty past nine but that doesnt necessarily mean anything a bit too agatha christie if you ask me doc thinks last night but were still interviewing the neighbors so you think she lay there for nearly twentyfour hours could be sir the doctor said shed have bled to death if she hadnt been a good clotter banks swallowed raped waltham shook his head doc says no signs of sexual assault when we found her she was fully clothed no signs of interference some consolation eh who found her one of her musician friends got worried when she didnt show up for rehearsals this morning some sort of string quartet or something apparently shed been a bit upset lately he said she was usually reliable and had never missed a day before he phoned the house several times during the day and only got her answering machine after work he drove by and knocked still no answer then he had a butchers through the window after that he phoned the local police hes in the clear banks said nothing ds waltham leaned against the bannister the scruffy dc squeezed by them and went upstairs in the front room someone laughed out loud again waltham coughed behind his hand er look sir is there something we should know therell have to be questions of course but we can be as discreet as anyone if we have to be what with you showing up here and and what sergeant well i recognize your voice from her answering machine it was you wasnt it banks sighed yes yes it was but no theres nothing you need to be discreet about there is probably a lot you should know shit he looked at his watch almost seven look sergeant id clean forgot im supposed to be meeting di blackstone for dinner our di blackstone sir yes know him yes sir do you think you can get one of the pcs to page him or track him down its the shabab on eastgate waltham smiled i know it very popular with the lads at millgarth ill see to it sir he went to the door and spoke to one of the uniformed constables then came back hes on his way look sir pc obrien there just told me theres an old geezer across the street thinks he might have seen something want to come over yes very much banks followed him down the path and through the small crowd one or two reporters shouted for comments but waltham just waved them aside pc obrien stood by the low dark stone wall that ran by the allotments talking to a painfully thin old man wearing a grubby collarless shirt behind them other allotment workers stood in a semicircle watching some of them leaning on shovels or rakes very yorkshire gothic banks thought mr judd sir obrien said introducing waltham who in turn introduced banks he was working his allotment last night just before dark waltham nodded and obrien walked off keep those bloody reporters at bay will you please obrien waltham called after him banks sat on the wall and took out his cigarettes he offered them around waltham declined but mr judd accepted one might as well lad he croaked tapping his chest too late to worry about my health now he did look ill banks thought sallow flesh hung off the bones of his face above his scrawny neck with its turkeyflaps and puckered skin like a surgery scar around his adams apple the whites of his eyes had a yellow cast but the dark blue pupils glinted with intelligence mr judd banks decided was a man whose observations he could trust he sat by and let waltham do the questioning what time were you out here waltham asked from seven oclock till about half past nine said judd this time of year i always come out of an evening after tea for a bit of peace weather permitting the wife likes to watch telly but ive no patience with it myself nowt but daft buggers acting like daft buggers he took a deep draw on the cigarette banks noticed him flinch with pain were you the only one working here waltham asked aye tothers had all gone home by then can you tell us what you saw aye well it must have been close to knockingoff time it were getting dark i remember that and this car pulled up outside miss jeffreyss house dark and shiny it were black do you know what make no sorry lad i wouldnt know a mini from an aston martin these days to tell you the truth especially since weve been getting all these foreign cars it werent a big one though waltham smiled okay go on well two men gets out and walks up the path what did they look like hard to say really they were both wearing suits and one of them was a darkie but thats nowt to write home about these days is it one of the men was black aye what happened next judd went through a minor coughing fit and spat a ball of redgreen phlegm on the earth beside him i packed up and went home the wife needs a bit of help getting up the apples and pears to bed these days she cant walk as well as she used to did you see miss jeffreys open the door and let the men in i cant say i was watching that closely one minute they were on the doorstep next they were gone but the car was still there did you hear anything no too far away he shrugged i thought nothing of it insurance men most like thats what they looked like or maybe those religious folks jehovahs witnesses so you didnt see them leave no id gone home by then where do you live judd pointed across the street over there number fourteen it was five houses down from pamela jeffreyss been there forty years or more now a right dump it was when we first moved in damp walls no indoor toilets no bathroom had it done up over the years though bit by bit waltham paused and looked at banks who indicated he would like to ask one or two questions waltham banks noted had been a patient interviewer not pushy rude and condescending toward the old like some maybe it was because he had a dci watching over his shoulder and maybe that was being uncharitable did you know miss jeffreys at all banks asked judd shook his head cant say as i did but you knew her to say hello to oh aye she was a right nice lass if you ask me and a bonny one too he winked always said hello if she passed me in the street always carrying that violin case i used to ask her if she were in tmafia and had a machinegun in it just joking like but you never stopped and chatted not apart from that and the odd comment about the weather what would an old codger like me have to say to a young lass like her besides people round here tend to keep themselves to themselves these days he coughed and spat again it didnt used to be that way tha knows when eunice and i first came here there used to be a community wed have bloody great big bonfires out in the street on guy fawkes night it were still just cobbles then none of this tarmac and everyone came out eunice would make parkin and treacletoffee wed wrap taties in foil and put em in tfire to bake but its all changed people died moved away see that there sikh temple he pointed down the street it used to be a congregationalist chapel everyone went there on a sunday morning they had monday whist drives too and a youth club boys brigade and girl guides for the young uns pantos at christmas oh aye its all changed people coming and going weve got indoor toilets now but nobody talks to anyone not that ive owt against pakis like as i said she was a nice lass i saw them taking her out on that stretcher an hour or so back he shook his head slowly nowadays you keep your door locked tight will she be all right we dont know banks said were keeping our fingers crossed did she have many visitors i didnt keep a look out i suppose you mean boyfriends anyone male or female i never saw any women call not by themselves her mum and dad came now and then at least i assumed it was her mum and dad and there was one bloke used to visit quite regularly a few months back used to park outside our house sometimes and dont ask me what kind of car he drove i cant even remember the color but he stopped coming hasnt been anyone since not that ive noticed what did this man look like ordinary really fair hair glasses a bit taller than thee keith rothwell or robert calvert banks thought anyone else judd shook his head then smiled only you and that young woman tother day banks felt waltham turn and stare at him if judd had seen banks and susan visit pamela jeffreys on saturday then he obviously didnt miss much morning afternoon or evening banks thanked him well get someone to take a statement soon mr judd said waltham all right son said the old man turning back to his allotment i wont be going anywhere except my final resting place and thatll be a few months off god willing i only wish i could have been more help you did fine said banks what the bloody hell was all that about sir waltham asked as they walked away you didnt tell me youd been here before banks noticed ken blackstone getting out of a dark blue peugeot opposite the sikh temple didnt have time he said to waltham moving away later sergeant ill explain it all later banks and blackstone sat in an indian restaurant near woodhouse moor a short drive across the aire valley from pamela jeffreyss house drinking lager and nibbling at pakoras and onion bhaji as they waited for their main courses being close to the university the place was full of students the aroma was tantalizing cumin coriander cloves cinnamon mingled with other spices banks couldnt put a name to not exactly the shabab blackstone had said but not bad a yorkshire compliment in the brief time they had been there banks had explained as succinctly as he could what the hell was going on at least to the extent that he understood it himself so why do you think they beat up the girl blackstone asked they must have thought she knew where daniel clegg was or that she was hiding something for him they ripped her place up pretty thoroughly and you think theyre working for martin churchill burgess thinks so its possible do you think it was the same two who visited cleggs secretary and his exwife yes im certain of it but they didnt beat up either of them or search their places why not i dont know maybe they were getting desperate by the time they got to pamela lets face it theyd found out nothing so far they must have been frustrated they felt theyd done enough pussyfooting around and it was time for business either that or they phoned their boss and he told them to push harder they also probably thought she was lying or holding out on them for some reason maybe something in her manner i dont know perhaps theyre just racists banks shook his head feeling a sudden ache and rage he couldnt seem to banish the image of pamela jeffreys at the hands of her torturers her terror her agony the smashed viola and would her broken fingers ever heal enough for her to play again but he didnt know blackstone well enough to talk openly about his feelings theyd been polite but pushy earlier he said maybe they just ran out of patience the main course arrived a plate of steaming chapatis chicken bhuna and goat vindaloo along with a selection of chutneys and raita they shared out the dishes and started to eat using the chapatis to shovel mouthfuls of food and mop up the sauce blackstone ordered a couple more lagers and a jug of ice water there is another explanation blackstone said between mouthfuls what that she did know something that she was involved in the doublecross or whatever it was from the quick look i got at her house id agree theres no doubt they were looking for something ds waltham suggested the same thing dont think i havent considered it banks said carefully piling a heap of the hot vindaloo on a scrap of chapati but im sure she didnt even know clegg thats only what she told you remember nobody else contradicted her ken not melissa clegg not the secretary not even mr judd oh come on alan the old man cant have seen everything nor could the secretary or the exwife have known everything maybe clegg never visited her at her home they could have had some clandestine relationship met in secret why the need for secrecy neither of them was married perhaps because they were involved in some funny business not necessarily of a sexual nature and it wouldnt be good to be seen together maybe she was involved in whatever scam clegg and rothwell had going banks shook his head clegg was a lawyer rothwell a financial whizkid and pamela jeffreys is a classical musician it just doesnt fit they could have had business interests in common though true anythings possible but remember pamela jeffreys knew robert calvert she told me they met by chance in a pub shed never heard of keith rothwell until after his murder when his photo appeared in the papers she had no reason to lie she was even putting herself in an awkward situation by calling us she neednt have done so we hadnt heard of robert calvert and might never have done if it werent for her usually people want to stay as far away from a murder investigation as they can get you know that ken until we find out differently we have to assume that calvert was a persona invented by rothwell with cleggs help solely for pleasure blackstone swallowed a mouthful of bhuna i sometimes think i could do with one of those myself he said banks laughed calvert helped rothwell express another side of his nature a side he couldnt indulge at home or perhaps it helped him be the way he used to be relive something hed lost as calvert hed have fun gambling and womanizing and probably subsidizing himself with his illicit earnings from the moneylaundering and pamela jeffreys wasnt his only conquest you know there were no doubt others before her and she was convinced that hed met someone else someone hed really fallen for that would upset the applecart wouldnt it said blackstone banks stopped chewing for a moment alan blackstone said alan are you all right i know the currys hot but what oh yes it was just something you said thats all im surprised i never thought of it before what if calvert really did do it you know fall in love the real thing with all the bells and whistles then what would happen to rothwell i dont get you its the same person isnt it yes and no what i mean is how could he go on living his rothwell life the one we assumed was his real life at arkbeck farm with mary alison and tom forgive me im just thinking out loud going nowhere it doesnt matter i do see what you mean said blackstone it would bugger up everything wouldnt it hmm banks finished his meal and washed away some of the spicy heat with a swig of watery lager his lips still burned though and he felt prickles of sweat on his scalp the signs of a good curry did the suspects in the jeffreys beating know about rothwell blackstone asked banks shook his head dont know they havent been seen locally and they certainly dont match the daughters description of his killers how old is she alison fifteen she didnt see their faces could she be wrong its possible but not that wrong i dont think nothing matches just a thought i mean if rothwell and clegg were in the laundering business together and whoever they were working for sent a couple of goons to find clegg and whatever money hes made off with youd think theyd start with rothwells family wouldnt you perhaps but weve been keeping too close a watch they wouldnt dare show up within twenty miles of arkbeck farm and another thing if they killed rothwell why did they use different people to chase down clegg it seems a bit excessive doesnt it again said banks i can only guess i think some of whats been happening took them by surprise its possible that they asked clegg to get rid of rothwell and he hired his own men as you know were looking into what connections he might have had with criminal types blackstone nodded i see he said then clegg became a problem and they had to send their own men something like that makes sense clegg was a bit of a ladies man you know according to my dc who talked to his colleagues blackstone said yes his estranged wife melissa suggested as much did he have a girlfriend yes apparently nothing serious since he split up with his wife prefers to play the field recently hes been seeing a receptionist from norwich insurance name of marci lapwing if you can believe that aspiring actress dc gaitskill had a word with her this morning says shes a bit of a bimbo with obvious attractions but hes a bit of an asshole himself is gaitskill so id take it with a pinch of salt anyway they saw each other the saturday before cleggs disappearance they went for dinner then to a nightclub in harehills she spent the night with him and he took her home thats seacroft after a pub lunch out at the red lion in burnsall on sunday afternoon she hasnt seen or heard from him since is she telling the truth gaitskill says so id trust him on that okay thanks ken clegg had a reserved parking space at the back of the court centre according to what we could find out he used to eat at a little trattoria on the headrow after work on thursdays the waiters there remember him all right nothing odd about his behavior he left about sixthirty or a quarter to seven last thursday heading west toward where his car was parked and thats the last sighting we have the car red jag gone weve put it out over the pnc along with this blackstone took a photograph from his briefcase and slid it over the tablecloth it showed the head and shoulders of a man in his early forties with determined blue eyes a slightly crooked nose fair hair and a mouth that had a cruel twist to its left side clegg blackstone nodded and put the photograph back in his briefcase weve also been through cleggs house in chapel allerton nothing whatever he was up to he kept it at the office anything on hamilton and the other car the boffins are still working on the car i pulled hamilton s record myself and we had another chat with him at the station this afternoon he shook his head i cant see it alan the mans as thick as two short planks i dont think hes even heard of st corona and hes strictly small fry on the drugs scene by the time he gets his stuff to sell its been stepped on by just about every dealer in the city it was just a thought thanks for giving it a try no problem well have another shot in a day or two just in case and well keep a discreet eye on him look back to what i was saying before how do you think the goons knew about pamela jeffreys if she wasnt involved banks felt the anger flare up inside him again but he held it in check thats all too easy he said remember they were also following me around yesterday i think they started at cleggs office first thing yesterday morning and one or both of them stayed on my tail until i spotted them outside calverts flat that evening they didnt know who the hell i was and the only other person i met that they hadnt talked to already was pamela jeffreys they must have thought we were in it together i met her near the hall where she was rehearsing and either one of them hung around to follow her home or they found out some other way who she was and where she lived she must have looked like their best lead so far they thought she had some connection with clegg and that she knew where he was or was holding something for him clegg has obviously got something they want most likely money if he was laundering for their boss then it looks like he might have skipped with a bundle either that or hes got some sort of evidence for blackmail books bank account records and thats probably what they were looking for when they tore her place apart back to square one the goons worked pamela over because they thought she knew something or had something of theirs she didnt and i blame myself i should have bloody well known i was putting her at risk come off it alan how could you know banks shrugged and tapped out a cigarette he was the only smoker in the entire restaurant and had to ask the waiter specially for an ashtray it was getting like that these days he noted glumly hed have to stop sometime soon he knew he was only postponing the inevitable he had thought about getting a nicotine patch then quickly dismissed the idea it was the feel of the cigarette between his fingers he wanted the sharp intake of tobacco smoke into the lungs not some slow oozing of poison through his skin into his blood pity about the health problems he felt rather like st augustine must have felt when he wrote in his confessions give me chastity and continency but not yet you know what really pisses me off banks said after he had lit the cigarette dirty dick burgess was following me around that day too and it wouldnt surprise me at all if hed seen them outside melissa cleggs shop how would he know who they are oh i think he knows them all right even so what could he have done they hadnt broken any laws banks shrugged i suppose not its too bloody late now anyway he said lets just hope they dont go back to see betty moorhead and melissa clegg dont worry charlie waltham will have them both covered by now hes a good bloke alan and hell have descriptions of mutt and jeff out too they wont get far i hope not said banks i bloody hope not id like a few minutes alone with them in a quiet cell back at the hotel banks felt caged anger burned inside him like the hot indian spices but it would take more than rennies to quell it what a bloody fool hed been to do nothing when he realized he had been followed he had practically signed pamela jeffreyss death warrant and it was through no virtue of his that she had survived her ordeal so far he poured himself a shot of bell s and turned on the television nothing but a nature program a silly comedy an interview with a hasbeen politician and an old dirty harry movie he watched clint eastwood for a while he had never much enjoyed cop films or cop programs on television but watching right here and now he could identify with dirty harry tracking down the villains and dealing with them his own way he had meant what he said to blackstone a few minutes alone with pamela jeffreyss attackers and they would know what police brutality was all about but he hated himself when he felt that way luckily it was rare after all policemen are only human he reminded himself they have their loyalties their lusts their prejudices their agonies their tempers the problem was that they have to keep these emotions in check to do their jobs properly you go home and puke on your own time if you want to get anywhere in this job lad one of his early mentors had told him at a grisly crime scene you dont do it all over the corpse and you go home and punch holes in your own wall not in the child molesters face unable to concentrate even on dirty harry he turned off the television he couldnt stand up couldnt sit down didnt know what he wanted to do and all the time the anger and pain churned inside him and he couldnt find a way to get them out he picked up the phone and dialled the code for eastvale then put it down before he started dialling his own number he wanted to talk to sandra but he didnt think he could explain his feelings to her right now especially the way theyd been drifting apart of late god knew under normal circumstances she was an understanding wife but this would be pushing it a bit far a woman he had lusted after fantasized about gets beaten within a hairs breadth of her life and hes whipping himself over it no he couldnt explain that to sandra and it wasnt just a fantasy had things turned out differently he would have phoned pamela jeffreys again and would probably be having dinner or drinks with her right now plucking up the courage to ask her up to his hotel room bells at the ready well he would never know the outcome now his virtue hadnt even been put to the test hadnt st augustine said something about that too or was that someone else he phoned the hospital and after a bit of officious rankpulling actually got a doctor on the line yes ms jeffreys was stable but still in intensive care no she was still unconscious there was no way of telling when or if she would come round no idea yet if there was any permanent damage he didnt feel any better when he hung up it was just after ninethirty he knocked back the rest of the glass of scotch grabbed his sports jacket and went out maybe a walk would help or the anonymous comfort of a crowded pub not that he expected leeds city center on a tuesday evening to be the west end he walked along wellington street past the national express coach station and the tall royal mail building to city square which was deserted except for the silent nymphs who stood bearing their torches around the central statue of the black prince on his horse from somewhere along boar lane a drunk shouted in the night a bottle smashed and a woman laughed loudly banks crossed city square he walked fast trying to burn off some of his rage and soon found himself in the empty bond street centre with only his reflection in the shop windows he passed his memories of leeds city center were vague but he was sure that somewhere among the jungle of refurbished victorian arcades and modern shopping centers there were a number of pubs down the dingy back alleys that riddled the heart of the old city center and he was right the first one he found was an old brass mirrors and dark wood tetleys house with a fairsized crowd and a jukebox at tolerable volume he ordered a pint and stood sideways at the bar just watching people chat and laugh it was mostly a young crowd only kids seemed to venture into the city centers at night these days perhaps that was why their parents and grandparents stayed away the pubs in armley and bramley in headingley and kirkstall would be full of locals of all age groups mixed together as he leaned against the bar drinking and smoking nobody paid him any attention banks had always been pleased that he didnt stand out as an obvious policeman thered be no mistaking hatchley or ken blackstone no matter how off duty they were but banks could fit in almost anywhere without attracting too much attention over the years he had found it a useful quality it wasnt only that he didnt look like a copper whatever that meant but for some reason his presence didnt set off the usual warning bells at the same time he didnt like to sit or stand with his back to the door and he didnt miss much he finished his pint quickly and ordered another one lighting up again he was smoking too much he realized and he would feel it in the morning but that was the morning in the meantime it gave him something to do with his hands which left to their own devices curled and hardened into fists his second pint went down easily too the ebb and flow of conversation washed over him loudest was a group of two middleaged couples sitting behind the engraved smoked glass and dark wood at the side of the door the only people over twentyfive apart from banks and the bar staff they had all had a bit too much to drink the men were on pints of bitter and the women on oddly colored concoctions with umbrellas sticking out of them and bits of fruit floating around by the sound of things they were celebrating the engagement of one couples daughter who wasnt present and this brought forth all the old blue jokes banks had ever heard in his life theres these three women said one of the men the prostitute the nymphomaniac and the wife after sex the prostitute says thats it then all businesslike the nympho says thats it and the wife says beige i think the ceiling should be beige they howled with laughter one of the women a rather blowsy peroxide blonde like a lateperiod diana dors with too much makeup and unfocused eyes looked over and winked at banks he winked back and she nudged her friend they both started to laugh a man banks assumed to be her husband popped his head around the divide and said thas welcome to her lad but ill warn thee shell have thee worn out in a week bloody insatiable she is she hit him playfully and they all laughed so much they had tears in their eyes banks laughed with them then turned away the barmaid raised her eyebrows and drew a finger across her throat banks drank up and moved on outside he noticed that the evening had turned a little cooler and dark clouds were fast covering the stars there was an electric edge to the air that presaged a storm as if he didnt feel tense and wound up enough already without the bloody weather conspiring against him too the next pub down another alley off briggate was busier groups of young people stood about outside leaning against the wall or sitting on the wooden benches the place danced with long shadows like something out of an old orson welles film banks took his pint out into the narrow whitewashed alley and rested it on a ledge at elbow level like a bar he thought of his last meeting with pamela jeffreys she had run off in tears and he had stood there like an idiot in the park watching his icecream melt he had wanted to apologize for treating her feelings so shoddily but at the same time another part of him the professional side knew he had had to ask and knew an apology would never be completely genuine still he was only human susceptible to beauty he found her attractive and he liked her warm open personality her enthusiasm for life and her sense of humor her connection with music also excited him how much of that would she have left when she came out of hospital if she came out now slurping his ale in a back alley in leeds he considered again what blackstone had suggested about her involvement in the affair but he didnt think pamela jeffreys was that good an actress she had liked calvert they had had simple fun together with no demands no strings attached no deep commitment and what was wrong with that she may have felt hurt when he found someone else after all nobody likes rejection but she had liked him enough to swallow her pride and remain friends she was young she had energy enough to deal with a few hard knocks if she had been jealous enough for murder she would have killed robert calvert probably in his leeds flat and if she had been involved in the laundering operation with rothwell and clegg she wouldnt have phoned the eastvale station and told them about calvert it was close to eleven most of the people had gone home banks ordered one more for the road as he would be walking beside it not driving on it he was glad he had taken a little time out the drink had helped douse his anger or at least dampen it for a while he was also rational enough to know that tomorrow he would be the professional again and nobody would ever know about his complex knotted feelings of lust and guilt for pamela jeffreys he drained his glass put his cigarettes back in his jacket pocket and set off down the alley it was long and narrow rough whitewashed stone on both sides and lit only by a single high bulb behind wire mesh when he was a couple of yards from the end two men walked in from the street and blocked the exit one of them asked banks for a light contrary to what one sees on television detectives rarely find themselves in situations where immediate physical violence is threatened banks couldnt remember the last time he had been in a fight but he didnt stop to try to remember a number of thoughts flashed through his mind at once but so quickly that an observer would not have seen him hesitate for a second first he knew that they underestimated him he was neither as drunk nor as unfit as they probably believed secondly he had learned an important lesson from schoolyard fights you go in first fast dirty and hard real violence doesnt take place in slow motion like a sam peckinpah film its usually over before anyone realizes it has begun before they could make their move banks took a step closer pretended to fumble for matches then grabbed the nearest one by his shirtfront and nutted him hard on the bridge of the nose the man put his hands over his face and went down on his knees groaning as blood dripped down his shirtfront the other hesitated a moment to glance down at his friend mistake banks grabbed him by the arm whirled him around and slammed him into the wall before the man could get his breath back banks punched him in the stomach and as he bent forward in pain brought his knee up into the mans face he felt cheekbone or teeth smash against his kneecap the man fell putting his hands to his mouth to stem the flow of blood and vomit his mate had clambered to his feet by now and he threw himself at banks knocking him hard into the wall and banging the side of his head against the rough stone he got in a couple of close body punches but before he could gain any further advantage banks pushed him back far enough to start throwing quick jabs at his already broken nose in the sickly light of the alley banks could see blood smeared over his attackers face almost closing one eye and dripping down his chin the man backed off and slumped against the wall by this time the other was back wobbling on his feet and banks went for him he aimed one sharp blow to the head after the other splitting an eyebrow a lip jarring a tooth loose the other stumbled away toward the exit there was no fight left in either of them but banks couldnt stop he kept slugging away at the man in front of him feeling the anger in him explode and pour out when the man tried to protect his face with his hands banks pummeled his exposed stomach and ribs the man backed away begging banks to stop hitting him his friend swaying at the alleys exit now yelled come on kev run for it hes a fucking maniac hell fucking kill us both and they both staggered off toward commercial street banks watched them go there was no one else around thank god the whole debacle couldnt have taken more than a couple of minutes when they were out of sight banks fell back against the whitewashed wall shaking sweating panting he took several deep breaths smoothed his clothes and headed back to the hotel chapter the storm broke in the middle of the night banks lay in the dark in his strange hotel bed tossing and turning as lightning flashed and thunder first rumbled in the distance then cracked so loudly overhead that the windows rattled once unbound the shape of his rage was fluid it could be as easily warped and twisted into fanciful images by sleep as it had been channelled into violence earlier he kept waking from one nightmare and drifting back into another rain lashed against the windows and in the background something hissed constantly the way something always hisses in hotel rooms in the worst nightmare the one he remembered the most clearly he was talking on the telephone to a woman who had dialled his number by mistake she sounded disoriented and the longer she spoke the longer the spaces stretched between her words finally silence took over completely banks called hello a few times then hung up as soon as he had done so he was stricken by panic the woman was committing suicide he knew it she had taken an overdose of pills and fallen into a coma while she was still on the line he didnt know her name or her telephone number if he had kept the line open and not hung up he would have been able to trace her and save her life he awoke feeling guilty and depressed and it wasnt only his soul that hurt his head pounded from too much whisky and from the glasgow handshake he had given one of his attackers his chest felt tight from smoking his knuckles ached and his side felt sore where he had been slammed into the wall his mouth tasted as dry as the bottom of a budgies cage and as sour as monthold milk when he got up to go to the toilet he felt a stabbing pain shoot through his kneecap and found himself limping he felt about ninety he took three extrastrength panadols from his travellers survival kit and washed them down with two glasses of cold water it was four twentythree am by the red square numbers of the digital clock cars hissed by through the puddles in the road around the edges of the curtains he could see the sickly amber glow of the streetlights and the occasional flash of distant lightning as the storm passed over to the north he didnt want to be awake but he couldnt seem to get back to sleep all he could do was lie there feeling sorry for himself remembering what a bloody fool he had been what had started as a simple bit of childish selfindulgence drowning his sorrows in drink had turned into a fullblown exhibition of idiocy and both his skinned knuckles and the empty scotch bottle on the bedside table were evidence enough of that after the fracas he had dashed back to the hotel and hurried straight up to his room before anyone could notice his bloody knuckles or torn jacket once safe inside he had poured himself a stiff drink to stop the shakes lying on the bed watching television until the programs ended for the night he had poured another then another soon the halfbottle was empty and he had fallen asleep now it was time to pay he had heard once that guilt and shame contributed to the pain of hangovers and at four thirtytwo that morning he certainly believed it christ it was so bloody easy to slide down ones thoughts into the pit of misery and selfrecrimination at four thirtytwo am at four thirtytwo if you feel ill you just know you have cancer at four thirtytwo if you feel depressed suicide seems the only way out four thirtytwo is the perfect time for fear and selfloathing the time of the dark night of the soul but it wouldnt do he told himself feeling sorry for himself just wouldnt bloody well do so he wasnt perfect he had contemplated committing adultery so what he wasnt the first and he wouldnt be the last he felt responsible for pamela jeffreyss injuries maybe just maybe he should have acted differently when he knew he was being followed put a guard on everyone he had talked to but it was a big maybe he wasnt god almighty he couldnt anticipate everything most detective work was pissing about in the dark anyway waiting for the light to grow slowly as it was doing now outside on rare occasions the truth hit you quick as a lightning flash but they were very rare occasions indeed even then before the lightning hit you you had spent months looking for the right place to stand so last night in the alley he had lost it so what two yobbos had tried to mug him and he had gone wild on them plastered them all over the walls most of it was a blur now but he remembered enough to embarrass him they had just been kids really early twenties at most out looking for aggro but one had been black and one white like the men who had put pamela jeffreys in hospital banks knew in his mind that they werent the same ones but when the bubble of his anger burst and the fury unleashed itself when the blood started to flow they were the ones he was lashing out at no wonder they ran away shitting bricks there was nothing rational about it blinded by rage he had thought he was hurting the people he really wanted to hurt he had taken out his anger on two unwary substitutes they had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time still he told himself they bloody well deserved it bleeding amateurs at least he might have discouraged two apprentice muggers from their chosen career and nobody would ever know what happened they certainly wouldnt say anything after all he hadnt killed them they had managed to run away and lick their wounds they would survive to fight again another day if they got back the bottle it wasnt the worst thing he had ever done and soon surely that feeling of being a total fucking idiot would go away and he could get on with his life he dozed briefly and woke again at five fortyone not quite as bad as four thirtytwo he thought at first glance he got up and looked outside at the gray morning the road and pavement were still awash with puddles green doubledecker buses were already running people to work splashing up the water where it had collected in the gutters banks was on the fifth floor and he could see the gray sky streaked with blood and milk behind the majestic dome of the town hall already dim shadows were shuffling out of the salvation army shelter opposite banks made a cup of instant coffee with the electric kettle and sachet provided and took it back to bed with him he turned on the bedside light and picked up the copy of evelyn waughs sword of honour trilogy he had brought with him guy crouchbacks misadventures should cheer him up a bit at least he didnt have that much misfortune he would put last night behind him he decided sipping the weak nescafé a man was allowed his mistakes he had just better not cling to them or they would drag him down to the bottom of the abyss at nine oclock that morning susan gay sat alone on the second pew from the back of the small nondenominational chapel at eastvale crematorium it was cool inside thanks to a large fan below the western stainedglass window and the lighting was suitably dimmed the place smelled of shoe polish not the usual musty hymnbooks she associated with chapels the service went briskly enough the rentavicar said a few words about keith rothwells devotion to his family and his dedication to hard work then he read psalm susan thought it particularly apt all that guff about being cleansed of sin bloodguiltiness was a word she hadnt heard before and it made her give a little shudder without knowing why the mention of burnt offering brought the unwelcome image of rothwells corpse the head a black mess as if it had indeed been burned but wash me and i shall be whiter than snow almost made her laugh out loud it brought to mind an old television advert for detergent then rothwells moneylaundering after the vicar read a bit from revelation about a new heaven and a new earth and all sorrow pain and death disappearing it was all over the rothwells all suitably dressed in shades of black for the occasion sat in the front row throughout the ceremony mary sat stiffly alison kept glancing around her at the stainedglass and the font and tom sat hunched over as far as susan could tell from behind nobody reached for a handkerchief when she watched them walk out into the sunlight she could tell she was right dry eyes not a tear in sight mary rothwell doing her stiffupperlip routine bearing her loss and grief with dignity everyone ignored susan except tom who approached her and said youre the detective who was at our house when i got back from the states arent you yes dc susan gay in case youve forgotten i hadnt forgotten what are you doing here id like a word with you if you can spare a few minutes tom took a silver pocketwatch from his waistcoat and looked at it susan saw it was attached by a chain to one of his belt loops somehow it seemed like a very affected gesture in one so young maybe it had impressed the americans he slipped it back in his pocket all right he said but i cant come just now everyones going back to mr pratts for coffee and cake ill have to show up of course how about an hour okay look its a fine morning susan said how about that café by the river the one near the preroman site i know it susan busied herself with paperwork back at the station for three quarters of an hour then set off to keep her appointment the river swain was flowing swiftly still high after the spring thaw on the grass by the bank the owner of the small café had stuck a couple of rickety white tables and chairs susan bought a tin of coke for tom and a pot of tea for herself and they sat by the water two weeping willows framed the rolling farmland beyond right across in the center of the view was a field of bright yellow rapeseed flies buzzed around her head and susan kept fanning them away how was it she asked tom shrugged i hate those kinds of social gatherings he said and laurence pratt gets on my nerves susan smiled at least they had something in common she let the silence stretch as she looked closely at the youth sitting opposite her wavy brown hair fell over his ears about halfway down his neck he was tanned slender handsome and he looked as good now in his mourning suit as he had in torn jeans and a denim shirt the more she let herself simply feel his presence the more she was sure she was right about him he shifted in his chair look he said im sorry about the other day i was rude i know but i was tired upset i understand susan said its just that i got the impression there was something you wanted to tell me tom looked away over the river his face was scrunched up in a frown or maybe the sun was in his eyes you know dont you he asked you can tell that youre homosexual i have a strong suspicion yes am i that obvious susan laughed maybe not to everyone remember im a detective tom managed a weak smile funny thing that isnt it he said youd think it would be men whod guess i dont know women are used to responding to men in certain ways they can tell when somethings wrong i was going to say missing but even thats not right different then thatll do look im not judging you tom you mustnt think that its really none of my business unless your sexual preference connects somehow with your fathers murder i cant see how it does youre probably right tell me about this aston or afton then when chief inspector banks mentioned the name you assumed it was a man why because i didnt assume i know damn well who he is his names ashton bloody clive ashton how could i forget who is he hes the son of one of my fathers clients lionel ashton we were at a party together once i made a mistake you made advances toward him yes and they werent welcome tom gave a dry laugh obviously not he told his father and and his father told my father and my father told me i was disgusting sick queer and that i should see about getting myself cured thats the exact word he used cured he said it would kill mum if she ever found out and he suggested you take off to america for a while at his expense yes but that came a bit later first we let it lie while we figured out what was best what did you do in the meantime tom looked at her tilted his tin back and finished his coke his adams apple bobbed up and down susan turned away and watched a family of ducks drift by on the swain tom wiped his lips with the back of his hand then said i followed him she turned back toward him you followed your father why because i thought he was up to something he was away so often he was always so remote like he wasnt really with us even when he was at home i thought he was doing damage to the family he wasnt always like that tom shook his head no believe it or not dad used to have a bit of life about him im sorry i didnt intend to make a bad joke i know how long had he been behaving this way hard to say it was gradual like but this past couple of years it was getting worse you could hardly talk to him he shrugged was that the only reason you followed him because you thought he was up to something i dont know maybe i wanted to get something on him revenge i dont know find out what his guilty secret was and did you tom took a deep breath held it for a moment then let it out loudly with a nervous laugh this is harder than i thought okay here goes yes i saw my father with another woman he said it fast staccatostyle there thats it i said it susan paused a moment to take the information in then asked when sometime in february where leeds in a pub they were sitting together at a table in the guildford on the headrow they were holding hands christ his eyes were glassy with gathering tears he rubbed the backs of his hands over them and collected himself do you know what that feels like he asked seeing your old man with another woman no of course you dont it was like a kick in the balls sorry thats all right did your father see you no i kept myself well enough hidden not that they had eyes for anyone but each other what happened next nothing i left i was so upset i just got in the van and drove around the countryside for a while i remember stopping somewhere and walking by a river it was very cold was the woman darkskinned indian or pakistani tom looked surprised no susan took her notepad and pen out what did she look like tom closed his eyes i can see her now he said just as clearly as i could then she was young much younger than dad probably in her midtwenties id guess not much older than me she was sitting down so i couldnt really see her figure properly but id say it was good i mean she didnt look fat or anything she looked nicely proportioned she was wearing a blouse made of some shiny white material and a scarf sort of thing more like a shawl really over her shoulders all in blues whites and reds it looked like one of those liberty patterns she had long fingers i noticed them for some reason am i going too fast no said susan ive got my own kind of shorthand carry on long tapered fingers no nail varnish but her nails looked well kept not bitten or anything she had blonde hair no thats not quite accurate it was a kind of reddish blonde it was piled and twisted on top with some strands falling loose over her cheeks and shoulders you know the kind of look sort of messy but ordered susan nodded hairstyles like that cost a fortune she was extraordinarily goodlooking tom went on very fine pale skin a flawless complexion like marble sort of translucent the kind where you can just about see the blue veins underneath and her features could have been cut by a fine sculptor high cheekbones small straight nose her eyes were an unusual shade of blue they may have been contact lenses but they were sort of light but very bright blue cobalt i guess is that it itll do go on thats about all really no beauty spots or anything she was wearing long dangly earrings too lapis lazuli no rings i dont think thats a very good description tom do you think you could work with a police artist on this i think wed like to have a talk with this woman and your description might help us find her tom nodded no problem i could paint her myself from memory if i had the talent good well arrange something then maybe this evening tom took his watch out again i suppose id better be going home mum and alison need my support did you ever challenge your father about what you saw susan asked tom shook his head i came close once when he kept going on about how disappointed he was in me how sick i was i told him i was disappointed in him too but i wouldnt tell him why what did he say nothing just carried on as if i hadnt spoken does your mother know he shook his head no she doesnt know im sure of it do you think she suspects maybe who knows shes been living in a bit of a dream world im worried about her actually sometimes i get the feeling that underneath all the lies she knows the truth but she just wont admit it to herself do you know what i mean yes what about alison alisons a sweet thing really but she hasnt got a clue lives in her books shes brontë mad is alison you know reads nothing but and shes got notebooks full of her own stories all in tiny handwriting like the brontës did when they were kids made up her own world i keep thinking shell grow out of it but i dont know she seems even worse since since dad he shook his head slowly no she doesnt know i wouldnt confide in her i kept it all to myself can you imagine that i still do youre the first person ive told he stood up look i really must be off well be in touch about the artist then yes okay and yes thanks he said then turned abruptly and hurried off susan watched him go down the path hands in pockets shoulders slumped she poured herself another cup of tea stewed though it was and looked out at the river a beautiful insect with iridescent wings hovered a few feet above the water suddenly a chaffinch shot out from one of the trees and took the insect in its beak in midair susan left her lukewarm tea and headed off to meet sergeant hatchley the porn hunt awaited after banks had gone for a swim in the hotel pool taken a long sauna and put away three cups of freshly brewed coffee and a plateful of bacon and eggs courtesy of room service he was feeling much better as he made a few phone calls he tried to remember something that had been nagging away at him since the early hours something he should do but he failed miserably at about the same time that susan gay was talking to tom rothwell he went out for his first appointment with melissa clegg the morning sun had burned off most of the rain and the pavements had absorbed the rest leaving them the color of sandstone with small puddles catching the light here and there as wind ruffled the waters surface golden light danced inside the puddles it wasnt as warm as it had been banks noticed he had left his torn sports jacket at the hotel all he wore on top was a light blue openneck shirt he carried his notebook wallet keys and cigarettes in his briefcase a cool wind whispered through the streets and there were plenty of dark heavy clouds now lurking on the northern horizon behind the town hall it looked like the region was in for some changeable weather as the forecasters called it sunny with cloudy periods or cloudy with sunny periods he could drive to his appointment he knew but the oneway system was a nightmare besides the city center wasnt all that big and the fresh air would help blow away the cobwebs that still clung to his brain banks had grown quite fond of leeds since he had been living in yorkshire it had an honest slightly shabby charm about it that appealed to him despite the new leedslook architecture redbrick revival with royal blue trim that had sprouted up everywhere and despite the modern shopping centers and the yuppie developments down by the river aire leeds was a scruff by nature it wouldnt look comfortable in fancy dress no matter what the price and then there was opera north of course avoiding city square and the scene of the previous evenings debacle he cut up king street instead walked past the recently restored metropole hotel all redbrick and gold sandstone masonry and along east parade through the business section of banks and insurance buildings in all their jumbled glory here victorian gothic rubbed shoulders with georgian classicism and sixties concrete and glass as in many cities you had to look up above eye level to see the interesting details on the tops of the buildings surprising gables where pigeons nested gargoyles balconies caryatids as he walked along the headrow past stumps and the art gallery he became aware again of the sharp pain in his knee with which he had probably chipped a cheekbone or broken a jaw the previous evening he arrived at the merrion centre a couple of minutes early melissa clegg had told him on the phone that she had a very busy day planned she was expecting a number of important deliveries and had appointments with her suppliers she could however allow him half an hour there was a quiet coffee bar with outside tables she told him on the second level up the steps over the entrance to le phonographique she would meet him there at half past ten banks found the coffee bar and an empty table with no trouble at that time on a wednesday morning the merrion centre was practically deserted especially the upper level which seemed to have nothing but small offices and hairdressers melissa clegg arrived on time with all the flurry of the busy executive when she sat down she tucked her hair behind her ears today she wore a pink dress cut square at her throat and shoulders the last thing on earth banks felt he needed was another cup of coffee but he took an espresso just to have something in front of him also by the feel of his chest he didnt need a cigarette either but he lit one nonetheless the first few drags made him a bit dizzy then it tasted fine you look a bit the worse for wear melissa observed you should have seen the other two banks said he could tell by the way she laughed that she didnt believe him just as he had expected but he had also noticed the angry contusion high on his left cheek just to the side of his eye when he shaved that morning another result of his crash into the alley wall he tried to keep his skinned knuckles out of sight which made drinking coffee difficult what can i do for you this time inspector or chief inspector is it chief inspector i dont suppose youve heard anything from your husband ex well near as no i havent but hes hardly likely to get in touch with me i still dont know why youre so worried im sure hell turn up i dont think so mrs clegg remember last time we met i asked you if you knew a robert calvert yes i said i didnt and i still dont id appreciate it if you would keep this quiet for the moment but we believe that robert calvert was also keith rothwell i dont understand do you mean he had a false name an alias something like that more actually he lived in leeds had a flat in the name of robert calvert a whole other life mary rothwell doesnt know so dont worry i wont say anything youve got me puzzled we were too but the reason im telling you this is that your husband acted as a reference for robert calvert in the matter of his bank account and credit card also ironically enough calvert listed his employer as keith rothwell curiouser and curiouser said melissa daniel must have known about this double life then it looks that way well i certainly knew nothing about it as i told you before i havent seen keith rothwell since danny and i split up two years ago she frowned i must say it surprises me that daniel would risk doing something so obviously dishonest as that not that dishonesty is beneath him but it seems too much of a risk for no return we dont know what the returns were banks said how close are you and daniel what do you mean did he ever mention a woman called marci lapwing to you god what a name no who is she his girlfriend someone hes been seeing lately well he wouldnt tell me about her would he why not she shrugged he never does maybe he thinks id be jealous would you look i dont see what it has to do with anything but no its over o v e r we made our choices is there someone else she blushed a little but met his gaze with steady eyes as she fingered the top of her dress over her freckled collarbone as a matter of fact there is but i wont tell you anything more i dont want him dragged into this its none of your business anyway dannys probably run off with his bimbo no marci lapwing is still around never mind lets move on how do you explain the two men who visited you i dont know perhaps her husband sent them whose husband the bimbos marci whateverhernameis shes not married since we last talked banks said lowering his voice things have taken several turns for the worse were talking about very serious matters indeed it looks as if your husband might be implicated in murder moneylaundering theft and fraud and that he may be partly responsible for the savage beating of a young woman my god i i know you didnt take all this seriously nor did you want to now will you she began to fidget with her coffeespoon yes yes of course i assume youre talking about keith rothwells murder yes and who has been beaten a friend of mr rothwells the way it looks both keith rothwell and your husband were laundering money for a mr x we think we know his identity but im afraid i cant reveal it to you rothwell was either stealing or threatening to talk or both and mr x asked your husband to get rid of him she shook her head danny no i dont believe it he couldnt kill anyone hear me out mrs clegg he did as he was asked maybe his own life was threatened we dont know immediately after he arranged to get rid of keith rothwell he either became a threat himself or he made off with a lot of illegal money so mr x sent two goons to track him down maybe hed seen it coming and anticipated what they would do at this point theres a lot we can only speculate about and that explains the two men yes banks leaned forward and rested his arms on the table they visited your exhusbands office they visited you then they visited a girl they saw me talking to she was the one they beat up now tell me again mrs clegg have you ever seen or heard of a woman called pamela jeffreys she was born here in yorkshire but her family came originally from pakistan shes about five foot four slender figure with almond eyes and long black hair that she sometimes wears tied back she has a smooth dark gold complexion and a gold stud through her left nostril shes a classical musician a violist with the northern philharmonia banks watched melissas face as he described pamela jeffreys when he had finished she shook her head honestly she said ive never seen her and danny never mentioned anyone like that she sounds impressive but he doesnt go for that type what type bright women career women it scared him to death when i started to make a success of the wine business at first he could just look down on it as my little hobby you said she was a classical musician yes he doesnt like classical music all he likes is that bloody awful trad jazz a woman like the one you describe would bore danny to death besides she sounds so gorgeous im sure id remember her a gentle gust of wind blew through the center carrying the smells of espresso and fried bacon from the café two more things banks said first in the time you lived with your husband did you ever come across any acquaintances say or clients of his whom youd describe as shady she laughed oh a tax lawyer has plenty of shady clients chief inspector thats what keeps him in business but i assume you mean something other than that yes if daniel did have anything to do with keith rothwells death he certainly didnt commit the murder himself as you pointed out thats true the daniel i know wouldnt have had the stomach for it so he must have hired someone you dont usually just walk into your local and say look chaps i need a couple of killers do you think you could help me out melissa smiled you might try it at a law society banquet im sure youd get a few takers but i see what you mean so he might have known someone who would consider the task and it might have been someone he met through his practice i doubt very much that the two of you socialized with hitmen but there might be someone who struck you as dangerous perhaps who knows who we socialized with melissa said who knows anything about anyone when it comes right down to it no one immediately springs to mind but ill think about it if i may okay banks passed on alison rothwells vague description of the two men especially the one with the puppydog eyes the only distinguishing feature ill be at the holiday inn here for the next day or so or you can leave a message with detective inspector blackstone at millgarth is he the one who came over last night with my bodyguard no thats detective sergeant waltham i dont honestly believe youre in any danger mrs clegg i think theyre probably miles from here by now but its best to be on the safe side are you happy with the arrangement i didnt really understand all the fuss at first but after what youve just told me ill sleep easier tonight for knowing theres someone out there watching over me she looked at her watch sorry mr banks times pressing you said you had two things to ask yes the other is a bit more personal melissa raised her eyebrows yes i mean personal in the true sense not necessarily embarrassing she frowned still looking at him it was a strong attractive face with its reddish tan and freckles over the nose and upper cheeks every little wrinkle around her grayblue eyes looked as if it had been earned we think daniel clegg has probably done a bunk with a lot of money banks began enough to set him up for life otherwise these goons wouldnt be so keen on finding him but its a bloody big world if you dont know where to look the two of you shared your dreams at one stage i suppose like most married couples where do you think he would go where did he dream of living melissa continued to frown i see what you mean she murmured thats an interesting question wheres dannys shangrila his eldorado yes we all have one dont we well danny wasnt much of a dreamer to tell you the truth he didnt have a lot of imagination but whenever he talked of winning the pools and packing it all in it was always tahiti tahiti yes he was a big fan of mutiny on the bounty had every version on video i think he liked the idea of those barebreasted native girls serving him long cool drinks in coconut shells she laughed and looked at her watch again look mr banks im sorry but i really do have to go now ive got a hell of a day ahead she pushed her chair back and stood up banks stood with her of course he said shaking her hand but if i can be any more help ill get in touch i mean it i never thought danny was capable of real evil but if what you say is true she shrugged anyway ill give what you said some thought i just a minute her brow furrowed and she turned her eyes up as if inspecting her eyelashes she looked at her watch again bit her lip then perched on the edge of the chair knees together clutching her briefcase to her chest there was someone i really cant stay im going to be late i cant think of the name but i might be able to remember if you give me a bit of time he did have those sort of sad eyes like a puppy now i think of it banks sat forward what were the circumstances i told you danny doesnt do criminal work but he is a solicitor and apparently he was the only one this chap knew according to danny they met in a pub had a few drinks got talking you know how it is this chap had been in the army or something over in northern ireland when he got himself arrested danny was the only one he knew to call on what happened danny referred him to someone else i only remember because he came round to the house once he wasnt too happy about the solicitor danny passed him on to for some reason i think it might have been the fee or something like that they argued a bit then danny managed to calm him down they had a drink then the man left i never saw or heard of him again im sorry i didnt really hear what was going on not that id remember now how long ago was it a little over two years shortly before we separated and you remember nothing more about this man no not offhand what pub did they meet in i cant remember isnt that odd you mentioning about meeting a killer in a pub what if it was him what was he arrested for it was something to do with assault i think a fight i know it wasnt really serious certainly not murder or anything look i really must go ill try and remember more i promise just one thing banks said can you remember the name of the solicitor your husband referred him to we might be able to trace him through our records she compressed her lips in thought for a moment then said atkins of course it would have been harvey atkins he and danny are good friends and harvey does a fair bit of criminal work thank you banks said but she was already dashing away ill be in touch she called over her shoulder banks headed for the staircase while he had been talking with melissa clegg he had remembered what it was that had been nagging at him all morning he decided to satisfy his curiosity before meeting ken blackstone things were moving fast chapter take the scenic route said sergeant hatchley were not in a hurry instead of going east to the a at the roundabout by the red lion hotel susan headed southwest along the edge of the dales through masham ripon and harrogate hatchley didnt smoke at all during the journey though he insisted she stop once at a café in harrogate for a cup of coffee during which he chainsmoked three cigarettes it was very different from travelling with banks for a start banks liked to drive and with him there was always music sometimes tolerable sometimes execrable hatchley preferred to sit with his arms crossed and look out of the window at the passing scenery no doubt with visions of bare breasts flashing through what passed for his mind she wished she didnt have to work with men all the time one crying jag or sharp response and it was pmt a day off for any reason meant it was that time of the month she had to put up with it without complaint just take it all in her stride maybe she was being unfair though hatchley aside the men she worked with were mostly okay phil richmond with whom she spent the most time was a sweetheart but phil was leaving soon superintendent gristhorpe frightened her a little perhaps because he made her think of her father and she always felt like a silly little girl when he was around banks though was like an older brother and like a brother he teased her too much especially about music when they were in the car she was sure he played some terrible things just to make her uncomfortable right now though as she approached the busy leeds ring road she would have welcomed something soothing to listen to susan was building up a nice collection of classical music every month she bought a magazine that gave away a free cd of bits and pieces of the works reviewed it provided a breakdown of what to listen for at what points of time like the warm and sunny feeling of the spring day returns or second theme emerges from interplay of brass and woodwinds susan found it very helpful and if she liked the part she heard she would buy the complete work unless it was a lengthy and expensive opera at the moment her favorite piece was beethovens pastoral symphony she knew banks would approve but she was too embarrassed to tell him susan went on to think about her talk with tom rothwell by the river and about the agonies he must be going through it was hard enough being homosexual anywhere she imagined but it would be especially tough in yorkshire where men prided themselves on their masculinity and women were supposed to know their place and stick to it there was a prime example of yorkshire manhood sitting right next to her she thought all rugby league roast beef and pints of bitter and she couldnt imagine what he could find offensive about her perfume it certainly smelled pleasant enough to her and she used it sparingly the traffic snarled up on the ring road and hatchley sat there with the tattered leeds and bradford a to z on his lap squinting at signs he was the kind of navigator who shouted turn here just as you passed by the turning after several misdirections and a couple of hairraising uturns they pulled up outside candidate number one a newsagents shop at the edge of a rundown council estate in gipton two scruffy kids swaggered out as susan and hatchley went in the girl behind the counter couldnt have been more than fifteen or sixteen she was pale as a ghost and skinny as a rake her hair brown streaked with silver red and green teetered untidily on top of her head and unruly strands snaked down over her white neck and face partly covering one overmascaraed eye she looked as if she had a small pretty mouth underneath the full and pouting one she had superimposed with brownish purple lipstick susan also noticed a pungent scent which she immediately classified as cheap not at all like her own the girl rested her ringladen fingers with the long crimson nails on the counter and slanted her bony shoulders toward them head tilted to one side she wore a baggy white tshirt with screw you written in black across her flat chest mr drake around love hatchley asked she moved her head a fraction the hair danced like medusas snakes in the back she said without breaking the rhythm of her chewing he moved toward the counter and lifted the flap hey she said you cant just walk through like that cant i love do you mean i have to be announced all formally like hatchley took out his identification and held it close to her eyes she squinted as she read maybe youd like to get out your salver he went on then i can put my calling card on it and you can take it through to mr drake and inform him that a gentleman wishes to call on him sod off clever arse she said slouching aside to let them pass youre no fucking gentleman and dont call me love who have we got here then hatchley stopped and said glenda slagg feminist piss off they went through without further ceremony into the back room an office of sorts and susan saw mr drake sitting at his desk below the greasy black hair was the lumpiest face susan had ever seen he had a bulbous forehead a potato nose and a carbuncular chin over all of which his oily red skin pitted with blackheads stretched tight and out of which looked a pair of beady black eyes darting about like tiny fish in an aquarium his belly was so big he could hardly get close enough to the desk to write a smell of burned bacon hung in the stale air and susan noticed a hotplate with a fryingpan on it in one corner when they walked in he pushed his chair back and grunted who let you in what do you want remember me jack said hatchley drake screwed up his eyes they disappeared into folds of fat is it well bugger me if it isnt jim hatchley he floundered to his feet and stuck out his hand first wiping it on the side of his trousers hatchley leaned forward and shook it whos the crumpet drake asked nodding toward susan the crumpet as you so crudely put it jack is detective constable susan gay and show a bit of respect sorry lass said drake executing a little bow for susan she found it hard to hold back her laughter she knew that oldfashioned sexism was alive and well and living in yorkshire but it felt strange to have sergeant hatchley defending her honor drake turned back to hatchley now what is it you want jim youre not still working these parts are you i am today drake held his hands out palms open well ive done nowt to be ashamed of jack old lad said hatchley heavily you ought to be ashamed of being born but well leave that aside for now girlie magazines eh what about em still in business drake shifted from one foot to the other and cast a beady eye on susan guilty as the day is long you know i dont go in for owt illegal jim believe it or not at the moment i couldnt care less its not you im after and its sergeant hatchley to you sorry whats up then hatchley asked him about the masked killer with the puppydog eyes drake was shaking his head before he had finished sure hatchley asked aye swear on my mothers grave hatchley laughed youd swear night was day on your mothers grave if you thought it would get me off your back wouldnt you jack nonetheless ill believe you this time any ideas where we might try what have you got shaved pussies excited penises right up your alley idve thought drake turned up his misshapen nose in disgust shaved pussies why thats pretty much straight stuff nay jim times have changed theyre all into the arsebandit stuff or whips and chains these days im not just talking about the local mps jack haha very funny even so hatchley sighed benny still in business drake nodded far as i know but he deals mostly in bodypiercing now very specialized taste he looked at susan you know love pierced nipples labia foreskins that kind of thing susan repressed a shudder bert oldham hatchley went on mario nelson henry talbot aye but you can practically sell the stuff over the counter these days ji sergeant its the practically that interests me jack you know what the law says no penetration no oral sex and no hardons anyway if you get a whiff of him phone this number he handed drake a card ill do that said drake dropping back into his chair again susan thought the legs would break but miraculously they held the girl didnt look up from her magazine as they went out better give that reading a rest love said hatchley it must be hell on your lips fuck off she said chewing gum at the same time shit thought susan its going to be one of those days banks was right he saw as he stood on the threshold of robert calverts flat and surveyed the wreckage the only difference between this and pamela jeffreyss flat was that there had been no human being hurt and no prized possessions utterly destroyed stuffing from the sofa lay strewn over the carpet which had been partly rolled up to expose the bare floorboards in places wallpaper had been ripped down and the television screen had been shattered so they had come back it supported his theory they obviously didnt know that banks was a policeman didnt know that calverts flat had already been thoroughly searched by professionals if they had known they would never have come here it was as he had suspected they had started following him when he left cleggs park square office on monday morning they must have seen the police arrive first but from their point of view the police arrived sometime after banks and he left alone so there was no reason to make a connection certainly none to suspect that he was a policeman for all they knew he could have been a friend of betty moorheads or a colleague of cleggs still looking for clues to cleggs whereabouts they had trailed banks on his lunch date with pamela and noted where she was rehearsing one of them must have found out where she lived they didnt know about the calvert flat until banks led them there and they must have thought the place had something to do with clegg finally when banks saw them from the window they ran off only to come back later and search the place when the coast was clear where were they now already their descriptions had been sent to other police forces to the airports and ports if the men had any sense they would lie low for a while before trying to leave the country but criminals dont always have sense banks knew in fact more often than not they were plain stupid and what about rothwells killers if the man melissa clegg remembered was involved and it was a big if then he was local was he the kind to stay put or run and what about his partner no one else was at home in the building and there was no point looking over the rest of the flat from the box at the corner of the street banks went through the motions of calling the local police to report the breakin but he knew there was nothing they could do he had no doubts as to who had done it he just had to find them dirty dick burgess knew something banks believed but he would talk only when he wanted and tell only as little as he needed when banks had finished the call he took a bus to millgarth at the bottom of eastgate over the road on the site of the demolished quarry hill flats stood the new west yorkshire playhouse with its city of drama sign it seemed uncannily appropriate banks thought given the events of the past couple of days beyond the theater high on a hill was quarry house new home of the department of health and social security and already nicknamed the kremlin by locals ken blackstone was in his office bent over a stack of paperwork he pushed the pile aside and gestured for banks to sit opposite him no earthshattering developments to report before you get your hopes up he said were still no closer to finding clegg or rothwells killers but theres a couple of interesting points first off you might like to know that the lab boys say the dirt and gravel on the tires of ronald hamiltons escort match that around arkbeck farm they said a lot of other things about phosphates and sulphides or whatever which i didnt understand but it looks like the car the killers used rest of it was clean as a whistle and airport security at heathrow have found cleggs red jag in the longstay car park surprise surprise said banks indeed coffee banks stomach was already grumbling from too much caffeine so he declined blackstone went and poured himself a mug from a machine in the openplan office and returned to his screenedoff corner there was a buzz of constant noise around them telephones computer printers fax machines doors opening and closing and the general banter of a section cid department but blackstone seemed to have carved himself a small corner of reasonably quiet calm banks told him about calverts flat interesting said blackstone when do you think that happened id say before they went to pamelas banks said finding nothing there would put them in a fine mood for hurting someone is there any news from the hospital blackstone shook his head no change shes stable at least he frowned at banks and touched the side of his own cheek what about you and i noticed you limping a bit when you came in slipped in the shower look ken i might have a lead on one of rothwells killers he went on quickly to tell blackstone what melissa clegg had said about the mysterious client with the puppydog eyes that clegg had passed on to harvey atkins blackstone put the tip of a yellow pencil to his lower lip hmm he said were already running a check on all cleggs contacts and clients we can certainly check the court records at least weve got the briefs name which helps a bit harvey atkins is certainly no stranger around here hes not a bad bloke as lawyers go its a bit vague though isnt it about two years ago she says something to do with assault maybe do we know if the bloke was convicted banks shook his head im afraid well have to depend on the kindness of microchips blackstone scowled hang on a minute he made a quick phone call and set the inquiry in motion they say it could take a while he said it might be a long list banks nodded what do you know about tahiti he asked tahiti thats where captain blighs men deserted in the film its part of french polynesia now isnt it i think so its in the south pacific at any rate and gauguin painted there why are you interested banks told him what melissa clegg had said hmm said blackstone it wouldnt do any harm to put a few inquiries in motion check on flights would it especially now weve found the car at heathrow a relative newcomer might stand out there ill see what i can do thanks anything else we finished the housetohouse in pamela jeffreyss street nothing really except i think weve fixed the time one neighbor remembered hearing some noise at about ninefifteen monday evening which fits with what the doc said and with mr judds statement banks nodded the people on the other side were out these neighbors said banks they said they just heard some noise yes ken imagine how much noise it must have made when they smashed that stuff imagine how pamela jeffreys must have screamed for help when she realized what was happening i know i know blackstone shook his head and sighed i suppose they would have gagged her still look alan according to dc hyatt who talked to them they said they thought it was the television at first he asked them if she usually played her television set so loud and they said no then they said they thought she was having a fight with her boyfriend he asked them if that was a regular occurrence too and again they said no then they said or implied that darkskinned people have odd forms of entertaining themselves and that we white folks had best leave them to it they really said that blackstone nodded words to that effect theyre the sort of people who wouldnt cross the street to piss on an asian if she was on fire and they dont want to get involved and thats it afraid so blackstone looked at his watch i dont know about you but im a bit peckish what do you say about lunch on me banks didnt feel especially hungry but he knew he ought to try to eat something if he were to keep going all day all right youre on he said but no curries the other shops were not much different from the first usually with the windows barred or covered in mesh and usually close to dilapidated graffitiscarred corporation estates or surviving prewar terraces of backtobacks in areas like hunslet holbeck beeston and kirkstall one moment the sun was out the next it looked like rain around and around they drove hatchley flipping through the a to z which had now become so wellthumbed that the pages were falling out missing turnings looking for obscure streets it was all depressing enough to susan and a far cry from the nice big semi at the top of the hill in sheffield where she grew up but hatchley she noticed seemed to relish the task even though after another three visits they had got nowhere his reputation for laziness she was beginning to realize might be unfounded he certainly didnt like to waste energy and usually took the line of least resistance but he was hardly alone in that susan had known truly lazy policemen some of them had even made detective sergeant but none of them were like hatchley they simply put in the time until the end of their shift generally trying to stay out of the way of any situation that might generate paperwork hatchley was determined when he was after something he didnt let go until he got it the fifth shop was larger and more modern than the others a kind of minimarketcumofflicense that sold milk tinned foods bread and all sorts of odds and ends as well as booze newspapers and magazines it was on beeston road not far from elland road where leeds united played and it was run hatchley said by a man called mario nelson who as his name suggested had an italian mother and an english father it was immediately clear to susan that mario took after his father she knew there were blondhaired italians in the north of the country but they didnt look as downright nordic as mario tall slim wearing a white smock he looked far too elegant to be running a shop in his early fifties susan guessed he was handsome in a robert redford sort of way and he looked as if he would be more comfortable being interviewed on a film set than unpacking a box of mushroom soup which is what he was doing when they entered when he saw hatchley a look of caution came to his iceblue eyes there was nobody else in the shop mario old mate said hatchley long time no see not long enough for me muttered mario putting the box aside what can i do for you no need to be so surly hows business hatchley took out a cigarette and lit up theres no smoking in here hatchley ignored him i asked hows business mario stared at him for a moment then broke off eye contact fair to middling doing much special trade dont know what you mean look if youve just come to chat im a busy man hatchley looked exaggeratedly around the shop doesnt look that way to me mario theres more to running a shop than serving customers well soon as youve answered our questions you can get back to it he described the man in the balaclava ever seen anyone like that in here is he on your list its a bit of a vague description true but concentrate on the eyes theyd just about come up to your chin poor misguided bloke has an appetite for shaved pussy magazines and i know you supply them youve never proved that come off it the only reason youre still in business is that youve done me a few favors over the years remember that youre a filthpeddler you know i dont like filthpeddlers mario you know i rank them a bit below a dollop of dogshit on my shoe hatchley made some very interesting distinctions susan thought some delicate moral judgments simple display of naked flesh was fine with him obviously but anything more was pornographic bit of a puritan really when it came down to it she watched mario shift from foot to foot and she saw something in his eyes other than wariness she saw that he recognized hatchleys description or thought he did hatchley noticed it too and she saw fear hatchley dropped his cigarette on the floor and ground it out susan he said would you go put up the closed sign please you cant do that said mario coming out from behind the counter and moving to stop susan hatchley got in the way he was about the same height and two stones heavier mario stopped susan went to the door and turned the sign over might as well drop the latch and pull the blinds down too said hatchley seeing as its such a quiet time susan did as he said right hatchley turned to face mario whats his name whose name i dont know what youre on about were not gormless susan and i were detectives that means we detect and i detect that youre lying whats his name mario looked pale beads of sweat formed on his brow susan almost felt sorry for him almost honest mr hatchley i dont know what you mean he said i run an honest business here i but before he could finish hatchley had grabbed him by the lapels of his shopcoat and pushed him against the shelves a jar of instant coffee fell to the floor and smashed tins dropped and rolled all over a packet of spaghetti noodles burst open watch what youre doing mario cried that stuff costs money hatchley pushed him up harder against the shelving twisting the lapels marios face turned red susan was worried he was going to have a heart attack or something she wished she hadnt become part of this gristhorpe would find out she knew and she would be thrown off the force in shame outside she heard somebody rattle the door do something her inner voice screamed sir she said levelly maybe mr nelson wants to tell us something and hes having difficulty speaking hatchley looked at nelson and relaxed his grasp is that so mario mario nodded as best he could under the circumstances hatchley let him go a jar of pickled onions rolled off the shelf and smashed infusing the air with the acrid smell of vinegar who is he asked hatchley mario massaged his throat and gasped for breath you shouldnt have done that he wheezed could have kkkilled me weak heart i cccould report you but we both know you wont dont we imagine trying to run an honest business with the local police breathing down your neck day and night come on give us the name mario i i dont know his name jjust that hes been in occasionally for your underthecounter stuff shaved pussies mario nodded hatchley shook his head i wouldnt believe it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes he said but youre lying again after all this he reached out for marios lapels no mario jumped back dislodging a few more tins from the shelf a bottle of gin fell and smashed he put his hands out no come on then said hatchley give jameson mr jameson thats all i know said mario still rubbing his throat i want his address too hes on one of your paper routes isnt he ill bet one of your lads delivers his papers maybe with a special color supplement on sundays eh come on no i dont know be reasonable mario its no skin off your nose is it and itll put you in good stead with the local bobbies whats his address mario paused a moment then went behind the counter and looked in the ledger where he kept the addresses for newspaper deliveries fortyseven bridgeport road he said but you wont find him there oh canceled his papers how long for three weeks since when last friday wheres he gone ive no idea have i off on his holidays maybe dont come the clever bugger with me im not honest is that all you know hatchley moved forward and mario backed off i swear it were not mates or anything hes just a customer and do me a favor when you do find him dont tell him you found out from me scared of him hes got a bit of a reputation for scrapping thats all when hes had a few like i dont think hed take kindly aye all right then said hatchley susan would you do the honors susan went over and unlocked the door a redfaced old woman bustled in whats going on here ive been waiting five minutes my poor marmaduke is going to starve to death if you she stopped talking looked at the mess on the floor then back at the three of them slight accident mrs bagshot said mario straightening his tie and smiling nothing serious hatchley bent down and grabbed a pickled onion after a cursory check to make sure there was no broken glass clinging to it he popped it in his mouth smiled at mrs bagshot and left after a light lunch in the police canteen with ken blackstone a toasted cheese sandwich and a plastic container of orange juice banks set off back to the hotel the weather was the same fastmoving cloud on the wind sun in and out casting shadows over the streets and buildings he would have to do something about his jacket he realized as he walked past the corn exchange maybe he could get it fixed this afternoon the hotel should be able to help or maybe he should buy a new one he wasnt looking forward to explaining his adventures to sandra either he hadnt phoned her last night and she would probably be out until this evening he could phone the gallery he knew but she would be busy besides it would only worry her if he told her about the fight over the telephone he might get his jacket fixed but there would be no hiding the skinned knuckles and bruised cheekbone from sandra let alone the bruises that would soon show up on his side all he had to say was that two kids had tried to mug him simple as that it might not be the complete truth but it certainly wasnt a lie on the other hand he wondered who he was trying to fool if he couldnt talk to sandra about what had happened who could he talk to right now he just didnt know a local train must have just come in judging from the hordes issuing from the station and heading for the bus stops around city square and boar lane banks picked up a yorkshire evening post from the aged vendor who was shouting out a headline that sounded like turkle an honest liar but which on reading turned out to be two killed in hunslet fire banks refused the free packet of old el paso taco shells he was offered with his newspaper at the hotel he found three messages one to call melissa clegg at the wine shop one to meet sergeant hatchley and susan gay at the victoria behind the town hall as soon as possible and one to call ken blackstone at millgarth first he went to his room and phoned melissa clegg oh mr banks she said i didnt want to get your hopes up but ive remembered his name the man daniel met in the pub yes well i knew there was something funny about it after i left you i just couldnt get it out of my mind then i was filling some orders and i saw it written down it came to me just like that yes irish whiskey funny how the mind works isnt it irish whiskey his name it was jameson im sure of it banks thanked her and called ken blackstone alan weve got some names for you blackstone said quite a lot im afraid never mind said banks is jameson among them banks heard blackstone muttering to himself as he went through the list yes yes there he is bloke called arthur jameson alan what i cant talk now ken can you pull his file and meet me at the victoria in about fifteen minutes i assume you know where it is the vic sure but fifteen minutes then banks hung up chapter it was foolish susan knew but she couldnt help feeling butterflies in her stomach as she turned the corner where courtney terrace intersected bridgeport road at number thirtyfive it was midafternoon there was no one about she felt completely alone and the click of her heels which seemed to echo from every building was the only sound breaking the blanket of silence her instructions were simple find out what you can about arthur jameson and his whereabouts in her blue jacket and matching skirt carrying a briefcase and clipboard she looked like a market researcher a light breeze ruffled her tight blonde curls and a sudden burst of sun through the clouds dazzled her she could smell rain in the air we know hes not at home she repeated to herself he has cancelled his papers for three weeks and gone on a long holiday on the proceeds earned from killing keith rothwell he doesnt answer his telephone and the two men observing the house over the past hour or so have seen no signs of occupation so theres nothing to worry about but still she worried she remembered keith rothwell kneeling there on the garage floor in his suit his head blown to a pulp she remembered the tattered pieces of the girlie magazine ripped images of womens bodies as if the killer had intended some kind of sick joke and she remembered what ken blackstone had told her about jameson at the makeshift briefing in the victoria he had been kicked out of the army for rushing halfcocked against orders into an ambush that had killed two innocent teenage girls as well as one suspected ira triggerman after that he had drifted around africa and south america as a mercenary then back home he had beaten an irishman senseless in a pub because the mans belfast accent hit a raw nerve since the gbh he hadnt done much except work on building sites and perhaps the occasional hit though there was no evidence of this he had four alevels and an incomplete degree in engineering from the university of birmingham susan looked around her as she walked bridgeport road was a drab street of dirty terrace houses with no front gardens from each house two small steps led right onto the worn pavement and the tarmac road surface was in poor repair at the back she knew each house had a small brickedin backyard complete with privy full of weeds and each row faced an identical row across an alley a peculiar smell hung in the air a mix of raw sewage and brewery malt susan thought wrinkling her nose outside one or two houses lines of washing propped up by high poles hung out to dry right across the street a woman came out of her house with a bucket and knelt on the pavement to scour her front steps she glanced at susan without much interest then started scrubbing if jameson really is our man susan thought hell probably be looking for somewhere a bit more upmarket to live after he has laid low for a while there was nobody at home in the first two houses the timid woman at number thirtynine said she knew nothing about anyone else in the street the man at number fortyone didnt speak english the west indian couple at number fortythree had just moved into the area and didnt know anyone number fortyfive was out susan felt her heart beat faster as she lifted the brass lions head knocker of number fortyseven jamesons house she was sure the whole street could hear her heart and the knocker thumping in concert echoing from the walls she had it all rehearsed if the man with the puppydog eyes answered the door she was going to lift up her clipboard and tell him she was doing market research on neighborhood shopping habits how often did he use the local supermarket that kind of thing under no circumstances banks had said was she to enter the house as if she would as her mother used to say she wasnt as green as she was cabbagelooking but the heavy knocks just echoed in the silence she listened nothing stirred inside all her instincts told her the house was empty she relaxed and moved on to number fortynine yes an old lady with dry wrinkled skin opened the door but kept it on the chain susan kept her voice down even though she was sure jameson wasnt home she showed her card dc susan gay north yorkshire police id like to talk to you about your neighbor mr jameson if i may hes not at home i know do you know where he is the face looked at susan for some time she couldnt help but be reminded of reptile skin with slit lizard eyes peeping out of the dry folds the door shut the chain rattled and the door opened again come in the woman said susan walked straight into the small living room which smelled of mothballs and peppermint tea everything was in shades of dark brown the wallpaper the wood around the fireplace the threepiece suite and in the fireplace stood an electric fire with fake coals lit by red bulbs all three elements blazed away there might be a chilly breeze outside but the temperature was still in the midteens the room was stifling worse than pratts office as the door closed susan suddenly felt claustrophobic panic though she had never suffered from claustrophobia in her life a heavy brown curtain hung from a brass rail at the top of the door it swept along the floor with a long hissing sound as the door closed whats arthur been up to now the woman asked will you tell me your name first gardiner martha gardiner whats he been up to here sit down can i get you a cup of tea susan remained by the door no thank you she said i cant stop its very important we find out where mr jameson is hes gone on his holidays thats where has he done anything wrong why do you keep asking me that mrs gardiner would it surprise you she chuckled surprise me nowt much surprises me these days lass that one especially but hes a good enough neighbor when my lumbago plays me up hell go to the shops for me he keeps an eye on me too just in case i drop dead one of these days it happens with us old folk you know she grabbed susans arm with a scrawny talon and hissed in her ear but i know hes been in jail and i saw him with a gun once a gun oh aye a shotgun she let go i know a shotgun when i see one young lady my eric used to have one when we lived in the country bless his soul young arthur doesnt think i know about it but i saw him cleaning it through the back window once still hes always polite to me gives me the odd pint of milk and never asks for owt who am i to judge if he likes to go off shooting gods innocent creatures then hes no worse than many a gentleman is he ducks grouse whatever even though he says hes one of that green lot how long ago did you see him with the shotgun couldnt say for certain time has a funny way of moving when youre my age couple of months perhaps are you going to arrest him what are you going to arrest him for wholl do my shopping mrs gardiner first weve got to find him have you any idea where he went how would i know on his holidays thats what he said abroad she snorted shouldnt think so doesnt like foreigners doesnt arthur you should hear him go on about the way this countrys gone downhill since the war all because of foreigners taking our jobs imposing their ways no hes been abroad he said and had enough of foreigners to last him a lifetime hates em all foreigners begin at calais mrs gardiner just you remember that thats what he says as if i needed reminding my eric was in the war in burma never the same after england for the english thats what mr jameson always says and i cant say i disagree susan gritted her teeth and all he told you was that he was going on holiday aye thats what he told me likes to drive around the english countryside at least thats what hes done before sent me a postcard from the lake district once he wished me well and asked me to keep an eye on his place you know in case somebody broke in theres a lot of that these days she snorted foreigners again if you ask me i dont suppose he left you a key did he she shook her head just asked me to keep an eye out you know check the windows try the door every now and then make sure its still locked when did he leave late thursday afternoon when did you last see him just before he went about four oclock was he driving of course he was what kind of car does he drive a gray one did he take his shotgun with him i didnt see it but he might have i dont know i imagine hed want to shoot a few animals if hes on holiday wouldnt he susan could feel the sweat itching behind her ears and under her arms her breathing was becoming shallow she couldnt take much more of mrs gardiners hothouse atmosphere but there were other things she needed to know what make was the car a ford granada i know because he told me when he bought it i dont suppose you know the number no its new though he only got it last year that would make it an m registration susan noted how was he dressed she asked dressed just casual jeans a shortsleeved shirt green i think it was or blue ive always been a bit color blind one of those anoraks red or orange i think it was and he drove off at about four oclock on thursday yes i told you was he alone aye do you have any idea where he was heading first he didnt say susan needed to know about any friends jameson might have entertained but she knew if she stayed in the house a moment longer she would faint she opened the door the welcome draft of fresh air almost made her dizzy banks would want to question mrs gardiner further anyway they would need an official statement any other questions could wait they had enough thank you mrs gardiner she said edging out of the door thank you very much someone else will be along to see you soon to take a statement and she hurried off down the street heels clicking in the silence to where banks and the rest waited in their cars in the tesco car park off the main road it took the locksmith all of fortyfive seconds to open arthur jamesons door for banks and blackstone to get in as it wasnt often that four detectives and two patrol cars appeared in bridgeport road and as it was still a nice enough day despite the occasional clouds everyone who happened to be home at the time stood out watching gathered on doorsteps swapping explanations the consensus of opinion very quickly became that mr jameson was a child molester and it just went to show you should never trust anyone with eyes like a dog and some added this kind of thing wouldnt happen if the authorities kept them locked up where they belonged or fed them bromide with their cornflakes or better still castrated them like mrs gardiners jamesons front door opened directly into the living room but unlike the gloomy number fortynine this room had cream wallpaper patterned with poppies and cornflowers twined around a trellis banks opened the curtains and the daylight gave the place a cheery enough aspect it smelled a little musty but that was to be expected of a house that had been empty for almost six days jamesons mug shot and a description of his car had already gone out to police all over the country they had got the granada s number quickly enough from the central driver and vehicle licensing centre in swansea local police were warned not to approach him under any circumstances simply to observe and report hatchley and susan gay were taking a statement from the woman next door whom they had managed to persuade at susans insistence to accompany them to the local station mrs gardiner had in fact been quite thrilled to be asked to come down to the station just like on television and had managed a regal wave to all the neighbors who had whistled and whooped their encouragement as she got in the car things were on the move in the living room banks and blackstone examined a small bookcase filled with books on nature the english heritage and the environment rain forests ozone layers whaling oil spills sealclubbing the whole green spectrum jameson had a healthy selection on birds flowers and wildlife in general including gilbert whites natural history of selborne and kilverts diaries there were also a few large picture books on stately homes and listed buildings blackstone whistled probably a member of greenpeace and the national trust as well he said therell be trouble if we arrest this one alan loves britain s heritage likes furry little animals and wants to save the seals theyll be calling him the green killer just you wait and see banks laughed its not every murderer you meet has a social conscience is it he said i suppose we should take it as an encouraging sign loves animals and plants but has no regard for human life he pulled a girlie magazine from down the side of a battered armchair yes it looks like weve got a real nature boy here after the living room they went into the kitchen everything was clean neat and tidy dishes washed dried and put away surfaces scrubbed clean of grease the only sign of neglect was a piece of cheddar well past its sellby date going green in the fridge the six cans of tetleys bitter on the shelf above it would last for a long time yet as he looked in the oven banks remembered a story he had heard from superintendent gristhorpes nephew in toronto about a texan who hid his loaded handgun in the oven when he went to canada to visit his daughter and soninlaw canadian gun laws being much stricter than those in the usa he forgot about it when he got back until his wife started to heat up the oven for dinner the first night after that he always kept it in the fridge jameson didnt keep his shotgun in the oven or the fridge the first bedroom was practically empty except for a few cardboard boxes of small household appliances an electric kettle a teasmade a clock radio they looked too old and well used to be stolen property more likely things that had broken things he hadnt got around to fixing or tossing out there were also an ironing board and a yellow plastic laundry basket the other bedroom clearly the one jameson slept in was untidy but basically clean the sheets lay twisted on the bed and a pile of clothes lay on the floor under the window a small television stood on top of the dresserdrawers opposite the bed all the cupboard held was clothes and shoes perhaps the soil expert might be able to find something on the shoes linking jameson to arkbeck farm and its immediate area after all he had succeeded with the car the only reading material on his bedside table was a british national party pamphlet there was a small attic reached through a hatch in the landing ceiling banks stood on a chair and looked around he saw nothing but rafters and beams it hadnt been converted for use at all next they opened the cistern and managed to get the side of the bath off but jameson had avoided those common hiding places which left the cellar banks never had liked cellars very much or any underground places for that matter he always expected to find something gruesome in them and he often had when he worked in london at their very best they were dark dank dirty and smelly places and this one was no exception the chill air gripped them as soon as they got down the winding steps and banks smelled mold and damp coal dust it must have been there for years he thought because the area was a smokefree zone now like most of the country thank the lord there was an electric light the first thing they saw was a bicycle lying in parts on the floor next to a workbench and a number of planks of wood leaning against the wall next to them hung a world war ii gas mask and helmet dark stained brick walls enclosed a number of smaller storage areas like the ones used for coal in the old days now they were empty the only thing of interest was jamesons workbench complete with vise and expensive toolbox on the bench lay a box of loose shot and a ripped and crumpled page from a magazine when banks rubbed his latexcovered index finger over the rough surface wood he could feel grains of powder he lifted up the finger and sniffed gunpowder there was a drawer under the bench and banks pulled it open inside among a random collection of screws nails electrical tape fuse wire and used sandpaper he found a halfempty box of ammunition for a mm handgun right ken he said i think weve got the bastard national trust or not time to call in the socos banks cadged a lift with blackstone back to millgarth where susan and hatchley were just about to take mrs gardiner home before returning to eastvale they had found out nothing more from her hatchley said as they stood at the doors ready to leave it seemed that jameson was a bit of a loner he had had no frequent visitors male or female and she had seen no one answering the vague description of his partner neither had the other neighbors according to the results of the housetohouse banks asked about pamela jeffreyss condition and was told there had been some improvement but that she was still in intensive care christ banks thought as he sat opposite blackstone it had been a long day he felt shagged out especially given his previous nights folly which seemed light years ago now he looked at his watch ten to six he wanted to go home but knew he might not be able to make it tonight depending on the developments of the next few hours at least he could go back to the hotel and have a long bath phone sandra listen to classic fm and read the army and probation officers reports on jameson while he waited around if nothing happened by say eight oclock then he would perhaps go back to eastvale for the night he slipped the reports into his briefcase and again decided to walk back to the hotel it was that twilight hour between the evening rushhour and goingoutonthetown time the city center was practically deserted the shops had closed workers had gone home and only a few people lingered in the few cafés and restaurants still open in the arcades and pedestrian precincts off vicar lane and briggate the sun had at last won its daylong battle with cloud it lay in proud gold pools on the dusty streets and pavements where last nights rain was a dim memory it cast black shadows that crept slowly up the sides of buildings it reflected harshly in shop windows and glittered on the specks of quartz embedded in stone surfaces back at the hotel he picked up his jacket which he had handed over to be mended before leaving for the vic there was one message for him please come to room as soon as you get back where you will find out some useful information it wasnt signed that was odd informers didnt usually operate this way they certainly didnt book rooms in hotels to pass along their information whos staying in room banks asked slipping his jacket on after the obligatory refusal to give out such information on the part of the clerk and the showing of a warrant card on the part of banks he discovered that the occupant of said room was a mr wilson very odd indeed it was a common enough name but banks couldnt remember offhand and mr wilson he was tempted to ignore the message and carry on with what he planned but curiosity got the better of him as it always did when the lift stopped at the fourth floor he poked his head through the doors first to see if there was anyone in the corridor it was empty he followed the arrow to room took a deep breath and knocked he debated whether to stand aside but decided it was only in american films that people shot holes through hotel doors still he found himself edging away a little so he couldnt be seen through the peephole the door opened abruptly banks tensed then let out his breath before him stood dirty dick burgess you again what the hell banks gasped but before he could even enter the room burgess had put on a leather jacket and taken him by the elbow about bloody time banks he said im sick of being cooped up in here theres been developments come on lets go get a drink chapter despite burgesss protest that it would be full of commercial travellers and visiting rugby teams banks insisted on their drinking in the holiday inns idea of a traditional english pub the wig and pen he did this because his car was nearby and he still held hopes of getting back to eastvale that evening as it turned out burgess seemed to take a shine to the place he sat at the table opposite banks with his pint of mcewans lager lit a tom thumb and looked around the quiet pub not bad he said tapping his cigar on the rim of the ashtray not bad at all i never did like those places with beams across the ceiling and bedpans on the walls bed warmers banks corrected him whatever anyway what do you think of those two over there as a couple of potential bed warmers do you think they fancy us banks looked over and saw two attractive women in their late twenties or early thirties who judging by their clothes had dropped by for a drink after working late at one of the many wellington street office buildings there was no doubt about it the one with the short black hair and the good legs did give burgess the eye and whisper something in her friends ear i think they do said burgess didnt you say something about developments what oh yes burgess looked away from the women and leaned forward lowering his voice for a start fraud squad think theyve found definite evidence in daniel cleggs books and records that clegg and rothwell were laundering money for martin churchill that hardly counts as a development banks said we were already working on that assumption ah but now its more than an assumption isnt it youve got to hand it to those fraud squad boys boring little fuckers that they are theyve been burning the candle at both ends on this one have you any idea why churchill would use a couple of provincials like rothwell and clegg good point said burgess as it happens yes i do know daniel clegg and martin churchill were at cambridge together reading law simple as that the old boy network id reckon the one knew the other was crooked right from the start did they keep in touch over the years obviously remember cleggs a tax lawyer hes been using st corona as a tax shelter for his clients for years it must have seemed a natural step to call on him when churchill needed expert help you can launder money from just about anywhere you know baby doc used a swiss lawyer and did a lot of his business in canada you can take it out or bring it into heathrow or gatwick by the suitcaseload using couriers or you can run it through foreign exchange wire services whatever governments keep coming up with new restrictive measures but its like plugging holes in a sieve its easy if you know how and a tax lawyer and a financial consultant with a strong background in accounting certainly knew how what made clegg choose rothwell as his partner how would i know you cant expect me to do your job for you banks now can you but they clearly knew one another somehow clegg must have known that rothwell was exceptionally good with finances and none too concerned about their source takes one to know one as they say burgess looked over at the two women who had got another round of drinks and smiled the blackhaired one crossed her long legs and smiled back shyly the other put her hand over her mouth and giggled my lucky night i think burgess said clapping his hands and showering cigar ash over his stomach he had a disconcerting habit of sitting still for ages then making a sudden jerky movement ill say one thing for the north he went on youve got some damned accommodating women up here damned accommodating look why dont you get a couple more pints in then ill tell you something else that might interest you and mines lager remember not that pissy real ale stuff banks thought about it two pints yes he would be fine for driving back to eastvale if he got the chance all right he said and went to the bar okay said burgess after his first sip the two men the white one and the darkie who were following you around banks lit a cigarette you know who they are ive got to admit i wasnt entirely truthful with you last time we met when have you ever been unfair so you knew who they were last time we talked suspected now weve got confirmation theyre mickey lanois and gregory jackson two of churchills top enforcers they came into heathrow last friday the way it looks is that churchill asked clegg to get rid of rothwell and after he did it he took off with a lot of money probably figuring that he might be next churchill heard about cleggs scarpering pretty quickly and sent his goons to do some damage control you know what their favorite torture is banks banks shook his head he didnt want to know but he knew burgess would tell him anyway they get a handful of those little glass tubes the doctors use to keep liquid in what do you call them vials right really thin glass anyway and they put them in the victims mouth lots of them then they tape the mouth shut securely and beat him a bit about the face or her churchill himself thought that up he likes to watch think about it banks thought swallowed and felt his throat constrict been letting you practice it at the yard have they he asked burgess laughed no not yet theyre still running tests in belfast anyway the point is that we know who they are no thats not entirely the point said banks the point is where are they now and what are you going to do about them burgess shook his head thats a whole different ball game were talking about international politics here politically sensitive issues its out of your hands banks accept that all you need to know is that we know who they are and were keeping tabs dont give me that politically sensitive crap said banks stabbing out his cigarette so hard that sparks flew out of the ashtray these two men damn near killed a woman here a few days ago you say they like to go around stuffing peoples mouths full of glass then you tell me to trust you youre keeping tabs well bollocks thats what i say burgess sighed somehow i knew you were going to be difficult banks i just knew it cant you leave it be they wont get away with it dont worry do you know where they are now they wont get away with it burgess repeated banks took a sip of his beer and held back his rage there was something in burgesss tone that hinted he had something up his sleeve what are you telling me banks asked that well get them or somebody will but theyll go down quietly no fuss no publicity banks thought for a moment he still didnt trust burgess can i talk to them he asked aware he was speaking through clenched teeth still keeping his anger in check burgess narrowed his eyes got to you did it what they did to the girl ive seen pictures of her before and after nasty ill bet you fancied her didnt you banks nice dusky piece of crumpet touch of the tarbrush probably knew a lot of those kama sutra tricks just your type tasty banks felt his hand tighten on the pint glass why did he always let burgess get to him this way the bastard had a knack of touching on exactly the right raw nerve did it every time id just like to be there when you question them thats all he said quietly burgess shrugged no problem if its possible ill arrange it all im saying is no publicity on the churchill matter okay let your liberal humanist sentiments fuck this one up and youll be in deep doodoo banks very deep doodoo indeed what about the press they can be dealt with have you ever considered that for every scandal you read about how many you dont do you think its all left to chance dont be so bloody naïve come off it you might be able to tape a few mouths shut but even you cant guarantee that no hotshot investigative reporters arent going to be all over this one like flies around shit burgess shrugged maybe theyll hear churchills been killed in a coup maybe theyll even see the body maybe itd be best for everyone if he did get killed in a coup less embarrassing all round burgess remained silent for a moment glass in hand then he said slowly and maybe hes got life insurance well i suppose youd know lets hope theres a good plastic surgeon on st corona look burgess said lets stop pissing around what i want from you is a promise that you wont talk to the press about the churchill angle banks lit another cigarette what could he do if burgess were telling the truth mickey lanois and gregory jackson would be caught and punished for their crimes he could live with that he would have to burgess certainly had a better chance of catching them than banks did by the sound of things perhaps they were even in custody already also with luck arthur jameson and his accomplice would go down for the murder of keith rothwell but was burgess telling the full truth banks didnt know all he knew was that he couldnt trust the bastard it all sounded too easy but what choice did he have all right he said burgess reached over and patted his arm good he said good i knew i could depend on you to keep shut when it counts banks jerked his arm away dont push it and if i find out youve been buggering me around on this one my promise is null and void okay burgess held up his hands in mock surrender okay okay there is another thing whats that rothwells killers lanois and jackson didnt do that burgess shook his head im not interested in them theyre not in my brief so what happens when we catch jameson if we catch him jameson arthur jameson one of rothwells killers i dont give a monkeys toss thats up to you im not interested its unlikely that this jameson whoever he is knows anything about churchills part in the matter he was probably just a hired killer working for clegg who has conveniently disappeared with a shitload of cash any ideas where burgess shook his head then jabbed his finger in the air close to bankss chest but i can tell you one thing wherever he is he wont be there for long churchill has the memory of an elephant the reach of a giraffe and the tenacity of a bloody pit bull he didnt get to bleed an entire country dry for nothing it takes a special talent dont underestimate the man just because hes a butcher so we write off clegg i think hes already written himself off by doublecrossing churchill and jameson if he goes to trial and if he talks both big ifs by the way all he can say is that clegg hired him to kill rothwell i doubt that clegg would tell him the real reason he might be a crooked lawyer but im sure he still knows the value of confidentiality he wouldnt want to let his hired killers know exactly how much money was involved would he it would make him too vulnerable by half anyway i trust youll have enough physical evidence to prosecute this jameson when the time comes if not maybe we can fabricate some for you always happy to oblige he held his hand up only kidding my little joke burgess glanced over at the two women who had got yet another round of drinks and seemed to be laughing quite tipsily look he said if i dont strike soon theyll be past it are you sure you wont join me itll be a laugh and the wife need never know no said banks no thanks im going home suit yourself burgess stretched back his shoulders and sucked in his gut anything to liven up a miserable evening in leeds he said once more unto the breach and with that he strutted over to their table smiling pint in hand banks watched them make room for him then shook his head drank up and left what on earth happened to you asked sandra when banks walked into the living room at about ten oclock that evening i had a slight disagreement with a couple of wouldbe muggers banks said dont worry im okay and he left it at that sandra raised her dark eyebrows but didnt pursue it he knew she wouldnt she wasnt the mothering type and she rarely gave him much sympathy when he whimpered through flu or moaned through a bad cold banks walked over to the cocktail cabinet and poured a stiff shot of laphroaig single malt whisky sandra said shed have a drambuie a good sign after that he put on his new cd of khachaturians piano concerto and flopped onto the sofa as he listened to the music he looked at sandras framed photograph over the fireplace a misty sunset in hawes taken from the daleside above the town all subdued gray and orange with a couple of thin streaks of vermilion the unusual church tower square with a turret attached to one corner dominated the gray slate roofs and smoke curled up from some of the chimneys banks sipped the peaty malt whisky and smacked his lips sandra sat beside him what are you thinking she asked banks told her about his meetings with dirty dick burgess theres always some sort of hidden agenda with him he said im not sure what hes up to this time but theres not a hell of a lot i can do about it except wait and see thats about all we can do now wait they also serve i was thinking about the rothwells on the drive home too how could a man lead an entire other life away from his family under another name is that what happened yes banks explained about robert calvert and his flat in leeds his fondness for gambling women and dancing and pamela jeffreys said she was sure he wasnt a married man she said shed have been able to tell did she whos pamela jeffreys his girlfriend it doesnt matter sandra sipped her drink and thought it over its probably not as difficult as you think for two people who live together on the surface to lead completely separate lives one unknown to the other lord knows so many couples have drifted so far apart anyway that they dont communicate anymore banks felt his chest tighten are you talking about us he asked remembering what ken blackstone had said about his marriage is that what you think i dont know sandra shrugged i dont know either it was just a comment but if the cap fits think about it alan the amount we see each other talk to each other we could both be living other lives mostly we just meet in passing lets face it you could be up to anything most of the time how would i know most of the time im working just like this rothwell was thats different he was away a lot what about the last couple of nights you didnt phone did you banks sat forward oh come on i tried you werent home you could have left a message on the machine you know how i hate those things anyway its not as if you didnt know where i was you could easily have checked up on me and its not that often im away from home for a night or more secret lives dont always have to be lived at night this is ridiculous is it probably all im saying is we dont talk enough to know banks slumped back and sipped his drink i suppose so he said is it my fault you always seemed to handle my absences so well before you understand the job better than any other coppers wife ive met i dont know sandra said maybe it just took longer for the strain to work its way through or maybe its just worse because im busy a lot now too he put his arm around her i dont know whats been happening to us lately either he said but maybe well go away when this is all over he felt sandra stiffen beside him promises she said youve been saying that for years have i you know you have we havent had a bloody holiday since we moved to eastvale well dust off your camera ive got a bit of leave due and i might just surprise you this time how long do you think the case will last hard to say there you are then he stroked her shoulder tell me youll think about it ill think about it tracy comes back on sunday i know wont you be pleased to see her will you even be around to meet her at the airport of course i will sandra relaxed a little and moved closer a very good sign the drambuie was clearly working youd better she said she phoned earlier tonight she sends her love hows she getting on sandra laughed she said its not quite like a year in provence down there but she likes it anyway she hasnt bumped into john thaw yet who john thaw you know the actor who was in a year in provence on television i liked him better as morse who she elbowed him in the ribs you know quite well who im talking about i know you liked morse he used to be in the sweeney too years ago and you used to watch that down in london remember in your old macho days didnt you even go drinking with him once what do you mean old banks flexed his biceps sandra laughed and moved closer i dont want to fight she said honest i dont not since weve seen so little of one another me neither said banks i just think weve got a few problems to deal with thats all we need to communicate better and we will how about a truce he tightened his arm around her shoulder mmm all right ill have to call the station and see if theres been any developments he said but he didnt move he felt too comfortable his limbs felt pleasantly heavy and weary and the warmth of the malt whisky flowed through his veins the slow second movement started in its haunting erotic way soon the eerie flexatone entered and sent shivers up and down his spine a cheap effect perhaps but sometimes effective if you happened to be in the right mood banks drained his glass and put it on the table by the sofa sandra let her head rest between his shoulder and chest definitely a good sign remember that silly film we saw on tv a while back he said the one where the couple has sex listening to ravels bolero hmm its called dudley moore and bo derek and i dont think they were really listening more like using it as background music well ive never really liked bolero its far too ordered and mechanical its got a kind of inevitability about it thats too predictable for my taste ive always thought this khachaturian piece would be a lot better to make love to much better wanders all over the place you never really know where its going next slow and dreamy at the start with plenty of great climaxes later on sounds good to me have you ever tried it no sandra moved her head up until she was facing him her lips about two inches away he swept back a strand of hair from her cheek and let his fingers rest on her cool skin i thought you had to call the station she said later he said stroking her cheek later are the curtains closed boredom they never told you about that down at the recruitment drives thought pc grant everett as he rolled down the window of the patrol car and lit a cigarette his partner pc barry miller was good about the smoking he didnt indulge himself but he understood grants need to light up every now and then especially on a quiet night like this one they were parked in a layby between princes risborough and high wycombe to the south through the rearview mirror grant could see the faint glow of the nearest town while to the north only isolated lights twinkled from scattered farms and cottages all around them spread the dark rolling landscape of the chilterns it was an attractive spot on a nice day especially in spring with the bluebells and cherry blossoms out but in the dark it seemed somehow forbidding inhospitable a light breeze swirled the smoke out of the car grant inhaled deeply it had just stopped raining and he loved the way the scent of rain seemed to blend with the tobacco and make it taste so much better it was at moments like this when he understood why he smoked despite all the health warnings on the other hand he never quite understood it when he got up after a nights chainsmoking in the pub and coughed his guts up for half an hour next to him barry was munching on a mars bar grant smiled to himself six foot two and sixteen stone already and the silly bugger still needed to feed his face with chocolate bars who am i to talk grant thought sucking on his cigarette again to each his own poison grant felt sleepy and the cigarette helped keep him awake he had never got used to shift work his biological rhythms or whatever they were had never adapted when he lay down his head in the morning as the neighbors kids were going to school the postman was doing his rounds and everyone else was off to work he could never get to sleep especially if the sun were shining and then there was janet bless her soul doing her best trying hard to be as quiet as she could around the house and sarah only six months crying for feeding and nappychanging and the bills to pay and christ he wasnt going to think about that at least the job got him out of the house away from all that for a while a lorry rumbled by grant flicked the stub of his cigarette out of the window and heard it sizzle as it hit a puddle occasionally voices cut through the static on the police radio but the messages werent for them shall we belt up and bugger off then said barry he screwed up the wrapper of his mars bar and put it in his pocket ever the careful one grant thought with an affectionate smile wouldnt even be caught littering wouldnt barry might as well grant reached for his belt then they heard the squealing sound of rubber on wet tarmac what the fuck was that on the main road a northbound car skidded as it turned the bend too fast then righted itself shall we said barry my pleasure grant loved it when the lights were flashing and the siren screaming first he was pushed back in the seat by the force when he put his foot down and then he felt as if he were taking off seeming somehow to be magically freed from all the restraints of the road not just the manmade rules but the laws of nature sometimes grant even felt as if they were really taking off wheels no longer on the ground but there was no chase to be had here it was over before it began the car was about two hundred yards ahead of them when its driver seemed to realize they meant business he slowed down as they caught up and pulled over to the side of the road spraying up water from the hedgerow his numberplate was too muddy to read grant pulled up behind him and barry got out to approach the car it wasnt likely to be much grant thought as he sniffed the fresh night air through the open window maybe a drunk maybe a few outstanding parking tickets but at least it was something to relieve the boredom for a few minutes he could hear perfectly clearly when barry asked the driver to turn off his ignition and present his driving documents the driver did as he was told barry looked at the papers and passed them back next he asked the man if he had been drinking grant couldnt hear the mans reply but it seemed to satisfy barry grant knew he would be listening for slurred words and sniffing for booze on the drivers breath after that barry asked the man where he had been and where he was going grant thought he heard the man mention princes risborough no other cars passed the night was quiet and grant caught a whiff of beech leaves and cherry wood on the damp air he thought he heard some cows low in the distance and farther still a nightingale then barry asked the man to get out of the car and clean off his numberplate grant heard him explain patiently that it was an offense to drive with a numberplate that is not easily distinguishable and smiled to himself at the stilted textbook phrase but the man would get off with a caution this time barry seemed satisfied with his behavior the man got back in the car and grant heard barry speak over his personal radio to control go ahead ten nine vehicle check please the voices crackled unnaturally over the country night air pass your number mike four three seven tango zulu delta stand by grant knew it would take three or four minutes for the operator to check the number on the computer then all being well they could be on their way barry and the driver seemed to be chatting amiably enough as they waited grant looked at the newly cleaned numberplate and reached idly for the briefingsheet beside him there seemed to be something familiar about it something he ought to remember he ran his finger down the list of stolen cars no not there he wouldnt remember any of those numbers there were always too many of them it had to be something more important a vehicle used in a robbery perhaps then he found it m tzd gray granada suddenly he felt cold the owner was wanted in connection with a murder in north yorkshire possibly armed and dangerous shit all of a sudden barry seemed to be taking a hell of a long time out there a number of thoughts passed quickly through grants mind the first of which was regret that they didnt do things the american way get the guy out of the vehicle hands stretched on the roof legs apart pat him down assume the position asshole why pretend they were still living in a peaceful society where the local bobby was your best friend christ how grant wished he had a gun should he go out and try to get barry to the car use some excuse he could say theyd been called to an emergency could he trust himself to walk without stumbling to speak without stuttering his legs felt like jelly and his throat was tight but he felt so impotent just watching all he could hope was that the radio operator would understand barrys predicament and give the guy a clean bill of health according to the information on the sheet the man arthur jameson didnt even know he was wanted the radio crackled back into life control to go ahead over er mike four three seven tango zulu delta no reports stolen er do you require keeper details over affirmative more static grant tensed in his seat hand on the doorhandle too many pauses keeper is arthur jameson bridgeport avenue leeds er is keeper with you over affirmative any problem she was blowing it grant sensed someone probably the super was standing over her trying to help her calmly get barry back to the car and the driver on his way but she was nervous halting it was all taking far too long and if the suspect couldnt sense there was something wrong over the radio then he was an idiot no reports stolen you already told me that love said barry is something wrong sorry er stand by grant tightened his grip on the doorhandle this was it he wasnt going to stand around and let his partner who had probably dozed off at the briefing and to whom the number obviously meant buggerall just stand there and take it but before he got the door half open he saw barry all sixteen stone and six foot two of him drop to the wet road clutching the side of his neck from which a dark spray of blood fountained high and arced to the ground then he heard the shots two dull cracks echoing through the dark countryside left foot still in the car right foot on the road grant hesitated mistake his last thought was that it was so bloody unfair and pointless and miserable to die like this by a roadside outside high wycombe then a bullet shattered the windscreen and took him full in the face scattering blood teeth and bone fragments all over the car after its echo had faded the granada revved up and sped off into the night and the nightingale sang again into the vacuum of silence the car left behind chapter the sky was a sheet of gray shale smeared here and there by dirty rags of cloud fluttering over the wooded hillsides on a cool wind rooks and crows gathered noisily in the roadside trees like shards of darkness refusing to dispel even the green of the dense beech forests looked black banks and sergeant hatchley who had driven through the night at breakneck speed from eastvale stood and looked in silence at the patrol car with the shattered windscreen and at the outline of the body on the tarmac about six or seven feet ahead near which dark blood had coagulated in shallow puddles on the road surface close by detective superintendent jarrell from the thames valley police paced up and down shabby beige raincoat flapping around his legs the road had been cordoned off and several patrol cars lights circling like demented lighthouses guarded the edges of the scene where the socos still worked local traffic had been diverted it was a cockup superintendent jarrell growled glaring at the two men from yorkshire the minute they got out of bankss cortina and walked over to him a monumental cockup jarrell was clearly looking for somewhere to place the blame and it irritated the hell out of him that no matter how hard he tried it fell squarely on his own shoulders the two pcs might have made a mistake in not tattooing the granada s number on their memories and the radio operator had certainly screwed up royally but in the police force as in other hierarchical structures when an underling screws up the responsibility goes to the top you dont blame the footsoldiers you blame the general and everybody gets a good bollocking from the top down banks knew that ken blackstone at west yorkshire had followed correct procedure in getting a photograph description and details about arthur jameson out to all divisions and the point he had most emphasized was may be armed observe only under no circumstances attempt to apprehend jarrells was one of those unfortunate faces in which the individual features fail to harmonize long nose small beady eyes bushy brows a thin slit of a mouth prominent cheekbones receding chin mottled complexion somehow though it didnt dissolve into total chaos there was an underlying unity about the man himself that like a magnetic field drew it all together any update on the injured officer sir banks asked what oh jarrell stopped pacing for a moment and faced banks he had an erect military bearing suddenly the fury seemed to bleed out of him like air from a tire miller was killed outright as you know he gestured at the outline and the surrounding stained tarmac with his whole arm as if indicating a cornucopia theres about seven pints of his blood here everett s still hanging on just the bullet went in through his upper lip just under the nose and it seems to have been slowed down or deflected by cartilage and bone anyway it didnt get a chance to do serious brain damage so the doc says hes got a good chance bloody fool if you dont mind my saying so sir banks said it looks like they got into a situation they couldnt get out of we had no reason to think jameson knew we were onto him nor had we any reason to think he was a likely spree killer we want him for a job he was hired to do coldbloodedly he must have panicked i know it doesnt help the situation sir but the men were inexperienced i doubt theyd handled much but traffic duty had they jarrell ran his hand through his hair youre right of course they pulled him over on a routine traffic check when miller called in the vehicle number the radio operator called the senior officer on the shift he tried to talk her through it calmly but hell she was new to the job she was scared to death it wasnt her fault banks nodded and rubbed his eyes beside him hatchleys gaze seemed fixed on the bloody tarmac when banks had got the call close to two am his first night at home in days he had first thought of taking susan gay then not without malice entirely though affectionate malice he had decided that it was time sergeant hatchley got his feet wet he knew how hatchley loved his sleep consequently they hadnt said much on the way down banks had played mitsuko uchidas live versions of the mozart piano sonatas and hatchley had seemed content to doze in the passenger seat snoring occasionally most chief inspectors banks knew would have had someone else drive but he was using his own car the old cortina no longer produced now and practically an antique and damn it he liked driving it himself seen enough here jarrell asked i think so me too lets go jarrell drove them down the road believe it or not he said this is very pretty countryside under the right circumstances about a mile along the road toward princes risborough jarrell turned left onto a muddy farm track and bumped along until they got to a gate on the right where he pulled up a hedgerow interspersed with hawthorns shielded the field and its fence from view cows mooed in the next field the gate stood open and as banks and hatchley followed jarrell through they both sank almost to their ankles in mud too late banks realized he hadnt brought the right gear he should have known to bring the wellingtons he always carried in the boot of his car like most policemen he took pride in keeping his shoes well polished now they were covered in mud and probably worse judging by the prevalence of cows he cursed and jarrell laughed hatchley stood holding onto the gatepost trying to wipe most of it off on the few tufts of grass there banks looked at the muddy field dotted with cowpats and didnt bother theyd only get dirty again in the field a group of men in white boiler suits and black wellington boots worked around a car that stood bogged down in the mud with its doors open the air was sharp with the tang of cowclap one of the men had propped a radio on a stone by the hedgerow and it was tuned to the local breakfast show at the moment featuring a golden oldie cilla black singing anyone who had a heart one of the socos sang along with it as he worked the cows mooed even louder demonstrating remarkably good taste banks thought they werent so far away after all they were in fact all lying down in a group just across the field cows lying down that meant it was going to rain his mother always said but it had rained already did that mean theyd been in the same position for hours that it was going to rain again giving up on folk wisdom banks turned instead to look at the abandoned granada the bottom of its chassis streaked with mud and cowshit it had been found jarrell said just over an hour ago while banks and hatchley had been in transit anything jarrell shouted over to the team one of the men in white shook his head nothing but the usual rubbish sir he said sweet wrappers old road maps that sort of thing he must have taken everything of use or value no sign of any weapons jarrell grunted and turned away hed hardly have left his guns would he said banks not now hes officially on the run id guess he probably had a rucksack or something with him in the car look sir you know the landscape around here better than i do if you were him where would you go jarrell looked up at the louring sky for a moment as if for inspiration then rubbed at the inside corner of his right eye with his index finger he has a couple of choices he said either head immediately for the nearest town get to london and take the first boat or plane out of the country or simply lie low he pointed toward the hills a man could hide himself there for a good while if he knew how to survive wed better cover both possibilities banks said hes spent time in the army so hes probably been on survival courses and if he heads for london hell likely know someone who can help him whatever he does id say hell most likely go across country first said jarrell hed be smart enough to know that stealing a car or walking by the roadside would be too risky he looked at his watch the shooting occurred at about half past twelve its half past six now that gives him a sixhour start how far could he get do you reckon id give him about three miles an hour in this terrain under these conditions jarrell went on maybe a bit less wheres the nearest station thats the problem said jarrell slowly this is close to prime commuter country theres princes risborough saunderton and high wycombe on the chiltern line all nearby if he heads east he can get to the northampton line at tring berkhamsted or hemel hempstead if he heads for amersham he can even get on the underground the metropolitan line unfortunately for us theres no shortage of trains to london around here and they start running early lets say hes managed about sixteen or seventeen miles said banks whats his best bet probably the chiltern line plenty of trains and an easy connection with the underground he could even be in london by now they started walking back to the car i can tell you one thing said banks wherever he is his shoes will be bloody muddy if if if such were bankss thoughts as he followed superintendent jarrell into jamesons rented cottage an hour or so later if everett and miller hadnt stopped jameson last night if jameson hadnt panicked and shot them if in an ideal world they would have tracked jameson to this cottage through a check stub or a circled address in an accommodation guide quietly they would have surrounded the place when they were certain jameson was inside then arrested him perhaps as he walked out to his car unsuspecting without a shot being fired for he hadnt known that was the stinger he hadnt known they were after him now though things were different now he was a dangerous man on the run as it turned out they discovered that jameson was renting a cottage just to the east of princes risborough through an aylesbury estate agent shortly after the office opened at eightthirty that friday morning policemen were showing jamesons photograph around and asking the same questions in every estate agents hotel and bed and breakfast establishment in buckinghamshire and the pair of dcs given the aylesbury estate agents just happened to get lucky like everett and miller got unlucky swings and roundabouts that was often the way things happened jameson had simply driven off from leeds on his holidays being a lover of nature he had headed for the countryside why the chilterns it was anyones guess it could just as easily have been the cotswolds or the malverns banks supposed according to the estate agent the man had simply dropped in one afternoon and asked after rental cottages in the area he had paid a cash deposit and moved in there was no need for subterfuge or secrecy arthur jameson had nothing to fear from anyone or he wouldnt have had were it not for a weakness for pornography a fleeting contact with daniel cleggs estranged wife melissa and sergeant hatchleys network of informers he had either been careless about the wadding or he thought it was a joke they didnt know which yet it hadnt shown up as a trademark in any other jobs over the past few years last night he had probably gone into high wycombe for a bite to eat lingered over his dessert and coffee maybe celebrated his newfound wealth with a large cognac then headed back for the rented cottage taking the bend a little too fast the cottage was certainly isolated it stood just off a winding lane about two miles long opposite a small perfectly rounded tor the lane carried on passed another farmhouse about a mile further on then meandered back to the main road from the mud on the floor it looked very much as if jameson had been there after the shooting a bit of a risk maybe but the cottage wasnt far from his abandoned car in the kitchen yesterdays lunch dishes soaked in cold water and breadcrumbs cheese shavings and tiny florets of yellowed broccoli dotted the counter in the living room jameson had left the contents of his suitcase strewn around including a number of local wildlife guides beside a girlie magazine on the table hatchley picked up the magazine and flipped through it quickly tilting the centerfold to get a better look then they all followed the mud trail upstairs at the bottom of the wardrobe hardly hidden at all by the spare blankets jameson had obviously used to cover them lay a twelvegauge shotgun wrapped in an oilstained cloth and a small canvas bag carefully banks leaned forward and opened the flap of the bag with the tip of a biro it was empty but on the floor by the blankets lay a few used tenpound notes banks visualized the hunted man hurriedly stuffing the notes into his pockets until they spilled over on the floor the shotgun was obviously too big and awkward for him to take with him but he was still armed with the handgun banks pointed to the shotgun and the canvas bag can we get this stuff to your lab he asked jarrell that shotguns probably evidence in a murder case jarrell nodded no problem as hatchley bent to pick up the shotgun careful to handle only the material it was wrapped in and as banks reached for the canvas bag a message for jarrell crackled through on his personal radio jarrell here over hq sir subject arthur jameson spotted at aylesbury railway station at nine fiftythree am subject bought london ticket now standing on platform locals await instructions over has he spotted them they say not sir tell them to keep their distance jarrell looked at his watch it was ten oclock whens the next train he asked twelve minutes past ten sir which route marylebone via amersham thank you stand by jarrell turned to banks and hatchley we can pick up that train at great missenden or amersham if you want he said banks looked first at hatchley then back at jarrell come on then he said lets do it banks and hatchley boarded the train separately at amersham at ten thirtytwo reluctantly superintendent jarrell being the local man had agreed to stay behind and coordinate the thames valley end of the operation neither banks nor hatchley looked much like a policeman that morning waking miserably to the middleofthenight phone call banks had put on jeans a light cotton shirt and a tan sports jacket over this he had thrown on his columbo raincoat even though he had done his best to clean the mud off his shoes with a damp rag it still showed sergeant hatchley wore his shiny blue suit white shirt and no tie he looked as if he had been dragged through a hedge backward but there was nothing unusual in that they had been told by the transport police who had spotted jameson that the suspect still resembled his photograph except that he had about two days growth around his chin and cheeks he looked like a rambler he was wearing gray trousers of some light material tucked into walking boots at the ankles a green openneck shirt and an orange anorak nice of him banks thought dressing so easy to spot he was also carrying a heavy rucksack which no doubt held his gun and money amongst other things the train rattled out of the station banks managed to find a seat next to a young woman who smiled at him briefly as he sat down then went back to reading her copy of pc magazine banks had his battered brown leather briefcase with him and its chief contents were his omnibus paperback copy of waughs sword of honour and his walkman he opened the book at the marker and started to read but every so often he glanced at the man in the green shortsleeve shirt who sat about four seats down over to his left the rucksack and the orange anorak lay on the luggage rack above the train moved in a comforting rhythm but banks couldnt help feeling tense he left the walkman in his briefcase because he was too distracted to listen to music they could probably take jameson right now he thought he and jim hatchley just approach quietly from behind like anyone going to the toilet and grab an arm each the gun surely was up in the rucksack on the luggage rack but it wasnt worth the risk something could go wrong jameson could hold the entire coach hostage it didnt bear thinking about this way was far safer and would with a little patience skill and luck guarantee success banks and hatchley had got on the train simply to keep an eye on jameson at the station superintendent jarrell had talked to the yard who promised that there would be a number of plainclothes officers waiting at marylebone mixed in with the crowds these men were experts at surveillance and they would keep jameson in sight no matter how he travelled without being spotted until he arrived at his final destination be it hotel or house some were posing as taxidrivers and with luck jameson would get into one of their cabs banks had every intention of trying to keep up with the chase but it was comforting to know that if he lost sight of jameson someone else would have him there were plainclothes officers at all the stops on the way too in case he got off but jameson had bought a ticket for london and it was almost certain that was where he was heading given his past he would likely know someone there who could help get him out of the country what banks hoped and this was one of the main reasons for letting their quarry go to ground was that jameson would lead them to his accomplice in the rothwell murder as the train rattled out of rickmansworth jameson got up and walked past banks on his way to the toilet banks looked down at his book not registering the words his eyes passed over while jameson was gone he stared at the khaki rucksack and held himself back how easy it would be he thought just to take it then grab jameson when he came back but he had to keep thinking like a policeman not give in to the maverick instinct however strong this way with a little patience the catch might be bigger and there was another reason the gun might not be in the rucksack jamesons trousers were of the bulky manypocketed kind favored by ramblers banks had glanced quickly as he went by and hadnt been able to discern the weight or outline of a gun but it could be there and there were too many civilians present to make the risk worthwhile best wait he thought of how much money there might be in the rucksack and smiled at how ironic it would be if someone snatched it while jameson was having a piss jameson came back they passed harrow and entered a landscape of factory yards piles of tires and orange oil drums pallets warehouses schoolyards full of screaming kids bleak housing estates concrete overpasses before long the people in the carriage were standing up to get their jackets and bags as the train rumbled slowly into marylebone station all anxious to be first off banks spotted hatchley ahead of him his head above most people in the crowd that shuffled through the ticket gate jameson had his anorak on now and was easy to keep in sight banks noticed him look around and lick his lips every now and then sad cruel puppydog eyes scanning the station forecourt but there was nothing to see nothing out of the ordinary the uniformed transport police went about their business as usual people leafed through magazines at the bookstall or headed for the buffet checked the schedule displays ran for trains carts of luggage and mail threaded in and out of the crowds announcements about forthcoming departures came over the publicaddress system in the usual monotone echoing from the roof where pigeons nested to banks the station smelled of diesel oil and soot though the age of steam was long gone jameson made his way through the exit and managed to get a taxi that was their first stroke of good fortune if things went according to plan the driver would be a dc if not then a taxi crawling through london traffic was easy enough for even a onelegged septuagenarian on foot to follow banks opened the door of the next taxi hatchley beside him now banks was dying to jump in and say follow that taxi but the driver didnt want to let them in he leaned over and tried to pull the door shut holding up a police id card sorry mate he said police business theres another one behind just in time banks managed to get his own card out snap he said now open the fucking door sorry sir said the driver eyes on the road following jamesons cab through the thick traffic on marylebone road i wasnt to know they never said to expect a dci jumping in the cab forget it said banks im assuming its one of your men driving in the taxi ahead yes sir dc formby hes a good bloke dont worry were not going to lose the bastard with excruciating slowness the taxis edged their way south toward kensington along the busy high street and down a side street of five or sixstory white buildings with black metal railings at the front jamesons taxi stopped outside one that announced itself a hotel on the smoked glass over the huge shiny black doors across the street came the sound of drilling where workmen stood on scaffolding renovating the building opposite the air was dry with drifting stone dust and thick with exhaust fumes jameson got out looked around quickly and went into the hotel his taxi drove off right said banks looks like weve run the bastard to earth now we wait for the reinforcements for gray the hotel manager could have given john major a good run for his money his suit was gray his hair was gray his voice was gray he also had one of those faces receding chin goofy teeth stickout ears that attract such abusive and bullying attention at school at the moment his face was gray too he reminded banks of parkinson a rather unpleasant largenosed boy who had been the butt of ridicule and recipient of the occasional thump in the fourth form banks had always felt sorry for parkinson had even defended him once or twice until he had met him later in life fully transformed into a selfserving arrogant and humorless labour mp then he felt parkinson probably hadnt been thumped enough the manager had obviously never seen so many roughlooking badly dressed coppers gathered in one place since they stopped showing repeats of the sweeney jeans abounded as did leather jackets anoraks blousons tshirts and grubby trainers there wasnt a uniform a tie or a wellpolished shoe in sight and the only suit was sergeant hatchleys blue polyester one which was so shiny you could see your face in it it was also obvious that a number of the officers were armed and that two of them wore bulletproof vests over their tshirts short of the sas police support units or half a dozen armed response vehicles none of which the police authorities wanted the public to see mounting a major offensive on a quiet kensington hotel on a thursday lunchtime these two were probably the best you could get vest one the tallest was called spike probably because of his hair and his smaller more hirsute associate was called shandy spike was doing all the talking see squire he said to the wideeyed hotel manager our boss tells us we dont want a lot of fuss about this none of this evacuating the area bollocks you see on telly we go in we disarm him nice and quiet then bobs your uncle were out of your hair for good okay no problems for us and no bad publicity for the hotel the manager clearly not used to being called squire swallowed bobbing an oversize adams apple and nodded but what we do need to do spike went on is to clear the floor now is there anyone else up there apart from this jameson the manager looked at the keys only room he said its lunchtime people usually go out for lunch what about the chambermaids finished good said spike then turned to one of the others in trainers jeans and leather jacket smiffy go get number out quietly okay right boss said smiffy and headed for the stairs spike tapped his long fingers on the desk and turned to banks you know this bloke this jameson right sir he said banks was surprised he had remembered the honorific not personally he said and filled spike in hes shot a policeman right yes two of them ones dead and the others still in the operating room waiting to find out if hes got a brain left spike slipped a stick of wrigleys spearmint gum from its wrapper and popped it in his mouth what do you suggest he asked between chews banks didnt know if spike was being polite or deferential in asking an opinion but he didnt get a chance to find out as smiffy came down the stairs with a rather dazed old dear clutching a pink dressinggown around her throat the phone rang at the desk the manager answered it turned even more gray as he listened then said yes sir of course sir at once sir well spike asked when the manager had put the phone down whats put the wind up you it was him the man in room whats he want he wants a roast beef sandwich and a bottle of beer sent up to his room howd he sound sound yeah you know did he seem suspicious nervous oh no just ordinary right on said spike grinning at banks opportunity knocks he turned back to the manager do the doors up there have those peephole things so you can see whos knocking no chains yes no problem right said spike come with me shandy the rest of you stay here and make sure no one gets in or out we got the back covered yes sir one of the blousons answered fire escape that too sir good spike looked at banks i dont suppose youre armed banks shook his head no time spike frowned better stay down here then sir sorry but i cant take the responsibility you probably know the rules better than i do banks nodded he gave spike and shandy a floors start then turned to sergeant hatchley stay here jim he said i dont want to lead you astray without waiting for an answer he slipped into the stairwell one of the yard men in the lobby noticed but made no move to stop him at the firstfloor landing banks heard someone wheezing behind him and turned dont worry im not deaf said hatchley i just thought you might like some company anyway banks grinned mind if i ask you what were doing this for hatchley whispered as they climbed the next flight to find out what happens said banks ive got a funny feeling about this something spike said you know what curiosity did they reached the third floor banks peeked around the stairwell and put his arm out to hold hatchley back glancing again banks saw spike point at his watch and mouth something to shandy shandy nodded they drew their weapons and walked slowly along the corridor toward jamesons room the worn carpet that covered the floor couldnt stop the old boards creaking with each footstep banks saw spike knock on the door and heard a muffled grunt from inside room service said spike the door rattled open on a chain by the sound of it someone spike or jameson swore loudly then banks saw shandy rear back like a wild horse and kick the door open the chain snapped spike and shandy charged inside and banks heard two shots in close succession then after a pause of three or four seconds another shot not quite as loud banks and hatchley waited where they were for a minute out of sight then when banks saw spike come out of the room and lean against the doorjamb he and hatchley walked into the corridor spike saw them coming and said its all over you can go in now if you like silly bugger had to try it on didnt he they walked into the room banks could smell cordite from the gunfire jameson had fallen backward against the wall and slid down into a perfect sitting position on the floor legs splayed leaving a thick red snails trail of blood smeared on the wallpaper his puppydog eyes were open his face bore no expression the front of his green shirt over the heart was a tangle of dark red rag and tissue spreading fast and there was a similar stain slightly above it near his shoulder his hands lay at his side one of them holding his gun another dark wet patch spread between his legs urine banks thought of the chair at arkbeck farm where this man had scared alison rothwell so much that she had wet herself jesus christ he whispered wed no choice spike said behind him he had his gun in his hand when he came to the door you can see for yourself he fired first two shots in close succession followed by another sounding slightly different two patches of spreading blood our boss tells us we dont want a lot of fuss about this banks looked at the two policemen sighed and said give my regards to dirty dick shandy came back with a not very convincing whos that spike grinned rubbed the barrel of his gun against his upper thigh and said will do sir chapter banks had always hated hospitals the antiseptic smells the starched uniforms the mysterious and unsettling pieces of shiny equipment around every corner things that looked like modern sculpture or instruments of torture made of articulated chrome they all gave him the creeps worst of all though was the way the doctors and nurses seemed to huddle in corridors and doorways and whisper about death or so he imagined it was saturday afternoon may just over a week since rothwells murder and two days after jamesons shooting when banks walked into leeds infirmary he had spent thursday night in london then headed back to amersham for his car the next morning after spending a little time with superintendent jarrell banks and hatchley had driven back to eastvale that friday evening and arrived a little after nine on saturday morning he had to go into leeds to consult with ken blackstone and wrap things up after their pub lunch he had taken a little time off to go and buy some more compact discs at the classical record shop and pay a sick visit before heading back to eastvale for richmond s farewell bash sandra was off with the camera club photographing rock formations at brimham rocks so he was left to his own devices for the day banks paused and looked at the signs then turned left at last he found the right corridor pamela jeffreys shared a room with one other person who happened to be down in xray when banks called he pulled up a chair by the side of the bed and put down the brown paper package hed brought on the table pamela looked at it with her one good eye the other was covered in bandages grapes said banks feeling embarrassed its what you bring when you visit people in hospital isnt it pamela smiled then decided it hurt too much and let her face relax and banks said pulling a cassette from his pocket i made you a tape of some mozart piano concertos thought they might cheer you up got a walkman wouldnt go anywhere without it pamela said out of the side of her mouth its a bit difficult to get the headphones on with one hand though she directed his gaze to where her bandaged right hand lay on the sheets he set the cassette on the bedside table beside the grapes the doctor says youre going to be okay he said hmmm murmured pamela so they tell me it came out muffled but banks could tell what she said he said youll be playing the viola again in no time hmph it might take a bit longer than that but you will play again she uttered a sound that could have been a laugh or a sob they broke two fingers on my right hand she said my bowing hand its a good thing they know bugger all about musical technique if theyd broken my wrist that might really have put an end to my career people like that arent chosen for their intelligence as a rule said banks but the important thing is that theres no permanent damage to your fingers or to your eye i know i know she said i ought to think myself lucky well oh im okay i suppose mostly just bored theres the tapes and the radio but you cant listen to music all day theres nothing else to do but watch telly and i can stomach even less of that reading still hurts too much with just one good eye and the foods awful im sorry banks said and im sorry about that day in the park she moved her head slowly from side to side no my fault you had to ask i overreacted is this an official visit have you come about the men the men who hurt me no but we know who they are they wont get away with it why have you come i thats a good question banks laughed nervously and looked away out of the window at the swaying treetops to see you i suppose he said to bring you some grapes and some mozart i just happened to be in the area you know buying cds what did you get banks showed her keith jarrett playing shostakovitchs preludes and fugues nobuko imai playing waltons viola concerto she raised her eyebrow interesting then she tapped the walton its beautiful if you get it right she said but so difficult shes very good it says in the notes that the viola is an introvert of an instrument a poetphilosopher does that describe you my teacher told me i had to be careful not to get overwhelmed by the orchestra that tends to happen to violas you know but i manage to hold my own how long are they going to keep you here who knows another week or so id get up and go home right now but i think my legs broken it is the right one damn the prettiest banks laughed did you catch the men who killed robert she asked was it the same ones banks gave her the gist of what had happened with jameson avoiding the more lurid details so one got away she said so far thats not bad going not bad banks agreed fifty percent success rate its better than the police average will you get a promotion out of it he laughed i doubt it dont look so worried she said resting her bandaged hand on his ill be all right and dont blame yourself you know for what happened to me right ill try not to banks felt his eyes burn he could see her name bracelet and the tube attached to the vein in her wrist it made him feel squeamish even more so than seeing jamesons body against the wall in the hotel room it didnt make sense he could take a murder scene in his stride but a simple intravenous drip in a hospital made him queasy pamela was right she would be fine her wounds would heal her beauty would regenerate in less than a year she would be as good as new but would she ever recover fully inside how would she handle being alone in the house would she ever again be able to hear someone walking up the garden path without that twinge of fear and panic he didnt know the psyche regenerates itself too sometimes were often a damn sight more resilient than wed imagine will you come and see me again she asked i mean when its all over and im home will you come and see me sure i will said banks thinking guiltily of the feelings he had had for pamela not sure at all do you mean it he looked into her almond eye and saw the black shape of fear at its center he swallowed of course i mean it he said and he did he leaned forward and brushed his lips against her good cheek id better go now why was he born so beautiful why was he born so tall hes no bloody use to anyone hes no bloody use at all richmond took the yorkshire compliment delivered in shaky harmonies by sergeant hatchley and an assorted cats choir of pcs very well banks thought especially for someone who listened to music that sounded like zamfir on valium speech speech hatchley shouted embarrassed richmond gave a sideways glance at rachel his fiancée then stood up cleared his throat and said thank you thank you all very much and thanks specially for the cdrom you know im not much at giving speeches like this but id just like to say its been a pleasure working with you all i know you all probably think im a traitor going off down south here a chorus of boos interrupted his speech but as soon as ive got that lot down there sorted out he went on ill be back and you buggers had better make sure you know a hard drive from a hole in the ground thank you he sat down again and people went over to pat him on the back and say farewell everyone cheered when susan gay leaned forward and gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek she blushed when richmond responded by giving her a bearhug they were in the back room of the queens arms on saturday night and banks leaned against the polished bar pint of theakstons in his hand with sandra on one side and gristhorpe on the other someone had hung balloons from the ceiling cyril had hooked up the old jukebox for the occasion and gerry and the pacemakers were singing ferry across the mersey banks knew he should have been happier to see the end of the rothwell case but he just couldnt seem to get rid of a niggling feeling like an itch he couldnt reach jameson had killed rothwell true now jameson was dead justice had been done after a fashion an eye for an eye so forget it but he couldnt the two men who had beaten pamela jeffreys hadnt been caught yet along with jamesons accomplice that left three on the loose only a twentyfive percent success rate not satisfactory at all but it wasnt just that somehow it was all too neat all too neat and ready for martin churchill to slip into the country one night with a new face and a clean colossal bank account and retire quietly to cornwall guarding the secrets of those in power to the grave which might not be far off banks wouldnt be surprised if someone from m or wherever slipped into cornwall one night and both mr churchill and his insurance had a nasty accident susan gay walked over from richmond s table and indicated shed like a word banks excused himself from sandra and they found a quiet corner sorry for dragging you away from the festivities sir susan said but i havent had a chance to talk to you since you got back theres a couple of things you might be interested in im listening susan told him about her talk with tom rothwell after the funeral about his homosexuality and what he had seen his father do that day he followed him into leeds the artist came in on wednesday evening sir and we managed to get the impression in the papers on thursday while you were down south any luck well yes and no come on then dont keep me in suspense weve found out who she is her names julia marshall and she lives in adel thats in north leeds shes a schoolteacher we got a couple of phone calls from colleagues apparently she was a quiet person shy and private was well i shouldnt say that really sir but its just that shes disappeared thats all we know so far i just think we should find her thats all she said talk to her friends i dont really know why its just a feeling she might know something i think youre right said banks its a loose end id like to see tied up as well there are too many bloody disappearances in this case for my liking is there anything else no but its not over yet is it sir no susan i dont think it is thanks for telling me well follow up on it first thing tomorrow for now wed better get back to the party or phil will think we dont love him banks walked back to the bar and lit a cigarette the music had changed now it was the swinging blue jeans doing hippy hippy shake and some of the younger members of the department were dancing banks thought about tom rothwell and his father susan had been sharp to pick up on that it didnt make sense given rothwells other interests that he should be so genuinely upset that his son didnt want to be an accountant or a lawyer on the other hand perhaps nothing was more of an anathema an insult to a confirmed heterosexual philanderer than a gay son penny for them sandra said what oh nothing just thinking thats all its over alan leave it be its another feather in your cap you cant solve the whole worlds problems it feels more like a lead weight than a feather i think ill have another drink he turned and ordered another pint sandra had a gin and tonic youre right of course he said standing the drink on the bar weve done the best we can youve done all you can its being pipped at the post by dirty dick that really gets your goat isnt it sandra taunted you two have got some kind of macho personal vendetta going havent you maybe i dont know i wont say its a good feeling knowing the bastards got his way you did what you could didnt you yes but you still think burgess has won this time and it pisses you off doesnt it maybe yes yes it bloody well does sandra the man had someone shot a coldblooded murderer besides you dont know that you mean i cant prove it and were not here to play vigilantes if burgess had jameson shot you can be damn sure it wasnt just an eye for an eye he was making certain he didnt talk men said sandra turning to her drink with a longsuffering sigh gristhorpe who had been listening from the other side laughed and nudged banks in the ribs better listen to her he said i can understand how you feel but theres no more you can do and theres no point making some kind of competition out of it i know that its not that its oh maybe sandras right and it is macho stuff i dont know at that moment sergeant rowe who had been manning the front desk across the street pushed through the crowd of drinkers and said to banks phone call sir he says its important must talk to you in person banks put his pint glass back on the bar shit did he say who no all right he turned to sandra and pointed at his pint guard that drink with your life back in a few minutes he couldnt ignore the call it might be an informer with important information irritated nonetheless he crossed market street and went into the tudorfronted police station you can take it in here sir said rowe pointing to an empty groundfloor office banks went in and picked up the receiver hello banks here ah banks said the familiar voice its superintendent burgess here remember me what do you want first the good news or the bad speak of the devil banks felt his jaw clench and his stomach start to churn just tell me he said as calmly as he could okay you know those two goons the ones that beat up the tart of color yes have you got them weell not exactly what then they got away slipped through our net thats the bad news where did they go back home of course st corona thats the good news whats so good about that seems they didnt realize theyd become persona non grata there or whatever the plural of that is and well i have it on good authority that theyve both been eating glass theyre dead of course theyre bloody dead i doubt theyd survive a diet like that how do you know this i told you good authority its the real mccoy no reason to doubt the source why ours is not to reason why banks lets just say that their bungling around england drawing attention to themselves didnt help much things are in a delicate balance did you know in advance that they were out of favor did you let them slip out of the country knowing what would happen did you even try to find them oh banks you disappoint me how could you even think something like that of me easy the same way i think you sent spike and shandy down to kensington to make damn sure arthur jameson didnt survive to say anything embarrassing in court i told you jameson wasnt in my brief i know what you told me i also know what happened in that hotel room they shot the bastard down burgess and youre responsible superintendent burgess to you and he shot first is what i heard thats the official version at any rate and i dont see any reason not to believe it as our cousins over the pond would say it was a righteous shoot bollocks they shot him twice then fired off a round from his gun to make it look like he fired first apart from the shots do you know what gave them away no but im sure youre going to tell me they left the gun in his hand for me to see procedure is that you disarm a suspect first thing whether you think hes dead or not well hurray for you sherlock dont you think they might have got careless in the heat of the moment no not with their training but it doesnt matter does it you werent there officially were you in fact you were ordered to stay on the ground floor anyway i dont think we need to go into all that tiresome stuff do we do you really want me to have to pull rank believe it or not i like you banks life would be a lot duller without you i wouldnt want to see you throw your career down the tubes over this take my word for it nobody will take kindly to your rocking the boat the official verdict is the only one that counts not to me leave it alone banks its over why does everyone keep telling me that because its true one more thing and dont interrupt me we found an address book in jamesons stuff and it led us to an old exarmy crony of his called donald pembroke ring any bells no anyway it seems this pembroke just inherited a lot of money according to his neighbor the first thing he did was buy a fast sports car cash down according to the salesman two days later he lost control on a b road in kent doing eighty or ninety by all accounts and ran it into a tree and and hes dead isnt he whats more theres no way you can put it down to me so dont say theres no justice in the world banks goodbye have a good life burgess hung up abruptly leaving banks to glare into the receiver he slammed it down so hard that sergeant rowe popped his head around the door everything all right sir yes fine said banks he took a deep breath and ran his hand through his short hair everythings just bloody fine and dandy he sat in the empty office gaining control of his breathing susans words echoed in his mind its not over yet is it sir no it bloody well wasnt chapter banks sat at a tavérna by the quayside sipping an icecold becks and smoking a dutyfree benson and hedges special mild when he had finished his cigarette he popped a dolmáde into his mouth and followed it with a black olive one or two of the locals mostly mustachioed and sunleathered fishermen occasionally glanced his way during a pause in their conversation it was a small island just one village built up the central hillside and though it got its share of tourists in season none of the big cruise ships came banks had arrived half an hour ago on a regular ferry service from piraeus and he needed a while to collect his thoughts and get his landlegs back again he had a difficult interview ahead of him he suspected he had already contacted the greek police help had been offered and the legal machinery was ready to grind into action at a word but banks had something else he wanted to try first by christ it was hot even in the shade the sun beat down from a clear sky a more intense more saturated blue than banks had ever seen especially in contrast to the white houses shops and tavérnas along the quayside a couple of sailboats and a few fishing craft were moored in the small harbor bobbing gently on the calm water it was hard to describe the seas color certainly there were shades of green and blue in it aquamarine ultramarine but in places it was a kind of inky blue too almost purple maybe homer was right when he called it winedark banks thought remembering his conversation with superintendent gristhorpe before the trip banks had never read the odyssey but he probably would when he got back he paid for his food and drink and walked out into the sun on his way he popped into the local police station in the square near the harbor as promised then set off along the dirt track up the hill the main street itself was narrow enough but every few yards a sidestreet branched off narrower still all white cubist flatroofed houses with painted shutters mostly blue some of the houses had red pantile roofs like the ones in whitby many people had put hanging baskets of flowers out on the small balconies a profusion of purple pink red and blue and lines of washing hung over the narrow streets by the roadside were poppies and delicate lavender flowers that looked like morning glories mingled with the scents of the flowers were the smells of tobacco and wild herbs banks thought he recognized thyme and rosemary insects with red bodies and transparent wings flew around him the sun beat relentlessly before banks had walked twenty yards his white cotton shirt stuck to his back he wished he had worn shorts instead of jeans banks looked ahead where the white houses ended halfway up the hillside scrub and rocky outcrops took over the house he wanted he had been told was on his right a large one with a highgated white wall and a shaded courtyard it wasnt difficult to spot now about fifty yards ahead almost threequarters of the length of the road he finally made it the ochre gate was unlocked and beyond it banks found a courtyard full of saplings pots of herbs and hanging plants by a krokalia pathway of black and white pebbles winding up to the door expensive definitely the door was slightly ajar and he could hear voices inside by the plummy tones it sounded like the bbc world service news he paused a moment for breath then walked up to the door and knocked he heard a movement inside the voices stopped and in a few seconds someone opened the door banks looked into the face that he had thought for so long had been blown to smithereens mr rothwell he said slipping his card out of his wallet and holding it up mr keith rothwell youve come then rothwell said simply yes he looked over bankss shoulder alone yes youd better come in banks followed rothwell into a bright room where a ceiling fan spun and a light breeze blew through the open blue shutters it was sparsely furnished the walls were plastered white the floor was flagged covered here and there by rugs and the ceiling was panelled with dark wood outside he could hear birds singing he didnt know what kind he sat down in the wicker chair rothwell offered surprised to be able to see the sea down below through the window now he was at the end of his journey he felt bone weary and more than a little dizzy it had been a long way from eastvale and a long uphill walk in the sun sweat dribbled from his eyebrows into his eyes and made them sting he wiped it away with his forearm at least it was cooler inside the room rothwell noticed his discomfort hot isnt it he said can i get you something banks nodded thanks anything as long as its cold rothwell went to the kitchen door and turned with a smile just as he opened it dont worry he said i wont run away theres nowhere to run replied banks a minute or so later he came back with a glass of ice water and a bottle of grölsch lager id drink the water first he advised you look a bit dehydrated banks drained the glass then opened the metal gizmo on the beer it tasted good imported of course but rothwell could afford it banks looked at him the receding sandy hair forming a slight widows peak had bleached in the sun he had a good tan for such a fairskinned person behind wirerimmed glasses his steady gray eyes looked out calmly not giving away any indication as to his state of mind he had a slightly prissy mouth a girls mouth and his lips were pale pink he looked nothing at all like the photograph of daniel clegg he wore a peach shortsleeve shirt white shorts and brown leather sandals his toenails needed cutting he was an inch or so taller than banks slim and in good shape about all he did have in common with clegg apart from the color of his hair his blood group and the appendicitis scar when he went to get the drinks banks noticed he moved with an athletes grace and economy there was nothing of the sedentary penpusher about his bearing anyone else here banks asked julias gone to the shops he said glancing at his watch she shouldnt be long id like to meet her how did you find me rothwell asked sitting opposite opening a tin of pepsi the gas hissed out and liquid frothed over the edge rothwell held it at arms length until it had stopped fizzing then wiped the tin with a tissue from a box on the table beside him it wasnt that difficult said banks once i knew who i was looking for we found you partly through julia he shrugged after that it was a matter of routine police work mostly boring footwork we checked travel agents then we contacted the local police through interpol it didnt take that long to get word back about two english strangers who resembled your descriptions taking a lease on a captains house here did you really believe we wouldnt find you eventually i suppose i must have said rothwell foolish of me but there it is there are always variables loose ends but i thought id left enough red herrings and covered my tracks pretty well i planned it all very carefully do you have any idea what youve done to your family rothwells lips tightened it wasnt a family it was a sham a lie a façade we played at happy families i couldnt stand it anymore there was no love in the house mary and i hadnt slept together in years and tom well banks let tom pass for the moment why not get a divorce like anyone else why this elaborate scheme i assume seeing as youre here you know most of it humor me rothwell squinted at banks look he said i cant see where youd have any room to hide one but youre not wired as the americans say are you banks shook his head you have my word on that this is just between you and me off the record for the moment i am here officially though rothwell sipped some pepsi then rubbed the can between his palms i might have asked mary for a divorce eventually he said but it was still all very new to me the freedom the taste of another life im not even sure she would have let me go that easily the way things turned out though i had to appear dead if he thinks im alive therell be no peace no escape anywhere martin churchill yes he found out i was taking rather more than i was entitled to how did you find out he knew a close source when you play the kind of games i did mr banks it pays to have as much information as you can get lets say someone on the island tipped me that churchill knew and that he was pressuring daniel clegg to do something about it is that how it happened yes and it made sense id noticed that daniel had been behaving oddly lately he was nervous about something wouldnt look me in the eye now i had an explanation the bastard was planning to have me executed so you had him killed instead rothwell gazed out of the window at the sea and the mountainside in silence for a moment yes it was him or me i beat him to it thats all someone had to die violently someone who could pass for me under certain circumstances we looked enough alike without a face you mean i i didnt look in the garage i couldnt ill bet you couldnt go on we were about the same age and build same hair color i knew hed had his appendix out i even knew his blood group was o the same as mine how did you know that he told me we were talking once about blood tainted by the hiv virus he wondered if he had a greater chance of catching it from a transfusion because he shared his blood group with over forty percent of the male population what did you do once you had the idea of passing him off as you there was this man wed both met in the eagle a couple of times down there for the ed odonnell band on a sunday lunchtime and hed boasted about being a mercenary and doing anything for money arthur jameson was his name he was a walking mass of contradictions he loved animals and nature but he liked hunting and duckshooting and he didnt seem to give a damn for human life i found him fascinating fascinating and a little frightening it was perfect daniel knew him too of course and he told me that jameson had even approached him for some legal help once shortly after we met i thought if you found out anything that would be it he might have had something in his files you know how lawyers hoard every scrap of paper but there was nothing linking jameson to me it would only reinforce what you suspected already that daniel had had me killed instead of the other way round you werent to know that i was with daniel the day we met jameson or that id chatted with jameson on a number of subsequent occasions so you and clegg were pals socialized together did you rothwell paused a muscle by his jaw twitched no it wasnt quite like that he said quietly daniel had a hold over me but sometimes he seemed to want to play at being boozing buddies i didnt understand it but at least for a while we could bury our differences and have a good time the next day it would usually be back to cold formality at bottom daniel was a terrible snob been to cambridge you know how much did you pay jameson fifty thousand pounds and a plane ticket to rio i know its a lot but i thought the more i paid him the more likely hed be to disappear for good with it and not get caught first mistake how did it happen banks told him about the wadding and about jamesons attitude to the world beyond calais rothwell laughed then stared at the sea again i knew it was a risk he said i suppose i should have known the way he used to go on about the irish and the frogs sometimes but if you have a dream you have to take risks for it pay a price dont you you neednt try to justify your actions to me said banks finally feeling steady and cool enough to light a cigarette he offered one to rothwell who accepted i was the one left to clean up your mess and jameson killed one policeman and seriously wounded another trying to escape the fan drew their smoke up to it then pushed it toward the windows im sorry ill bet you are it wasnt my fault what jameson did was it you cant blame me cant i lets get back to your relationship with daniel clegg how did you get involved we met in the george hotel on great george street it was about four years ago a year or so after i left hatchard and pratt anyway expenses were high what with renovations to arkbeck and everything else and business wasnt exactly booming though i wasnt doing too badly they have jazz at the george on thursdays and as i was in leeds on business i thought id drop by rather than watch television in the hotel room it turns out we were both jazz fans we just got talking thats all i didnt tell him very much at first except that i was a freelance financial consultant he seemed interested anyway we exchanged business cards and he put a bit of work my way offshore banking that sort of thing turns out some of it was a bit shady though i wasnt aware at the time not that i mightnt have done it anyway mind you and he brought that up later in conversation he put pressure on you oh yes rothwell paused and looked banks in the eye a smooth blackmailer was dannyboy i suppose you know about my bit of bad luck at hatchard and pratts dont you yes that was five years ago wed just moved into arkbeck then and we couldnt really afford it not that the mortgage itself was so high but the place had been neglected for so long there was so much needed doing and im no diy expert but mary wanted to live there so live there we did the upshot was that i had to pad the expenses a little if i hadnt been married to the bosss daughter and if laurence pratt hadnt been a good friend things could have gone very badly for me at the firm then as it was after i left i didnt have a lot of work at first and mary well thats another story lets just say she doesnt have a forgiving nature one night in my cups i hinted to daniel about what had happened how i had parted company with hatchard and pratt anyway later daniel used what he knew about me as leverage to get me involved when his old college friend martin churchill first made enquiries about rearranging his finances that was a little over three years back see he knew he couldnt handle the task by himself that he needed my expertise he told me he could still report me to the board that it wasnt too late well maybe they would have listened to him and maybe they wouldnt who knows now quite frankly i didnt care i already knew a bit about moneylaundering and it looked to me like a license to print money why wouldnt i want in i think daniel just enjoyed manipulating people having power over them so i didnt spoil his illusion but he really wasnt terribly bright wasnt dannyboy despite cambridge a bit like frankenstein and the monster isnt it rothwell smiled yes perhaps and i suppose youd have to say that the monster far outstripped his creator though you could hardly say the good doctor himself was without sin how did you arrange it all the murder the escape rothwell emptied his tin put it on the table and leaned back the chair creaked outside gulls cried as they circled the harbor looking for fish another grölsch he asked there was still an inch left in the bottle no said banks not yet rothwell sighed you have to go back about eighteen months to understand to when i first started using the robert calvert identity daniel and i were doing fine laundering churchills money and he allowed us a decent percentage for doing so i was getting rich quick i suppose i should have been happy but i wasnt i dont know exactly when i first became aware of it but life just seemed to have lost its savor its sweetness things started to oppress me i felt like i was shrivelling up inside dying old before my time call it midlife crisis i suppose but i couldnt see the point of all that bloody money all mary wanted was her bridge club more renovations additions to the house jewelry expensive holidays christ i should have known better than to marry the bosss daughter even if i did get her pregnant one simple mistake that and my own bloody weakness what was it the philosopher said about the erect penis knowing no conscience that may be so but it certainly understands penitence regret remorse one bloody miserable uncomfortable screw in the back of an escort halfway up crow scar set me on a course straight to hell im not exaggerating twentyone years after that long my wife hated me my children hated me and i was beginning to hate myself banks noticed that rothwell had picked up the empty pepsi tin and started to squeeze until it buckled in his grip then i realized i was handling millions of pounds literally millions and that my job was essentially to clean it and hide it ready for future use it wasnt difficult to find a few hiding places of my own small amounts at first then when no one seemed to miss it more and more shell companies numbered accounts dummy corporations property i liked what i was doing the manipulation of large sums of money intrigued me and excited me like nothing else or almost nothing else just for the sake of it much of the time like art for arts sake i began to spend more time away from home on business nobody cared one way or another they never asked me where id been they only asked for more money for a new kitchen or a sunporch or a bloody gazebo when i was home i walked around like a zombie the dull boring accountant i suppose and mostly kept to my office or nipped out to the pub for a smoke and a jar occasionally i had plenty of time to look back on my life and though i didnt like a lot of what i saw i remembered i hadnt always been so bloody bored or boring i used to go dancing believe it or not i used to like a flutter on the horses now and then i had friends once in a while i liked to have too much to drink with the lads and stagger home singing happy as a lark that was before life came to resemble an accounts ledger debits and credits profit and loss with far too much on the loss side he sighed are you sure you wouldnt like another beer go on then banks said his bottle was empty now rothwell brought back a pepsi for himself and another grölsch for banks his glasses had slipped down over the bridge of his nose and he pushed them back so i invented robert calvert rothwell said after a sip of pepsi where did you get the name picked it from a magazine i was reading at the time with a pin the economist i believe go on i rented the flat bought new clothes more casual god youve no idea how strange it felt at first good but strange there were moments when i really did believe i was going mad turning into a split personality it became a kind of compulsion an addiction like smoking id go to the bookies and put bets on spend a day at the races go listen to trad jazz in smoky pubs the adelphi the george the duck and drake something i hadnt done since my early twenties id go around in jeans and sweatshirts and nobody back at arkbeck farm ever asked where id been what id been doing as long i turned up every now and then in my business suit and the money kept coming in for a new freezer a first edition brontë a christmas trip to hawaii after a while i realized i wasnt going mad i was just becoming myself returning to the way i was before i let life grind me down and sure enough the money kept coming in i had tapped into an endless supply or so i thought so i played the family role part of the time and i started exploring my real self as robert calvert i had no idea where it would lead not then i was just trying out ways of escape i told daniel clegg one night when wed had a few and he thought it was a wild idea i had to tell someone and i couldnt tell my family or pratt or anyone local so why not tell my blackmailer my confidant he helped me get a bank account and credit card as calvert which he thought gave him an even stronger hold over me he could always claim hed been deceived you see what about the escape youre jumping ahead a bit but as id already created robert calvert successfully enough it wasnt very difficult to go on from there and create a third identity david norcliffe as you no doubt know seeing as youre here rothwell was dead and i couldnt go as calvert i had to leave him behind that was part of the plan so i shuffled more money into various bank accounts in various places over a period of several weeks after all thats what i do best ive laundered and hidden millions for churchill and his wife how much for yourself three or four million he said with a shrug i dont know exactly enough anyway to last us our lifetime and there was plenty left in eastvale for my family theyre well provided for in the will and by the life insurance i made sure of that believe me theyll be better off without me what about daniel clegg what about pamela jeffreys pamela what about her banks told him he put his head in his hands oh my god he said i would never have hurt pamela it wasnt meant to be like that how did you meet her rothwell sipped some more pepsi and rubbed the back of his hand across his brow i told you the calvert thing felt very strange at first mostly i just used to walk around leeds in my jeans and sweatshirt id drop in at a pub now and then and enjoy being someone else occasionally i got chatting to people the way you do in pubs ill never forget how frightening and how exciting it was the first time someone asked me my name and i said robert calvert i knew it was still me you have to understand that were not really talking about a split personality here i was keith rothwell all right just playing a part or trying to find himself perhaps it gave me an exhilarating sense of freedom anyway as i said i used to drop in at pubs now and then mostly in the city center or up in headingley near the flat one night i saw pamela in the boulevard you know the tartedup jubilee hotel on the headrow it seemed a likely place to meet women they stay open till midnight on weekends and theyve got a small dancefloor pamela was with some friends theyd been doing something at the town hall a handel oratorio or something like that anyway something happened some spark we caught one anothers eye she wasnt with anyone in particular i mean she didnt seem to have a boyfriend with her the next time she was at the bar i made sure i got there too next to her and we got chatting i wasnt a great fan of classical music but pamelas a downtoearth sort of person not a highbrow snob or anything i asked her to dance she said yes we just got on thats all we slept together now and then but both of us knew it was just a casual relationship really i dont mean to denigrate it by saying that we had a wonderful time i was astounded she fancied me flattered it was the first time in my entire marriage that id been with another woman and the hell of it was that i didnt feel guilty at all she was fun to be with and we had a great time but we werent in love what came between you what well we stayed friends really at least i like to think we did there was her work of course its very demanding and between us we couldnt always be sure we could make time to get together and pamela was more outgoing she wanted more of a social life she wanted me to meet her friends and she wanted to meet mine but you didnt have any exactly and i didnt want to get too well known around the place it was a risk playing calvert always a risk go on what happened next i met julia how we met on a bus would you believe it had been raining one of those sudden showers and i was out walking without an umbrella so i jumped on a bus into town then the rain stopped and the sun came out id been looking at her out of the corner of my eye she was so beautiful like a model such delicate fragile sculpted features i imagined she was probably stuckup and wouldnt talk to the likes of me anyway she left her umbrella i saw it grabbed it and dashed after her when i caught her up she seemed startled at first then i gave it to her and she blushed she seemed flustered so i asked her if she wanted to go for a coffee she said yes she was very shy it was hard to get her talking at first but slowly i found out she was a teacher and she lived in adel and she adored greek history and literature do you believe in love at first sight mr banks do you because thats what this is all about really its not just about money its not just about leaving my old life behind and seeking novelty i fell in love with julia the moment i saw her and thats the truth it might sound foolish and sentimental to you but i have never in my life felt that way before bells ringing earth moving all the cliches and its mutual shes everything ive ever wanted when i met julia nothing else mattered i knew we had to get away find our eden if you like our paradise i had to get a new life a new identity everything was in such a mess falling apart no one was supposed to get hurt except daniel clegg rothwell banged on his chair arm with his fist i told you that wasnt my fault i had to appear to have been violently murdered by daniel himself or by someone hed hired and thats exactly the way it would have been too if i hadnt been tipped off and made other plans but julia knew nothing of that shes a complete innocent she knows nothing of the things weve just been talking about so you invited clegg over to the calvert flat to get his fingerprints there am i right yes on the monday i said i had some business to discuss that couldnt wait and he came over i showed him around had him touch things id cleaned the place thoroughly daniel was a touchyfeely kind of person anything he saw hed pick it up and have a look compact discs wallet credit cards in calverts name coins books you name it hed even let his fingers rest on surfaces as if he were claiming them or something he handled just about everything in the place i was much more careful to make mine blurred rothwell laughed quietly he really was a fool you know every time i got him to help me with something illegal like setting up the calvert bank account and credit card for example he thought he was getting more power over me so you must have known wed find out about the calvert identity about pamela about clegg and the moneylaundering of course as i said earlier i had to leave calvert behind it was part of my plan that you should find out about him another dead end but please believe me pamela wasnt meant to be a part of it except maybe to confirm the calvert identity i mean i thought she might get in touch with the police if she saw my picture in the papers or someone else might someone who thought they recognized me it was meant to confuse you thats all i left a careful trail for you i thought it led the wrong way i knew the police would be able to unlock and interpret the data on my computer eventually that they would realize id been laundering money for martin churchill i also left a letter for daniel clegg in a locked file i knew youd get at that eventually too that was one of the things that bothered me banks said in retrospect it was all too easy and we never found a copy of the letter among his papers he could have destroyed it of course but it was just one of those little niggling details lawyers tend to hang onto things i never sent it said rothwell i just created the file so youd get onto daniel if you hadnt already it was a way of telling you his name but i couldnt make it too easy then youd assume hed had me killed and disappeared with the money oh we did said banks we did then why are you here because im a persistent bastard among other things there were too many loose ends they worried me two different sets of thugs roaming the country for a start they could be explained of course but it still seemed odd and we couldnt find any trace of clegg no matter how hard we tried his exwife said he fancied tahiti but we had no luck there we had no luck anywhere else either of course we didnt we were looking for the wrong person but mostly i think it was the connection with julia that really did you in how did you find out about her pamela jeffreys mentioned her first she said she thought you were in love just a feeling she had you understand then i began to wonder how it would upset the applecart if you fell in love as robert calvert how would you handle it then tom came back from america for your funeral ah tom my achilles heel oh he didnt realize the significance of it but you made him angry he followed you to leeds once he saw you have lunch with a woman julia marshall you didnt know that did you but tom couldnt imagine the scale of your plans hes just a kid who caught his father with another woman he was already angry mixed up and confused at the way you treated him he was after getting his own back but what he saw upset him so much that all he could do was keep it to himself christ he muttered i didnt know that he didnt tell mary no he wanted to protect her my god rothwell ran his hand over the side of his face maybe you think i reacted too harshly chief inspector i know were living in liberal times where anything goes i know its oldfashioned of me but i still happen to believe that homosexuality is an aberration an abomination of nature and not just an alternative lifestyle as the liberals would have it and to find out that my own son so you decided it would be best to send tom away yes it seemed best for both of us if he went away a long way away he was well provided for as it turned out he wanted to go travelling in america and try to get into film school there by then i knew i had to get away too so it seemed best to let him go at least he had a good chance i might have abhorred his homosexuality but im not a tyrant he was still my son after all tom gave us an accurate description of julia banks went on hes a very observant young man we ran the artists impression in the yorkshire post and a woman called barbara ledward came forward a colleague of julias then julias family nobody lives in a vacuum when we followed up on their phone calls we found out that julia had resigned from her teaching job suddenly and told everyone she was going away that she had a onceinalifetime opportunity abroad but couldnt divulge the details she said shed be in touch then she simply disappeared about three days before your apparent murder her family and friends were worried about her she didnt usually behave so irresponsibly but they didnt report her as a missing person because she had told them she was going away we might have been a bit slow on the uptake but were not stupid all julias friends and colleagues mentioned how fascinated she was by the ancient greeks she even tried to teach the kids about the classics at school though im told it didnt go down well with the head he wanted them to study computers and car maintenance instead we had to assume you didnt think wed find out about julia oh you might have suspected wed find out there was someone but you didnt think wed try to find her did you no said rothwell after all why should you want to no more than i thought you would waste time and money doing tests to see if it really was my body in the garage another risk i was clearly dead executed because of my involvement in international crime what did it matter if i or calvert had a girlfriend i never thought for a moment youd look very closely at the rest of my private life then you shouldnt have revealed the calvert identity to us banks said if it hadnt been for that we might have gone on thinking you were a dull mildmannered accountant who just happened to get into something beyond his depth but calvert showed imagination calvert showed a dimension to your character i had to take into account and i had to ask myself what if calvert fell in love i couldnt get rid of calvert said rothwell you know that i didnt have time too many people had seen him i had to figure out a way to make him work to my advantage quickly i thought hed be a dead end your mistake poor judgment obviously but i had no choice what else could i do so how did you handle the killing another drink please banks stared out over the pink and purple flowers in the window box at the barren hillside and the blue sea below rothwells mention of the forensic tests galled him he knew they should have tried to establish the identity of the deceased beyond doubt forensics should have reconstructed the teeth and checked dental records that was an oversight it was understandable given the way rothwell had apparently been assassinated and given the state the teeth were in but it was an oversight nevertheless of course the lab had been as burdened with work as usual and tests cost money then when the fingerprints at calverts flat matched the corpses they didnt think they needed to look any further after all they had the pasta meal the appendix scar and the right blood group and mary rothwell had identified the dead mans clothing watch and pocket contents a red flying insect settled on his bare arm he brushed it off gently when rothwell came back with a grölsch and a pepsi he was not moving with quite the same confidence and grace as he had before i gave jameson instructions to hold alison until we got back he began but not to harm her in any way thats considerate of you he didnt what about his accomplice donald pembroke rothwell shook his head he held the pepsi against his shorts the tin was beaded with moisture and banks watched the damp patch spread through the white cotton i never met him that was jamesons business he said he needed someone to help and i left it to him getting guarantees of discretion of course i never even knew the mans name and thats the truth pembroke you say what happened to him banks told him rothwell sighed i suppose fate catches up with us all in the end doesnt it what is it the eastern religions call it karma back to the murder rothwell paused a moment then went on they held alison then when mary and i got home they tied her up too and took me out to the garage they had instructions to pick clegg up after dinner i knew he didnt like to cook for himself and on thursdays he always dropped by a trattoria near the office for a quick pasta before going home thats why i chose that day i knew mary and i would be going out for the annual anniversary dinner and i arranged for us to eat at marios you see i thought of everything even the stomach contents would match theyd already knocked clegg out and secured him earlier i even made sure to tell jameson to use loose handcuffs to avoid rope burns on cleggs wrists we got him into my clothes as quickly as possible he was starting to come round he was on his hands and knees i remember shaking his head as if he was groggy just waking up then jameson put the shotgun to the back of his head i i turned away there was a terrible explosion and a smell then we went through the woods and they drove me to leeds i drove cleggs jaguar to heathrow wearing gloves of course then i left the country as david norcliffe i already had a passport and bank accounts set up in that name i joined julia here it was all prearranged it had to be so elaborate because i was supposed to be murdered id read about a similar murder in the papers a while back and it seemed one worth imitating well you know what the poet said the best laid plans but you cant prove anything said rothwell dont be an idiot of course we can we can prove that youre alive and daniel clegg was murdered in your garage but you cant prove i was there its only your word against mine i could say they were taking me out to kill both of us i managed to get away and i ran and hid here they killed daniel but i escaped they killed him in your clothes banks shook his head slowly it wont wash keith but its all circumstantial jameson and pembroke are both dead a good lawyer could get me off and you know it youre dreaming say you do beat the murder conspiracy charge which i think is unlikely theres still the moneylaundering and the rest rothwell looked around the room mouth set firmly im not going back he said you cant make me i know there are european extradition treaties procedures to follow they take time you cant just take me in like some bounty hunter of course i cant said banks that was never my intention he heard the gate open and walked over to the window a pale beautiful woman in a yellow sundress redblonde hair piled and knotted high on her head had walked into the courtyard and paused to check on the flowers and potted plants she carried a basket of fresh bread and other foodstuffs in the crook of her arm she put out her free hand and bent to hold a purple blossom gently between her fingers for a moment then inspected the herbs the sun brought out the blonde highlights in her hair it looks like julias back banks said doesnt tan well does she rothwell jumped up and looked out julia knows nothing he said quickly speaking quietly so she couldnt hear him you have to believe that i told her i had business problems that i had to burn a lot of bridges if we were to be together that wed be well set up for life but we couldnt go back ever she agreed i dont know if you can understand this or not but i love her banks more than anyone or anything ive ever loved in my life i mean it its the first time ive ever i already told you i love her she knows nothing you can do what you want with me but leave her alone banks kept quiet youll never be able to prove anything rothwell added maybe i dont even want to take that risk said banks by now they could both see julia and hear her humming softly as she rubbed the leaves on a pot of basil and sniffed her fingers maybe id rather you made a clean breast of it he went on keeping his voice low a confession it might even go in your favor you never know especially the love bit juries love lovers julia stood up some of her piled tresses had come loose and trailed over her cheeks she was flushed from the walk and some of the hairs stuck to her face dampened with sweat you must be mad if you think id give all this up willingly rothwell said you cant buy paradise with blood keith said banks come on home tell us everything about martin churchills finances everything you know about the bastard lets go public make plenty of noise sing louder than a malevoice choir we can make sure he never sets foot in the country even if he turns up looking like mr bean we could offer you protection then perhaps another identity another new life youd do some time of course but im willing to bet that by the time you got out martin churchill would be just another of historys unpleasant footnotes and julia would be still waiting youre insane do you know that id kill you before id do what youre suggesting no you wouldnt keith besides thered be others after me rothwell paused on his way to the door and stared at banks eyes wide open and wild no longer calm and steady do you know what will happen if i go home it might not be half as bad as what will happen if i let churchill know youre still alive said banks they say he has a long reach and a nasty line in revenge julia had almost reached the door it wouldnt stop at you banks said rothwell froze you wouldnt no not even you would do a thing like that at that moment banks hated himself probably more than at any other time in his life he felt sorry for rothwell and he found himself on the verge of relenting then he remembered mary rothwell living in a haze of tranquillizers alison burying her head deep in her books and fast losing touch with the real world and tom flailing around in his own private mire of guilt and confusion rothwell could have helped these people then he thought of pamela jeffreys just out of hospital physically okay but still afraid of every knock at her door and unsure whether she would get back the confidence to play her viola again for this mans gamble on paradise daniel clegg lay in his grave with his head blown off barry miller had died on a wet road at midnight and grant everett might have to spend the next few years of his life relearning how to walk and talk even arthur jameson and donald pembroke were rothwells victims in a way and much farther away but no less implicated was a dictator who got fat while his people starved a man who liked to watch people eat glass a man who now if banks could help it would never enjoy a peaceful retirement in the english countryside no matter what he had on some powerful members of the establishment and the more banks thought about these people victims and predators alike the less able he was to feel sorry for the fallen lovers try me he said rothwell glared at him then all the life seemed to drain out of him until he resembled nothing more than a tired middleaged accountant banks still felt dirty and miserable and despite his resolve he wasnt certain he could go through with his threat but rothwell believed him now and that was all that mattered this bastard had caused enough trouble already there was no more room for pity banks felt his pulse race his jaw clench then the door opened and julia drifted in all blonde and yellow with a big smile for rothwell hello
