john steinbeck cannery row for ed ricketts who knows why or should the people places and events in this book are of course fictitious and fabrications cannery row in monterey in california is a poem a stink a grating noise a quality of light a tone a habit a nostalgia a dream cannery row is the gathered and scattered tin and iron and rust and splintered wood chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps sardine canneries of corrugated iron honky tonks restaurants and whore houses and little crowded groceries and laboratories and flophouses its inhabitants are as the man once said whores pimps gamblers and sons of bitches by which he meant everybody had the man looked through another peephole he might have said saints and angels and martyrs and holy men and he would have meant the same thing in the morning when the sardine fleet has made a catch the purseseiners waddle heavily into the bay blowing their whistles the deepladen boats pull in against the coast where the canneries dip their tails into the bay the figure is advisedly chosen for if the canneries dipped their mouths into the bay the canned sardines which emerge from the other end would be metaphorically at least even more horrifying then cannery whistles scream and all over the town men and women scramble into their clothes and come running down to the row to go to work then shining cars bring the upper classes down superintendents accountants owners who disappear into offices then from the town pour wops and chinamen and polaks men and women in trousers and rubber coats and oilcloth aprons they come running to clean and cut and pack and cook and can the fish the whole street rumbles and groans and screams and rattles while the silver rivers of fish pour in out of the boats and the boats rise higher and higher in the water until they are empty the canneries rumble and rattle and squeak until the last fish is cleaned and cut and cooked and canned and then the whistles scream again and the dripping smelly tired wops and chinamen and polaks men and women straggle out and droop their ways up the hill into the town and cannery row becomes itself again quiet and magical its normal life returns the bums who retired in disgust under the black cypress tree come out to sit on the rusty pipes in the vacant lot the girls from doras emerge for a bit of sun if there is any doc strolls from the western biological laboratory and crosses the street to lee chongs grocery for two quarts of beer henri the painter noses like an airedale through the junk in the grassgrown lot for some part or piece of wood or metal he needs for the boat he is building then the darkness edges in and the street light comes on in front of doras the lamp which makes perpetual moonlight in cannery row callers arrive at western biological to see doc and he crosses the street to lee chongs for five quarts of beer how can the poem and the stink and the grating noise the quality of light the tone the habit and the dream be set down alive when you collect marine animals there are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost impossible to capture whole for they break and tatter under the touch you must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea water and perhaps that might be the way to write this book to open the page and to let the stories crawl in by themselves chapter i lee chongs grocery while not a model of neatness was a miracle of supply it was small and crowded but within its single room a man could find everything he needed or wanted to live and to be happy clothes food both fresh and canned liquor tobacco fishing equipment machinery boats cordage caps pork chops you could buy at lee chongs a pair of slippers a silk kimono a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar you could work out combinations to fit almost any mood the one commodity lee chong did not keep could be had across the lot at doras the grocery opened at dawn and did not close until the last wandering vagrant dime had been spent or retired for the night not that lee chong was avaricious he wasnt but if one wanted to spend money he was available lees position in the community surprised him as much as he could be surprised over the course of the years everyone in cannery row owed him money he never pressed his clients but when the bill became too large lee cut off credit rather than walk into the town up the hill the client usually paid or tried to lee was roundfaced and courteous he spoke a stately english without ever using the letter r when the tong wars were going on in california it happened now and then that lee found a price on his head then he would go secretly to san francisco and enter a hospital until the trouble blew over what he did with his money no one ever knew perhaps he didnt get it maybe his wealth was entirely in unpaid bills but he lived well and he had the respect of all his neighbors he trusted his clients until further trust became ridiculous sometimes he made business errors but even these he turned to advantage in good will if in no other way it was that way with the palace flophouse and grill anyone but lee chong would have considered the transaction a total loss lee chongs station in the grocery was behind the cigar counter the cash register was then on his left and the abacus on his right inside the glass case were the brown cigars the cigarettes the bull durham the dukes mixture the five brothers while behind him in racks on the wall were the pints half pints and quarters of old green river old town house old colonel and the favorite old tennessee a blended whiskey guaranteed four months old very cheap and known in the neighbothood as old tennis shoes lee chong did not stand between the whiskey and the customer without reason some very practical minds had on occasion tried to divert his attention to another part of the store cousins nephews sons and daughtersinlaw waited on the rest of the store but lee never left the cigar counter the top of the glass was his desk his fat delicate hands rested on the glass the fingers moving like small restless sausages a broad golden wedding ring on the middle finger of his left hand was his only jewelry and with it he silently tapped on the rubber change mat from which the little rubber tits had long been worn lees mouth was full and benevolent and the flash of gold when he smiled was rich and warm he wore halfglasses and since he looked at everything through them he had to tilt his head back to see in the distance interest and discounts addition subtraction he worked out on the abacus with his little restless sausage fingers and his brown friendly eyes roved over the grocery and his teeth flashed at the customers on an evening when he stood in his place on a pad of newspaper to keep his feet warm he contemplated with humor and sadness a business deal that had been consummated that afternoon and reconsummated later that same afternoon when you leave the grocery if you walk cattycornered across the grassgrown lot threading your way among the great rusty pipes thrown out of the canneries you will see a path worn in the weeds follow it past the cypress tree across the railroad track up a chicken walk with cleats and you will come to a long low building which for a long time was used as a storage place for fish meal it was just a great big roofed room and it belonged to a worried gentleman named horace abbeville horace had two wives and six children and over a period of years he had managed through pleading and persuasion to build a grocery debt second to none in monterey that afternoon he had come into the grocery and his sensitive tired face had flinched at the shadow of sternness that crossed lees face lees fat finger tapped the rubber mat horace laid his hands palm up on the cigar counter i guess i owe you plenty dough he said simply lees teeth flashed up in appreciation of an approach so different from any he had ever heard he nodded gravely but he waited for the trick to develop horace wet his lips with his tongue a good job from corner to corner i hate to have my kids with that hanging over them he said why i bet you wouldnt let them have a pack of spearmint now lee chongs face agreed with this conclusion plenty dough he said horace continued you know that place of mine across the track up there where the fish meal is lee chong nodded it was his fish meal horace said earnestly if i was to give you that place would it clear me up with you lee chong tilted his head back and stared at horace through his halfglasses while his mind flicked among accounts and his right hand moved restlessly to the abacus he considered the construction which was flimsy and the lot which might be valuable if a cannery ever wanted to expand shu said lee chong well get out the accounts and ill make you a bill of sale on that place horace seemed in a hurry no need papers said lee i make paidinfull paper they finished the deal with dignity and lee chong threw in a quarter pint of old tennis shoes and then horace abbeville walking very straight went across the lot and past the cypress tree and across the track and up the chicken walk and into the building that had been his and he shot himself on a heap of fish meal and although it has nothing to do with this story no abbeville child no matter who its mother was knew the lack of a stick of spearmint ever afterward but to get back to the evening horace was on the trestles with the embalming needles in him and his two wives were sitting on the steps of his house with their arms about each other they were good friends until after the funeral and then they divided up the children and never spoke to each other again lee chong stood in back of the cigar counter and his nice brown eyes were turned inward on a calm eternal chinese sorrow he knew he could not have helped it but he wished he might have known and perhaps tried to help it was deeply a part of lees kindness and understanding that mans right to kill himself is inviolable but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary lee had already underwritten the funeral and sent a wash basket of groceries to the stricken families now lee chong owned the abbeville building a good roof a good floor two windows and a door true it was piled high with fish meal and the smell of it was delicate and penetrating lee chong considered it as a storehouse for groceries as a kind of warehouse but he gave that up on second thought it was too far away and anyone can go in through a window he was tapping the rubber mat with his gold ring and considering the problem when the door opened and mack came in mack was the elder leader mentor and to a small extent the exploiter of a little group of men who had in common no families no money and no ambitions beyond food drink and contentment but whereas most men in their search for contentment destroy themselves and fall wearily short of their targets mack and his friends approached contentment casually quietly and absorbed it gently mack and hazel a young man of great strength eddie who filled in as a bartender at la ida hughie and jones who occasionally collected frogs and cats for western biological were currently living in those large rusty pipes in the lot next to lee chongs that is they lived in the pipes when it was damp but in fine weather they lived in the shadow of the black cypress tree at the top of the lot the limbs folded down and made a canopy under which a man could lie and look at the flow and vitality of cannery row lee chong stiffened ever so slightly when mack came in and his eyes glanced quickly about the store to make sure that eddie or hazel or hughie or jones had not come in too and drifted away among the groceries mack laid out his cards with a winning honesty lee he said i and eddie and the rest heard you own the abbevile place lee chong nodded and waited i and my friends thought wed ast you if we could move in there well keep up the property he added quickly wouldnt let anybody break in or hurt anything kids might knock out the windows you know mack suggested place might burn down if somebody dont keep an eye on it lee tilted his head back and looked into macks eyes through the halfglasses and lees tapping finger slowed its tempo as he thought deeply in macks eyes there was good will and good fellowship and a desire to make everyone happy why then did lee chong feel slightly surrounded why did his mind pick its way as delicately as a cat through cactus it had been sweetly done almost in a spirit of philanthropy lees mind leaped ahead at the possibilities no they were probabilities and his finger tapping slowed still further he saw himself refusing macks request and he saw the broken glass from the windows then mack would offer a second time to watch over and preserve lees property and at the second refusal lee could smell the smoke could see the little flames creeping up the walls mack and his friends would try to help to put it out lees finger came to a gentle rest on the change mat he was beaten he knew that there was left to him only the possibility of saving face and mack was likely to be very generous about that lee said you like pay lent my place you like live there same hotel mack smiled broadly and he was generous say he cried thats an idear sure how much lee considered he knew it didnt matter what he charged he wasnt going to get it anyway he might just as well make it a really sturdy facesaving sum ti dolla week said lee mack played it through to the end ill have to talk to the boys about it he said dubiously couldnt you make that four dollars a week fi dolla said lee firmly well ill see what the boys say said mack and that was the way it was everyone was happy about it and if it be thought that lee chong suffered a total loss at least his mind did not work that way the windows were not broken fire did not break out and while no rent was ever paid if the tenants ever had any money and quite often they did have it never occurred to them to spend it any place except at lee chongs grocery what he had was a little group of active potential customers under wraps but it went further than that if a drunk caused trouble in the grocery if the kids swarmed down from new monterey intent on plunder lee chong had only to call and his tenants rushed to his aid one further bond it established you cannot steal from your benefactor the saving to lee chong in cans of beans and tomatoes and milk and watermelons more than paid the rent and if there was a sudden and increased leakage among the groceries in new monterey that was none of lee chongs affair the boys moved in and the fish meal moved out no one knows who named the house that has been known ever after as the palace flophouse and grill in the pipes and under the cypress tree there had been no room for furniture and the little niceties which are not only the diagnosis but the boundaries of our civilization once in the palace flophouse the boys set about furnishing it a chair appeared and a cot and another chair a hardware store supplied a can of red paint not reluctantly because it never knew about it and as a new table or footstool appeared it was painted which not only made it very pretty but also disguised it to a certain extent in case a former owner looked in and the palace flophouse and grill began to function the boys could sit in front of their door and look down across the track and across the lot and across the street right into the front windows of western biological they could hear the music from the laboratory at night and their eyes followed doc across the street when he went to lee chongs for beer and mack said that doc is a fine fellow we ought to do something for him chapter ii the word is a symbol and a delight which sucks up men and scenes trees plants factories and pekinese then the thing becomes the word and back to thing again but warped and woven into a fantastic pattern the word sucks up cannery row digests it and spews it out and the row has taken the shimmer of the green world and the skyreflecting seas lee chong is more than a chinese grocer he must be perhaps he is evil balanced and held suspended by good an asiatic planet held to its orbit by the pull of lao tze and held away from lao tze by the centrifugality of abacus and cash register lee chong suspended spinning whirling among groceries and ghosts a hard man with a can of beans a soft man with the bones of his grandfather for lee chong dug into the grave on china point and found the yellow bones the skull with gray ropy hair still sticking to it and lee carefully packed the bones femurs and tibias really straight skull in the middle with pelvis and clavicle surrounding it and ribs curving on either side then lee chong sent his boxed and brittle grandfather over the western sea to lie at last in ground made holy by his ancestors mack and the boys too spinning in their orbits they are the virtues the graces the beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of monterey and the cosmic monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them mack and the boys are the beauties the virtues the graces in the world ruled by tigers with ulcers tutted by strictured bulls scavenged by blind jackals mack and the boys dine delicately with the tigers fondle the frantic heifers and wrap up the crumbs to feed the sea gulls of cannery row what can it profit a man to gain the whole world and to come to his property with a gastric ulcer a blown prostate and bifocals mack and the boys avoid the trap walk around the poison step over the noose while a generation of trapped poisoned and trussedup men scream at them and call them nogoods cometobadends blotsonthetown thieves rascals bums our father who art in nature who has given the gift of survival to the coyote the common brown rat the english sparrow the house fly and the moth must have a great and overwhelming love for nogoods and blotsonthetown and bums and mack and the boys virtues and graces and laziness and zest our father who art in nature chapter iii lee chongs is to the right of the vacant lot although why it is called vacant when it is piled high with old boilers with rusting pipes with great square timbers and stacks of fivegallon cans no one can say up in back of the vacant lot is the railroad track and the palace flophouse but on the leftband boundary of the lot is the stern and stately whore house of dora flood a decent clean honest oldfashioned sporting house where a man can take a glass of beer among friends this is no flybynight cheap dipjoint but a sturdy virtuous dub built maintained and disciplined by dora who madam and girl for fifty years has through the exercise of special gifts of tact and honesty charity and a certain realism made herself respected by the intelligent the learned and the kind and by the same token she is hated by the twisted and lascivious sisterhood of married spinsters whose husbands respect the home but dont like it very much dora is a great woman a great big woman with flaming orange hair and a taste for nile green evening dresses she keeps an honest one price house sells no hard liquor and permits no loud or vulgar talk in her house of her girls some are fairly inactive due to age and infirmities but dora never puts them aside although as she says some of them dont turn three tricks a month but they go right on eating three meals a day in a moment of local love dora named her place the bear flag restaurant and the stories are many of people who have gone in for a sandwich there are normally twelve girls in the house counting the old ones a greek cook and a man who is known as a watchman but who undertakes all manner of delicate and dangerous tasks he stops fights ejects drunks soothes hysteria cures headaches and tends bar he bandages cuts and bruises passes the time of day with cops and since a good half of the girls are christian scientists reads aloud his share of science and health on a sunday morning his predecessor being a less wellbalanced man came to an evil end as shall be reported but alfred has triumphed over his environment and has brought his environment up with him he knows what men should be there and what men shouldnt be there he knows more about the home life of monterey citizens than anyone in town as for dora she leads a ticklish existence being against the law at least against its letter she must be twice as law abiding as anyone else there must be no drunks no fighting no vulgarity or they close dora up also being illegal dora must be especially philanthropic everyone puts the bite on her if the police give a dance for their pension fund and everyone else gives a dollar dora has to give fifty dollars when the chamber of commerce improved its gardens the merchants each gave five dollars but dora was asked for and gave a hundred with everything else it is the same red cross community chest boy scouts doras unsung unpublicized shameless dirty wages of sin lead the list of donations but during the depression she was hardest hit in addition to the usual charities dora saw the hungry children of cannery row and the jobless fathers and the worried women and dora paid grocery bills right and left for two years and very nearly went broke in the process doras girls are well trained and pleasant they never speak to a man on the street although he may have been in the night before before alfy the present watchman took over there was a tragedy in the bear flag restaurant which saddened everyone the previous watchman was named william and he was a dark and lonesomelooking man in the daytime when his duties were few he would grow tired of female company through the windows he could see mack and the boys sitting on the pipes in the vacant lot dangling their feet in the mallow weeds and taking the sun while they discoursed slowly and philosophically of matters of interest but of no importance now and then as he watched them he saw them take out a pint of old tennis shoes and wiping the neck of the bottle on a sleeve raise the pint one after another and william began to wish he could join that good group he walked out one day and sat on the pipe conversation stopped and an uneasy and hostile silence fell on the group after a while william went disconsolately back to the bear flag and through the window he saw the conversation spring up again and it saddened him he had a dark and ugly face and a mouth twisted with brooding the next day he went again and this time he took a pint of whiskey mack and the boys drank the whiskey after all they werent crazy but all the talking they did was good luck and lookin at you after a while william went back to the bear flag and he watched them through the window and he heard mack raise his voice saying but god damn it i hate a pimp now this was obviously untrue although william didnt know that mack and the boys just didnt like william now williams heart broke the bums would not receive him socially they felt that he was too far beneath them william had always been introspective and selfaccusing he put on his hat and walked out along the sea clear out to the lighthouse and he stood in the pretty little cemetery where you can hear the waves drumming always william thought dark and broody thoughts no one loved him no one cared about him they might call him a watchman but he was a pimp a dirty pimp the lowest thing in the world and then he thought how he had a right to live and be happy just like anyone else by god he had he walked back angrily but his anger went away when he came to the bear flag and climbed the steps it was evening and the juke box was playing harvest moon and william remembered that the first hooker who ever gaffed for him used to like that song before she ran away and got married and disappeared the song made him awfully sad dora was in the back parlor having a cup of tea when william came in she said whats the matter you sick no said william but whats the percentage i feel lousy i think ill bump myself off dora had handled plenty of neurotics in her time kid em out of it was her motto well do it on your own time and dont mess up the rugs she said a gray damp cloud folded over williams heart and he walked slowly out and down the ball and knocked on eva flanegans door she had red hair and went to confession every week eva was quite a spiritual girl with a big family of brothers and sisters but she was an unpredictable drunk she was painting her nails and messing them pretty badly when william went in and he knew she was bagged and dora wouldnt let a bagged girl work her fingers were nail polish to the first joint and she was angry whats eating you she said william grew angry too im going to bump myself off he said fiercely eva screeched at him thats a dirty lousy stinking sin she cried and then wouldnt it be like you to get the joint pinched just when i got almost enough kick to take a trip to east st louis youre a nogood bastard she was still screaming at him when william shut her door after him and went to the kitchen he was very tired of women the greek would be restful after women the greek big apron sleeves rolled up was frying pork chops in two big skillets turning them over with an ice pick hello kits how is going things the pork chops hissed and swished in the pan i dont know lou said william sometimes i think the best thing to do would be kluck he drew his finger across his throat the greek laid the ice pick on the stove and rolled his sleeves higher i tell you what i hear kits he said i hear like the fella talks about it dont never do it williams hand went out for the ice pick and he held it easily in his hand his eyes looked deeply into the greeks dark eyes and he saw disbelief and amusement and then as he stared the greeks eyes grew troubled and then worried and william saw the change saw first how the greek knew he could do it and then the greek knew he would do it as soon as he saw that in the greeks eyes william knew he had to do it he was sad because now it seemed silly his hand rose and the ice pick snapped into his heart it was amazing how easily it went in william was the watchman before alfred came everyone liked alfred he could sit on the pipes with mack and the boys any time he could even visit up at the palace flophouse chapter iv in the evening just at dusk a curious thing happened on cannery row it happened in the time between sunset and the lighting of the street light there is a small quiet gray period then down the hill past the palace flophouse down the chicken walk and through the vacant lot came an old chinaman he wore an ancient flat straw hat blue jeans both coat and trousers and heavy shoes of which one sole was loose so that it slapped the ground when he walked in his hand he carried a covered wicker basket his face was lean and brown and corded as jerky and his old eyes were brown even the whites were brown and deep set so that they looked out of holes he came by just at dusk and crossed the street and went through the opening between western biological and the hediondo cannery then he crossed the little beach and disappeared among the piles and steel posts which support the piers no one saw him again until dawn but in the dawn during that time when the street light has been turned off and the daylight has not come the old chinaman crept out from among the piles crossed the beach and the street his wicker basket was heavy and wet and dripping now his loose sole flapflapped on the street he went up the hill to the second street went through a gate in a high board fence and was not seen again until evening people sleeping heard his flapping shoe go by and they awakened for a moment it had been happening for years but no one ever got used to him some people thought he was god and very old people thought he was death and children thought he was a very funny old chinaman as children always think anything old and strange is funny but the children did not taunt him or shout at him as they should for he carried a little cloud of fear about with him only one brave and beautiful boy of ten named andy from salinas ever crossed the old chinaman andy was visiting in monterey and he saw the old man and knew he must shout at him if only to keep his selfrespect but even andy brave as he was felt the little cloud of fear andy watched him go by evening after evening while his duty and his terror wrestled and then one evening andy braced himself and marched behind the old man singing in a shrill falsetto chingchong chinaman sitting on a rail long came a white man an chopped off his tail the old man stopped and turned andy stopped the deepbrown eyes looked at andy and the thin corded lips moved what happened then andy was never able either to explain or to forget for the eyes spread out until there was no chinaman and then it was one eye one huge brown eye as big as a church door andy looked through the shiny transparent brown door and through it he saw a lonely countryside flat for miles but ending against a row of fantastic mountains shaped like cows and dogs heads and tents and mushrooms there was low coarse grass on the plain and here and there a little mound and a small animal like a woodchuck sat on each mound and the loneliness the desolate cold aloneness of the landscape made andy whimper because there wasnt anybody at all in the world and he was left andy shut his eyes so he wouldnt have to see it any more and when he opened them he was in cannery row and the old chinaman was just flapflapping between western biological and the hediondo cannery andy was the only boy who ever did that and he never did it again chapter v western biological was right across the street and facing the vacant lot lee chongs grocery was on its cattycorner right and doras bear flag restaurant was on its cattycorner left western biological deals in strange and beautiful wares it sells the lovely animals of the sea the sponges tunicates anemones the stars and buttlestars and sun stars the bivalves barnacles the worms and shells the fabulous and multiform little brothers the living moving flowers of the sea nudibranchs and tectibranchs the spiked and nobbed and needly urchins the crabs and demicrabs the little dragons the snapping shrimps and ghost shrimps so transparent that they hardly throw a shadow and western biological sells bugs and snails and spiders and rattlesnakes and rats and honey bees and gila monsters these are all for sale then there are little unborn humans some whole and others sliced thin and mounted on slides and for students there are sharks with the blood drained out and yellow and blue color substituted in veins and arteries so that you may follow the systems with a scalpel and there are cats with colored veins and arteries and frogs the same you can order anything living from western biological and sooner or later you will get it it is a low building facing the street the basement is the storeroom with shelves shelves clear to the ceiling loaded with jars of preserved animals and in the basement is a sink and instruments for embalming and for injecting then you go through the backyard to a covered shed on piles over the ocean and here are the tanks for the larger animals the sharks and rays and octopi each in their concrete tanks there is a stairway up the front of the building and a door that opens into an office where there is a desk piled high with unopened mail filing cabinets and a safe with the door propped open once the safe got locked by mistake and no one knew the combination and in the safe was an open can of sardines and a piece of roquefort cheese before the combination could be sent by the maker of the lock there was trouble in the safe it was then that doc devised a method for getting revenge on a bank if anyone should ever want to rent a safety deposit box he said then deposit in it one whole fresh salmon and go away for six months after the trouble with the safe it was not permitted to keep food there any more it is kept in the filing cabinets behind the office is a room where in aquaria are many living animals there also are the microscopes and the slides and the drug cabinets the cases of laboratory glass the work benches and little motors the chemicals from this room come smells formaline and dry starfish and sea water and menthol carbolic acid and acetic acid smell of brown wrapping paper and straw and rope smell of chloroform and ether smell of ozone from the motors smell of fine steel and thin lubricant from the microscopes smell of banana oil and rubber tubing smell of drying wool socks and boots sharp pungent smell of rattlesnakes and musty frightening smell of rats and through the back door comes the smell of kelp and barnacles when the tide is out and the smell of salt and spray when the tide is in to the left the office opens into a library the walls are bookcases to the ceiling boxes of pamphlets and separates books of all kinds dictionaries encyclopedias poetry plays a great phonograph stands against the wall with hundreds of records lined up beside it under the window is a redwood bed and on the walls and to the bookcases are pinned reproductions of daumiers and graham titian and leonardo and picasso dali and george grosz pinned here and there at eye level so that you can look at them if you want to there are chairs and benches in this little room and of course the bed as many as forty people have been here at one time behind this library or music room or whatever you want to call it is the kitchen a narrow chamber with a gas stove a water heater and a sink but whereas some food is kept in the filing cabinets in the office dishes and cooking fat and vegetables are kept in glassfronted sectional bookcases in the kitchen no whimsy dictated this it just happened from the ceiling of the kitchen hang pieces of bacon and salami and black bкchedemer behind the kitchen is a toilet and a shower the toilet leaked for five years until a clever and handsome guest fixed it with a piece of chewing gum doc is the owner and operator of the western biological laboratory doc is rather small deceptively small for he is wiry and very strong and when passionate anger comes on him he can be very fierce he wears a beard and his face is half christ and half satyr and his face tells the truth it is said that he has helped many a girl out of one trouble and into another doc has the hands of a brain surgeon and a cool warm mind doc tips his hat to dogs as he drives by and the dogs look up and smile at him he can kill anything for need but he could not even hurt a feeling for pleasure he has one great fear that of getting his head wet so that summer or winter he ordinarily wears a rain hat he will wade in a tide pool up to the chest without feeling damp but a drop of rain water on his head makes him panicky over a period of years doc dug himself into cannery row to an extent not even he suspected he became the fountain of philosophy and science and art in the laboratory the girls from doras heard the plain songs and gregorian music for the first time lee chong listened while li po was read to him in english henri the painter heard for the first time the book of the dead and was so moved that he changed his medium henri had been painting with glue iron rust and colored thicken feathers but he changed and his next four paintings were done entirely with different kinds of nutshells doc would listen to any kind of nonsense and change it for you to a kind of wisdom his mind had no horizon and his sympathy had no warp he could talk to children telling them very pro found things so that they understood he lived in a world of wonders of excitement he was concupiscent as a rabbit and gentle as hell everyone who knew him was indebted to him and everyone who thought of him thought next i really must do something nice for doc chapter vi doc was collecting marine animals in the great tide pool on the tip of the peninsula it is a fabulous place when the tide is in a wavechurned basin creamy with foam whipped by the combers that roll in from the whistling buoy on the reef but when the tide goes out the little water world becomes quiet and lovely the sea is very clear and the bottom becomes fantastic with hurrying fighting feeding breeding animals crabs rush from frond to frond of the waving algae starfish squat over mussels and limpets attach their million little suckers and then slowly lift with incredible power until the prey is broken from the rock and then the starfish stomach comes out and envelops its food orange and speckled and fluted nudibranchs slide gracefully over the rocks their skirts waving like the dresses of spanish dancers and black eels poke their heads out of crevices and wait for prey the snapping shrimps with their trigger daws pop loudly the lovely colored world is glassed over hermit crabs like frantic children scamper on the bottom sand and now one finding an empty snail shell he likes better than his own creeps out exposing his soft body to the enemy for a moment and then pops into the new shell a wave breaks over the barrier and churns the glassy water for a moment and mixes bubbles into the pool and then it clears and is tranquil and lovely and murderous again here a crab tears a leg from his brother the anemones expand like soft and brilliant flowers inviting any tired and perplexed animal to lie for a moment in their arms and when some small crab or little tidepool johnnie accepts the green and purple invitation the petals whip in the stinging cells shoot tiny narcotic needles into the prey and it grows weak and perhaps sleepy while the searing caustic digestive acids melt its body down then the creeping murderer the octopus steals out slowly softly moving like a gray mist pretending now to be a bit of weed now a rock now a lump of decaying meat while its evil goat eyes watch coldly it oozes and flows toward a feed lag crab and as it comes close its yellow eyes burn and its body turns rosy with the pulsing color of anticipation and rage then suddenly it runs lightly on the tips of its arms as ferociously as a charging cat it leaps savagely on the crab there is a puff of black fluid and the struggling mass is obscured in the sepia cloud while the octopus murders the crab on the exposed rocks out of water the barnacles bubble behind their closed doors and the limpets dry out and down to the rocks come the black flies to eat anything they can find the sharp smell of iodine from the algae and the lime smell of calcareous bodies and the smell of powerful protean smell of sperm and ova fill the air on the exposed rocks the starfish emit semen and eggs from between their rays the smells of life and richness of death and digestion of decay and birth burden the air and salt spray blows in from the barrier where the ocean waits for its risingtide strength to permit it back into the great tide pool again and on the reef the whistling buoy bellows like a sad and patient bull in the pool doc and hazel worked together hazel lived in the palace flophouse with mack and the boys hazel got his name in as haphazard a way as his life was ever afterward his worried mother had had seven children in eight years hazel was the eighth and his mother became confused about his sex when he was born she was tired and run down anyway from trying to feed and clothe seven children and their father she had tried every possible way of making money paper flowers mushrooms at home rabbits for meat and fur while her husband from a canvas chair gave her every help his advice and reasoning and criticism could offer she had a great aunt named hazel who was reputed to carry life insurance the eighth child was named hazel before the mother got it through her head that hazel was a boy and by that time she was used to the name and never bothered to change it hazel grew up did four years in grammer school four years in reform school and didnt learn anything in either place reform schools are supposed to teach viciousness and criminality but hazel didnt pay enough attention he came out of reform school as innocent of viciousness as he was of fractions and long division hazel loved to hear conversation but he didnt listen to words just to the tone of conversation he asked questions not to hear the answers but simply to continue the flow he was twentysix darkhaired and pleasant strong willing and loyal quite often he went collecting with doc and he was very good at it once he knew what was wanted his fingers could creep like an octopus could grab and hold like an anemone he was surefooted on the slippery rocks and he loved the hunt doc wore his rain hat and high rubber boots as he worked but hazel sloshed about in tennis shoes and blue jeans they were collecting starfish doc had an order for three hundred hazel picked a nobby purplish starfish from the bottom of the pool and popped it into his nearly full gunny sack i wonder what they do with them he said do with what doc asked the starfish said hazel you sell em youll send out a barrel of em what do the guys do with em you cant eat em they study them said doc patiently and he remembered that he had answered this question for hazel dozens of times before but doc had one mental habit he could not get over when anyone asked a question doc thought he wanted to know the answer that was the way with doc he never asked unless he wanted to know and he could not conceive of the brain that would ask without wanting to know but hazel who simply wanted to hear talk had developed a system of making the answer to one question the basis of another it kept conversation going what do they find to study hazel continued theyre just starfish theres millions of em around i could get you a million of em theyre complicated and interesting animals doc said a little defensively besides these are going to the middle west to northwestern university hazel used his trick they got no starfish there they got no ocean there said doc oh said hazel and he cast frantically about for a peg to hang a new question on he hated to have a conversation die out like this he wasnt quick enough while he was looking for a question doc asked one hazel hated that it meant casting about in his mind for an answer and casting about in hazels mind was like wandering alone in a deserted museum hazels mind was choked with uncatalogued exhibits he never forgot anything but he never bothered to arrange his memories everything was thrown together like fishing tacide in the bottom of a rowboat hooks and sinkers and line and lures and galis all snarled up doc asked how are things going up at the palace hazel ran his fingers through his dark hair and he peered into the dutter of his mind pretty good he said that fellow gay is moving in with us i guess his wife hits him pretty bad he dont mind that when hes awake but she waits til he gets to sleep and then hits him he hates that he has to wake up and beat her up and then when he goes back to sleep she hits him again he dont get any rest so hes moving in with us thats a new one said doc she used to swear out a warrant and put him in jail yeah said hazel but that was before they built the new jail in salinas used to be thirty days and gay was pretty hot to get out but this new jail radio in the tank and good bunks and the sheriffs a nice fellow gay gets in there and he dont want to come out he likes it so much his wife wont get him arrested any more so she figured out this hitting him while hes asleep its nerve racking he says and you know as good as me gay never did take any pleasure beating her up he only done it to keep his selfrespect but he gets tired of it i guess hell be with us now doc straightened up the waves were beginning to break over the barrier of the great tide pool the tide was coming in and little rivers from the sea had begun to flow over the rocks the wind blew freshly in from the whistling buoy and the barking of sea lions came from around the point doc pushed his rain hat on the back of his head weve got enough starash he said and then went on look hazel i know youve got six or seven undersized abalones in the bottom of your sack if we get stopped by a game warden youre going to say theyre mine on my permit arent you well hell said hazel look doc said kindly suppose i get an order for abalones and maybe the game warden thinks im using my collecting permit too often suppose he thinks im eating them well hell said hazel its like the industrial alcohol board theyve got suspicious minds they always think im drinking the alcohol they think that about everyone well aint you not much of it said doc that stuff they put in it tastes terrible and its a big job to redistill it that stuff aint so bad said hazel me and mack had a snort of it the other day what is it they put in doc was about to answer when he saw it was hazels trick again lets get moving he said he hoisted his sack of starfish on his shoulder and he had forgotten the illegal abalones in the bottom of hazels sack hazel followed him up out of the tide pool and up the slippery trail to solid ground the little crabs scampered and skittered out of their way hazel felt that he had better cement the grave over the topic of the abalones that painter guy came back to the palace he offered yes said doc yeah you see he done all our pictures in chicken feathers and now he says he got to do them all over again with nutshells he says he changed his his med medium doc chuckled he still building his boat sure said hazel hes got it all changed around new kind of a boat i guess hell take it apart and change it doc is he nuts doc swung his heavy sack of starfish to the ground and stood panting a little nuts he asked oh yes i guess so nuts about the same amount we are only in a different way such a thing had never occurred to hazel he looked upon himself as a crystal pool of darity and on his life as a troubled glass of misunderstood virtue docs last statement had outraged him a little but that boat he cried hes been building that boat for seven years that i know of the blocks rotted out and he made concrete blocks every time he gets it nearly finished he changes it and starts over again i think hes nuts seven years on a boat doc was sitting on the ground pulling off his rubber boots you dont understand he said gently henri loves boats but hes afraid of the ocean whats he want a boat for then hazel demanded he likes boats said doc but suppose he finishes his boat once its finished people will say why dont you put it in the water then if he puts it in the water hell have to go out in it and he hates the water so you see he never finishes the boat so he doesnt ever have to launch it hazel had followed this reasoning to a certain point but he abandoned it before it was resolved not only abandoned it but searched for some way to change the subject i think hes nuts he said lamely on the black earth on which the ice plants bloomed hundreds of black stink bugs crawled and many of them stuck their tails up in the air look at all them stink bugs hazel remarked grateful to the bugs for being there theyre interesting said doc well what they got their asses up in the air for doc rolled up his wool socks and put them in the rubber boots and from his pocket he brought out dry socks and a pair of thin moccasins i dont know why he said i looked them up recently theyre very common animals and one of the commonest things they do is put their tails up in the air and in all the books there isnt one mention of the fact that they put their tails up in the air or why hazel turned one of the stink bugs over with the toe of his wet tennis shoe and the shining black beetle strove madly with floundering legs to get upright again well why do you think they do it i think theyre praying said doc what hazel was shocked the remarkable thing said doc isnt that they put their tails up in the air the really incredibly remarkable thing is that we find it remarkable we can only use ourselves as yardsticks if we did something as inexplicable and strange wed probably be praying so maybe theyre praying lets get the hell out of here said hazel chapter vii the palace flophouse was no sudden development indeed when mack and hazel and eddie and hughie and jones moved into it they looked upon it as little more than shelter from the wind and the rain as a place to go when everything else had closed or when their welcome was thin and sere with overuse then the palace was only a long bare room lit dimly by two small windows walled with unpainted wood smelling strongly of fish meal they had not loved it then but mack knew that some kind of organization was necessary particularly among such a group of ravening individualists a training army which has not been equipped with guns and artillery and tanks uses artificial guns and masquerading trucks to simulate its destructive panoply and its toughening soldiers get used to field guns by handling logs on wheels mack with a piece of chalk drew five oblongs on the floor each seven feet long and four feet wide and in each square he wrote a name these were the simulated beds each man had property rights inviolable in his space he could legally fight a man who encroached on his square the rest of the room was property common to all that was in the first days when mack and the boys sat on the floor played cards hunkered down and slept on the hard boards perhaps save for an accident of weather they might always have lived that way however an unprecedented rainfall which went on for over a month changed all that houseridden the boys grew tired of squatting on the floor their eyes became outraged by the bare board walls because it sheltered them the house grew dear to them and it had the charm of never knowing the entrance of an outraged landlord for lee chong never came near it then one afternoon hughie came in with an army cot which bad a torn canvas he spent two hours sewing up the rip with fishing line and that night the others lying on the floor in their squares watched hughie ooze gracefully into his cot they heard him sigh with abysmal comfort and he was asleep and snoring before anyone else the next day mack puffed up the hill carrying a rusty set of springs he had found on a scrapiron dump the apathy was broken then the boys outdid one another in beautifying the palace flophouse until after a few months it was if anything overfurnished there were old carpets on the floor chairs with and without seats mack had a wicker chaise longue painted bright red there were tables a grandfather dock without dial face or works the walls were whitewashed which made it almost light and airy pictures began to appear mostly calendars showing improbable luscious blondes holding bottles of cocacola henri had contributed two pieces from his chickenfeather period a bundle of gilded cattails stood in one corner and a sheaf of peacock feathers was nailed to the wall beside the grandfather dock they were some time acquiring a stove and when they did find what they wanted a silverscrolled monster with floriated warming ovens and a front like a nickelplated tulip garden they had trouble getting it it was too big to steal and its owner refused to part with it to the sick widow with eight children whom mack invented and patronized in the same moment the owner wanted a dollar and a half and didnt come down to eighty cents for three days the boys closed at eighty cents and gave him an iou which he probably still has this transaction took place in seaside and the stove weighed three hundred pounds mack and hughie exhausted every possibility of haulage for ten days and only when they realized that no one was going to take this stove home for them did they begin to carry it it took them three days to carry it to cannery row a distance of five miles and they camped beside it at night but once installed in the palace flophouse it was the glory and the hearth and the center its nickel flowers and foliage shone with a cheery light it was the gold tooth of the palace fired up it warmed the big room its oven was wonderful and you could fry an egg on its shiny black lids with the great stove came pride and with pride the palace became home eddie planted morning glories to run over the door and hazel acquired some rather rare fuchsia bushes planted in fivegallon cans which made the entrance formal and a little cluttered mack and the boys loved the palace and they even cleaned it a little sometimes in their minds they sneered at unsettled people who had no house to go to and occasionally in their pride they brought a guest home for a day or two eddie was understudy bartender at la ida he filled in when whitey the regular bartender was sick which was as often as whitey could get away with it every time eddie filled in a few bottles disappeared so he couldnt fill in too often but whitey liked to have eddie take his place because he was convinced and correctly that eddie was one man who wouldnt try to keep his job permanently almost anyone could have trusted eddie to this extent eddie didnt have to remove much liquor he kept a gallon jug under the bar and in the mouth of the jug there was a funnel anything left in the glasses eddie poured into the funnel before he washed the glasses if an argument or a song were going on at la ida or late at night when good fellowship had reached its logical conclusion eddie poured glasses half or twothirds full into the funnel the resulting punch which he took back to the palace was always interesting and sometimes surprising the mixture of rye beer bourbon scotch wine rum and gin was fairly constant but now and then some effete customer would order a stinger or an anisette or a curasao and these little touches gave a distinct character to the punch it was eddies habit always to shake a little angostura into the jug just before he left on a good night eddie got threequarters of a gallon it was a source of satisfaction to him that nobody was out anything he had observed that a man got just as drunk on half a glass as on a whole one that is if he was in the mood to get drunk stall eddie was a very desirable inhabitant of the palace flophouse the others never asked him to help with the housecleaning and once hazel washed four pairs of eddies socks now on the afternoon when hazel was out collecting with doc in the great tide pool the boys were sitting around in the palace sipping the result of eddies latest contribution gay was there too the latest member of the group eddie sipped speculatively from his glass and smacked his lips its funny how you get a run he said take last night there was at least ten guys ordered manhattans sometimes maybe you dont get two calls for a manhattan in a month its the grenadine gives the stuff that taste mack tasted his a big taste and refilled his glass yes he said somberly its little things make the difference he looked about to see how this gem had set with the others only gay got the full impact sure is he said does wheres hazel today mack asked jones said hazel went out with doc to get some starfish mack nodded his head soberly that doc is a hell of a nice fella he said hell give you a quarter any time when i cut myself he put on a new bandage every day a hell of a nice fella the others nodded in profound agreement i been wondering for a long time mack continued what we could do for him something nice something hed like hed like a dame said hughie hes got three four dames said jones you can always tell when he pulls them front curtains closed and when he plays that kind of church music on the phonograph mack said reprovingly to hughie just because he doesnt run no dame naked through the streets in the daytime you think docs celebrate whats celebrate eddie asked thats when you cant get no dame said mack i thought it was a kind of a party said jones a silence fell on the room mack shifted in his chaise longue hughie let the front legs of his chair down on the floor they looked into space and then they all looked at mack mack said hum eddie said what kind of a party you think docd like what other kind is there said jones mack mused doc wouldnt like this stuff from the winin jug how do you know hughie demanded you never offered him none oh i know said mack hes been to college once i seen a dame in a fur coat go in there never did see her come out it was two oclock the last i looked and that church music goin no you couldnt offer him none of this he filled his glass again this tastes pretty nice after the third glass hughie said loyally no said mack not for doc have to be whiskey the real thing he likes beer said jones hes all the time going over to zees for beer sometimes in the middle of the night mack said i figure when you buy beer youre buying too much tare take per cent beer why youre spending your dough for percent water and color and hops and stuff like that eddie he added you think you could get four five bottles of whiskey at la ida next time whiteys sick sure said eddie sure i could get it but thatd be the end no more golden eggs i think johnnies suspicious anyways other day he says i smell a mouse named eddie i was gonna lay low and only bring the jug for a while yeah said jones dont you lose that job if something happened to whitey you could fall right in there for a week or so til they got somebody else i guess if were goin to give a party for doc we got to buy the whiskey how much is whiskey a gallon i dont know said hughie i never get more than a half pint at a time myself at one time that is i figure you get a quart and right away you got friends but you get a half pint and you can drink it in the lot beforewell before you got a lot of folks around its going to take dough to give doc a party said mack if were going to give him a party at all it ought to be a good one should have a big cake i wonder when is his birthday dont need a birthday for a party said jones no but its nice said mack i figure it would take ten or twelve bucks to give doc a party you wouldnt be ashamed of they looked at one another speculatively hughie suggested the hediondo cannery is hiring guys no said mack quickly we got good reputations and we dont want to spoil them every one of us keeps a job for a month or more when we take one thats why we can always get a job when we need one spose we take a job for a day or so why well lose our reputation for sticking then if we needed a job there wouldnt nobody have us the rest nodded quick agreement i figure im gonna work a couple of months november and part of december said jones makes it nice to have money around christmas we could cook a turkey this year by god we could said mack i know a place up carmel valley where theres fifteen hundred in one flock valley said hughie you know i used to collect stuff up the valley for doc turtles and crayfish and frogs got a nickel apiece for frogs me too said gay i got five hundred frogs one time if doc needs frogs its a setup said mack we could go up the carmel river and have a little outing and we wouldnt tell doc what it was for and then wed give him one hell of a party a quiet excitement grew in the palace flophouse gay said mack take a look out the door and see if docs car is in front of his place gay set down his glass and looked out not yet he said well he ought to be back any minute said mack now heres how well go about it chapter viii in april the boiler at the hediondo cannery blew a tube for the third time in two weeks and the board of directors consisting of mr randolph and a stenographer decided that it would be cheaper to buy a new boiler than to have to shut down so often in time the new boiler arrived and the old one was moved into the vacant lot between lee chongs and the bear flag restaurant where it was set on blocks to await an inspiration on mr randolphs part on how to make some money out of it gradually the plant engineer removed the tubing to use to patch other outworn equipment at the hediondo the boiler looked like an oldfashioned locomotive without wheels it had a big door in the center of its nose and a low fire door gradually it became red and soft with rust and gradually the mallow weeds grew up around it and the flaking rust fed the weeds flowering myrtle crept up its sides and the wild anise perfumed the air about it then someone threw out a datura root and the thick fleshy tree grew up and the great white bells hung down over the boiler door and at night the flowers smelled of love and excitement an incredibly sweet and moving odor in mr and mrs sam malloy moved into the boiler the tubing was all gone now and it was a roomy dry and safe apartment true if you came in through the fire door you bad to get down on your hands and knees but once in there was head room in the middle and you couldnt want a dryer warmer place to stay they shagged a mattress through the fire door and settled down mr malloy was happy and contented there and for quite a long time so was mrs malloy below the boiler on the hill there were numbers of large pipes also abandoned by the hediondo toward the end of there was a great catch of fish and the canneries were working full time and a housing shortage occurred then it was that mr malloy took to renting the larger pipes as sleeping quarters for single men at a very nominal fee with a piece of tar paper over one end and a square of carpet over the other they made comfortable bedrooms although men used to sleeping curled up had to change their habits or move out there were those too who claimed that their snores echoing back from the pipes woke them up but on the whole mr malloy did a steady small business and was happy mrs malloy bad been contented until her husband became a landlord and then she began to change first it was a rug then a washtub then a lamp with a colored silk shade finally she came into the boiler on her hands and knees one day and she stood up and said a little breathlessly holmans are having a sale of curtains real lace curtains and edges of blue and pink a set with curtain rods thrown in mr malloy sat up on the mattress curtains he demanded what in gods name do you want curtains for i like things nice said mrs malloy i always did like to have things nice for you and her lower lip began to tremble but darling sam malloy cried i got nothing against curtains i like curtains only mrs malloy quavered and you begrutch me and she sniffled and her chest heaved i dont begrutch you said mr malloy but darling for christs sake what are we going to do with curtains we got no windows mrs malloy cried and cried and sam held her in his arms and comforted her men just dont understand how a woman feels she sobbed men just never try to put themselves in a womans place and sam lay beside her and rubbed her back for a long time before she went to sleep chapter ix when docs car came back to the laboratory mack and the boys secretly watched hazel help to carry in the sacks of starfish in a few minutes hazel came damply up the thicken walk to the palace his jeans were wet with sea water to the thighs and where it was drying the white salt rings were forming he sat heavily in the patent rocker that was his and shucked off his wet tennis shoes mack asked how is doc feeling fine said hazel you cant understand a word he says know what he said about stink bugs no i better not tell you he seem in a nice friendly mood mack asked sure said hazel we got two three hundred starfish hes all right i wonder if we better all go over mack asked himself and he answered himself no i guess it would be better if one went alone it might get him mixed up if we all went what is this hazel asked we got plans said mack ill go myself so as not to startle him you guys stay here and wait ill come back in a few minutes mack went out and he teetered down the chicken walk and across the track mr malloy was sitting on a brick in front of his boiler how are you sam mack asked pretty good hows the missus pretty good said mr malloy you know any kind of glue you can stick cloth to iron ordinarily mack would have thrown himself headlong into this problem but now he was not to be deflected no he said he went across the vacant lot crossed the street and entered the basement of the laboratory doc had his hat off now since there was practically no chance of getting his head wet unless a pipe broke he was busy removing the starfish from the wet sacks and arranging them on the cool concrete floor the starfish were twisted and knotted up for a starfish loves to hang onto something and for an hour these had found only each other doc arranged them in long lines and very slowly they straightened out until they lay in symmetrical stars on the concrete floor docs pointed brown beard was damp with perspiration as he worked he looked up a little nervously as mack entered it was not that trouble always came in with mack but something always entered with him hiya doc said mack all right said doc uneasily hear about phyllis mae over at the bear flag she hit a drunk and got his tooth in her fist and its infected clear to the elbow she showed me the tooth it was out of a plate is a false tooth poison doc i guess everything that comes out of the human mouth is poison said doc warningfully has she got a doctor the bouncer fixed her up said mack ill take her some sulfa said doc and he waited for the storm to break he knew mack had come for something and mack knew he knew it mack said doc you got any need for any kind of animals now doc sighed with relief why he asked guardedly mack became open and confidential ill tell you doc i and the boys got to get some dough we simply got to its for a good purpose you might say a worthy cause phyllis maes arm mack saw the chance weighed it and gave it up well no he said its more important than that you cant kill a whore no this is different i and the boys thought if you needed something why wed get it for you and that way we could make a little piece of change it seemed simple and innocent doc laid down four more starfish in lines i could use three or four hundred frogs he said id get them myself but ive got to go down to la jolla tonight theres a good tide tomorrow and i have to get some octopi same price for frogs mack asked five cents apiece same price said doc mack was jovial dont you worry about frogs doc he said well get you all the frogs you want you just rest easy about frogs why we can get them right up carmel river i know a place good said doc ill take all you get but i need about three hundred just you rest easy doc dont you lose no sleep about it youll get your frogs maybe seven eight hundred he put the doc at his ease about frogs and then a little cloud crossed macks face doc he said any chance of using your car to go up the valley no said doc i told you i have to drive to la jolla tonight to make tomorrows tide oh said mack dispiritedly oh well dont you worry about it doc maybe we can get lee chongs old truck and then his face fell a little further doc he said on a business deal like this would you advance two or three bucks for gasoline i know lee chong wont give us gas no said doc he had fallen into this before once he had financed gay to go for turtles he financed him for two weeks and at the end of that time gay was in jail on his wifes charge and he never did go for turtles well maybe we cant go then said mack sadly now doc really needed the frogs he tried to work out some method which was business and not philanthropy ill tell you what ill do he said ill give you a note to my gas station so you can get ten gallons of gas how will that be mack smiled fine he said that will work out just fine i and the boys will get an early start tomorrow time you get back from the south well have more damn frogs than you ever seen in your life doc went to the labeling desk and wrote a note to red williams at the gas station authorizing the issue of ten gallons of gasoline to mack here you are he said mack was smiling broadly doc he said you can get to sleep tonight and not even give frogs a thought well have piss pots full of them by the time you get back doc watched him go a little uneasily docs dealings with mack and the boys had always been interesting but rarely had they been profitable to doc he remembered ruefully the time mack sold him fifteen torn cats and by night the owners came and got every one mack he had asked why all torn cats mack said doc its my own invention but ill tell you because youre a good friend you make a big wire trap and then you dont use bait you see well you use a lady cat catch every god damn torn cat in the country that way from the laboratory mack crossed the street and went through the swinging screen doors into lee chongs grocery mrs lee was cutting bacon on the big butchers block a lee cousin primped up slightly wilted heads of lettuce the way a girl primps a loose finger wave a cat lay asleep on a big pile of oranges lee chong stood in his usual place back of the cigar counter and in front of the liquor shelves his tapping finger on the change mat speeded up a little when mack came in mack wasted no time in sparring lee he said doc over theres got a problem hes got a big order for frogs from the new york museum means a lot to doc besides the dough theres a lot of credit getting an order like that docs got to go south and i and the boys said wed help him out i think a guys friends ought to help him out of a hole when they can especially a nice guy like doc why i bet he spends sixty seventy dollars a month with you lee chong remained silent and watchful his fat finger barely moved on the change mat but it flicked slightly like a tense cats tail mack plunged into his thesis will you let us take your old truck to go up carmel valley for frogs for doc for good old doc lee chong smiled in triumph tluck no good he said bloke down this staggered mack for a moment but he recovered he spread the order for gasoline on the cigar counter look he said doc needs them frogs he give me this order for gas to get them i cant let doc down now gay is a good mechanic if he fixes your truck and puts it in good shape will you let us take it lee put back his head so that he could see mack through his halfglasses there didnt seem to be anything wrong with the proposition the truck really wouldnt run gay really was a good mechanic and the order for gasoline was definite evidence of good faith how long you be gone lee asked maybe half a day maybe a whole day just til we get the frogs lee was worried but he couldnt see any way out the dangers were all there and lee knew all of them okay said lee good said mack i knew doc could depend on you ill get gay right to work on that truck he turned about to leave by the way he said docs paying us five cents apiece for those frogs were going to get seven or eight hundred how about taking a pint of old tennis shoes just til we can get back with the frogs no said lee chong chapter x frankie began coming to western biological when he was eleven years old for a week or so he just stood outside the basement door and looked in then one day he stood inside the door ten days later he was in the basement he had very large eyes and his hair was a dark wiry dirty shock his hands were filthy he picked up a piece of excelsior and put it in a garbage can and then he looked at doc where he worked labeling specimen bottles containing purple velella finally frankie got to the work bench and he put his dirty fingers on the bench it took frankie three weeks to get that far and he was ready to bolt every instant of the time finally one day doc spoke to him whats your name son frankie where do you live up there a gesture up the hill why arent you in school i dont go to school why not they dont want me there your hands are dirty dont you ever wash frankie looked stricken and then he went to the sink and scrubbed his hands and always afterwards he scrubbed his hands almost raw every day and he came to the laboratory every day it was an association without much talk doc by a telephone call established that what frankie said was true they didnt want him in school he couldnt learn and there was something a little wrong with his coordination there was no place for him he wasnt an idiot he wasnt dangerous his parents or parent would not pay for his keep in an institution frankie didnt often sleep at the laboratory but he spent his days there and sometimes he crawled in the excelsior crate and slept that was probably when there was a crisis at home doc asked why do you come here you dont hit me or give me a nickel said frankie do they hit you at home theres uncles around all the time at home some of them hit me and tell me to get out and some of them give me a nickel and tell me to get out wheres your father dead said frankie vaguely wheres your mother with the uncles doc clipped frankies hair and got rid of the lice at lee chongs he got him a new pair of overalls and a striped sweater and frankie became his slave i love you he said one afternoon oh i love you he wanted to work in the laboratory he swept out every day but there was something a little wrong he couldnt get a floor quite clean he tried to help with grading crayfish for size there they were in a bucket all sizes they were to be grouped in the big pans laid out all the threeinch ones together and all the fourinch ones and so forth frankie tried and the perspiration stood on his forehead but he couldnt do it size relationships just didnt get through to him no doc would say look frankie put them beside your finger like this so youll know which ones are this long see this one goes from the tip of your finger to the base of your thumb now you just pick out another one that goes from the tip of your finger down to the same place and it will be right frankie tried and he couldnt do it when doc went upstairs frankie crawled in the excelsior box and didnt come out all afternoon but frankie was a nice good kind boy he learned to light docs cigars and he wanted doc to smoke all the time so he could light the cigars better than anything else frankie loved it when there were parties upstairs in the laboratory when girls and men gathered to sit and talk when the great phonograph played music that throbbed in his stomach and made beautiful and huge pictures from vaguely in his head frankie loved it then he crouched down in a corner behind a chair where he was hidden and could watch and listen when there was laughter at a joke he didnt understand frankie laughed delightedly behind his chair and when the conversation dealt with abstractions his brows furrowed and he became intent and serious one afternoon he did a desperate thing there was a small party in the laboratory doc was in the kitchen pouring beer when frankie appeared beside him frankie grabbed a glass of beer and rushed it through the door and gave it to a girl sitting in a big chair she took the glass and said why thank you and she smiled at him and doc coming through the door said yes frankie is a great help to me frankie couldnt forget that he did the thing in his mind over and over just how he had taken the glass and just how the girl sat and then her voice why thank you and doc a great help to me frankie is a great help to me sure frankie is a great help frankie and oh my god he knew a big party was coming because doc bought steaks and a great deal of beer and doc let him help clean out all the upstairs but that was nothing for a great plan had formed in frankies mind and he could see just how it would be he went over it again and again it was beautiful it was perfect then the party started and people come and sat in the front room girls and young women and men frankie had to wait until he had the kitchen to himself and the door closed and it was some time before he had it so but at last he was alone and the door was shut he could hear the chatter of conversation and the music from the great phonograph be worked very quietly first the tray then get out the glasses without breaking any now fill them with beer and let the foam settle a little and then fill again now he was ready he took a great breath and opened the door the music and the talk roared around him frankie picked up the tray of beer and walked through the door he knew how he went straight toward the same young woman who had thanked him before and then right in front of her the thing happened the coordination failed the hands fumbled the panicked muscles the nerves telegraphed to a dead operator the responses did not come back tray and beer collapsed forward into the young womans lap for a moment frankie stood still and then he turned and ran the room was quiet they could hear him run downstairs and go into the cellar they heard a hollow scrabbling sound and then silence doc walked quietly down the stairs and into the cellar frankie was in the excelsior box burrowed down clear to the bottom with the pile of excelsior on top of him doc could hear him whimpering there doc waited for a moment and then he went quietly back upstairs there wasnt a thing in the world he could do chapter xi the model t ford truck of lee chong had a dignified history in it had been a passenger car belonging to dr w t waters he used it for five years and sold it to an insurance man named rattle mr rattle was not a careful man the car he got in clean nice condition he drove like fury mr rattle drank on saturday nights and the car suffered the fenders were broken and bent he was a pedal rider too and the bands had to be changed often when mr rattle embezzled a clients money and ran away to san jose he was caught with a highhair blonde and sent up within ten days the body of the car was so battered that its next owner cut it in two and added a little truck bed the next owner took off the front of the cab and the windshield he used it to haul squids and he liked a fresh breeze to blow in his face his name was francis almones and he had a sad life for he always made just a fraction less than he needed to live his father had left him a little money but year by year and month by month no matter how hard francis worked or how careful he was his money grew less until he just dried up and blew away lee chong got the truck in payment of a grocery bill by this time the truck was little more than four wheels and an engine and the engine was so crotchety and sullen and senile that it required expert care and consideration lee chong did not give it these things with the result that the truck stood in the tallgrass back of the grocery most of the time with the mallows growing between its spokes it had solid tires on its back wheels and blocks held its front wheels off the ground probably any one of the boys from the palace flophouse could have made the truck run for they were all competent practical mechanics but gay was an inspired mechanic there is no term comparable to green thumbs to apply to such a mechanic but there should be for there are men who can look listen tap make an adjustment and a machine works indeed there are men near whom a car runs better and such a one was gay his fingers on a timer or a carburetor adjustment screw were gentle and wise and sure he could fix the delicate electric motors in the laboratory he could have worked in the canneries all the time had he wished for in that industry which complains bitterly when it does not make back its total investment every year in profits the machinery is much less important than the fiscal statement indeed if you could can sardines with ledgers the owners would have been very happy as it was they used decrepit struggling old horrors of machines that needed the constant attention of a man like gay mack got the boys up early they had their coffee and immediately moved over to the truck where it lay among the weeds gay was in charge he kicked the blockedup front wheels go borrow a pump and get those pumped up he said then he put a stick in the gasoline tank under the board which served as a seat by some miracle there was a half inch of gasoline in the tank now gay went over the most probable difficulties he took out the coil boxes scraped the points adjusted the gap and put them back he opened the carburetor to see that gas came through he pushed on the crank to see that the whole shaft wasnt frozen and the pistons rusted in their cylinders meanwhile the pump arrived and eddie and jones spelled each other on the tires gay hummed dum tiddy dum tiddy as he worked he removed the spark plugs and scraped the points and bored the carbon out then gay drained a little gasoline into a can and poured some into each cylinder before he put the spark plugs back he straightened up were going to need a couple of dry cells he said see if lee chong will let us have a couple math departed and returned almost immediately with a universal no which was designed by lee chong to cover all future requests gay thought deeply i know wheres a couple pretty good ones too but i wont go get them where asked mack down cellar at my house said gay they run the front doorbell if one of you fellas wants to kind of edge into my cellar without my wife seeing you theyre on top of the side stringer on the left hand side as you go in but for gods sake dont let my wife catch you a conference elected eddie to go and he departed if you get caught dont mention me gay called out after him meanwhile gay tested the bands the lowhigh pedal didnt quite touch the floor so he knew there was a little band left the brake pedal did touch the floor so there was no brake but the reverse pedal had lots of band left on a model t ford the reverse is your margin of safety when your brake is gone you can use reverse as a brake and when the low gear band is worn too thin to pull up a steep hill why you can turn around and back up it gay found there was plently of reverse and he knew everything was all right it was a good omen that eddie came back with the dry cells without trouble mrs gay had been in the kitchen eddie could hear her walking about but she didnt hear eddie he was very good at such things gay connected the dry cells and he advanced the gas and retarded the spark lever twist her tail he said he was such a wonder gay was the little mechanic of god the st francis of all things that turn and twist and explode the st francis of coils and armatures and gears and if at some time all the heaps of jalopies cutdown dusenbergs buicks de sotos and plymouths american austins and isotta fraschinis praise god in a great chorus it will be largely due to gay and his brotherhood one twist one little twist and the engine caught and labored and faltered and caught again gay advanced the spark and reduced the gas he switched over to the magneto and the ford of lee chong chuckled and jiggled and clattered happily as though it knew it was working for a man who loved and understood it there were two small technical legal difficulties with the truck it had no recent license plates and it had no lights but the boys hung a rag permanently and accidentally on the rear plate to conceal its vintage and they dabbed the front plate with good thick mud the equipment of the expedition was slight some longhandled frog nets and some gunny sacks city hunters going out for sport load themselves with food and liquor but not mack he presumed rightly that the country was where food came from two loaves of bread and what was left of eddies wining jug was all the supply the party clambered on the truck gay drove and mack sat beside him they bumped around the corner of lee chongs and down through the lot threading among the pipes mr malloy waved at them from his seat by the boiler gay eased across the sidewalk and down off the curb gently because the front tires showed fabric all the way around with all their alacrity it was afternoon when they got started the truck eased into red williams service station mack got out and gave his paper to red he said doc was a little short of change so if you put five gallons in and just give us a buck instead of the other five gallons why thats what doc wants he had to go south you know had a big deal down there red smiled goodnaturedly you know mack he said doc got to figuring if there was some kind of loophole and he put his finger on the same one you did docs a pretty bright fellow so he phoned me last night put in the whole ten gallons said mack no wait itll slop around and spill put in five and give us five in a can one of them sealed cans red smiled happily doc kind of figured that one too he said put in ten gallons said mack and dont go leaving none in the hose the little expedition did not go through the center of monterey a delicacy about the license plates and the lights made gay choose back streets there would be the time when they would go up carmel hill and down into the valley a good four miles on a main highway exposed to any passing cop until they turned up the fairly unfrequented carmel valley road gay chose a back street that brought them out on the main highway at peters gate just before the steep carmel hill starts gay took a good noisy clattering run at the hill and in fifty yards he put the pedal down to low he knew it wouldnt work the band was worn too thin on the level it was all right but not on a hill he stopped let the truck back around and aimed it down the hill then he gave it the gas and the reverse pedal and the reverse was not worn the truck crawled steadily and slowly but backward up carmel hill and they very nearly made it the radiator boiled of course but most model t experts believed that it wasnt working well if it wasnt boiling someone should write an erudite essay on the moral physical and esthetic effect of the model t ford on the american nation two generations of americans knew more about the ford coil than the clitoris about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars with the model t part of the concept of private property disappeared pliers ceased to be privately owned and a tire pump belonged to the last man who had picked it up most of the babies of the period were conceived in model t fords and not a few were born in them the theory of the anglo saxon home become so warped that it never quite recovered the truck backed sturdily up carmel hill and it got past the jacks peak road and was just going into the last and steepest pull when the motors breathing thickened gulped and strangled it seemed very quiet when the motor was still gay who was heading downhill anyway ran down the fifty feet and turned into the jacks peak road entrance what is it mack asked carburetor i think said gay the engine sizzled and creaked with heat and the jet of steam that blew down the overflow pipe sounded like the hiss of an alligator the carburetor of a model t is not complicated but it needs all of its parts to function there is a needle valve and the point must be on the needle and must sit in its hole or the carburetor does not work gay held the needle in his hand and the point was broken off how in hell you spose that happened he asked magic said mack just pure magic can you fix it hell no said gay got to get another one how much they cost about a buck if you buy one new quarter at a wreckers you got a buck mack asked yeah but i wont need it well get back as soon as you can will you well just stay right here anyways you wont go running off without a needle valve said gay he stepped out to the road he thumbed three cars before one stopped for him the boys watched him climb in and start down the hill they didnt see him again for one hundred and eighty days oh the infinity of possibility how could it happen that the car that picked up gay broke down before it got into monterey if gay had not been a mechanic he would not have fixed the car if he had not fixed it the owner wouldnt have taken him to jimmy brucias for a drink and why was it jimmys birthday out of all the possibilities in the world the millions of them only events occurred that lead to the salinas jail sparky enea and tiny colletti had made up a quarrel and were helping jimmy celebrate his birthday the blonde came in the musical argument in front of the juke box gays new friend who knew a judo hold and tried to show it to sparky and got his wrist broken when the hold went wrong the policeman with a bad stomach all unrelated irrelevant details and yet all running in one direction fate just didnt intend gay to go on that frog hunt and fate took a hell of a lot of trouble and people and accidents to keep him from it when the final dimax came with the front of holmans bootery broken out and the party trying on the shoes in the display window only gay didnt hear the fire whistle only gay didnt go to the fire and when the police came they found him sitting all alone in holmans window wearing one brown oxford and one patent leather dress shoe with a gray cloth top back at the truck the boys built a little fire when it got dark and the chill crept up from the ocean the pines above them soughed in the fresh sea wind the boys lay in the pine needles and looked at the lonely sky through the pine branches for a while they spoke of the difficulties gay must be having getting a needle valve and then gradually as the time passed they didnt mention him any more somebody should of gone with him said mack about ten oclock eddie got up theres a construction camp a piece up the hill he said i think ill go up and see if they got any model ts chapter xii monterey is a city with a long and brilliant literary tradition it remembers with pleasure and some glory that robert louis stevenson lived there treasure island certainly has the topography and the coastal plan of pt lobos more recently in carmel there have been a great number of literary men about but there is not the old flavor the old dignity of the true belleslettres once the town was greatly outraged over what the citizens considered a slight to an author it had to do with the death of josh billings the great humorist where the new postoffice is there used to be a deep gulch with water flowing in it and a little foot bridge over it on one side of the gulch was a fine old adobe and on the other the house of the doctor who handled all the sickness birth and death in the town he worked with animals too and having studied in france he even dabbled in the new practice of embalming bodies before they were buried some of the oldtimers considered this sentimental and some thought it wasteful and to some it was sacrilegious since there was no provision for it in any sacred volume but the better and richer families were coming to it and it looked to become a fad one morning elderly mr carriaga was walking from his house on the hill down toward alvarado street he was just crossing the foot bridge when his attention was drawn to a small boy and a dog struggling up out of the gulch the boy carried a liver while the dog dragged yards of intestine at the end of which a stomach dangled mr carriaga paused and addressed the little boy politely good morning in those days little boys were courteous good morning sir where are you going with the liver im going to make some chum and catch some mackerel mr carriaga smiled and the dog will he catch mackerel too the dog found that its his sir we found them in the gulch mr carriaga smiled and strolled on and then his mind began to work that isnt a beef liver its too small and it isnt a calf s liver its too red it isnt a sheeps liver now his mind was alert at the corner he met mr ryan anyone die in monterey last night he asked not that i know of said mr ryan anyone killed no they walked on together and mr carriaga told about the little boy and the dog at the adobe bar a number of citizens were gathered for their morning conversation there mr carriaga told his story again and he had just finished when the constable came into the adobe he should know if anyone had died no one died in monterey he said but josh billings died out at the hotel del monte the men in the bar were silent and the same thought went through all their minds josh billings was a great man a great writer he had honored monterey by dying there and he had been degraded without much discussion a committee formed made up of everyone there the stern men walked quickly to the gulch and across the foot bridge and they hammered on the door of the doctor who had studied in france he had worked late the knocking got him out of bed and brought him tousled of hair and beard to the door in his nightgown mr carriaga addressed him sternly did you embalm josh billings why yes what did you do with his tripas why i threw them in the gulch where i always do they made him dress quickly then and they hurried down to the beach if the little boy had gone quickly about his business it would have been too late he was just getting into a boat when the committee arrived the intestine was in the sand where the dog had abandoned it then the french doctor was made to collect the parts he was forced to wash them reverently and pick out as much sand as possible the doctor himself had to stand the expense of the leaden box which went into the coffin of josh billings for monterey was not a town to let dishonor come to a literary man chapter xiii mack and the boys slept peacefully on the pine needles some time before dawn eddie came back he had gone a long way before he found a model t and then when he did he wondered whether or not it would be a good idea to take the needle out of its seat it might not fit so he took the whole carburetor the boys didnt wake up when he got back he lay down beside them and slept under the pine trees there was one nice thing about model ts the parts were not only interchangeable they were unidentifiable there is a beautiful view from the carmel grade the curving bay with the waves creaming on the sand the dune country around seaside and right at the bottom of the hill the warm intimacy of the town mack got up in the dawn and hustled his pants where they bound him and he stood looking down on the bay he could see some of the purseseiners coming in a tanker stood over against seaside taking on oil behind him the rabbits stirred in the bush then the sun came up and shook the night chill out of the air the way youd shake a rug when he felt the first sun warmth mack shivered the boys ate a little bread while eddie installed the new carburetor and when it was ready they didnt bother to crank it they pushed it out to the highway and coasted in gear until it started and then eddie driving they backed up over the rise over the top and turned and headed forward and down past hatton fields in carmel valley the artichoke plants stood gray green and the willows were lush along the river they turned left up the valley luck blossomed from the first a dusty rhode island red rooster who had wandered too far from his own farmyard crossed the road and eddie hit him without running too far off the road sitting in the back of the truck hazel picked him as they went and let the feathers fly from his hand the most widely distributed evidence on record for there was a little breeze in the morning blowing down from jamesburg and some of the red chicken feathers were deposited on pt lobos and some even blew out to sea the carmel is a lovely little river it isnt very long but in its course it has everything a river should have it rises in the mountains and tumbles down a while runs through shallows is dammed to make a lake spills over the dam crackles among round boulders wanders lazily under sycamores spills into pools where trout live drops in against banks where crayfish live in the winter it becomes a torrent a mean little fierce river and in the summer it is a place for children to wade in and for fishermen to wander in frogs blink from its banks and the deep ferns grow beside it deer and foxes come to drink from it secretly in the morning and evening and now and then a mountain lion crouched flat laps its waters the farms of the rich little valley back up to the river and take its water for the orchards and the vegetables the quail call beside it and the wild doves come whistling in at dusk raccoons pace its edges looking for frogs its everything a river should be a few miles up the valley the river cuts in under a high cliff from which vines and ferns hang down at the base of this duff there is a pool green and deep and on the other side of the pool there is a little sandy place where it is good to sit and to cook your dinner mack and the boys came down to this place happily it was perfect if frogs were available they would be here it was a place to relax a place to be happy on the way out they had thriven in addition to the big red chicken there was a sack of carrots which had fallen from a vegetable truck half a dozen onions which had not mack had a bag of coffee in his pocket in the truck there was a fivegallon can with the top cut off the wining jug was nearly half full such things as salt and pepper had been brought mack and the boys would have thought anyone who traveled without salt pepper and coffee very silly indeed without effort confusion or much thought four round stones were rolled together on the little beach the rooster who had challenged the sunrise of this very day lay dismembered and clean in water in the five gallon can with peeled onions about him while a little fire of dead willow sticks sputtered between the stones a very little fire only fools build big fires it would take a long time to cook this rooster for it had taken him a long time to achieve his size and muscularity but as the water began to boil gently about him he smelled good from the beginning mack gave them a pep talk the best time for frogs is at night he said so i guess well just lay around til it gets dark they sat in the shade and gradually one by one they stretched out and slept mack was right frogs do not move around much in the daytime they hide under ferns and they look secretly out of holes under rocks the way to catch frogs is with a flashlight at night the men slept knowing they might have a very active night only hazel stayed awake to replenish the little fire under the cooking chicken hazel stuck his pocket knife into the muscles of the chicken there is no golden afternoon next to the cliff when the sun went over it at about two oclock a whispering shade came to the beach the sycamores rustled in the afternoon breeze little water snakes slipped down to the rocks and then gently entered the water and swam along through the pool their heads held up like little periscopes and a tiny wake spreading behind them a big trout jumped in the pool the gnats and mosquitoes which avoid the sun came out and buzzed over the water all of the sun bugs the flies the dragonflies the wasps the hornets went home and as the shadow came to the beach as the first quail began to call mack and the boys awakened the smell of the chicken stew was heartbreaking hazel had picked a fresh bay leaf from a tree by the river and he had dropped it in the carrots were in now coffee in its own can was simmering on its own rock far enough from the flame so that it did not boil too hard mack awakened started up stretched staggered to the pool washed his face with cupped hands hacked spat washed out his mouth broke wind tightened his belt scratched his legs combed his wet hair with his fingers drank from the jug belched and sat down by the fire by god that smells good he said men all do about the same things when they wake up macks process was loosely the one all of them followed and soon they had all come to the fire and complimented hazel hazel stuck his pocket knife into the muscles of the chicken he aint going to be what youd call tender said hazel youd have to cook him about two weeks to get him tender how old about do you judge he was mack im fortyeight and i aint as tough as he is said mack eddie said how old can a thicken get do you think thats if nobody pushes him around or he dont get sick thats something nobody isnt ever going to find out said jones it was a pleasant time the jug went around and warmed them jones said eddie i dont mean to complain none i was just thinkin spose you had two or three jugs back of the bar spose you put all the whiskey in one and all the wine in another and all the beer in another a slightly shocked silence followed the suggestion i didnt mean nothing said jones quickly i like it this way jones talked too much then because he knew he had made a social blunder and he wasnt able to stop what i like about it this way is you never know what kind of a drunk youre going to get out of it he said you take whiskey he said hurriedly you more or less know what youll do a fightin guy fights and a cryin guy cries but this he said magnaminously why you dont know whether itll run you up a pine tree or start you swimming to santa cruz its more fun that way he said weakly speaking of swimming said mack to fill in the indelicate place in the conversation and to shut jones up i wonder whatever happened to that guy mckinley moran remember that deep sea diver i remember him said hughie i and him used to hang around together he just didnt get much work and then he got to drinking its kind of tough on you divin and drinkin got to worryin too finally he sold his suit and helmet and pump and went on a hell of a drunk and then he left town i dont know where he went he wasnt no good after he went down after that wop that got took down with the anchor from the twelve brothers mckinley just dove down bust his eardrums and he wasnt no good good after that didnt hurt the wop a bit mack sampled the jug again he used to make a lot of dough during prohibition mack said used to get twentyfive bucks a day from the government to dive lookin for liquor on the bottom and he got three dollars a case from louie for not findin it had it worked out so he brought up one case a day to keep the government happy louie didnt mind that none made it so they didnt get in no new divers mckinley made a lot of dough yeah said hughie but hes like everybody else gets some dough and he wants to get married he got married three times before his dough run out i could always tell hed buy a white fox fur piece and bang i next thing youd know hes married i wonder what happened to gay eddie asked it was the first time they had spoken of him same thing i guess said mack you just cant trust a married guy no matter how much he hates his old lady why hell go back to her get to thinkin and broodin and back hell go you cant trust him no more take gay said mack his old lady hits him but i bet you when gays away from her three days he gets it figured out that its his fault and he goes back to make it up to her they ate long and daintily spearing out pieces of chicken holding the dripping pieces until they cooled and then gnawing the musded meat from the bone they speared the carrots on pointed willow switches and finally they passed the can and drank the juice and around them the evening crept in as delicately as music the quail called each other down to the water the trout jumped in the pool and the moths came down and fluttered about the pool as the daylight mixed into the darkness they passed the coffee can about and they were warm and fed and silent at last mack said god damn it i hate a liar whos been lyin to you eddie asked oh i dont mind a guy that tells a little one to get along or to hop up a conversation but i hate a guy that lies to himself who done that eddie asked me said mack and maybe you guys here we are he said earnestly the whole god damn shabby lot of us we worked it out that we wanted to give doc a party so we come out here and have a hell of a lot of fun then well go back and get the dough from doc theres five of us so well drink five times as much liquor as he will and i aint sure were doin it for doc i aint sure we aint doin it for ourselves and docs too nice a fella to do that to doc is the nicest fella i ever knew i dont want to be the kind of a guy that would take advantage of him you know one time i put the bee on him for a buck i give him a hell of a story right in the middle i seen he knew god damn well the story was so much malarky so right in the middle i says doc thats a fuggin lie and he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a buck mack he says i figure a guy that needs it bad enough to make up a lie to get it really needs it and he give me the buck i paid him that buck back the next day i never did spend it just kept it overnight and then give it back to him hazel said there aint nobody likes a party better than doc were givin him the party what the hell is the beef i dont know said mack id just like to give him something when i didnt get most of it back how about a present hughie suggested spose we just bought the whiskey and give it to him and let him do what he wants now youre talkin said mack thats just what well do well just give him the whiskey and fade out you know whatll happen said eddie henri and them people from carmel will smell that whiskey out and then instead of only five of us therell be twenty doc told me one time himself they can smell him fryin a steak from cannery row clear down to point sur i dont see the percentage hed come out better if we give him the party ourselves mack considered this reasoning maybe youre right he said at last but spose we give him something except whiskey maybe cuff links with his initials oh horse shit said hazel doc dont want stuff like that the night was in by now and the stars were white in the sky hazel fed the fire and it put a little room of light on the beach over the hill a fox was barking sharply and now in the night the smell of sage came down from the hills the water thudded on the stones where it went out of the deep pool mack was mulling over the last piece of reasoning when the sound of footsteps on the ground made them turn a man dark and large stalked near and he had a shotgun over his arm and a pointer walked shyly and delicately at his heel what the hell are you doing here he asked nothing said mack the lands posted no fishing hunting fires camping now you just pack up and put that fire out and get off this land mack stood up humbly i didnt know captain he said honest we never seen the sign captain theres signs all over you couldnt have missed them look captain we made a mistake and were sorry said mack he paused and looked closely at the slouching figure you are a military man arent you sir i can always tell military man dont carry his shoulders the same as ordinary people i was in the army so long i can always tell imperceptibly the shoulders of the man straightened nothing obvious but he held himself differently i dont allow fires on my place he said well were sorry said mack well get right out captain you see were workin for some scientists were tryin to get some frogs theyre workin on cancer and were helpin out getting some frogs the man hesitated for a moment what do they do with the frogs he asked well sir said mack they give cancer to the frogs and then they can study and experiment and they got it nearly licked if they can just get some frogs but if you dont want us on your land captain well get right out never would of come in if we knew suddenly mack seemed to see the pointer for the first time by god thats a finelookin bitch he said enthusiastically she looks like nola that win the field trials in virginia last year she a virginia dog captain the captain hesitated and then he lied yes he said shortly shes lame tick got her right on her shoulder mack was instantly solicitous mind if i look captain come girl come on girl the pointer looked up at her master and then sidled up to mack pile on some twigs so i can see he said to hazel its up where she cant lick it said the captain and he leaned over macks shoulder to look mack pressed some pus out of the evillooking crater on the dogs shoulder i had a dog had a thing like this and it went right in and killed him she just had pups didnt she yes said the captain six i put iodine on that place no said mack that wont draw you got any epsom salts up at your place yes theres a big bottle well you make a hot poultice of epsom salts and put it on there shes weak you know from the pups be a shame if she got sick now youd lose the pups too the pointer looked deep into macks eyes and then she licked his hand tell you what ill do captain ill look after her myself epsom saltll do the trick thats the best thing the captain stroked the dogs head you know ive got a pond up by the house thats so full of frogs i cant sleep nights why dont you look up there they bellow all night id be glad to get rid of them thats mighty nice of you said mack ill bet those docs would thank you for that but id like to get a poultice on this dog he turned to the others you put out this fire he said make sure there aint a spark left and clean up around you dont want to leave no mess i and the captain will go and take care of nola here you fellows follow along when you get cleared up mack and the captain walked away together hazel kicked sand on the fire i bet mack could of been president of the us if he wanted he said what could he do with it if he had it jones asked there wouldnt be no fun in that chapter xiv early morning is a time of magic in cannery row in the gray time after the light has come and before the sun has risen the row seems to hang suspended out of time in a silvery light the street lights go out and the weeds are a brilliant green the corrugated iron of the canneries glows with the pearly lucence of platinum or old pewter no automobiles are running then the street is silent of progress and business and the rush and drag of the waves can be heard as they splash in among the piles of the canneries it is a time of great peace a deserted time a little era of rest cats drip over the fences and slither like syrup over the ground to look for fish heads silent early morning dogs parade majestically picking and choosing judiciously whereon to pee the sea gulls come flapping in to sit on the cannery roofs to await the day of refuse they sit on the roof peaks shoulder to shoulder from the rocks near the hopkins marine station comes the barking of sea lions like the baying of hounds the air is cool and fresh in the back gardens the gophers push up the morning mounds of fresh damp earth and they creep out and drag flowers into their holes very few people are about just enough to make it seem more deserted than it is one of doras girls comes home from a call on a patron too wealthy or too sick to visit the bear flag her makeup is a little sticky and her feet are tired lee chong brings the garbage cans out and stands them on the curb the old chinaman comes out of the sea and flapflaps across the street and up past the palace the cannery watchmen look out and blink at the morning light the bouncer at the bear flag steps out on the porch in his shirtsleeves and stretches and yawns and scratches his stomach the snores of mr malloys tenants in the pipes have a deep tannelly quality it is the hour of the pearl the interval between day and night when time stops and examines itself on such a morning and in such a light two soldiers and two girls strolled easily along the street they had come out of la ida and they were very tired and very happy the girls were hefty big breasted and strong and their blonde hair was in slight disarray they wore printed rayon party dresses wrinided now and dinging to their convexities and each girl wore a soldiers cap one far back on her head and the other with the visor down almost on her nose they were fulllipped broadnosed hippy girls and they were very tired the soldiers tunics were unbuttoned and their belts were threaded through their epaulets the ties were pulled down a little so the shirt collars could be unbuttoned and the soldiers wore the girls hats one a tiny yellow straw boater with a bunch of daisies on the crown the other a white knitted halfhat to which medallions of blue cellophane adhered they walked holding hands swinging their hands rhythmically the soldier on the outside had a large brown paper bag filled with cold canned beer they strolled softly in the pearly light they had had a hell of a time and they felt good they smiled delicately like weary children remembering a party they looked at one another and smiled and they swung their hands past the bear flag they went and said hiya to the bouncer who was scratching his stomach they listened to the snores from the pipes and laughed a little at lee chongs they stopped and looked into the messy display window where tools and clothes and food crowded for attention swinging their hands and scuffing their feet they came to the end of cannery row and turned up to the railroad track the girls climbed up on the rails and walked along on them and the soldiers put their arms around the plump waists to keep them from falling then they went past the boat works and turned down into the parklike property of the hopkins marine station there is a tiny curved beach in front of the station a miniature beach between little reefs the gentle morning waves licked up the beach and whispered softly the fine smell of seaweed came from the exposed rocks as the four came to the beach a sliver of the sun broke over tom works land across the head of the bay and it gilded the water and made the rocks yellow the girls sat formally down in the sand and straightened their skirts over their knees one of the soldiers punched holes in four cans of beer and handed them around and then the men lay down and put their heads in the girls laps and looked up into their faces and they smiled at each other a tired and peaceful and wonderful secret from up near the station came the barking of a dog the watchman a dark and surly man had seen them and his black and surly cocker spaniel had seen them he shouted at them and when they did not move he came down on the beach and his dog barked monotonously dont you know you cant lay around here you got to get off this is private property the soldiers did not even seem to hear him they smiled on and the girls were stroking their hair over the temples at last in slow motion one of the soldiers turned his head so that his cheek was cradled between the girls legs he smiled benevolently at the caretaker why dont you take a flying fuggut the moon he said kindly and he turned back to look at the girl the sun lighted her blonde hair and she scratched him over one ear they didnt even see the caretaker go back to his house chapter xv by the time the boys got up to the farmhouse mack was in the kitchen the pointer bitch lay on her side and mack held a cloth saturated with epsom salts against her tick bite among her legs the big fat wiener pups nuzzled and bumped for milk and the bitch looked patiently up into macks face saying you see how it is i try to tell him but he doesnt understand the captain held a lamp and looked down on mack im glad to know about that he said mack said i dont want to tell you about your business sir but these pups ought to be weaned she aint got a hell of a lot of milk left and them pups are chewin her to pieces i know said the captain i spose i should have drowned them all but one ive been so busy trying to keep the place going people dont take the interest in bird dogs they used to its all poodles and boxers and dobermans i know said mack and there aint no dog like a pointer for a man i dont know whats come over people but you wouldnt of drowned them would you sir well said the captain since my wife went into politics im just running crazy she got elected to the assembly for this district and when the legislature isnt in session shes off making speeches and when shes home shes studying all the time and writing bills must be lousy in i mean it must be pretty lonely said mack now if i had a pup like this he picked up a squirming puzzfaced pup why i bet id have a real bird dog in three years id take a bitch every time would you like to have one the captain asked mack looked up you mean youd let me have one oh jesus christ yes take your pick said the captain nobody seems to understand bird dogs any more the boys stood in the kitchen and gathered quick impressions it was obvious that the wife was away the opened cans the frying pan with lace from fried eggs still sticking to it the crumbs on the kitchen table the open box of shotgun shells on the bread box all shrieked of the lack of a woman while the white curtains and the papers on the dish shelves and the too small towels on the rack told them a woman had been there and they were unconsciously glad she wasnt there the kind of women who put papers on shelves and had little towels like that instinctively distrusted and disliked mack and the boys such women knew that they were the worst threats to a home for they offered ease and thought and companionship as opposed to neatness order and properness they were very glad she was away now the captain seemed to feel that they were doing him a favor he didnt want them to leave he said hesitantly spose you boys would like a little something to warm you up before you go out for the frogs the others looked at mack mack was frowning as though he was thinking it through when were out doin scientific stuff we make it a kind of a rule not to touch nothin he said and then quickly as though he might have gone too far but seein as how you been so nice to us well i wouldnt mind a short one myself i dont know about the boys the boys agreed that they wouldnt mind a short one either the captain got a flashlight and went down in the cellar they could hear him moving lumber and boxes about and he came back upstairs with a fivegallon oak keg in his arms he set it on the table during prohibition i got some corn whiskey and laid it away i just got to thinking id like to see how it is its pretty old now id almost forgot it you see my wife he let it go at that because it was apparent that they understood the captain knocked out the oak plug from the end of the keg and got glasses down from the shelf that had scallopedged paper laid on it it is a hard job to pour a small drink from a fivegallon keg each of them got half a water glass of the clear brown liquor they waited ceremoniously for the captain and then they said over the river and tossed it back they swallowed tasted their tongues sucked their lips and there was a faraway look in their eyes mack peered into his empty glass as though some holy message were written in the bottom and then he raised his eyes you cant say nothin about that he said they dont put that in bottles he breathed in deeply and sucked his breath as it came out i dont think i ever tasted nothin as good as that he said the captain looked pleased his glance wandered back to the keg it is good he said you think we might have another little one mack stared into his glass again maybe a short one he agreed wouldnt it be easier to pour out some in a pitcher youre liable to spill it that way two hours later they recalled what they had come for the frog pool was square fifty feet wide and seventy feet long and four feet deep lush soft grass grew about its edge and a little ditch brought the water from the river to it and from it little ditches went out to the orchards there were frogs there all right thousands of them their voices beat the night they boomed and barked and croaked and rattled they sang to the stars to the waning moon to the waving grasses they bellowed love songs and challenges the men crept through the darkness toward the pool the captain carried a nearly filled pitcher of whiskey and every man had his own glass the captain had found them flashlights that worked hughie and jones carried gunny sacks as they drew quietly near the frogs heard them coming the night had been roaring with frog song and then suddenly it was silent mack and the boys and the captain sat down on the ground to have one last short one and to map their campaign and the plan was bold during the millennia that frogs and men have lived in the same world it is probable that men have hunted frogs and during that time a pattern of hunt and parry has developed the man with net or bow or lance or gun creeps noiselessly as he thinks toward the frog the pattern requires that the frog sit still sit very still and wait the rules of the game require the frog to wait until the final flicker of a second when the net is descending when the lance is in the air when the finger squeezes the trigger then the frog jumps plops into the water swims to the bottom and waits until the man goes away that is the way it is done the way it has always been done frogs have every right to expect it will always be done that way now and then the net is too quick the lance pierces the gun flicks and that frog is gone but it is all fair and in the framework frogs dont resent that but how could they have anticipated macks new method how could they have foreseen the horror that followed the sudden flashing of lights the shouting and squealing of men the rush of feet every frog leaped plopped into the pool and swam frantically to the bottom then into the pooi plunged the line of men stamping churning moving in a crazy line up the pool flinging their feet about hysterically the frogs displaced from their placid spots swam ahead of the crazy thrashing feet and the feet came on frogs are good swimmers but they havent much endurance down the pool they went until finally they were bunched and crowded against the end and the feet and wildly plunging bodies followed them a few frogs lost their heads and floundered among the feet and got through and these were saved but the majority decided to leave this pool forever to find a new home in a new country where this kind of thing didnt happen a wave of frantic frustrated frogs big ones little ones brown ones green ones men frogs and women frogs a wave of them broke over the bank crawled leaped scrambled they clambered up the grass they dutched at each other little ones rode on big ones and then horror on horror the flashlights found them two men gathered them like berries the line came out of the water and closed in on their rear and gathered them like potatoes tens and fifties of them were flung into the gunny sacks and the sacks filled with tired frightened and disillusioned frogs with dripping whimpering frogs some got away of course and some had been saved in the pool but never in frog history had such an execution taken place frogs by the pound by the fifty pounds they werent counted but there must have been six or seven hundred then happily mack tied up the necks of the sacks they were soaking dripping wet and the air was cool they had a short one in the grass before they went back to the house so they wouldnt catch cold it is doubtful whether the captain had ever had so much fun he was indebted to mack and the boys later when the curtains caught fire and were put out with the little towels the captain told the boys not to mind it he felt it was an honor to have them burn his house clear down if they wanted to my wife is a wonderful woman he said in a kind of peroration most wonderful woman ought to of been a man if she was a man i wouldn of married her he laughed a long time over that and repeated it three or four times and resolved to remember it so he could tell it to a lot of other people he filled a jug with whiskey and gave it to mack he wanted to go to live with them in the palace flophouse he decided that his wife would like mack and the boys if she only knew them finally he went to sleep on the floor with his head among the puppies mack and the boys poured themselves a short one and regarded him seriously mack said he give me that jug of whiskey didnt he you heard him sure he did said eddie i heard him and he give me a pup sure pick of the litter we all heard him why i never did roll a drunk and i aint gonna start now said mack we got to get out of here hes gonna wake up feelin lousy and its goin to be all our fault i just dont want to be here mack glanced at the burned curtains at the floor glistening with whiskey and puppy dirt at the bacon grease that was coagulating on the stove ffуnt he went to the pups looked them over carefully felt bone and frame looked in eyes and regarded jaws and he picked out a beautifully spotted bitch with a livercolored nose and a fine dark yellow eye come on darling he said they blew out the lamp because of the danger of fire it was just turning dawn as they left the house i dont think i ever had such a fine trip said mack but i got to thinkin about his wife comin back and it gave me the shivers the pup whined in his arms and he put in under his coat hes a real nice fella said mack after you get him feelin easy that is he strode on toward the place where they had parked the ford we shouldnt go forgettin were doin all this for doc he said from the way things are pannin out it looks like doc is a pretty lucky guy chapter xvi probably the busiest time the girls of the bear flag ever had was the march of the big sardine catch it wasnt only that the fish ran in silvery billions and money ran almost as freely a new regiment moved into the presidio and a new bunch of soldiers always shop around a good deal before they settle down dora was short handed just at that time too for eva flanegan had gone to east st louis on a vacation phyllis mae had broken her leg getting out of the roller coaster in santa cruz and elsie doublebottom had made a novena and wasnt much good for anything else the men from the sardine fleet loaded with dough were in and out all afternoon they sail at dark and fish all night so they must play in the afternoon in the evening the soldiers of the new regiment came down and stood around playing the joke box and drinking cocacola and sizing up the girls for the time when they would be paid dora was having trouble with her income tax for she was entangled in that curious enigma which said the business was illegal and then taxed her for it in addition to everything else there were the regulars the steady customers who had been coming down for years the laborers from the gravel pits the riders from the ranches the railroad men who came in the front door and the city officials and prominent business men who came in the rear entrance back by the tracks and who had little chintz sitting rooms assigned to them all in all it was a terrific month and right in the middle of it the influenza epidemic had to break out it came to the whole town mrs talbot and her daughter of the san carlos hotel had it tom work had it benjamin peabody and his wife had it excelentisima maria antonia field had it the whole gross family came down with it the doctors of monterey and there were enough of them to take care of the ordinary diseases accidents and neuroses were running crazy they had more business than they could do among clients who if they didnt pay their bills at least had the money to pay them cannery row which produces a tougher breed than the rest of the town was late in contracting it but finally it got them too the schools were closed there wasnt a house that hadnt feverish children and sick parents it was not a deadly disease as it was in but with children it had a tendency to go into the mastoids the medical profession was very busy and besides cannery row was not considered a very good financial risk now doc of the western biological laboratory had no right to practice medicine it was not his fault that everyone in the row came to him for medical advice before he knew it he found himself running from shanty to shanty taking temperatures giving physics borrowing and delivering blankets and even taking food from house to house where mothers looked at him with inflamed eyes from their beds and thanked him and put the full responsibility for their childrens recovery on him when a case got really out of hand he phoned a local doctor and sometimes one came if it seemed to be an emergency but to the families it was all emergency doc didnt get much sleep he lived on beer and canned sardines in lee chongs where he went to get beer he met dora who was there to buy a pair of nail clippers you look done in dora said i am doc admitted i havent had any sleep for about a week i know said dora i hear its bad comes at a bad time too well we havent lost anybody yet said doc but there are some awful sick kids the ransel kids have all developed mastoiditis is there anything i can do dora asked doc said you know there is people get so scared and helpless take the ransels theyre scared to death and theyre scared to be alone if you or some of the girls could just sit with them dora who was soft as a mouses belly could be as hard as carborundum she went back to the bear flag and organized it for service it was a bad time for her but she did it the greek cook made a tengallon cauldron of strong soup and kept it full and kept it strong the girls tried to keep up their business but they went in shifts to sit with the families and they carried pots of soup when they went doc was in almost constant demand dora consulted him and detailed the girls where he suggested and all the time the business at the bear flag was booming the joke box never stopped playing the men of the fishing fleet and the soldiers stood in line and the girls did their work and then they took their pots of soup and went to sit with the ransels with the mccarthys with the ferrias the girls slipped out the back door and sometimes staying with the sleeping children the girls dropped to sleep in their chairs they didnt use makeup for work any more they didnt have to dora herself said she could have used the total membership of the old ladies home it was the busiest time the girls at the bear flag could remember everyone was glad when it was over chapter xvii in spite of his friendliness and his friends doc was a lonely and a setapart man mack probably noticed it more than anybody in a group doc seemed always alone when the lights were on and the curtains drawn and the gregorian music played on the great phonograph mack used to look down on the laboratory from the palace flophouse he knew doc had a girl in there but mack used to get a dreadful feeling of loneliness out of it even in the clear close contact with a girl mack felt that doc would be lonely doc was a night crawler the lights were on in the lab all night and yet he seemed to be up in the daytime too and the great shrouds of music came out of the lab at any time of the day or night sometimes when it was all dark and when it seemed that sleep had come at last the diamondtrue child voices of the sistine choir would come from the windows of the laboratory doc had to keep up his collecting he tried to get to the good tides along the coast the sea rocks and the beaches were his stock pile he knew where everything was when he wanted it all the articles of his trade were filed away on the coast sea cradles here octopi here tube worms in another place sea pansies in another he knew where to get them but he could not go for them exactly when he wanted for nature locked up the items and only released them occasionally doc had to know not only the tides but when a particular low tide was good in a particular place when such a low tide occurred he packed his collecting tools in his car he packed his jars his bottles his plates and preservatives and he went to the beach or reef or rock ledge where the animals he needed were stored now he had an order for small octopi and the nearest place to get them was the boulderstrewn intertidal zone at la jolla between los angeles and san diego it meant a fivehundredmile drive each way and his arrival had to coincide with the retreating waters the little octopi live among the boulders imbedded in sand being timid and young they prefer a bottom on which there are many caves and little crevices and lumps of mud where they may hide from predators and protect themselves from the waves but on the same flat there are millions of sea cradles while filling a definite order for octopi doc could replenish his stock of the cradles low tide was am on a thursday if doc left monterey on wednesday morning he could be there easily in time for the tide on thursday he would have taken someone with him for company but quite by accident everyone was away or was busy mack and the boys were up carmel valley collecting frogs three young women he knew and would have enjoyed as companions had jobs and couldnt get away in the middle of the week henri the painter was occupied for holmans department store had employed not a flagpole sitter but a flagpole skater on a tall mast on top of the store he had a little round platform and there he was on skates going around and around he had been there three days and three nights he was out to set a new record for being on skates on a platform the previous record was hours so he had some time to go henri had taken up his post across the street at red williams gas station henri was fascinated he thought of doing a huge abstraction called substratum dream of a flagpole skater henri couldnt leave town while the skater was up there he protested that there were philosophic implications in flagpole skating that no one had touched henri sat in a chair leaned back against the lattice which concealed the door of the mens toilet at red williams he kept his eye on the eyrie skating platform and obviously he couldnt go with doc to la jolla doc had to go alone because the tide would not wait early in the morning he got his things together personal things went in a small satchel another satchel held instruments and syringes having packed he combed and trimmed his brown beard saw that his pencils were in his shirt pocket and his magnifying glass attached to his lapel he packed the trays bottles glass plates preservatives rubber boots and a blanket into the back of his car he worked through the pearly time washed three days dishes put the garbage into the surf he closed the doors but did not lock them and by nine oclock was on his way it took doc longer to go places than other people he didnt drive fast and he stopped and ate hamburgers very often driving up to lighthouse avenue he waved at a dog that looked around and smiled at him in monterey before he even started he felt hungry and stopped at hermans for a hamburger and beer while he ate his sandwich and sipped his beer a bit of conversation came back to him blaisedell the poet had said to him you love beer so mud ill bet some day youll go in and order a beer milk shake it was a simple piece of foolery but it had bothered doc ever since he wondered what a beer milk shake would taste like the idea gagged him but he couldnt let it alone it cropped up every time he had a glass of beer would it curdle the milk would you add suger it was like a shrimp ice cream once the thing got into your head you couldnt forget it he finished his sandwich and paid herman he purposely didnt look at the milk shake machines lined up so shiny against the back wall if a man ordered a beer milk shake he thought hed better do it in a town where he wasnt known but then a man with a beard ordering a beer milk shake in a town where he wasnt known they might call the police a man with a beard was always a little suspect anyway you couldnt say you wore a beard because you liked a beard people didnt like you for telling the truth you had to say you had a scar so you couldnt shave once when doc was at the university of chicago he had love trouble and he had worked too hard he thought it would be nice to take a very long walk he put on a little knapsack and he walked through indiana and kentucky and north carolina and georgia clear to florida he walked among farmers and mountain people among the swamp people and fishermen and everywhere people asked him why he was walking through the country because he loved true things he tried to explain he said he was nervous and besides he wanted to see the country smell the ground and look at grass and birds and trees to savor the country and there was no other way to do it save on foot and people didnt like him for telling the truth they scowled or shook and tapped their heads they laughed as though they knew it was a lie and they appreciated a liar and some afraid for their daughters or their pigs told him to move on to get going just not to stop near their place if he knew what was good for him and so he stopped trying to tell the truth he said he was doing it on a bet that he stood to win a hundred dollars everyone liked him then and believed him they asked him in to dinner and gave him a bed and they put lunches up for him and wished him good luck and thought he was a hell of a fine fellow doc still loved true things but he knew it was not a general love and it could be a very dangerous mistress doc didnt stop in salinas for a hamburger but he stopped in gonzales in king city and in paso robles he had hamburger and beer at santa maria two in santa maria because it was a long pull from there to santa barbara in santa barbara he had soup lettuce and string bean salad pot roast and mashed potatoes pineapple pie and blue cheese and coffee and after that he filled the gas tank and went to the toilet while the service station checked his oil and tires doc washed his face and combed his beard and when he came back to the car a number of potential hitchhikers were waiting going south mister doc traveled on the highways a good deal he was an old hand you have to pick your hitchhikers very carefully its best to get an experienced one for he relapses into silence but the new ones try to pay for their ride by being interesting doc had had a leg talked off by some of these then after you have made up your mind about the one you want to take you protect yourself by saying you arent going far if your man turns out too much for you you can drop him on the other hand you may be just lucky and get a man very much worth knowing doc made a quick survey of the line and chose his company a thinfaced salesmanlike man in a blue suit he had deep lines beside his mouth and dark brooding eyes he looked at doc with dislike going south mister yes said doc a little way mind taking me along get in said doc when they got to ventura it was pretty soon after the heavy dinner so doc only stopped for beer the hitchhiker hadnt spoken once doc pulled up at a roadside stand want some beer no said the hitchhiker and i dont mind saying i think its not a very good idea to drive under the influence of alcohol its none of my business what you do with your own life but in this case youve got an automobile and that can be a murderous weapon in the hands of a drunken driver at the beginning doc had been slightly startled get out of the car he said softly what im going to punch you in the nose said doc if you arent out of this car before i count ten one two three the man fumbled at the door catch and backed hurriedly out of the car but once outside he howled im going to find an officer im going to have you arrested doc opened the box on the dashboard and took out a monkey wrench his guest saw the gesture and walked hurriedly away doc walked angrily to the counter of the stand the waitress a blonde beauty with just the hint of a goiter smiled at him whatll it be beer milk shake said doc what well here it was and what the hell might just as well get it over with now as some time later the blonde asked are you kidding doc knew wearily that he couldnt explain couldnt tell the truth ive got a bladder complaint he said bipalychaetorsonectomy the doctors call it im supposed to drink a beer milk shake doctors orders the blonde smiled reassuringly oh i thought you was kidding she said archly you tell me how to make it i didnt know you was sick very sick said doc and due to be sicker put in some milk and add half a bottle of beer give me the other half in a glass no sugar in the milk shake when she served it he tasted it wryly and it wasnt so bad it just tasted like stale beer and milk it sounds awful said the blonde its not so bad when you get used to it said doc ive been drinking it for seventeen years chapter xviii doc had driven slowly it was late afternoon when he stopped in ventura so late in fact that when he stopped in carpenteria he only had a cheese sandwich and went to the toilet besides he intended to get a good dinner in los angeles and it was dark when he got there he drove on through and stopped at a big chickenintherough place he knew about and there he had fried chicken julienne potatoes hot biscuits and honey and a piece of pineapple pie and blue cheese and here he filled his thermos bottle with hot coffee had them make up six ham sandwiches and bought two quarts of beer for breakfast it was not so interesting driving at night no dogs to see only the highway lighted with his headlights doc speeded up to finish the trip it was about two oclock when he got to la jolla he drove through the town and down to the duff below which his tidal fiat lay there he stopped the car ate a sandwich drank some beer turned out the lights and curled up in the seat to sleep he didnt need a clock he had been working in a tidal pattern so long that he could feel a tide change in his sleep in the dawn he awakened looked out through the windshield and saw that the water was already retreating down the bouldery flat he drank some hot coffee ate three sandwiches and had a quart of beer the tide goes out imperceptibly the boulders show and seem to rise up and the ocean recedes leaving little pools leaving wet weed and moss and sponge iridescence and brown and blue and china red on the bottoms lie the incredible refuse of the sea shells broken and chipped and bits of skeleton daws the whole sea bottom a fantastic cemetery on which the living scamper and scramble doc pulled on his rubber boots and set his rain hat fussily he took his buckets and jars and his crowbar and put his sandwiches in one pocket and his thermos bottle in another pocket and he went down the cliff to the tidal flat then he worked down the flat after the retreating sea he turned over the boulders with his crowbar and now and then his hand darted quickly into the standing water and brought out a little angry squirming octopus which blushed with rage and spat ink on his hand then he dropped it into a jar of sea water with the others and usually the newcomer was so angry that it attacked its fellows it was good hunting that day he got twentytwo little octopi and he picked off several hundred sea cradles and put them in his wooden bucket as the tide moved out he followed it while the morning came and the sun rose the flat extended out two hundred yards and then there was a line of heavy weedcrusted rocks before it dropped off to deep water doc worked out to the barrier edge he had about what he wanted now and the rest of the time he looked under stones leaned down and peered into the tide pools with their brilliant mosaics and their scuttling bubbling life and he came at last to the outer barrier where the long leathery brown algae hung down into the water red starfish dustered on the rocks and the sea pulsed up and down against the barrier waiting to get in again between two weeded rocks on the barrier doc saw a flash of white under water and then the floating weed covered it he climbed to the place over the slippery rocks held himself firmly and gently reached down and parted the brown algae then he grew rigid a girls face looked up at him a pretty pale girl with dark hair the eyes were open and clear and the face was firm and the hair washed gently about her head the body was out of sight caught in the crevice the lips were slightly parted and the teeth showed and on the face was only comfort and rest just under water it was and the clear water made it very beautiful it seemed to doc that he looked at it for many minutes and the face burned into his picture memory very slowly he raised his hand and let the brown weed float back and cover the face docs heart pounded deeply and his throat felt tight he picked up his bucket and his jars and his crowbar and went slowly over the slippery rocks back toward the beach and the girls face went ahead of him he sat down on the beach in the coarse dry sand and pulled off his boots in the jar the little octopi were huddled up each keeping as far as possible from the others music sounded in docs ears a high thin piercingly sweet flute carrying a melody he could never remember and against this a pounding surflike woodwind section the flute went up into regions beyond the hearing range and even there it carried its unbelievable melody goose pimples came out on docs arms he shivered and his eyes were wet the way they get in the focus of great beauty the girls eyes had been gray and clear and the dark hair floated drifted lightly over the face the picture was set for all time he sat there while the first little spout of water came over the reef bringing the returning tide he sat there hearing the music while the sea crept in again over the bouldery flat his hand tapped out the rhythm and the terrifying flute played in his brain the eyes were gray and the mouth smiled a little and seemed to catch its breath in ecstasy a voice seemed to awaken him a man stood over him been fishing no collecting well what are them things baby octopi you mean devilfish i didnt know there was any there ive lived here all my life youve got to look for them said doc listlessly say said the man arent you feeling well you look sick the flute climbed again and plucked cellos sounded below and the sea crept in and in toward the beach doc shook off the music shook off the face shook the chill out of his body is there a police station near up in town why whats wrong theres a body out on the reef where right out there wedged between two rocks a girl say said the man you get a bounty for finding a body i forget how much doc stood up and gathered his equipment will you report it im not feeling well give you a shock did it is it bad rotten or eat up doc turned away you take the bounty he said i dont want it he started toward the car only the tiniest piping of the flute sounded in his head chapter xix probably nothing in the way of promotion holmans department store ever did attracted so much favorable comment as the engagement of the flagpole skater day after day there he was up on his little round platform skating around and around and at night he could be seen up there too dark against the sky so that everybody knew he didnt come down it was generally agreed however that a steel rod came up through the center of the platform at night and he strapped himself to it but he didnt sit down and no one minded the steel rod people came from jamesburg to see him and from down the coast as far as grimes point salinas people came over in droves and the farmers mercantile of that town put in a bid for the next appearance when the skater could attempt to break his own record and thus give the new worlds record to salinas since there werent many flagpole skaters and since this one was by far the best he had for the last year gone about breaking his own worlds record holmans was delighted about the venture they had a white sale a remnant sale an aluminum sale and a crockery sale all going at the same time crowds of people stood in the street watching the lone man on his platform his second day up he sent down word that someone was shooting at him with an air gun the display department used its head it figured the angles and located the offender it was old doctor merrivale hiding behind the curtains of his office plugging away with a daisy air rifle they didnt denounce him and he promised to stop he was very prominent in the masonic lodge henri the painter kept his chair at red williams service station he worked out every possible philosophic approach to the situation and came to the conclusion that he would have to build a platform at home and try it himself everyone in the town was more or less affected by the skater trade fell off out of sight of him and got better the nearer you came to holmans mack and the boys went up and looked for a moment and then went back to the palace they couldnt see that it made much sense holmans set up a double bed in their window when the skater broke the worlds record he was going to come down and sleep right in the window without taking off his skates the trade name of the mattress was on a little card at the foot of the bed now in the whole town there was interest and discussion about this sporting event but the most interesting question of all and the one that bothered the whole town was never spoken of no one mentioned it and yet it was there haunting everyone mrs trolat wondered about it as she came out of the scotch bakery with a bag of sweet buns mr hall in mens furnishings wondered about it the three willoughby girls giggled whenever they thought of it but no one had the courage to bring it into the open richard frost a high strung and brilliant young man worried about it more than anyone else it haunted him wednesday night he worried and thursday night he fidgeted friday night he got drunk and had a fight with his wife she cried for a while and then pretended to be asleep she heard him slip from bed and go into the kitchen he was getting another drink and then she heard him dress quietly and go out she cried some more then it was very late mrs frost was sure he was going down to doras bear flag richard walked sturdily down the hill through the pines until he came to lighthouse avenue he turned left and went up toward holmans he had the bottle in his pocket and just before he came to the store he took one more slug of it the street lights were turned down low the town was deserted not a soul moved richard stood in the middle of the street and looked up dimly on top of the high mast he could see the lonely figure of the skater he took another drink he cupped his hand and called huskily hey there was no answer hey he called louder and looked around to see if the cops had come out of their place beside the bank down from the sky came a surly reply what do you want richard cupped his hands again how how do you go to the toilet ive got a can up here said the voice richard turned and walked back the way he had come he walked along lighthouse and up through the pines and he came to his house and let himself in as he undressed he knew his wife was awake she bubbled a little when she was asleep he got into bed and she made room for him hes got a can up there richard said chapter xx in midmorning the model t truck rolled triumphantly home to cannery row and hopped the gutter and creaked up through the weeds to its place behind lee chongs the boys blocked up the front wheels drained what gasoline was left into a fivegallon can took their frogs and went wearily home to the palace flophouse then mack made a ceremonious visit to lee chong while the boys got a fire going in the big stove mack thanked lee with dignity for lending the truck he spoke of the great success of the trip of the hundreds of frogs taken lee smiled shyly and waited for the inevitable were in the chips mack said enthusiastically doc pays us a nickel a frog and we got about a thousand lee nodded the price was standard everybody knew that docs away said mack jesus is he gonna be happy when he sees all them frogs lee nodded again he knew doc was away and he also knew where the conversation was going say by the way said mack as though he had just thought of it were a little bit short right now he managed to make it sound like a very unusual situation no whiskey said lee chong and he smiled mack was outraged what would we want whiskey for why we got a gallon of the finest whiskey you ever laid a lip over a whole full god damned running over gallon by the way he continued i and the boys would like to have you just step up for a snort with us they told me to ask you in spite of himself lee smiled with pleasure they wouldnt offer it if they didnt have it no said mack ill lay it on the line i and the boys are pretty short and were pretty hungry you know the price of frogs is twenty for a buck now doc is away and were hungry so what we thought is this we dont want to see you lose nothing so well make over to you twentyfive frogs for a buck you got a fivefrog profit there and nobody loses his shirt no said lee no money well hell lee all we need is a little groceries ill tell you what we want to give doc a little party when he gets back we got plenty of liquor but wed like to get maybe some steaks and stuff like that hes such a nice guy hell when your wife had that bad tooth who give her the laudanum mack had him lee was indebted to doc deeply indebted what lee was having trouble comprehending was how his indebtedness to doc made it necessary that he give credit to mack we dont want you to have like a mortgage on frogs mack went on we will actually deliver right into your hands twentyfive frogs for every buck of groceries you let us have and you can come to the party too lees mind nosed over the proposition like a mouse in a cheese cupboard he could find nothing wrong with it the whole thing was legitimate frogs were cash as far as doc was concerned the price was standard and lee had a double profit he had his fivefrog margin and also he had the grocery markup the whole thing hinged on whether they actually had any frogs we go see flog lee said at last in front of the palace he had a drink of the whiskey inspected the damp sacks of frogs and agreed to the transaction he stipulated however that he would take no dead frogs now mack counted fifty frogs into a can and walked back to the grocery with lee and got two dollars worth of bacon and eggs and bread lee anticipating a brisk business brought a big packing case out and put it into the vegetable department he emptied the fifty frogs into it and covered it with a wet gunny sack to keep his charges happy and business was brisk eddie sauntered down and bought two frogs worth of bull durham jones was outraged a little later when the price of cocacola went up from one to two frogs in fact bitterness arose as the day wore on and prices went up steak for instance the very best steak shouldnt have been more than ten frogs a pound but lee set it at twelve and a half canned peaches were sky high eight frogs for a no can lee had a stranglehold on the consumers he was pretty sure that the thrift market or holmans would not approve of this new monetary system if the boys wanted steak they knew they had to pay lees prices feeling ran high when hazel who had coveted a pair of yellow silk arm bands for a long time was told that if he didnt want to pay thirtyfive frogs for them he could go somewhere else the poison of greed was already creeping into the innocent and laudable merchandising agreement bitterness was piling up but in lees packing case the frogs were piling up too financial bitterness could not eat too deeply into mack and the boys for they were not mercantile men they did not measure their joy in goods sold their egos in bank balances nor their loves in what they cost while they were mildly irritated that lee was taking them for an ecomonic ride or perhaps hop two dollars worth of bacon and eggs was in their stomachs lying right on top of a fine slug of whiskey and right on top of the breakfast was another slug of whiskey and they sat in their own chairs in their own house and watched darling learning to drink canned milk out of a sardine can darling was and was destined to remain a very happy dog for in the group of five men there were five distinct theories of dog training theories which dashed so that darling never got any training at all from the first she was a precocious bitch she slept on the bed of the man who had given her the last bribe they really stole for her sometimes they wooed her away from one another occasionally all five agreed that things had to change and that darling must be disciplined but in the discussion of method the intention invariably drifted away they were in love with her they found the little puddles she left on the floor charming they bored all their acquaintances with her cuteness and they would have killed her with food if in the end she hadnt had better sense than they jones made her a bed in the bottom of the grandfather clock but darling never used it she slept with one or another of them as the fancy moved her she chewed the blankets tore the mattresses sprayed the feathers out of the pillows she coquetted and played her owners against one another they thought she was wonderful mack intended to teach her tricks and go in vaudeville and he didnt even housebreak her they sat in the afternoon smoking digesting considering and now and then having a delicate drink from the jug and each time they warned that they must not take too much for it was to be for doc they must not forget that for a minute what time you figure hell be back eddie asked usually gets in about eight or nine oclock said mack now we got to figure when were going to give it i think we ought to give it tonight sure the others agreed maybe he might be tired hazel suggested thats a long drive hell said jones nothing rests you like a good party ive been so dog tired my pants was draggin and then ive went to a party and felt fine we got to do some real thinkin said mack where we going to give it here well doc he likes his music hes always got his phonograph going at a party maybe hed be more happy if we give it over at his place you got something there said mack but i figure it ought to be like a surprise party and how we going to make like its a party and not just us bringin over a jug of whiskey how about decorations hughie suggested like fourth of july or halloween macks eyes looked off into space and his lips were parted he could see it all hughie he said i think you got something there i never would of thought you could do it but by god you really rang a duck that time his voice grew mellow and his eyes looked into the future i can just see it he said doc comes home hes tired he drives up the place is all lit up he thinks somebodys broke in he goes up the stairs and by god the place has got the hell decorated out of it theres crepe paper and theres favors and a big cake jesus hed know it was a party then and it wouldnt be no little mouse fart party neither and were kind of hiding so for a minute he dont know who done it and then we come out yelling cant you see his face by god hughie i dont know how you thought of it hughie blushed his conception had been much more conservative based in fact on the new years party at la ida but if it was going to be like that why hughie was willing to take credit i just thought it would be nice he said well its a pretty nice thing said mack and i dont mind saying when the surprise kind of wears off im going to tell doc who thought it up they leaned back and considered the thing and in their minds the decorated laboratory looked like the conservatory at the hotel del monte they had a couple more drinks just to savor the plan lee chong kept a very remarkable store for instance most stores buy yellow and black crepe paper and black paper cats masks and papiermache pumpkins in october there is a brisk business for halloween and then these items disappear maybe they are sold or thrown out but you cant buy them say in june the same is true of fourth of july equipment flags and bunting and skyrockets where are they in january gone no one knows where this was not lee chongs way you could buy valentines in november at lee chongs shamrocks hatchets and paper cherry trees in august he had firecrackers he had laid up in one of the mysteries was where he kept his stock since his was not a very large store he had bathing suits he had bought when long skirts and black stockings and head bandanas were in style he had bicycle dips and tatting shuttles and mah jong sets he had badges that said remember the maine and felt pennants commemorating fighting bob he had mementos of the panama pacific international exposition of little towers of jewels and there was one other unorthodoxy in lees way of doing business he never had a sale never reduced a price and never remaindered an article that cost thirty cents in still was thirty cents although mice and moths might seem to some to have reduced its value but there was no question about it if you wanted to decorate a laboratory in a general way not being specific about the season but giving the impression of a cross between saturnalia and a pageant of the flags of all nations lee chongs was the place to go for your stuff mack and the boys knew that but mack said where we going to get a big cake lee hasnt got nothing but them little bakery cakes hughie had been so successful before he tried again whynt eddie bake a cake he suggested eddie used to be fry cook at the san carlos for a while the instant enthusiasm for the idea drove from eddies brain the admission that he had never baked a cake mack put it on a sentimental basis besides it would mean more to doc he said it wouldnt be like no god damned old soggy bought cake it would have some heart in it as the afternoon and the whiskey went down the enthusiasm rose there were endless trips to lee chongs the frogs were gone from one sack and lees packing case was getting crowded by six oclock they had finished the gallon of whiskey and were buying half pints of old tennis shoes at fifteen frogs a crack but the pile of decorating materials was heaped on the floor of the palace flophouse miles of crepe paper commemorating every holiday in vogue and some that had been abandoned eddie watched his stove like a mother hen he was baking a cake in the wash basin the recipe was guaranteed not to fail by the company which made the shortening but from the first the cake had acted strangely when the batter was completed it writhed and panted as though animals were squirming and crawling inside it once in the oven it put up a bubble like a baseball which grew tight and shiny and then collapsed with a hissing sound this left such a crater that eddie made a new batch of batter and filled in the hole and now the cake was behaving very curiously for while the bottom was burning and sending out a black smoke the top was rising and falling glueyly with a series of little explosions when eddie finally put it out to cool it looked like one of bel geddes miniatures of a battlefield on a lava bed this cake was not fortunate for while the boys were decorating the laboratory darling ate what she could of it was sick in it and finally curled up in its still warm dough and went to sleep but mack and the boys had taken the crepe paper the masks the broomsticks and paper pumpkins the red white and blue bunting and moved over the lot and across the street to the laboratory they disposed of the last of the frogs for a quart of old tennis shoes and two gallons of cent wine doc is very fond of wine said mack i think he likes it even better than whiskey doc never locked the laboratory he went on the theory that anyone who really wanted to break in could easily do it that people were essentially honest and that finally there wasnt much the average person would want to steal there anyway the valuable things were books and records surgical instruments and optical glass and such things that a practical working burglar wouldnt look at twice his theory had been sound as far as burglars snatch thieves and kleptomaniacs were concerned but it had been completely ineffective regarding his friends books were often borrowed no can of beans ever survived his absence and on several occasions returning late he had found guests in his bed the boys piled the decorations in the anteroom and then mack stopped them whats going to make doc happiest he asked the party said hazel no said mack the decorations hughie suggested he felt responsible for the decorations no said mack the frogs thats going to make him feel best of all and maybe by the time he gets here lee chong might be closed and he cant even see his frogs until tomorrow no sir mack cried them frogs ought to be right here right in the middle of the room with a piece of bunting on it and a sign that says welcome home doc the committee which visited lee met with stern opposition all sorts of possibilities suggested themselves to his suspicious brain it was explained that he was going to be at the party so he could watch his property that no one questioned that they were his mack wrote out a paper transferring the frogs to lee in case there should be any question when his protests weakened a little they carried the packing case over to the laboratory tacked red white and blue bunting over it lettered the big sign with iodine on a card and they started the decorating from there they had finished the whiskey by now and they really felt in a party mood they crisscrossed the crepe paper and put the pumpkins up passersby in the street joined the party and rushed over to lees to get more to drink lee chong joined the party for a while but his stomach was notoriously weak and he got sick and had to go home at eleven oclock they fried the steaks and ate them someone digging through the records found an album of count basie and the great phonograph roared out the noise could be heard from the boat works to la ida a group of customers from the bear flag mistook western biological for a rival house and charged up the stairs whooping with joy they were evicted by the outraged hosts but only after a long happy and bloody battle that took out the front door and broke two windows the crashing of jars was unpleasant hazel going through the kitchen to the toilet tipped the frying pan of hot grease on himself and the floor and was badly burned at onethirty a drunk wandered in and passed a remark which was considered insulting to doc mack hit him a clip which is still remembered and discussed the man rose off his feet described a small arc and crashed through the packing case in among the frogs someone trying to change a record dropped the tone down and broke the crystal no one has studied the psychology of a dying party it may be raging howling boiling and then a fever sets in and a little silence and then quickly quiddy it is gone the guests go home or go to sleep or wander away to some other affair and they leave a dead body the lights blazed in the laboratory the front door hung sideways by one hinge the floor was littered with broken glass phonograph records some broken some only nicked were strewn about the plates with pieces of steak ends and coagulating grease were on the floor on top of the bookcases under the bed whiskey glasses lay sadly on their sides someone trying to climb the bookcases had pulled out a whole section of books and spilled them in brokenbacked confusion on the floor and it was empty it was over through the broken end of the packing case a frog hopped and sat feeling the air for danger and then another joined him they could smell the fine damp cool air coming in the door and in through the broken windows one of them sat on the fallen card which said welcome home doc and then the two hopped timidly toward the door for quite a while a little river of frogs hopped down the steps a swirling moving river for quite a while cannery row crawled with frogs was overrun with frogs a taxi which brought a very late customer to the bear flag squashed five frogs in the street but well before dawn they had all gone some found the sewer and some worked their way up the hill to the reservoir and some went into culverts and some only hid among the weeds in the vacant lot and the lights blazed in the quiet empty laboratory chapter xxi in the back room of the laboratory the white rats in their cages ran and skittered and squeaked in the corner of a separate cage a mother rat lay over her litter of blind naked children and let them suckle and the mother stared about nervously and fiercely in the rattlesnake cage the snakes lay with their chins resting on their own coils and they stared straight ahead out of their scowling dusty black eyes in another cage a gila monster with a skin like a beaded bag reared slowly up and dawed heavily and sluggishly at the wire the anemones in the aquaria blossomed open with green and purple tentacles and pale green stomachs the little sea water pump whirred softly and the needles of driven water hissed into the tanks forcing lines of bubbles under the surface it was the hour of the pearl lee chong brought his garbage cans out to the curb the bouncer stood on the porch of the bear flag and scratched his stomach sam malloy crawled out of the boiler and sat on his wood block and looked at the lightening east over on the rocks near hopkins marine station the sea lions barked monotonously the old chinaman came up out of the sea with his dripping basket and flipflapped up the hill then a car turned into cannery row and doc drove up to the front of the laboratory his eyes were red rimmed with fatigue he moved slowly with tiredness when the car had stopped he sat still for a moment to let the road jumps get out of his nerves then he climbed out of the car at his step on the stairs the rattlesnakes ran out their tongues and listened with their waving forked tongues the rats scampered madly about the cages doc climbed the stairs he looked in wonder at the sagging door and at the broken window the weariness seemed to go out of him he stepped quickly inside then he went quickly from room to room stepping around the broken glass he bent down quickly and picked up a smashed phonograph record and looked at its title in the kitchen the spilled grease had turned white on the floor docs eyes flamed red with anger he sat down on his couch and his head settled between his shoulders and his body weaved a little in his rage suddenly he jumped up and turned on the power in his great phonograph he put on a record and put down the arm only a hissing roar came from the loudspeaker he lifted the arm stopped the turntable and sat down on the couch again on the stairs there were bumbling uncertain footsteps and through the door came mack his face was red he stood uncertainly in the middle of the room doc he said i and the boys for the moment doc hadnt seemed to see him now he leaped to his feet mack shuffled backward did you do this well i and the boys docs small hard fist whipped out and splashed against macks mouth docs eyes shone with a red animal rage mack sat down heavily on the floor docs fist was hard and sharp macks lips were split against his teeth and one front tooth bent sharply inward get up said doc mack lumbered to his feet his hands were at his sides doc hit him again a cold calculated punishing punch in the mouth the blood spurted from macks lips and ran down his chin he tried to lick his lips put up your hands fight you son of a bitch doc cried and he hit him again and heard the crunch of breaking teeth macks head jolted but he was braced now so he wouldnt fall and his hands stayed at his sides go ahead doc he said thickly through his broken lips i got it coming docs shoulders sagged with defeat you son of a bitch he said bitterly oh you dirty son of a bitch he sat down on the couch and looked at his cut knuckles mack sat down in a chair and looked at him macks eyes were wide and full of pain he didnt even wipe away the blood that flowed down his chin in docs head the monotonal opening of monteverdis hor ch el ciel e la terra began to form the infinitely sad and resigned mourning of petrarch for laura doc saw macks broken mouth through the music the music that was in his head and in the air mack sat perfectly still almost as though he could hear the music too doc glanced at the place where the monteverdi album was and then he remembered that the phonograph was broken he got to his feet go wash your face he said and he went out and down the stairs and across the street to lee chongs lee wouldnt look at him as he got two quarts of beer out of the icebox he took the money without saying anything doc walked back across the street mack was in the toilet cleaning his bloody face with wet paper towels doc opened a bottle and poured gently into a glass holding it at an angle so that very little collar rose to the top he filled a second tall glass and carried the two into the front room mack came back dabbing at his mouth with wet towelling doc indicated the beer with his head now mack opened his throat and poured down half the glass without swallowing he sighed explosively and stared into the beer doc had already finished his glass he brought the bottle in and filled both glasses again he sat down on his couch what happened he asked mack looked at the floor and a drop of blood fell from his lips into his beer he mopped his split lips again i and the boys wanted to give you a party we thought youd be home last night doc nodded his head i see she got out of hand said mack it dont do no good to say im sorry i been sorry all my life this aint no new thing its always like this he swallowed deeply from his glass i had a wife mack said same thing everthing i done turned sour she couldnt stand it any more if i done a good thing it got poisoned up some way if i give her a present they was something wrong with it she only got hurt from me she couldnt stand it no more same thing ever place til i just got to downing i dont do nothin but down no more try to make the boys laugh doc nodded again the music was sounding in his head again complaint and resignation all in one i know he said i was glad when you hit me mack went on i thought to myself maybe this will teach me maybe ill remember this but hell i wont remember nothin i wont learn nothin doc mack cried the way i seen it we was all happy and havin a good time you was glad because we was givin you a party and we was glad the way i seen it it was a good party he waved his hand at the wreckage on the floor same thing when i was married id think her out and then but it never come off that way i know said doc he opened the second quart of beer and poured the glasses full doc said mack i and the boys will clean up here and well pay for the staff thats broke if it takes us five years well pay for it doc shook his head slowly and wiped the beer foam from his mustache no he said ill clean it up i know where everything goes well pay for it doc no you wont mack said doc youll think about it and itll worry you for quite a long time but you wont pay for it theres maybe three hundred dollars in broken museum glass dont say youll pay for it that will just keep you uneasy it might be two or three years before you forget about it and felt entirely easy again and you wouldnt pay it anyway i guess youre right said mack god damn it i know youre right what can we do im over it said doc those socks in the mouth got it out of my system lets forget it mack finished his beer and stood up so long doc he said so long say mack what happened to your wife i dont know said mack she went away he walked clumsily down the stairs and crossed over and walked up the lot and up the chicken walk to the palace flophouse doc watched his progress through the window and then wearily he got a broom from behind the water heater it took him all day to clean up the mess chapter xxii henri the painter was not french and his name was not henri also he was not really a painter henri had so steeped himself in stories of the left bank in paris that he lived there although he had never been there feverishly he followed in periodicals the dadaist movements and schisms the strangely feminine jealousies and religiousness the obscurantisms of the forming and breaking schools regularly he revolted against outworn techniques and materials one season he threw out perspective another year he abandoned red even as the mother of purple finally he gave up paint entirely it is not known whether henri was a good painter or not for he threw himself so violently into movements that he had very little time left for painting of any kind about his painting there is some question you couldnt judge very much from his productions in different colored chicken feathers and nutshells but as a boat builder he was su path henri was a wonderful craftsman he had lived in a tent years ago when he started his boat and until galley and cabin were complete enough to move into but once he was housed and dry he had taken his time on the boat the boat was sculptured rather than built it was thirtyfive feet long and its lines were in constant state of flux for a while it had a clipper bow and a fantail like a destroyer another time it had looked vaguely like a caravel since henri had no money it sometimes took him months to find a plank or a piece of iron or a dozen brass screws that was the way he wanted it for henri never wanted to finish his boat it sat among the pine trees on a lot henri rented for five dollars a year this paid the taxes and satisfied the owner the boat rested in a cradle on concrete foundations a rope ladder hang over the side except when henri was at home then he pulled up the rope ladder and only put it down when guests arrived his little cabin had a wide padded seat that ran around three sides of the room on this he slept and on this his guests sat a table folded down when it was needed and a brass lamp hung from the ceiling his galley was a marvel of compactness but every item in it had been the result of months of thought and work henri was swarthy and morose he wore a beret long after other people abandoned them he smoked a calabash pipe and his dark hair fell about his face henri had many friends whom he loosely classified as those who could feed him and those whom he had to feed his boat had no name henri said he would name it when it was finished henri had been living in and building his boat for ten years during that time he had been married twice and had promoted a number of semipermanent liaisons and all of these young women had left him for the same reason the sevenfoot cabin was too small for two people they resented bumping their heads when they stood up and they definitely felt the need for a toilet marine toilets obviously would not work in a shorebound boat and henri refused to compromise with a spurious landsmans toilet he and his friend of the moment had to stroll away among the pines and one after another his loves left him just after the girl he had called alice left him a very curious thing happened to henri each time he was left alone he mourned formally for a while but actually he felt a sense of relief he could stretch out in his little cabin he could eat what he wanted he was glad to be free of the endless female biologic functions for a while it had become his custom each time he was deserted to buy a gallon of wine to stretch out on the comfortably hard bunk and get drunk sometimes he cried a little all by himself but it was luxurious stuff and he usually had a wonderful feeling of wellbeing from it he would read rimbaud aloud with a very bad accent marveling the while at his fluid speech it was during one of his ritualistic mournings for the lost alice that the strange thing began to happen it was night and his lamp was burning and he had just barely begun to get drunk when suddenly he knew he was no longer alone he let his eye wander cautiously up and across the cabin and there on the other side sat a devilish young man a dark handsome young man his eyes gleamed with cleverness and spirit and energy and his teeth flashed there was something very dear and yet terrible in his face and beside him sat a goldenhaired little boy hardly more than a baby the man looked down at the baby and the baby looked back and laughed delightedly as though something wonderful were about to happen then the man looked over at henri and smiled and he glanced back at the baby from his upper left vest pocket he took an oldfashioned straightedged razor he opened it and indicated the child with a gesture of his head he put a hand among the curls and the baby laughed gleefully and then the man tilted the chin and cut the babys throat arid the baby went right on laughing but henri was howling with terror it took him a long time to realize that neither the man nor the baby was still there henri when his shaking had subsided a little rushed out of his cabin leaped over the side of the boat and hurried away down the hill through the pines he walked for several hours and at last he walked down to cannery row doc was in the basement working on cats when henri burst in doc went on working while henri told about it and when it was over doc looked closely at him to see how much actual fear and how much theater was there and it was mostly fear is it a ghost do you think henri demanded is it some reflection of something that has happened or is it some freudian horror out of me or am i completely nuts i saw it i tell you it happened right in front of me as plainly as i see you i dont know said doc well will you come up with me and see if it comes back no said doc if i saw it it might be a ghost and it would scare me badly because i dont believe in ghosts and if you saw it again and i didnt it would be a hallucination and you would be frightened but what am i going to do henri asked if i see it again ill know whats going to happen and im sure ill die you see he doesnt look like a murderer he looks nice and the kid looks nice and neither of them give a damn but he cut that babys throat i saw it i dont know said doc im not a psychiatrist or a witch hunter and im not going to start now a girls voice called into the basement hi doc can i come in come along said doc she was a rather pretty and a very alert girl doc introduced her to henri hes got a problem said doc he either has a ghost or a terrible conscience and he doesnt know which tell her about it henri henri went over the story again and the girls eyes sparkled but thats horrible she said when he finished ive never in my life even caught the smell of a ghost lets go back up and see if he comes again doc watched them go a little sourly after all it had been his date the girl never did see the ghost but she was fond of henri and it was five months before the cramped cabin and the lack of a toilet drove her out chapter xxiii a black gloom settled over the palace flophouse all the joy went out of it mack came back from the laboratory with his mouth torn and his teeth broken as a kind of pennance he did not wash his face he went to his bed and pulled his blanket over his head and he didnt get up all day his heart was as bruised as his mouth he went over all the bad things he had done in his life and everything he had ever done seemed bad he was very sad hughie and jones sat for a while staring into space and then morosely they went over to the hediondo cannery and applied for jobs and got them hazel felt so bad that he walked to monterey and picked a fight with a soldier and lost it on purpose that made him feel a little better to be utterly beaten by a man hazel could have licked without half trying darling was the only happy one of the whole dub she spent the day under macks bed happily eating up his shoes she was a dever dog and her teeth were very sharp twice in his black despair mack reached under the bed and caught her and put her in bed with him for company but she squirmed out and went back to eating his shoes eddie mooned on down to la ida and talked to his friend the bartender he got a few drinks and borrowed some nickels with which he played melancholy baby five times on the juke box mack and the boys were under a cloud and they knew it and they knew they deserved it they had become social outcasts all of their good intentions were forgotten now the fact that the party was given for doc if it was known was never mentioned or taken into consideration the story ran through the bear flag it was told in the canneries at la ida drunks discussed it virtuously lee chong refused to comment he was feeling financially bruised and the story as it grew went this way they had stolen liquor and money they had maliciously broken into the laboratory and systematically destroyed it out of pure malice and evil people who really knew better took this view some of the drunks at la ida considered going over and beating the hell out of the whole lot of them to show them they couldnt do a thing like that to doc only a sense of the solidarity and fighting ability of mack and the boys saved them from some kind of reprisal there were people who felt virtuous about the affair who hadnt had the material of virtue for a long time the fiercest of the whole lot was tom sheligan who would have been at the party if he had known about it socially mack and the boys were beyond the pale sam malloy didnt speak to them as they went by the boiler they drew into themselves and no one could foresee how they would come out of the cloud for there are two possible reactions to social ostracism either a man emerges determined to be better purer and kindlier or he goes bad challenges the world and does even worse things this last is by far the commonest reaction to stigma mack and the boys balanced on the scales of good and evil they were kind and sweet to darling they were forbearing and patient with one another when the first reaction was over they gave the palace flophouse a cleaning such as it had never had they polished the bright work on the stove and they washed all their clothes and blankets financially they had become dull and solvent hughie and jones were working and bringing home their pay they bought groceries up the hill at the thrift market because they could not stand the reproving eyes of lee chong it was during this time that doc made an observation which may have been true but since there was one factor missing in his reasoning it is not known whether he was correct it was the fourth of july doc was sitting in the laboratory with richard frost they drank beer and listened to a new album of scarlatti and looked out the window in front of the palace flophouse there was a large log of wood where mack and the boys were sitting in the midmorning sun they faced down the hill toward the laboratory doc said look at them there are your true philosophers i think he went on that mack and the boys know everything that has ever happened in the world and possibly everything that will happen i think they survive in this particular world better than other people in a time when people tear themselves to pieces with ambition and nervousness and covetousness they are relaxed all of our socalled successful men are sick men with bad stomachs and bad souls but mack and the boys are healthy and curiously clean they can do what they want they can satisfy their appetites without calling them something else this speech so dried out docs throat that he drained his beer glass he waved two fingers in the air and smiled theres nothing like that first taste of beer he said richard frost said i think theyre just like anyone else they just havent any money they could get it doc said they could ruin their lives and get money mack has qualities of genius theyre all very dever if they want something they just know the nature of things too well to be caught in that wanting if doc had known of the sadness of mack and the boys he would not have made the next statement but no one had told him about the social pressure that was exerted against the inmates of the palace he poured beer slowly into his glass i think i can show you proof he said you see how they are sitting facing this way well in about half an hour the fourth of july parade is going to pass on lighthouse avenue by just turning their heads they can see it by standing up they can watch it and by walking two short blocks they can be right beside it now ill bet you a quart of beer they wont even turn their heads suppose they dont said richard frost what will that prove what will it prove cried doc why just that they know what will be in the parade they will know that the mayor will ride first in an automobile with bunting streaming from the hood next will come long bob on his white horse with the flag then the city council then two companies of soldiers from the presidio next the elks with purple umbrellas then the knights templar in white ostrich feathers and carrying swords next the knights of columbus with red ostrich feathers and carrying swords mack and the boys know that the band will play theyve seen it all they dont have to look again the man doesnt live who doesnt have to look at a parade said richard frost is it a bet then its a bet it has always seemed strange to me said doc the things we admire in men kindness and generosity openness honesty understanding and feeling are the concomitants of failure in our system and those traits we detest sharpness greed acquisitiveness meanness egotism and selfinterest are the traits of success and while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second who wants to be good if he has to be hungry too said richard frost oh it isnt a matter of hunger its something quite different the sale of souls to gain the whole world is completely voluntary and almost unanimous but not quite everywhere in the world there are mack and the boys ive seen them in an icecream seller in mexico and in an aleut in alaska you know how they tried to give me a party and something went wrong but they wanted to give me a party that was their impulse listen said doc isnt that the band i hear quickly he filled two glasses with beer and the two of them stepped close to the window mack and the boys sat dejectedly on their log and faced the laboratory the sound of the band came from lighthouse avenue the drums echoing back from the buildings and suddenly the mayors car crossed and it sprayed bunting from the radiator then long bob on his white horse carrying the flag then the band then the soldiers the elks the knights templar the knights of columbus richard and the doc leaned forward tensely but they were watching the line of men sitting on the log and not a head turned not a neck straightened up the parade filed past and they did not move and the parade was gone doc drained his glass and waved two fingers gently in the air and he said hah theres nothing in the world like that first taste of beer richard started for the door what kind of beer do you want the same kind said doc gently he was smiling up the bill at mack and the boys its all fine to say time will heal everything this too shall pass away people will forget and things like that when you are not involved but when you are there is no passage of time people do not forget and you are in the middle of something that does not change doc didnt know the pain and selfdestructive criticism in the palace flophouse or he might have tried to do something about it and mack and the boys did not know how he felt or they would have held up their heads again it was a bad time evil stalked darkly in the vacant lot sam malloy had a number of fights with his wife and she cried all the time the echoes inside the boiler made it sound as though she were crying under water mack and the boys seemed to be the node of trouble the nice bouncer at the bear flag threw out a drunk but threw him too hard and too far and broke his back alfred had to go over to salinas three times before it was cleared up and that didnt make alfred feel very well ordinarily he was too good a bouncer to hurt anyone his a and c was a miracle of rhythm and grace on top of that a group of highminded ladies in the town demanded that dens of vice must close to protect young american manhood this happened about once a year in the dead period between the fourth of july and the county fair dora usually closed the bear flag for a week when it happened it wasnt so bad everyone got a vacation and little repairs to the plumbing and the walls could be made but this year the ladies went on a real crusade they wanted somebodys scalp it had been a dull summer and they were restless it got so bad that they had to be told who actually owned the property where vice was practiced what the rents were and what little hardships might be the result of their closing that was how close they were to being a serious menace dora was closed a full two weeks and there were three conventions in monterey while the bear flag was closed word got around and monterey lost five conventions for the following year things were bad all over doc had to get a loan at the bank to pay for the glass that was broken at the party elmer rechati went to sleep on the southern pacific track and lost both legs a sudden and completely unexpected storm tore a purseseiner and three lampara boats loose from their moorings and tossed them broken and sad on del monte beach there is no explaining a series of misfortunes like that every man blames himself people in their black minds remember sins committed secretly and wonder whether they have caused the evil sequence one man may put it down to sun spots while another invoking the law of probabilities doesnt believe it not even the doctors had a good time of it for while many people were sick none of it was goodpaying sickness it was nothing a good physic or a patent medicine wouldnt take care of and to cap it all darling got sick she was a very fat and lively puppy when she was struck down but five days of fever reduced her to a little skincovered skeleton her livercolored nose was pink and her gums were white her eyes glazed with illness and her whole body was hot although she trembled sometimes with cold she wouldnt eat and she wouldnt drink and her fat little belly shriveled up against her spine and even her tail showed the articulations through the skin it was obviously distemper now a genuine panic came over the palace flophouse darling had come to be vastly important to them hughie and jones instantly quit their jobs so they could be near to help they sat up in shifts they kept a cool damp cloth on her forehead and she got weaker and sicker finally although they didnt want to hazel and jones were chosen to call on doc they found him working over a tide chart while he ate a chicken stew of which the principal ingredient was not thicken but sea cucumber they thought he looked at them a little coldly its darling they said shes sick whats the matter with her mack says its distemper im no veterinarian said doc i dont know how to treat these things hazel said well couldnt you just take a look at her shes sick as hell they stood in a circle while doc examined darling he looked at her eyeballs and her gums and felt in her ear for fever he ran his finger over the ribs that stuck out like spokes and at the poor spine she wont eat he asked not a thing said mack youll have to force feed her strong soup and eggs and cod liver oil they thought he was cold and professional he went back to his tide charts and his stew but mack and the boys had something to do now they boiled meat until it was as strong as whiskey they put cod liver oil far back on her tongue so that some of it got down her they held up her head and made a little funnel of her chops and poured the cool soup in she had to swallow or drown every two hours they fed her and gave her water before they had slept in shifts now no one slept they sat silently and waited for darlings crisis it came early in the morning the boys sat in their chairs half asleep but mack was awake and his eyes were on the puppy he saw her ears flip twice and her chest heave with infinite weakness she climbed slowly to her spindly legs dragged herself to the door took four laps of water and collapsed on the floor mack shouted the others awake he danced heavily all the boys shouted at one another lee chong heard them and snorted to himself as he carried out the garbage cans alfred the bouncer heard them and thought they were having a party by nine oclock darling had eaten a raw egg and half a pint of whipped cream by herself by noon she was visibly putting on weight in a day she romped a little and by the end of the week she was a well dog at last a crack had developed in the wall of evil there were evidences of it everywhere the purseseiner was hauled back into the water and floated word came down to dora that it was all right to open up the bear flag earl wakefield caught a sculpin with two heads and sold it to the museum for eight dollars the wall of evil and of waiting was broken it broke away in chunks the curtains were drawn at the laboratory that night and gregorian music played until two oclock and then the music stopped and no one came out some force wrought with lee chongs heart and all in an oriental mometit he forgave mack and the boys and wrote off the frog debt which had been a monetary headache from the beginning and to prove to the boys that he had forgiven them he took a pint of old tennis shoes up and presented it to them their trading at the thrift market had hurt his feelings but it was all over now lees visit coincided with the first destructive healthy impulse darling had since her illness she was completely spoiled now and no one thought of housebreaking her when lee chong came in with his gift darling was deliberately and happily destroying hazels only pair of rubber boots while her happy masters applauded her mack never visited the bear flag professionally it would have seemed a little like incest to him there was a house out by the baseball park he patronized thus when he went into the front bar everyone thought he wanted a beer he stepped up to alfred dora around he asked what do you want with her alfred asked i got something i want to ask her what about thats none of your god damn business said mack okay have it your way ill see if she wants to talk to you a moment later he led mack into the sanctum dora sat at a rolltop desk her orange hair was piled in ringlets on her head and she wore a green eyeshade with a stub pen she was bringing her books up to date a fine old double entry ledger she was dressed in a magnificent pink silk wrapper with lace at the wrists and throat when mack came in she whirled her pivot chair about and faced him alfred stood in the door and waited mack stood until alfred closed the door and left dora scrutinized him suspiciously well what can i do for you she demanded at last you see maam said mack well i guess you heard what we done over at docs some time back dora pushed the eyeshade back up on her head and she put the pen in an oldfashioned coilspring holder yeah she said i heard well maam we did it for doc you may not believe it but we wanted to give him a party only he didnt get home in time and well she got out of hand so i heard said dora well what you want me to do well said mack i and the boys thought wed ask you you know what we think of doc we wanted to ask you what you thought we could do for him that would kind of show him dora said hum and she flopped back in her pivot chair and crossed her legs and smoothed her wrapper over her knees she shook out a cigarette lighted it and studied you gave him a party he didnt get to why dont you give him a party he does get to she said jesus said mack afterwards talking to the boys it was just as simple as that now there is one hell of a woman no wonder she got to be a madam there is one hell of a woman chapter xxiv mary talbot mrs tom talbot that is was lovely she had red hair with green lights in it her skin was golden with a green undercast and her eyes were green with little golden spots her face was triangular with wide cheekbones wideset eyes and her chin was pointed she had long dancers legs and dancers feet and she seemed never to touch the ground when she walked when she was excited and she was excited a good deal of the time her face flushed with gold her greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandmother had been burned as a witch more than anything in the world mary talbot loved parties she loved to give parties and she loved to go to parties since tom talbot didnt make much money mazy couldnt give parties all the time so she tricked people into giving them sometimes she telephoned a friend and said bluntly isnt it about time you gave a party regularly mary had six birthdays a year and she organized costume parties surprise parties holiday parties christmas eve at her house was a very exciting thing for mary glowed with parties she carried her husband tom along on the wave of her excitement in the afternoon when tom was at work mary sometimes gave tea parties for the neighborhood cats she set a footstool with doll cups and saucers she gathered the cats and there were plenty of them and then she held long and detailed conversations with them it was a kind of play she enjoyed very much a kind of satiric game and it covered and concealed from mary the fact that she didnt have very nice clothes and the talbots didnt have any money they were pretty near absolute bottom most of the time and when they really scraped mary managed to give some kind of party she could do that she could infect a whole house with gaiety and she used her gift as a weapon against the despondency that lurked always around outside the house waiting to get in at tom that was marys job as she saw it to keep the despondency away from tom because everyone knew he was going to be a great success some time mostly she was successful in keeping the dark things out of the house but sometimes they got in at tom and laid him out then he would sit and brood for hours while mary frantically built up a backfire of gaiety one time when it was the first of the month and there were curt notes from the water company and the rent wasnt paid and a manuscript had come back from colliers and the cartoons had come back from the new yorker and pleurisy was hurting tom pretty badly he went into the bedroom and lay down on the bed mary came softly in for the bluegray color of his gloom had seeped out under the door and through the keyhole she had a little bouquet of candy tuft in a collar of paper lace smell she said and held the bouquet to his nose he smelled the flowers and said nothing do you know what day this is she asked and thought wildly for something to make it a bright day tom said why dont we face it for once were down were going under whats the good kidding ourselves no were not said mary were magic people we always have been remember that ten dollars you found in a book remember when your cousin sent you five dollars nothing can happen to us well it has happened said tom im sorry he said i just cant talk myself out of it this time im sick of pre tending everything for once id like to have it real just for once i thought of giving a little party tonight said mary on what youre not going to cut out the baked ham picture from a magazine again and serve it on a platter are you im sick of that kind of kidding it isnt funny any more its sad i could give a little party she insisted just a small affair nobody will dress its the anniversary of the founding of the bloomer league you didnt even remember that its no use said tom i know its mean but i just cant rise to it why dont you just go out and shut the door and leave me alone ill get you down if you dont she looked at him closely and saw that he meant it mary walked quietly out and shut the door and tom turned over on the bed and put his face down between his arms he could hear her rustling about in the other room she decorated the door with old christmas things glass balls and tinsel and she made a placard that said welcome tom our hero she listened at the door and couldnt hear anything a little disconsolately she got out the footstool and spread a napkin over it she put her bouquet in a glass in the middle of the footstool and set out four little cups and saucers she went into the kitchen put the tea in the teapot and set the kettle to boil then she went out into the yard kitty randolph was sunning herself by the front fence mary said miss randolph im having a few friends in to tea if you would care to come kitty randolph rolled over languorously on her back and stretched in the warm sun dont be later than four oclock said mary my husband and i are going to the boomer league centennial reception at the hotel she strolled around the house to the backyard where the blackberry vines dambered over the fence kitty casini was squatting on the ground growling to herself and flickering her tail fiercely mrs casini mary began and then she stopped for she saw what the cat was doing kitty casini had a mouse she patted it gently with her unarmed paw and the mouse squirmed horribly away dragging its paralyzed hind legs behind it the cat let it get nearly to the cover of the blackberry vines and then she reached delicately out and white thorns had sprouted on her jaw daintly she stabbed the mouse through the back and drew it wriggling to her and her tail flicked with tense delight tom must have been at least half asleep when he heard his name called over and over he jumped up shouting what is it where are you he could hear mary crying he ran out into the yard and saw what was happeing turn your head he shouted and he killed the mouse kitty casini had leaped to the top of the fence where she watched him angrily tom picked up a rock and hit her in the stomach and knocked her off the fence in the house mary was still crying a little she poured the water into the teapot and brought it to the table sit there she told tom and he squatted down on the floor in front of the footstool cant i have a big cup he asked i cant blame kitty casini said mary i know how cats are it isnt her fault but oh tom im going to have trouble inviting her again im just not going to like her for a while no matter how much i want to she looked closely at tom and saw that the lines were gone from his forehead and that he was not blinking badly but then im so busy with the bloomer league these days she said i just dont know how im going to get everything done mary talbot gave a pregnancy party that year and everyone said god a kid of hers is going to have fun chapter xxv certainly all of cannery row and probably all of monterey felt that a change had come its all right not to believe in luck and omens nobody believes in them but it doesnt do any good to take chances with them and no one takes chances cannery row like every place else is not superstitious but will not walk under a ladder or open an umbrella in the house doc was a pure scientist and incapable of superstition and yet when he came in late one night and found a line of white flowers across the doorsill he had a bad time of it but most people in cannery row simply do not believe in such things and then live by them there was no doubt in macks mind that a dark cloud had hung on the palace flophouse he had analyzed the abortive party and found that a misfortune had crept into every crevice that bad luck had come up like hives on the evening and once you got into a routine like that the best thing to do was just to go to bed until it was over you couldnt buck it not that mack was superstitious now a kind of gladness began to penetrate into the row and to spread out from there doc was almost supernaturally successful with a series of lady visitors he didnt half try the puppy at the palace was growing like a pole bean and having a thousand generations of training behind her she began to train herself she got disgusted with wetting on the floor and took to going outside it was obvious that darling was going to grow up a good and charming dog and she had developed no chorea from her distemper the benignant influence crept like gas through the row it got as far as hermans hamburger stand it spread to the san carlos hotel jimmy brucia felt it and johnny his singing bartender sparky evea felt it and joyously joined battle with three new out of town cops it even got as far as the county jail in salinas where gay who had lived a good life by letting the sheriff beat him at checkers suddenly grew cocky and never lost another game he lost his privileges that way but he felt a whole man again the sea lions felt it and their barking took on a tone and a cadence that would have gladdened the heart of st francis little girls studying their catechism suddenly looked up and giggled for no reason at all perhaps some electrical finder could have been developed so delicate that it could have located the source of all this spreading joy and fortune and triangulation might possibly have located it in the palace flophouse and grill certainly the palace was lousy with it mack and the boys were charged jones was seen to leap from his chair only to do a quick tap dance and sit down again hazel smiled vaguely at nothing at all the joy was so general and so sdfused that mack had a hard time keeping it centered and aimed at its objective eddie who had worked at la ida pretty regularly was accumulating a cellar of some promise he no longer added beer to the wining jug it gave a flat taste to the mixture he said sam malloy had planted morning glories to grow over the boiler he had put out a little awning and under it he and his wife often sat in the evening she was crocheting a bedspread the joy even got into the bear flag business was good phyllis maes leg was knitting nicely and she was nearly ready to go to work again eva flanegan got back from east st louis very glad to be back it had been hot in east st louis and it hadnt been as fine as she remembered it but then she had been younger when she had had so much fun there the knowledge or conviction about the party for doc was no sudden thing it did not burst out full blown people knew about it but let it grow gradually like a pupa in the cocoons of their imaginations mack was realistic about it last time we forced her he told the boys you cant never give a good party that way you got to let her creep up on you well whens it going to be jones asked impatiently i dont know said mack is it gonna be a surprise party hazel asked it ought to thats the best kind said mack darling brought him a tennis ball she had found and he threw it out the door into the weeds she bounced away after it hazel said if we knew when was docs birthday we could give him a birthday party macks mouth was open hazel constantly surprised him by god hazel you got something he cried yes sir if it was his birthday thered be presents thats just the thing all we got to find out is when it is that ought to be easy said hughie why dont we ask him hell said mack then hed catch on you ask a guy when is his birthday and especially if youve already give him a party like we done and hell know what you want to know for maybe ill just go over and smell around a little and not let on ill go with you said hazel no if two of us went he might figure we were up to something well hell it was my idear said hazel i know said mack and when it comes off why ill tell doc it was your idear but i think i better go over alone how is he friendly eddie asked sure hes all right mack found doc way back in the downstairs part of the laboratory he was dressed in a long rubber apron and he wore rubber gloves to protect his hands from the formaldehyde he was injecting the veins and arteries of small dogfish with color mass his little ball mill rolled over and over mixing the blue mass the red fluid was already in the pressure gun docs fine hands worked precisely slipping the needle into place and pressing the compressed air trigger that forced the color into the veins he laid the finished fish in a neat pile he would have to go over these again to put blue mass in the arteries the dogfish made good dissection specimens hi doc said mack keepin pretty busy busy as i want said doc hows the pup doin just fine she would of died if it hadnt been for you for a moment a wave of caution went over doc and then slipped off ordinarily a compliment made him wary he had been dealing with mack for a long time but the tone had nothing but gratefulness in it he knew how mack felt about the pup how are things going up at the palace fine doc just fine we got two new chairs i wish youd come up and see us its pretty nice up there now i will said doc eddie still bring back the jug sure said mack he aint puttin beer in it no more and i think the stuff is better its got more zip it had plenty of zip before said doc mack waited patiently sooner or later doc was going to wade into it and he was waiting if doc seemed to open the subject himself it would be less suspicious this was always macks method havent seen hazel for some time he isnt sick is he no said mack and he opened the campaign hazel is all right him and hughie are havin one hell of a battle been goin on for a week he thudded an the funny thing is its about somethin they dont neither of them know nothin about i stayed out of it because i dont know nothin about it neither but not them theyve even got a little mad at each other whats it about doc asked well sir said mack hazels all the time buyin these here charts and lookin up lucky days and stars and stuff like that and hughie says its all a bunch of malarky hazel he says if you know when a guy is born you can tell about him and hughie says theyre just sellin hazel them charts for two bits apiece me i dont know nothin about it what do you think doc id kind of side with hughie said doc he stopped the ball mill washed out the color gun and filled it with blue mass they got goin hot the other night said mack they ask me when im born so i tell em april and hazel he goes and buys one of them charts and read all about me well it did seem to hit in some places but it was nearly all good stuff and a guy will believe good stuff about himself it said im brave and smart and kind to my friends but hazel says its all true whens your birthday doc at the end of the long discussion it sounded perfectly casual you couldnt put your finger on it but it must be remembered that doc had known mack a very long time if he had not he would have said december which was his birthday instead of october which was not october said doc ask hazel what that makes me its probably so much malarky said mack but haze he takes it serious ill ask him to look you up doc when mack left doc wondered casually what the buildup was for he had recognized it as a lead he knew macks technique his method he recognized his style and he wondered to what purpose mack could put the information it was only later when rumors began to creep in that doc added the whole thing up now he felt slightly relieved for he had expected mack to put the bite on him chapter xxvi the two little boys played in the boat works yard until a cat climbed the fence instantly they gave chase drove it across the tracks and there filled their pockets with granite stones from the roadbed the cat got away from them in the tall weeds but they kept the stones because they were perfect in weight shape and size for throwing you cant ever tell when youre going to need a stone like that they turned down cannery row and whanged a stone at the corrugated iron front of mordens cannery a startled man looked out the office window and then rushed for the door but the boys were too quick for him they were lying behind a wooden stringer in the lot before he even got near the door he couldnt have found them in a hundred years i bet he could look all his life and he couldnt find us said joey they got tired of hiding after a while with no one looking for them they got up and strolled on down cannery row they looked a long time in lees window coveting the pliers the back saws the engineers caps and the bananas then they crossed the street and sat down on the lower step of the stairs that went to the second story of the laboratory joey said you know this guy in here got babies in bottles what kind of babies willard asked regular babies only before theyre borned i dont believe it said willard well its true the sprague kid seen them and he says they aint no bigger than this and they got little hands and feet and eyes and hair willard demanded well the sprague kid didnt say about hair you should of asked him i think hes a liar you better not let him hear you say that said joey well you can tell him i said it i aint afraid of him and i aint afraid of you i aint afraid of anybody you want to make something of it joey didnt answer well do you no said joey i was thinkin why dont we just go up and ask the guy if hes got babies in bottles maybe hed show them to us that is if hes got any he aint here said willard when hes here his cars here hes away some place i think its a lie i think the sprague kid is a liar i think youre a liar you want to make something of that it was a lazy day willard was going to have to work hard to get up any excitement i think youre a coward too you want to make something of that joey didnt answer willard changed his tactics wheres your old man now he asked in a conversational tone hes dead said joey oh yeah i didnt hear whatd he die of for a moment joey was silent he knew willard knew but he couldnt let on he knew not without fighting willard and joey was afraid of willard he committed he killed himself yeah willard put on a long face howd he do it he took rat poison willards voice shrieked with laughter whatd he think he was a rat joey chuckled a little at the joke just enough that is he must of thought he was a rat willard cried did he go crawling around like this look joey like this did he wrinkle up his nose like this did he have a big old long tail willard was helpless with laughter whynt he just get a rat trap and put his head in it they laughed themselves out on that one willard really wore it out then he probed for another joke whatd he look like when he took it like this he crossed his eyes and opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue he was sick all day said joey he didnt die til the middle of the night it hurt him willard said whatd he do it for he couldnt get a job said joey nearly a year he couldnt get a job and you know a funny thing the next morning a guy come around to give him a job willard tried to recapture his joke i guess he just figured he was a rat he said but it fell through even for willard joey stood up and put his hands in his pockets he saw a little coppery shine in the gutter and walked toward it but just as he reached it willard shoved him aside and picked up the penny i saw it first joey cried its mine you want to try and make something of it said willard whynt you go take some rat poison chapter xxvii mack and the boys the virtues the beatitudes the beauties they sat in the palace flophouse and they were the stone dropped in the pool the impulse which sent out ripples to all of cannery row and beyond to pacific grove to monterey even over the hill to carmel this time said mack we got to be sure he gets to the party if he dont get there we dont give it where we going to give it this time jones asked mack tipped his chair back against the wall and hooked his feet around the front legs ive give that a lot of thought he said of course we could give it here but it would be pretty hard to surprise him here and doc likes his own place hes got his music there mack scowled around the room i dont know who broke his phonograph last time he said but if anybody so much as lays a finger on it next time i personally will kick the hell out of him i guess well just have to give it at his place said hughie people didnt get the news of the party the knowledge of it just slowly grew up in them and no one was invited everyone was going october had a mental red drde around it and since it was to be a birthday party there were presents to be considered take the girls at doras all of them had at one time or another gone over to the laboratory for advice or medicine or simply for unprofessional company and they had seen docs bed it was covered with an old faded red blanket full of fox tails and burrs and sand for he took it on all his collecting trips if money came in he bought laboratory equipment it never occurred to him to buy a new blanket for himself doras girls were making him a patchwork quilt a beautiful thing of silk and since most of the silk available came from underclothing and evening dresses the quilt was glorious in strips of flesh pink and orchid and pale yellow and cerise they worked on it in the late mornings and in the afternoons before the boys from the sardine fleet came in under the community of effort those fights and ill feelings that always are present in a whore house completely disappeared lee chong got out and inspected a twentyfivefoot string of firecrackers and a big bag of china lily bulbs these to his way of thinking were the finest things you could have for a party sam malloy had long had a theory of antiques he knew that old furniture and glass and crockery which had not been very valuable in its day had when time went by taken on desirability and cash value out of all proportion to its beauty or utility he knew of one chair that had brought five hundred dollars sam collected pieces of historic automobiles and he was convinced that some day his collection after making him very rich would repose on black velvet in the best museums sam gave the party a good deal of thought and then he went over his treasures which he kept in a big locked box behind the boiler he decided to give doc one of his finest pieces the connecting rod and piston from a chalmers he rubbed and polished this beauty until it gleamed like a piece of ancient armor he made a little box for it and lined it with black cloth mack and the boys gave the problem considerable thought and came to the conclusion that doc always wanted cats and had some trouble getting them mack brought out his double cage they borrowed a female in an interesting condition and set their trap under the cypress tree at the top of the vacant lot in the corner of the palace they built a wire cage and in it their collection of angry torn cats grew with every night jones had to make two trips a day to the canneries for fish heads to feed their charges mack considered and correctly that twentyfive tom cats would be as nice a present as they could give doc no decorations this time said mack just a good solid party with lots of liquor gay heard about the party clear over in salinas jail and he made a deal with the sheriff to get off that night and borrowed two dollars from him for a round trip bus ticket gay had been very nice to the sheriff who wasnt a man to forget it particularly because election was coming up and gay could or said he could swing quite a few votes besides gay could give the salinas jail a bad name if he wanted to henri had suddenly decided that the oldfashioned pincushion was an art form which had flowered and reached its peak in the nineties and had since been neglected he revived the form and was delighted to see what could be done with colored pins the picture was never completed you could change it by rearranging the pins he was preparing a group of these pieces for a oneman show when he heard about the party and he instantly abandoned his own work and began a giant pincushion for doc it was to be an intricate and provocative design in green yellow and blue pins all cool colors and its title was precambrian memory henris friend eric a learned barber who collected the first editions of writers who never had a second edition or a second book decided to give doc a rowing machine he had got at the bankruptcy proceedings of a client with a threeyear barber bill the rowing machine was in fine condition no one had rowed it much no one ever uses a rowing machine the conspiracy grew and there were endless visits back and forth discussion of presents of liquor of what time will we start and nobody must tell doc doc didnt know when he first became aware that something was going on that concerned him in lee chongs conversation stopped when he entered at first it seemed to him that people were cold to him when at least half a dozen people asked him what he was doing october he was puzzled for he had forgotten he had given this date as his birthday actually he had been interested in the horoscope for a spurious birth date but mack had never mentioned it again and so doc forgot it one evening he stopped in at the halfway house because they had a draft beer he liked and kept it at the right temperature he gulped his first glass and then settled down to enjoy his second when he heard a drunk talking to the bartender you goin to the party what party well said the drunk confidentially you know doc down in cannery row the bartender looked up the bar and then back well said the drunk theyre givin him a hell of a party on his birthday who is everybody doc mulled this over he did not know the drunk at all his reaction to the idea was not simple he felt a great warmth that they should want to give him a party and at the same time he quaked inwardly remembering the last one they had given now everything fell into place macks question and the silences when he was about he thought of it a lot that night sitting beside his desk he glanced about considering what things would have to be locked up he knew the party was going to cost him plenty the next day he began making his own preparations for the party his best records he carried into the back room where they could be locked away he moved every bit of equipment that was breakable back there too he knew how it would be his guests would be hungry and they wouldnt bring anything to eat they would run out of liquor early they always did a little wearily he went up to the thrift market where there was a fine and understanding butcher they discussed meat for some time doc ordered fifteen pounds of steaks ten pounds of tomatoes twelve heads of lettuce six loaves of bread a big jar of peanut butter and one of strawberry jam five gallons of wine and four quarts of a good substantial but not distinguished whiskey he knew he would have trouble at the bank the first of the mouth three or four such parties he thought and he would lose the laboratory meanwhile on the row the planning reached a crescendo doc was right no one thought of food but there were odd pints and quarts put away all over the collection of presents was growing and the guest list if there had been one was a little like a census at the bear flag a constant discussion went on about what to wear since they would not be working the girls did not want to wear the long beautiful dresses which were their uniforms they decided to wear street clothes it wasnt as simple as it sounded dora insisted that a skeleton crew remain on duty to take care of the regulars the girls divided up into shifts some to stay until they were relieved by others they had to flip for who would go to the party first the first ones would see docs face when they gave him the beautiful quilt they had it on a frame in the dining room and it was nearly finished mrs malloy had put aside her bedspread for a while she was crocheting six doilies for docs beer glasses the first excitement was gone from the row now and its place was taken by a deadly cumulative earnestness there were fifteen tom cats in a cage at the palace flophouse and their yowling made darling a little nervous at night chapter xxviii sooner or later frankie was bound to hear about the party for frankie drifted about like a small cloud he was always on the edge of groups no one noticed him or paid any attention to him you couldnt tell whether he was listening or not but frankie did hear about the party and he heard about the presents and a feeling of fullness swelled in him and a feeling of sick longing in the window of jacobs jewelry store was the most beautiful thing in the world it had been there a long time it was a black onyx clock with a gold face but on top of it was the real beauty on top was a bronze group st george killing the dragon the dragon was on his back with his claws in the air and in his breast was st georges spear the saint was in full armor with the visor raised and he rode a fat bigbuttocked horse with his spear he pinned the dragon to the ground but the wonderful thing was that he wore a pointed beard and he looked a little like doc frankie walked to alvarado street several times a week to stand in front of the window and look at this beauty he dreamed about it too dreamed of running his fingers over the rich smooth bronze he had known about it for months when he heard of the party and the presents frankie stood on the sidewalk for an hour before he went inside well said mr jacobs he had given frankie a visual frisk as he came in and he knew there wasnt cents on him how much is that frankie asked huskily what that you mean the clock fifty dollars with the group seventyfive dollars frankie walked out without replying he went down to the beach and crawled under an overturned rowboat and peeked out at the little waves the bronze beauty was so strong in his head that it seemed to stand out in front of him and a frantic trapped feeling came over him he had to get the beauty his eyes were fierce when he thought of it he stayed under the boat all day and at night he emerged and went back to alvarado street while people went to the movies and came out and went to the golden poppy he walked up and down the block and he didnt get tired or sleepy for the beauty burned in him like fire at last the people thinned out and gradually disappeared from the streets and the parked cars drove away and the town settled to sleep a policeman looked closely at frankie what you doing out he asked frankie took to his heels and fled around the corner and hid behind a barrel in the alley at twothirty he crept to the door of jacobs and tried the knob it was locked frankie went back to the alley and sat behind the barrel and thought he saw a broken piece of concrete lying beside the barrel and he picked it up the policeman reported that he heard the crash and ran to it jacobs window was broken he saw the prisoner walking rapidly away and chased him he didnt know how the boy could run that far and that fast carrying fifty pounds of dock and bronze but the prisoner nearly got away if he had not blundered into a blind street he would have got away the chief called doc the next day come on down will you i want to talk to you they brought frankie in very dirty and frowzy his eyes were red but he held his mouth firm and he even smiled a little welcome when he saw doc whats the matter frankie doc asked he broke into jacobs last night the chief said stole some stuff we got in touch with his mother she say its not her fault because he hangs around your place all the time frankie you shouldnt have done it said doc the heavy stone of inevitability was on his heart cant you parole him to me doc asked i dont think the judge will do it said the chief weve got a mental report you know whats wrong with him yes said doc i know and you know whats likely to happen when he comes into puberty yes said doc i know and the stone weighed terribly on his heart the doctor thinks we better put him away we couldnt before but now hes got a felony on him i think we better as frankie listened the welcome died in his eyes what did he take doc asked a great big clock and a bronze statue ill pay for it oh we got it back i dont think the judge will hear of it itll just happen again you know that yes said doc softly i know but maybe he had a reason frankie he said why did you take it frankie looked a long time at him i love you he said doc ran out and got in his car and went collecting in the caves below pt lobos chapter xxix at four oclock on october doc finished bottling the last of a lot of jellyfish he washed out the formaline jug cleaned his foceps powdered and took off his rubber gloves he went upstairs fed the rats and put some of his best records and his microscopes in the back room then he locked it sometimes an illuminated guest wanted to play with the rattlesnakes by making careful preparations by forseeing possibilities doc hoped to make this party as nonlethal as possible without making it dull he put on a pot of coffee started the great fugue on the phonograph and took a shower he was very quick about it for he was dressed in clean clothes and was having his cup of coffee before the music was completed he looked out through the window at the lot and up at the palace but no one was moving doc didnt know who or how many were coming to his party but he knew he was watched he had been conscious of it all day not that he had seen anyone but someone or several people had kept him in sight so it was to be a surprise party he might as well be surprised he would follow his usual routine as though nothing were happening he crossed to lee chongs and bought two quarts of beer there seemed to be a supressed oriental excitement at lees so they were coming too doc went back to the laborataly and poured out a glass of beer he drank the first off fox thirst and poured a second one to taste the lot and the street were still deserted mack and the boys were in the palace and the door was closed all afternoon the stove had roared heating water for baths even darling had been bathed and she wore a red bow around her neck what time you think we should go over hazel asked i dont think before eight oclock said mack but i dont see nothin against us havin a short one to kind of get warmed up how about doc getting warmed up hughie said maybe i ought to just take him a bottle like it was just nothin no said mack doc just went over to lees for some beer you think he suspects anything jones asked how could he asked mack in the corner cage two tom cats started an argument and the whole cageful commented with growls and arched backs there were only twentyone cats they had fallen short of their mark i wonder how well get them cats over there hazel begun we cant carry that big cage through the door we wont said mack remember how it was with the frogs no well just tell doc about them he can come over and get them mack got up and opened one of eddies wining jugs we might as well get warmed up he said at fivethirty the old chinaman flapflapped down the hill past the palace he crossed the lot crossed the street and disappeared between western biological and the hediondo at the bear flag the girls were getting ready a kind of anthor watch had been chosen by straws the ones who stayed were to be relieved every hour dora was splendid her hair freshly dyed orange was curled and piled on her head she wore her wedding ring and a big diamond brooch on her breast her dress was white silk with a black bamboo pattern in the bedrooms the reverse of ordinary procedure was in practice those who were staying wore long evening dresses while those who were going had on short print dresses and looked very pretty the quilt finished and backed was in a big cardboard box in the bar the bouncer grumbled a little for it had been decided that he couldnt go to the party someone had to look after the house contrary to orders each girl had a pint hidden and each girl watched for the signal to fortify herself a little for the party dora strode magnificently into her office and closed the door she unlocked the top drawer of the rolltop desk took out a bottle and a glass and poured herself a snort and the bottle clinked softly on the glass a girl listening outside the door heard the dick and spread the word dora would not be able to smell breaths now and the girls rushed for their rooms and got out their pints dusk had come to cannery row the gray time between daylight and street light phyllis mae peeked around the curtain in the front parlor can you see him doris asked yeah hes got the lights on hes sitting there like hes reading jesus how that guy does read youd think hed ruin his eyes hes got a glass of beer in his hand well said doris we might as well have a little one i guess phyllis mae was still limping a little but she was as good as new she could she said lick her weight in city councilmen seems kind of funny she said there he is sitting over there and he dont know whats going to happen he never comes in here for a trick doris said a little sadly lot of guys dont want to pay said phyllis mae costs them more but they figure it different well hell maybe he likes them likes who them girls that go over there oh yeah maybe he does i been over there he never made a pass at me he wouldnt said doris but that dont mean if you didnt work here you wouldnt have to fight your way out you mean he dont like our profession no i dont mean that at all he probably figures a girl thats workin has got a different attitude they had another small snort in her office dora poured herself one more swallowed it and locked the drawer again she fixed her perfect hair in the wall mirror inspected her shining red nails and went out to the bar alfred the bouncer was sulking it wasnt anything he said nor was his expression unpleasant but he was sulking just the same dora looked him over coldly i guess you figure youre getting the blocks dont you no said alfred no its quite all right that quite threw dora quite all right is it you got a job mister do you want to keep it or not its quite all right alfred said frostily i aint putting out no beef he put his elbows on the bar and studied himself in the mirror you just go and enjoy yourself he said ill take care of everything here you dont need to worry dora melted under his pain look she said i dont like to have the place without a man some lush might get smart and the kids couldnt handle him but a little later you can come over and you could kind of keep your eye on the place out the window how would that be you could see if anything happened well said alfred i would like to come he was mollified by her permission later i might drop over for just a minute or two they was a mean drunk in last night an i dont know dora i kind of lost my nerve since i bust that guys back i just aint sure of myself no more im gonna pull a punch some night and get took you need a rest said dora maybe ill get mack to fill in and you can take a couple of weeks off she was a wonderful madam dora was over at the laboratory doc had a little whiskey after his beer he was feeling a little mellow it seemed a nice thing to him that they would give him a party he played the pavane to a dead princess and felt sentimental and a little sad and because of his feeling he went on with daphnis and chloe there was a passage in it that reminded him of something else the observers in athens before marathon reported seeing a great line of dust crossing the plain and they heard the clash of arms and they heard the eleusinian chant there was part of the music that reminded him of that picture when it was done he got another whiskey and he debated in his mind about the brandenburg that would snap him out of the sweet and sickly mood he was getting into but what was wrong with the sweet and sickly mood it was rather pleasant i can play anything i want he said aloud i can play clair de lune or the maiden with flaxen hair im a free man he poured a whiskey and drank it and he compromised with the moonlight sonata he could see the neon light of la ida blinking on and off and then the street light in front of the bear flag came on a squadron of huge brown beetles hurled themselves against the light and then fell to the ground and moved their legs and felt around with their antennae a lady cat strolled lonesornely along the gutter looking for adventure she wondered what had happened to all the torn cats who had made life interesting and the nights hideous mr mallow on his hands and knees peered out of the boiler door to see if anyone had gone to the party yet in the palace the boys sat restlessly watching the black hands of the alarm dock chapter xxx the nature of parties has been imperfectly studied it is however generally understood that a party has a pathology that it is a kind of an individual and that it is likely to be a very perverse individual and it is also generally understood that a party hardly ever goes the way it is planned or intended this last of course excludes those dismal slave parties whipped and controlled and dominated given by ogreish professional hostesses these are not parties at all but acts and demonstrations about as spontaneous as peristalsis and as interesting as its end product probably everyone in cannery row had projected his imagination to how the party would be the shouts of greeting the congratulations the noise and good feeling and it didnt start that way at all promptly at eight oclock mack and the boys combed and clean picked up their jugs and marched down the chicken walk over the railroad track through the lot across the street and up the steps of western biological everyone was embarrassed doc held the door open and mack made a little speech being as how its your birthday i and the boys thought we would wish you happy birthday and we got twentyone cats for you for a present he stopped and they stood forlornly on the stairs come on in said doc why im im surprised i didnt even know you knew it was my birthday all tom cats said hazel we didnt bring em down they sat down formally in the room at the left there was a long silence well said doc now youre here how about a little drink mack said we brought a little snort and he indicated the three jugs eddie had been accumulating they aint no beer in it said eddie doc covered his early evening reluctance no he said youve got to have a drink with me it just happens i laid in some whiskey they were just seated formally sipping delicately at the whiskey when dora and the girls came in they presented the quilt doc laid it over his bed and it was beautiful and they accepted a little drink mr and mrs malloy followed with their presents lots of folks dont know what this stuffs going to be worth said sam malloy as he brought out the chalmers piston and connecting rod there probably isnt three of these here left in the world and now people began to arrive in droves henri came in with a pincushion three by four feet he wanted to give a lecture on his new art form but by this time the formality was broken mr and mrs gay came in lee chong presented the great string of firecrackers and the china lily bulbs someone ate the lily bulbs by eleven oclock but the firecrackers lasted longer a group of comparative strangers came in from la ida the stiffness was going out of the party quiddy dora sat in a kind of throne her orange hair flaming she held her whiskey glass daintily with her little finger extended and she kept an eye on the girls to see that they conducted themselves properly doc put dance music on the phonograph and he went to the kitchen and began to fry the steaks the first fight was not a bad one one of the group from la ida made an immoral proposal to one of doras girls she protested and mack and the boys outraged at this breach of propriety threw him out quiddy and without breaking anything they felt good then for they knew they were contributing out in the kitchen doc was frying steaks in three skillets and he cut up tomatoes and piled up sliced bread he felt very good mack was personally taking care of the phonograph he had found an album of benny goodmans trios dancing had started indeed the party was beginning to take on depth and vigor eddie went into the office and did a tap dance doc had taken a pint with him to the kitchen and he helped himself from the bottle he was feeling better and better everyone was surprised when he served the meat nobody was really hungry and they cleaned it up instantly now the food set the party into a kind of rich digestive sadness the whiskey was gone and doc brought out the gallons of wine dora sitting enthroned said doc play some of that nice music i get christ awful sick of that juke box over home then doc played ardo and the amor from an album of monteverdi and the guests sat quietly and their eyes were inward dora breathed beauty two newcomers crept up the stairs and entered quietly doc was feeling a golden pleasant sadness the guests were silent when the music stopped doc brought out a book and he read in a clear deep voice even now if i see in my soul the citronbreasted fair one still goldtinted her face like our night stars drawing unto her her body beaten about the flame wounded by the flaring spear of love my first of all by reason of her fresh years then is my heart buried alive in snow even now if my girl with lotus eyes came to me again weary with the dear weight of young love again i would give her to these starved twins of arms and from her mouth drink down the heavy wine as a reeeling pirate bee in fluttered ease steals up the honey from the nenuphar even now if i saw her lying all wide eyes and with collyrium the indent of her cheek lengthened to the bright ear and her pale side so suffering the fever of my distance then would my love for her be ropes of flowers and night a blackhaired lover on the breasts of day even now my eyes that hurry to see no more are painting painting faces of my lost girl o golden rings that tap against cheeks of small magnolia leaves o whitest so soft parchment where my poor divorced lips have written excellent stanzas of kisses and will write no more even now death sends me the flickering of powdery lids over wild eyes and the pity of her slim body all broken up with the weariness of joy the little red flowers of her breasts to be my comfort moving above scarves and for my sorrow wet crimson lips that once i marked as mine even now they chatter her weakness through the two bazaars who was so strong to love me and small men that buy and sell for silver being slaves crinkle the fat about their eyes and yet no prince of the cities of the sea has taken her leading to his grim bed little lonely one you clung to me as a garment clings my girl even now i love long black eyes that caress like silk ever and ever sad and laughing eyes whose lids make such sweet shadow when they close it seems another beautiful look of hers i love a fresh mouth ah a scented mouth and curving hair subtle as a smoke and light fingers and laughter of green gems even now i remember that you made answer very softly we being one soul your hand on my hair the burning memory rounding your near lips i have seen the priestesses of rati make love at moon fail and then in a carpeted hail with a bright gold lamp lie down carelessly anywhere to sleepblack marigolds translated from the sanskrit by b powys mathers phyllis mae was openly weeping when he stopped and dora herself dabbed at her eyes hazel was so taken by the sound of the words that he had not listened to their meaning but a little world sadness had slipped over all of them everyone was remembering a lost love everyone a call mack said jesus thats pretty reminds me of a dame and he let it pass they filled the wine glasses and became quiet the party was slipping away in sweet sadness eddie went out in the office and did a little tap dance and came back and sat down again the party was about to recline and go to sleep when there was a tramp of feet on the stairs a great voice shouted wheres the girls mack got up almost happily and crossed quickly to the door and a smile of joy illuminated the faces of hughie and jones what girls you got in mind mack asked softly aint this a whore house cab driver said they was one down here you made a mistake mister macks voice was gay well whats them dames in there they joined battle then they were the crew of a san pedro tuna boat good hard happy fightwise men with the first rush they burst through to the party doras girls had each one slipped off a shoe and held it by the toe as the fight raged by they would dip a man on the head with a pike heel dora leaped for the kitchen and came roaring out with a meat grinder even doc was happy he flailed about with the chalmers piston and connecting rod it was a good fight hazel tripped and got kicked in the face twice before he could get to his feet again the franklin stove went over with a crash driven to a corner the newcomers defended themselves with heavy books from the bookcases but gradually they were driven back the two front windows were broken out suddenly alfred who had heard the trouble from across the street attacked from the rear with his favorite weapon an indoor ball bat the fight raged down the steps and into the street and across into the lot the front door was hanging limply from one hinge again docs shirt was torn off and his slight strong shoulder dripped blood from a scratch the enemy was driven halfway up the lot when the sirens sounded docs birthday party had barely time to get inside the laboratory and wedge the broken door closed and turn out the lights before the police car cruised up the cops didnt find anything but the party was sitting in the dark giggling happily and drinking wine the shift changed at the bear flag the fresh contingent raged in full of hell and then the party really got going the cops came back looked in clicked their tongues and joined it mack and the boys used the squad car to go to jimmy brucias for more wine and jimmy came back with them you could hear the roar of the party from end to end of cannery row the party had all the best qualities of a riot and a night on the barricades the crew from the san pedro tuna boat crept humbly back and joined the party they were embraced and admired a woman five blocks away called the police to complain about the noise and couldnt get anyone the cops reported their own car stolen and found it later on the beach doc sitting crosslegged on the table smiled and tapped his fingers gently on his knee mack and phyllis mae were doing indian wrestling on the floor and the cool bay wind blew in through the broken windows it was then that someone lighted the twentyfivefoot string of firecrackers chapter xxxi a wellgrown gopher took up residence in a thicket of mallow weeds in the vacant lot on cannery row it was a perfect place the deep green luscious mailows towered up crisp and rich and as they matured their little cheeses hung down provocatively the earth was perfect for a gopher hole too black and soft and yet with a little day in it so that it didnt crumble and the tunnels didnt cave in the gopher was fat and sleek and he had always plenty of food in his cheek pouches his little ears were clean and well set and his eyes were as black as oldfashioned pin heads and just about the same size his digging hands were strong and the fur on his back was glossy brown and the fawncolored fur on his chest was incredibly soft and rich he had long curving yellow teeth and a little short tail altogether he was a beautiful gopher and in the prime of his life he came to the place over land and found it good and he began his burrow on a little eminence where he could look out among the mallow weeds and see the trucks go by on cannery row he could watch the feet of mack and the boys as they crossed the lot to the palace flophouse as he dug down into the coalblack earth he found it even more perfect for there were great rocks under the soil when he made his great chamber for the storing of food it was under a rock so that it could never cave in no matter how hard it rained it was a place where he could settle down and raise any number of families and the burrow could increase in all directions it was beautiful in the early morning when he first poked his head out of the burrow the mallows filtered green light down on him and the first rays of the rising sun shone into his hole and warmed it so that he lay there content and very comfortable when he had dug his great chamber and his four emergency exits and his waterproof deluge room the gopher began to store food he cut down only the perfect mallow stems and trimmed them to the exact length he needed and he took them down the hole and stacked them neatly in his great chamber and arranged them so they wouldnt ferment or get sour he had found the perfect place to live there were no gardens about so no one would think of setting a trap for him cats there were many of them but they were so bloated with fish heads and guts from the canneries that they had long ago given up hunting the soil was sandy enough so that water never stood about or filled a hole for long the gopher worked and worked until he had his great chamber crammed with food then he made little side chambers for the babies who would inhabit them in a few years there might be thousands of his progeny spreading out from this original hearthstone but as time went on the gopher began to be a little impatient for no female appeared he sat in the entrance of his hole in the morning and made penetrating squeaks that are inaudible to the human ear but can be heard deep in the earth by other gophers and still no female appeared finally in a sweat of impatience he went up across the track until he found another gopher hole he squeaked provocatively in the entrance he heard a rustling and smelled female and then out of the hole came an old battletom bull gopher who mauled and bit him so badly that he crept home and lay in his great chamber for three days recovering and he lost two toes from one front paw from that fight again he waited and squeaked beside his beautiful burrow in the beautiful place but no female ever came and after a while he had to move away he had to move two blocks up the hill to a dahlia garden where they put out traps every night chapter xxxii doc awakened very slowly and clumsily like a fat man getting out of a swimming pool his mind broke the surface and fell back several times there was red lipstick on his beard he opened one eye saw the brilliant colors of the quilt and closed his eye quickly but after a while he looked again his eye went past the quilt to the floor to the broken plate in the corner to the glasses standing on the table turned over on the floor to the spilled wine and the books like heavy fallen butterflies there were little bits of curled red paper all over the place and the sharp smell of firecrackers he could see through the kitchen door to the steak plates stacked high and the skillets deep in grease hundreds of cigarette butts were stamped out on the floor and under the firecracker smell was a fine combination of wine and whiskey and perfume his eye stopped for a moment on a little pile of hairpins in the middle of the floor he rolled over slowly and supporting himself on one elbow he looked out the broken window cannery row was quiet and sunny the boiler door was open the door of the palace flophouse was closed a man slept peacefully among the weeds in the vacant lot the bear flag was shut up tight doc got up and went into the kitchen and lighted the gas water heater on his way to the toilet then he came back and sat on the edge of his bed and worked his toes together while he surveyed the wreckage from up the hill he could hear the church bells ringing when the gas heater began rumbling he went back to the bathroom and took a shower and he put on blue jeans and a flannel shirt lee chong was closed but he saw who was at the door and opened it he went to the refrigerator and brought out a quart of beer without being asked doc paid him good time lee asked his brown eyes were a little inflamed in their pouches good time said doc and he went back to the laboratory with his cold beer he made a peanut butter sandwich to eat with his beer it was very quiet in the street no one went by at all doc heard music in his head violas and cellos he thought and they played cool soft soothing music with nothing much to distinguish it he ate his sandwich and sipped his beer and listened to the music when he had finished his beer doc went into the kitchen and cleared the dirty dishes out of the sink he ran hot water in it and poured soap chips under the running water so that the foam stood high and white then he moved about collecting all the glasses that werent broken he put them in the soapy hot water the steak plates were piled high on the stove with their brown juice and their white grease sticking them together doc cleared a place on the table for the clean glasses as he washed them then he unlocked the door of the back room and brought out one of his albums of gregorian music and he put a pater noster and agnus dei on the turntable and started it going the angelic disembodied voices filled the laboratory they were incredibly pure and sweet doc worked carefully washing the glasses so that they would not dash together and spoil the music the boys voices carried the melody up and down simply but with the richness that is in no other singing when the record had finished doc wiped his hands and turned it off he saw a book lying half under his bed and picked it up and he sat down on the bed for a moment he read to himself but then his lips began to move and in a moment he read aloud slowly pausing at the end of each line even now i mind the coming and talking of wise men from towers where they had thought away their youth and i listening found not the salt of the whispers of my girl murmur of confused colors as we lay near sleep little wise words and little witty words wanton as water honied with eagerness in the sink the high white foam cooled and ticked as the bubbles burst under the piers it was very high tide and the waves splashed on rocks they had not reached in a long time even now i mind that i loved cypress and roses dear the great blue mountains and the small gray hills the sounding of the sea upon a day i saw strange eyes and hands like butterflies for me at morning larks flew from the thyme and children came to bathe in little streams doc closed the book he could hear the waves beat under the piles and he could hear the scampering of white rats against the wire he went into the kitchen and felt the cooling water in the sink he ran hot water into it he spoke aloud to the sink and the white rats and to himself even now i know that i have savored the hot taste of life lifting green cups and gold at the great feast just for a small and a forgotten time i have had full in my eyes from off my girl the whitest pouring of eternal light he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and the white rats scampered and scrambled in their cages and behind the glass the rattlesnakes lay still and stared into space with their dusty frowning eyes
