jack higgins brought in dead for dorothy lim√≥n a real fan chapter the girl was young and might have been pretty once but not now her right eye was almost closed the cheek mottled by livid bruises and her lips had been split by the same violent blow that had knocked out three teeth she hobbled painfully into the lineup room supported by a woman pc a pathetic broken figure with a blanket over her shoulders to conceal the torn dress miller and brady were sitting on a bench at the far end of the room and brady saw her first he tapped his companion on the shoulder and miller stubbed out his cigarette and went to meet her he paused noting her condition with a sort of clinical detachment and the girl shrank back slightly from the strange young man with the white face and the eyes that seemed to stare right through her like dark glass detective sergeant nicholas miller was tired more tired than he had been in a long long time in the ten hours he had already spent on duty he had served as investigating officer at two burglaries a factory breakin and a closinghours brawl outside a pub near the market in which a youth had been slashed so badly across the face that it was more than likely that he would lose his right eye this had been followed almost immediately by a particularly vile case of child cruelty which had involved forcible entry in company with an nspcc inspector of a house near the docks where they had found three children huddled together like animals almost naked showing all the signs of advanced malnutrition squatting in their own dirt in a windowless boxroom that stank like a pigsty and now this compassion did not come easily at five oclock on a dark february morning but there was fear on this girls face and she had suffered enough he smiled and his whole personality seemed to change and the warmth reached out to envelop her so that sudden involuntary tears sprang to her eyes its all right he said everythings going to be fine another couple of minutes and itll be all over he turned to detective constable brady lets have them jack brady nodded and pressed a red button on a small control panel on the wall a hard white light illuminated a stage at the far end of the room and a moment later a door opened and half a dozen men filed in followed by two constables who marshalled them in line miller took the girl gently by the arm but before he could speak she started to tremble violently she managed to raise her right hand pointing at the prisoner who stood number one in line a great ox of a man his right cheek disfigured by a jagged scar she tried to speak something rattled in her throat and she collapsed against miller in a dead faint he held her close against his chest and looked up at the stage okay macek lets be having you a thickset fourteenstone irishman with fists like rocks detective constable jack brady had been a policeman for twentyfive years a quarter of a century of dealing with human wickedness in all its forms of walking daily in squalor and filth and a gradual erosion of the spirit had left him harsh and embittered a hard cruel man who believed in nothing and then a curious thing had happened certain villains now serving collectively some twentyfive years in one of her majestys prisons had thrown him down a flight of stairs breaking his leg in two places and fracturing his skull later leaving him for dead in a back street most men would have died but not jack brady the priest was called the last rites administered and then the surgeons took over and the nurses and physiotherapists and in three months he was back on duty with a barely perceptible limp in his left leg the same but not the same for one thing he was noticed to smile more readily he was still a good tough cop but now he seemed gifted with a new understanding it was as if through suffering himself he had learned compassion for others the girl painfully signed her name at the bottom of the typed statement sheet and he helped her to her feet and nodded to the woman pc youll be all right now love its all over the girl left sobbing quietly and miller came in holding a teletype flimsy dont waste too much sympathy on her jack ive just heard from cro shes got a record four previous convictions including larceny conspiracy to steal breaking and entering and illegal possession of drugs to cap that little lot shes been on the trot from peterhill remand home since november last year he dropped the flimsy on the table in disgust we can certainly pick them that still doesnt excuse what macek did to her brady said underneath that surface toughness shes just a frightened little girl sweetness and light miller said thats all i need he yawned reaching for a cigarette the packet was empty and he crumpled it with a sigh its been a long night brady nodded applying a match to the bowl of his pipe soon be over the door opened and macek entered escorted by a young probationer constable the pole slumped down on one of the hard wooden chairs at the table and miller turned to the probationer i could do with some tea and a packet of cigarettes see what the canteen can offer will you the young constable went on his way briskly for miller was a particular hero of his nick miller the man with the law degree who had made detective sergeant with only five years service all this and an interest so it was rumoured in his brothers business that enabled him to live in a style to which few police officers were accustomed as the door closed miller turned to macek now then you bastard lets get down to it ive got nothing to say macek said woodenly brady laughed harshly and there was a heavy silence macek looked furtively at miller who was examining his fingernails and said desperately all right so i knocked her around a little bloody little tart she had it coming why brady demanded i took her in macek said gave her a place to stay the best of everything then i find her sneaking out at two in the morning with my wallet my watch and everything else of value she could lay her hands on what would you have done he sounded genuinely aggrieved and miller picked up the girls statement she says here that youve been living together for five weeks macek nodded eagerly i gave her the best the best there was what about the men what men the men you brought round to the house every night the men who called because they needed a woman do me a favour macek said do i look like a pimp dont press me to answer that miller told him youve kept the girl under lock and key for the past two weeks when she couldnt take any more you beat her up and threw her out you try proving that i dont need to you said youve been living together as man and wife so what its a free country shes just fifteen maceks face turned grey she cant be oh yes she can weve got her record card macek turned desperately to brady she didnt tell me its a hard cruel world isnt it macek brady said the pole seemed to pull himself together i want a lawyer are you going to make a statement miller asked macek glared across the table you get stuffed he said viciously miller nodded all right jack take him down and book him make it abduction of a minor and rape with any luck and his record we might get him seven years macek sat there staring at him horror in his eyes and jack bradys iron fist descended jerking from the chair on your way soldier macek stumbled from the room and miller turned to the window and pulled the curtain rain drifted across the glass in a fine spray and beyond the first light of morning streaked the grey sky the door opened behind him and the young probationer entered the tea and cigarettes on a tray thatll be six bob sarge miller paid him and slipped the cigarettes into his pocket ive changed my mind about tea you have it im going home tell detective constable brady ill phone him this afternoon he walked along the quiet corridor descended three flights of marble stairs and went out through the swing doors of the portico at the front of the town hall his car was parked at the bottom of the steps with several others a green minicooper and he paused beside it to light a cigarette it was exactly fivethirty and the streets were strangely empty in the grey morning the sensible thing to do was to go home to bed and yet he felt strangely restless it was as if the city lay waiting for him and obeying a strange irrational impulse he turned up the collar of his dark blue swedish trenchcoat against the rain and started across the square for some people the early morning is the best part of the day and george hammond was one of these lockkeeper in charge of the great gates that prevented the canal from emptying itself into the river basin below he had reported for duty at fivefortyfive rain or snow for more than forty years walking through the quiet streets he savoured the calm morning with a conscious pleasure that never varied he paused at the top of the steps at the end of the bridge over the river and looked down into the basin they catered mainly for barge traffic this far upstream and they floated together beside the old victorian docks like basking sharks he went down the steps and started along the bank one section of the basin was crammed with coal barges offering a convenient shortcut to the other side and he started to work his way across he paused on the edge of the final barge judging the gap between the thwart and the wharf he started his jump gave a shocked gasp and only just managed to regain his balance a woman stared up at him through the greygreen water in a lifetime of working on the river george hammond had found bodies in the basin before but never one like this the eyes stared past him fixed on eternity and for some inexplicable reason he knew fear he turned worked his way back across the river scrambled up on the wharf and ran along the bank nick miller had just started to cross the bridge as hammond emerged from the top of the steps and leaned against the parapet sobbing for breath miller moved forward quickly anything wrong police hammond gasped i need the police youve found them miller said crisply whats up girl down there in the water hammond said other side of the coal barges beneath the wharf dead miller demanded hammond nodded gave me a hell of a turn i can tell you theres an allnight caf√© on the other side of the bridge phone for a patrol car and an ambulance from there ill go down and see what i can do hammond nodded turned away and miller went down the steps quickly and moved along the bank it had stopped raining and a cool breeze lifted off the water so that he shivered slightly as he jumped for the deck of the first coal barge and started to work his way across he couldnt find her at first and then a sudden eddy of the current swirled clearing the flotsam from the surface and she stared up at him and she was beautiful more beautiful than he had ever known a woman to be that was the strangest thing of all the body had drifted into the arched entrance of a vault under the wharf and hung suspended just beneath the surface the dress floated around her in a cloud as did the long golden hair and there was a look of faint surprise in the eyes the lips parted slightly as if in wonder at how easy it had been up on the bridge there was the jangle of a patrol cars bell and in the distance the siren of the approaching ambulance sounded faintly but he couldnt wait in some strange way this had become personal he took off his trenchcoat and jacket slipped off his shoes and lowered himself over the side the water was bitterly cold and yet he was hardly conscious of the fact as he swam into the archway at that moment the first rays of the morning sun broke through the clouds striking into the water so that she seemed to smile as he reached under the surface and took her a line of broad steps dropped into the basin twenty yards to the right and he swam towards them standing up when his knees bumped a shelving bank of gravel lifting her in his arms but now she looked different now she looked dead he stood there kneedeep staring down at her a lump in his throat aware of a feeling of personal loss why he said to himself softly why but there was no answer could never be and as the ambulance turned on the wharf above him he went up the steps slowly the girl cradled in his arms so that she might have been a child sleeping chapter detective superintendent bruce grant head of the citys central division cid stood at the window of his office drinking a cup of tea and stared out morosely at the driving rain he had a slight headache and his liver was acting up again he was getting old he decided old and fat through lack of exercise and the stack of paperwork waiting on his desk didnt help he lit a cigarette his first of the day sat down and started on the intray the first report was headed found dead unidentified grant read it through a slight frown on his face and pressed the button on his intercom is sergeant miller in i believe hes in the canteen sir a neutral voice replied get him for me will you miller arrived five minutes later immaculate in a dark blue worsted suit and freshly laundered white shirt only the skin that was stretched a little too tightly over the high cheekbones gave any hint of fatigue i thought you were supposed to be having a rest day grant said so did i but im due in court at ten when macek is formally charged im asking for a tenday remand that girls going to be in hospital for at least a week grant tapped the form on his desk i dont like the look of this one the girl i pulled out of the river thats right are you certain there was no identification miller took an envelope from his pocket and produced a small gold medallion on the end of a slender chain this was around her neck grant picked it up st christopher have a look on the back the engraving had been executed by an expert to joanna from daddy grant looked up frowning and this was all miller nodded she was wearing stockings the usual in underclothes and a reasonably expensive dress one rather sinister point just beneath the makers label there was obviously some sort of name tab its been torn out grant sighed heavily do you think she might have been put in miller shook his head not a chance there isnt a mark on her then it doesnt make sense grant said suicides an irrational act at the best of times are you asking me to accept that this girl was so coldblooded about it that she took time off to try to conceal her identity its the only thing that makes sense then what about the chain why didnt she get rid of that too when you habitually wear a thing like that you tend to forget about it miller said or maybe it meant a lot to her especially as she was a catholic thats another thing a catholic committing suicide its been known but not very often there are times when such things as statistical returns and probability tables have their uses in this work or didnt they teach you that at the staff college what have missing persons got to offer nothing yet miller said theres time of course she looks old enough to have been out all night someone could conceivably wait for a day or two before reporting her missing but you dont think so do you grant looked at the form again and shook his head no id say anything were going to find out about this one well have to dig up for ourselves can i have it grant nodded autopsy isnt mandatory in these cases but i think ill ask the county coroner to authorise one you never know what might turn up he reached for the phone and miller went back into the main cid room and sat down at his desk there was an hour to fill before his brief court appearance a good opportunity to get rid of some of the paperwork in his intray for some reason he found it impossible to concentrate he leaned back in his chair closing his eyes and her face rose out of the darkness to meet him still that faint look of surprise in the eyes the lips slightly parted it was as if she was about to speak to tell him something but that was impossible god but he was tired he settled back in his chair and catnapped awaking at exactly five minutes to ten feeling curiously refreshed but when he went downstairs and crossed the square to the county court building it wasnt the macek case he was thinking about the city mortuary was at the back of the medical school a large ugly building in victorian gothic with stained glass windows by the entrance inside it was dark and cool with green tiled walls and a strange aseptic smell that was vaguely unpleasant jack palmer the senior technician was sitting at his desk in the small glass office at the end of the corridor he turned and grinned as miller paused in the doorway dont tell me let me guess anything for me miller asked old murrays handled it himself hasnt had time to make out his report yet but hell be able to tell you what you need to know hes cleaning up now miller peered through the glass wall into the white tiled hall outside the theatre and saw the tall spare form of the university professor of pathology emerge from the theatre the front of his white gown stained with blood can i go in palmer nodded help yourself professor murray had removed his gown and was standing at the sluice washing his hands and arms when miller entered he smiled speaking with the faint scots accent of his youth that he had never been able to lose hardly the time of year to go swimming especially in that open sewer we call a river i trust youve been given suitable injections if i start feeling ill ill call no one but you miller said thats a promise murray reached for a towel and started to dry his arms they tell me you dont know who the girl is thats right of course she may be reported missing by someone within the next day or two but you dont think so may i ask why its not the usual kind of suicide the patterns all wrong for one thing the indications are that she did everything possible to conceal her identity before killing herself he hesitated theres no chance that she was dumped is there drugged beforehand or something like that murray shook his head impossible the eyes were still open its funny you should mention drugs though why ill show you it was cold in the theatre and the heavy antiseptic smell could not wholly smother the sicklysweet stench of death her body lay on the slab in the centre of the room covered with a rubber sheet murray raised the edge and lifted the left arm take a look the marks of the needle were plainly visible and miller frowned she was a junkie murray nodded my tests indicate that she had an injection consisting of two grains of heroin and one of cocaine approximately half an hour before she died and when would you say that was lets see now you pulled her out just before six didnt you id say shed been in the water about five hours which means she went in at one am or thereabouts one cant be exact it was a cold night anything else what can i tell you she was about nineteen well nurtured id say shed been raised in more than comfortable surroundings was she a virgin anything but two months pregnant he shook his head and added dryly a young woman very well acquainted with the sexual act what about her clothes a chap was here from your forensic department he took them away along with the usual things scrapings from under the fingernails hair samples and so on miller moved to the other side of the slab hesitated and then pulled back the rubber sheet revealing the face murray had closed the eyes and she looked calm and peaceful the skin smooth and colourless murray covered her again gently his face sombre i think she was someone who had suffered a great deal too much for one so young miller nodded unable to speak that strange aching dryness clutched at his throat again and he turned away quickly as he reached the door murray called softly nick miller turned keep me posted ill do that miller said and the rubber doors swung together behind him as he went out into the pale morning sunshine jack brady crossed the car park to meet him grant thought you might need some help on this one have they finished the autopsy miller nodded murray says she went into the river somewhere around one am she was pregnant by the way brady nodded calmly anything else she was a junkie heroin and cocaine that should give us a lead brady took a buff envelope from his overcoat pocket ive checked with forensic theyll have a report ready by noon these are from photography miller opened the envelope and examined the prints it contained those photography boys certainly knew their job she might almost have been alive an illusion helped by the fact that the photos had been taken before murray had closed her eyes brady took one and frowned a damned shame she looks like a nice kid dont they always miller slipped the other prints into his pocket i think ill go and see dr das he knows just about every junkie in town what about me miller took the gold st christopher from his breast pocket and handed it over youre a good catholic arent you jack i go to mass now and then maybe the girl did theres an inscription on the other side work your way round the parish priests someone may recognise her photo or even the medal more shoe leather brady groaned good for your soul this one ill drop you off at the cathedral if you like they got into the car and brady glanced at his copy of the girls photograph again before putting it away in his wallet he shook his head it doesnt make sense does it have you any idea what its like down there on the docks at that time in the morning just about the darkest and loneliest place in the world miller said brady nodded one things certain she must have been pretty desperate id like to know what got her into that state so would i jack miller said so would i and he released the handbrake and drove rapidly away drug addicts are possibly the most difficult of all patients to handle and yet dr lal das specialised in them he was a tall cadaverous indian with an international reputation in the field who persisted in running a general practice in one of the less salubrious parts of the city a twilight area of tall decaying victorian houses he had just finished his morning calls and was having coffee in front of the surgery fire when miller was shown in das smiled and waved him to a seat a pleasant surprise you will join me thanks very much das went to the sideboard and returned with another cup a social call im afraid not miller produced one of the photos have you ever seen her before das shook his head who is she we dont know i pulled her out of the river this morning suicide miller nodded professor murray did an autopsy shed had a fix about half an hour before she died what was the dosage two grains of heroin one of cocaine then she cant have been an addict for long most of my regulars are on five six or seven grains of heroin alone there were the usual tracks in her arm only a few which would seem to confirm my theory das sighed what a tragedy she looks such a pleasant child he handed the photo back im sorry i cant help you have no idea as to her identity at all i was hoping she might be a registered addict das shook his head emphatically definitely not we have a new scheme operating under which all registered addicts must attend my clinic at st gregorys hospital on saturday mornings is this as well as their visits to their own doctor das nodded believe me sergeant if she was registered i would know her miller swallowed the rest of his coffee id better get moving got a lot of ground to cover why not have a chat with chuck lazer das said if anyone could help he could thats an idea miller said how is he these days still dry for ten months now a remarkable achievement especially when one considers that his intake was of the order of seven grains of heroin and six of cocaine daily i hear hes running a small casino club now yes the berkley in cork square very exclusive havent you been i got an invitation to the opening but i couldnt make it does he still play a good jazz piano oscar peterson at his best couldnt improve on him i was there last saturday we were talking about you ill drop in and see him miller said wheres he living now he has an apartment over the club very pleasant hell probably be in bed now mind you ill take that chance they went out into the hall das opened the front door and shook hands formally if i can help in any way ill let you know miller said and he ran down the steps to the minicooper and drove away cork square was a green lung in the heart of the city a few sycamore trees scattered here and there the whole surrounded by quiet greystone georgian houses most of them occupied by consultant physicians and barristers the entrance to the berkley club was a creampainted door its brass handle and plate shining in the sunlight even the neon sign was in perfect taste with the surroundings and had obviously been specially designed miller pulled in to the kerb got out and looked up at the front of the building hey nick you old soandso what gives the cry echoed across the square and as he turned chuck lazer moved out of the trees a couple of dalmatians straining ahead of him on twin leads miller went to meet him leaving the path and crossing the damp grass hello there chuck whats all this he bent down to pat the eager dogs the american grinned part of my new image the customers love it gives the place tone but never mind that how are you its been too long he was bubbling over with genuine pleasure the blue eyes sparkling when miller had first met him almost a year previously during a murder investigation lazer had been hopelessly hooked on heroin with the gaunt fleshless face of an emaciated saint now there was meat on his bones and the neatly trimmed dark fringe beard combined with the expensive sports coat to give him a positively elegant appearance he slipped the dogs leads and the dalmatians moved into the flower beds as he and miller sat down on a bench ive just seen das he told me hed been to the club gave me a glowing report miller offered him a cigarette on you too lazer grinned no need to worry about me nick id cut my throat before id take another shot he lit his cigarette and exhaled smoke in a blue cloud what did you want with das business miller produced one of the photos and passed it across know her lazer shook his head cant say i do he frowned suddenly heh isnt that a morgue photograph miller nodded i pulled her out of the river this morning trouble is we cant identify her suicide thats right the autopsy showed she was an addict i was hoping she might be registered that das might know her and she isnt that makes it difficult whats the drug market like now chuck miller said where would she get the stuff difficult to say ive been out of circulation for quite a while remember as far as i know there isnt any really organised peddling if thats what you mean remember where you first met me miller grinned outside the allnight chemists in city square thats where it changes hands most registered addicts see their doctor at his evening surgery and usually get a prescription dated for the following day legally they can have it filled from midnight onwards which is why you always find a bunch waiting in the allnight chemists in any big city round about that time the nonregistered users hang around outside hoping to buy a few pills theyre usually in luck quite a few doctors tend to overprescribe so all i have to do is go down to city square at midnight and pass her photo around if she was an addict someone will recognise her thats for sure the most exclusive club in the world thanks very much miller said i didnt get any sleep last night either you shouldnt have joined lazer chuckled and then his smile faded miller glanced across to the club as a dark blue rolls eased in to the kerb the first man to emerge was built like a pro wrestler shoulders bulging massively under a dark blue overcoat the driver came round to join him a small wiry man with jet black hair and held open the rear door the man who got out was large and rather fleshy with hair so pale that it was almost white he wore a singlebreasted suit of dark grey flannel that was straight out of savile row a white gardenia in the buttonhole and carried himself with the habitual arrogance of a man who believes that he exists by a kind of divine right the small man said something to him and they all turned and glanced at lazer and miller friends of yours miller said as they moved across the grass lazer shook his head i wouldnt say that exactly the fancy boy is max vernon came up from london about four months ago and bought out harry faulkner took over his betting shops the flamingo club everything what about his minders the big boys called carver simon carver the little guys the one to watch stratton i dont know his first name have they been leaning on you lazer bared his teeth in a mirthless grin nothing quite so obvious lets say ive got a very nice little business and mr vernon would like a piece of the action for a consideration of course all nice and legal unfortunately im not interested in selling vernon paused a couple of yards away carver and stratton on either side of him hello there old man he said cheerfully i was hoping to find you in time we had another little chat not in my book it isnt lazer replied carver took a step forward but before anything could develop miller said quickly thats an old etonian tie youre wearing did you know that vernon turned his smile still hooked firmly into place how very gratifying youre the first person to recognise it since ive been here of course we are a little far north dangerous country miller said weve been known to roll boulders down the hillside on unwary travellers stone strangers how fascinating vernon turned to lazer introduce me to your friend chuck a pleasure lazer said nick miller detective sergeant central cid vernon hesitated momentarily and then extended his hand always a pleasure to meet the law miller stayed where he was on the bench hands tucked casually into his pockets i cant say its mutual you watch your mouth copper carver said harshly he started to move lazer whistled twice and the dalmatians arrived on the run they stood beside him pointing at carver something rumbling deep down in their throats carver hesitated obviously uncertain and miller laughed know why they call them carriage dogs carver they were specially bred during the eighteenth century as travelling companions to take care of highwaymen something glowed deep in carvers eyes and vernon chuckled thats damned good damned good he grinned at carver see you learn something new every day of the week he turned away without another word and walked back to the rolls carver and stratton hurrying after him lazer leaned down to fondle the ears of the two dogs and miller said softly i think you could have trouble there chuck if it comes ill handle it miller shook his head you mean ill handle it and thats an order he got to his feet and grinned ive got to get moving lazer stood up and produced a small goldedged card from his breast pocket i know its illegal to do it this way but theres a membership card why not drop in its been a long time since i heard you play piano i might just do that miller said and he turned and walked away across the grass as the rollsroyce moved out into the main traffic stream max vernon leaned forward and slid back the glass panel of the partition this chap miller he said to carver know anything about him not a thing then start digging i want to know everything everything there is to know any special reason carver said well let me put it this way the only other copper ive ever met who made a practice of wearing sixtyguinea suits is doing a five stretch in the ville for corruption carvers eyes widened and vernon closed the glass panel leaned back in his seat and lit a cigarette a slight smile on his face chapter henry wade was fat and balding and his several chins and hornrimmed spectacles gave him the deceptively benign air of a prosperous publican or back street bookie he was neither he was head of the departments forensic section with the rank of detective inspector and the ready smile concealed a brain that in action had the cutting edge of a razor when miller went into the small office at one end of the police lab he found wade at his desk filling in a report covering the paper with the neat italic script that was his special pride he turned and smiled hello nick i was wondering when youd turn up anything for me not much im afraid come on ill show you miller followed him into the lab nodding to the bench technicians as he passed the girls clothing was laid out neatly on a table by the window wade went through the items one by one the stockings are a wellknown brand sold everywhere and the underwear she bought at marks spencers along with just about every other girl in the country these days what about the dress reasonably expensive but once again a wellknown brand name available at dozens of shops and stores one interesting point just below the makers label a name tabs been torn out he picked up the dress pointing with a pair of tweezers and miller nodded i noticed i had a hunch about that we matched up a piece of the tab that was still attached to the dress and my hunch paid off its a cash label you must have seen them little white tabs with the individuals name woven in red people buy them for schoolchildren or students going away to college miller nodded thousands of people including my sisterinlaw her two kids have them sewn into just about every damned thing they own is that all no one other thing when we checked the nail scrapings we discovered a minute quantity of oil paint there were one or two spots on the dress too an artist miller said thats something dont be too certain lots of people do a little painting these days henry wade grinned and slapped him on the shoulder you shouldnt have joined nick lad you shouldnt have joined grant was still working away at his desk when miller peered round the door got a minute just about grant sat back and lit a cigarette hows it going so far not so good but it was something else i wanted to mention what do you know about a man called vernon max vernon the bloke from london who took over faulkners casino and betting shops grant shrugged not much the chief introduced him to me at the conservative ball obviously a gentleman public school and all that sort of thing right down to his old etonian tie miller suppressed a strong desire to burst into laughter hes leaning on chuck lazer hes what grant said incredulously its true enough miller said i was chatting to lazer in the square outside his place when vernon turned up with a couple of heavies named carver and stratton no comic vaudeville act those two believe me vernon wants a piece of the berkley club hell pay for it of course all nice and legal but chuck lazer better play ball or else grant was a different man as he flicked one of the switches on his intercom records get on to cro in london at once i want everything theyve got on max vernon and two men now working for him called carver and stratton top priority he turned back to miller what happened nothing much vernon didnt say anything in the slightest way incriminating on the face of it hes making a perfectly legitimate business offer did he know who you were not until lazer introduced us grant got up and walked to the window i dont like the sound of this at all it certainly raises interesting possibilities miller said those houses faulkner was running in gascoigne square his callgirl racket has vernon taken those over too an intriguing thought grant sighed heavily it never rains but it pours try and look in this afternoon at about three i should have heard from cro by then when miller went back into the main cid room a young pc was hovering beside his desk i took a message for you while you were in with the super sergeant who from jack brady he said he was ringing from st gemmas roman catholic church in walthamgate hed like you to join him there as soon as you can anything else yes he said to tell you that he thinks hes traced the girl the lights in the little church were very dim and down by the altar the candles flickered and the figure of the virgin in the chapel to one side seemed to float there in the darkness for miller this was unfamiliar territory and he paused waiting as jack brady dipped a knee crossing himself reverently the man they had come to see knelt in prayer at the altar and when he got to his feet and came towards them miller saw that he was very old the hair silvery in the subdued light brady made the introductions father ryan this is detective sergeant nick miller the old man smiled and took millers hand in a grip that was surprisingly firm jack and i are old friends sergeant for fifteen years or more he ran the boxing team for me at the dockside mission boys club shall we sit in the porch a pity to miss the sunshine its been a hard winter brady opened the door and father ryan preceded them he sat on the polished wooden bench that overlooked the quiet graveyard with the row of cypress trees lining the road beyond the high wall i understand you might be able to help us with our enquiry father miller said the old man nodded could i see the photo again miller passed it across and for a moment there was silence as father ryan examined it he sighed heavily poor girl poor wee girl you know her she called herself joanna martin called herself thats right i dont think it was her real name might i ask why father ryan smiled faintly like you i deal with people sergeant human beings in the raw lets say one develops an instinct miller nodded i know what you mean she first came to my church about three months ago i noticed something different about her at once this is a twilight area most of the houses in multiple occupation the tenants constantly coming and going joanna was obviously the product of a safer more ordered world she was out of her element can you tell us where she lived she had a room with a mrs kilroy a parishioner of mine its not far from here ive given detective constable brady the address somehow the fact that he had used bradys official title seemed to underline a new formality in the interchange it was as if he were preparing himself for the question that he knew must come i know this must be a difficult situation for you father miller said gently but this girl had problems and they must have been pretty desperate to make her take the way out that she did can you throw any light on them brady cleared his throat awkwardly and shuffled his feet the old man shook his head for me the secrecy of the confessional must be absolute surely you must be aware of that sergeant miller nodded of course father i wont press you any further youve already helped us a great deal father ryan stood up and held out his hand if i can help in any other way dont hesitate to get in touch brady was already moving away miller started to follow and hesitated one more thing father i understand there could be some difficulty regarding burial because of the manner of death not in this case father ryan said firmly there are several mitigating circumstances i intend raising the matter with the bishop personally i may say with some certainty that i foresee little difficulty miller smiled im glad forgive me for saying so but you appear to have some personal interest here may i ask why i pulled her out of the river myself miller told him something im not likely to forget in a hurry i know one thing id like to get my hands on whoever was responsible father ryan sighed its a strange thing but in spite of the fact that most people believe priests to be somehow cut off from the real world i come face to face with more human wickedness in a week than the average man does in a lifetime he smiled gently and i still believe that at heart most human beings are good i wish i could agree father miller said sombrely i wish i could agree he turned and walked away quickly to where jack brady waited at the gate mrs kilroy was a large unlovely widow with flaming red hair that had come straight out of a bottle and a thin mouth enlarged by orange lipstick into an obscene gash i keep a respectable place here ive never had any trouble before she said as she led the way upstairs no trouble mrs kilroy brady said persuasively we just want to see the room thats all and ask a few questions the landing was long and dark its polished lino covered by a thin strip of worn carpeting the door at the far end was locked she produced a bunch of keys opened it and led the way in the room was surprisingly large and furnished in victorian mahogany the curtains at the only window were partially closed the traffic sounds outside muted and unreal as if from another world and a thin bar of sunlight fell across the floor adding a new richness to the faded colours of the old indian carpet it was the neatness that was so surprising and the cleanliness the bed had been stripped the blankets folded into squares and stacked at one end of the mattress and the top of the dressing table had quite obviously been dusted miller opened one or two of the empty drawers closed them again and turned and this is exactly how you found the room this morning mrs kilroy nodded she came and knocked on my door last night at about ten oclock had she been out i wouldnt know she told me shed be moving today did she say why mrs kilroy shook her head i didnt ask i was more interested in getting a weeks rent in lieu of notice which was the agreement and she paid without a murmur mind you there was never any trouble over her rent ill say that not like some brady had busied himself during the conversation in moving around the room checking all drawers and cupboards now he turned and shook his head clean as a whistle which means that when she left she must have taken everything with her miller turned to mrs kilroy did you see her go last time i saw her was about half ten she knocked on the door and told me shed some rubbish to burn asked if she could put it in the central heating furnace in the cellar have you been down there since no need it has an automatic stoking system only needs checking every two days i see miller walked across to the window and pulled back the curtains lets go back to when you last saw her did she seem worried or agitated mrs kilroy shook her head quickly she was just the same as she always was and yet she killed herself less than three hours later god have mercy on her there was genuine horror in mrs kilroys voice and she crossed herself quickly what else can you tell me about her i understand shed been a tenant of yours for about three months thats right she arrived on the doorstep one afternoon with a couple of suitcases as it happened i had a vacancy and she offered a months rent in advance in lieu of references what did you think of her mrs kilroy shrugged she didnt really fit in too much of the lady for a district like this i never asked questions i always mind my own business but if anyone had a story to tell it was her father ryan doesnt seem to think joanna martin was her real name i shouldnt be surprised what did she do for a living she paid her rent on time and never caused any trouble whatever she did was her own business one thing she had an easel set up in here used to paint in oils i once asked her if she was a student but she said it was only a hobby did she go out much at night for instance she could have been out all night and every night as far as i was concerned all my lodgers have their own keys she shrugged more often than not im out myself did anyone ever call for her not that i noticed she kept herself to herself the only outstanding thing i do remember is that sometimes she looked really ill i had to help her up the stairs one day i wanted to call the doctor but she said it was just her monthly i saw her later that afternoon and she looked fine which was how one would expect her to look after a shot of heroin and miller sighed anything else i dont think so mrs kilroy hesitated if she had a friend at all it was the girl in number four monica grey why do you say that ive seen them going out together mainly in the afternoons is she in now should be as far as i know she works nights in one of these gaming clubs miller turned to brady ill have a word with her you get mrs kilroy to show you where the furnace is see what you can find the door closed behind them and miller stood there in the quiet listening but there was nothing here this room had no personality it was as if she had never been here at all and after all what did he really know about her at the moment she existed only as a series of apparently contradictory facts a wellbred girl she had come down to living in a place like this a sincere catholic she had committed suicide educated and intelligent but also a drug addict none of it made any sense at all and he went along the corridor and knocked at number four there was an immediate reply and he opened the door and entered she was standing in front of the dressing table her back to the door and dressed as far as he could judge in that first moment in stockings and a pair of dark briefs in the mirror he was aware of her breasts high and firm and then her eyes widened i thought it was mrs kilroy miller stepped back into the corridor smartly closing the door a moment later it opened again and she stood there laughing at him an old nylon housecoat belted around her waist shall we try again her voice was hoarse but not unattractive with a slight liverpool accent and she had a turnedup nose that gave her a rather gamin charm miss grey miller produced his warrant card detective sergeant miller central cid i wonder if i might have a word with you her smile slipped fractionally and a shadow seemed to cross her eyes as she stepped back and motioned him in what have i done now overparked or something there were times when the direct approach produced the best results and miller tried it now im making enquiries into the death of joanna martin i understand you might be able to help me it had the effect of a physical blow she seemed to stagger slightly then turned groped for the end of the bed and sank down i believe you were pretty good friends miller continued she stared up at him blindly then suddenly got to her feet pushed him out of the way and ran for the bathroom he stood there a slight frown on his face and there was a knock on the outside door he opened it to find jack brady waiting any luck miller asked brady held up an old canvas bag i found all sorts in the ashpan what about this for instance he produced a triangular piece of metal blackened and twisted by the fire and miller frowned this is a corner piece off a suitcase thats right brady shook the bag in his right hand if the bits and pieces in here are anything to go by id say she must have put every damned thing she owned into that furnace including her suitcase she certainly wasnt leaving anything to chance miller sighed all right jack take that little lot down to the car and put in a call to hq see if theyve anything for us i shant be long he lit a cigarette moved to the window and looked out into the back garden behind him the bathroom door opened and monica grey emerged she looked a lot brighter as she came forward and sat on the edge of the bed sorry about that it was rather a shock joanna was a nice kid she hesitated and then continued how how did it happen she jumped in the river miller gave her a cigarette and lit it for her mrs kilroy tells me you were good friends monica grey took the smoke deep into her lungs and exhaled with a sigh of pleasure i wouldnt say that exactly i went to the cinema with her sometimes in the afternoons or she came in for a coffee mainly because she happened to live next door you never went out with her at any other time i couldnt i work nights im a croupier at a gaming club in gascoigne square the flamingo max vernons place she nodded have you been there a long time ago tell me about joanna where did she come from monica grey shook her head she never discussed her past she always seemed to live entirely in the present what did she do for a living nothing as far as i could tell she spent a lot of time painting but only as a hobby i know one thing she was never short of money what about boy friends as far as i know she didnt have any didnt that seem strange to you she was an attractive girl thats true but she had her problems she appeared to hesitate and then went on if youve seen her body you must know what im getting at she was a junkie how did you know that i went into her room to borrow a pair of stockings one day and found her giving herself a shot she asked me to keep quiet about it which you did monica grey shrugged none of my affair how she got her kicks it was one hell of a shame but there was nothing i could do about it she was a catholic miller said did you know that she nodded she went to church nearly every day and yet she killed herself after burning everything she owned in the central heating furnace downstairs and ripping the name tab out of the dress she was wearing when she died its only by chance that weve managed to trace her this far and when we do nobody seems to know anything about her wouldnt you say that was peculiar she was a strange kid you could never tell what was going on beneath the surface father ryan doesnt seem to think that joanna martin was her real name if thats true she certainly never gave me any clue miller nodded turned and paced across the room he paused suddenly the table against the wall was littered with sketches mainly fashion drawings some in pen and ink others colourwashed all showed indications of real talent yours he said monica grey stood up and walked across thats right like them very much did you go to the college of art for two years thats what brought me here in the first place what made you give it up she grinned forty quid a week at the flamingo plus a dress allowance attractive alternative miller dropped the sketch he was holding well i dont think i need bother you any more he walked to the door paused and turned just one thing you do understand that if i cant trace her family i may have to ask you to make the formal identification she stood there staring at him her face very white and he closed the door and went downstairs there was a pay phone fixed to the wall by the door and brady leaned beside it filling his pipe he glanced up quickly any joy not really but ive a feeling well be seeing her again i got through to hq there was a message for you from chuck lazer apparently hes been passing round the copy of the photo you gave him hes come up with a registered addict who sold her a couple of pills outside the allnight chemists in city square just after midnight if you guarantee no charge hes agreed to make a statement thats all right by me miller said you handle it will you ill drop you off at cork square and you can go and see chuck right away ive a phone call to make first anything special just a hunch the girl liked to paint weve established that another thing that name tab she ripped out of her dress was a type commonly bought by students im wondering if there might be a connection he found the number he wanted and dialled quickly the receiver was picked up almost at once at the other end and a womans voice said college of art put me through to the registrars office please there was a momentary delay and then a pleasant scottish voice cut in henderson here central cid detective sergeant miller im making enquiries concerning a girl named joanna martin and ive good reason to believe she might have been a student at your college during the last couple of years would it take you long to check no more than thirty seconds sergeant henderson said crisply weve a very comprehensive filing system a moment later he was back sorry no student of that name i could go back further if you like no point miller said she wasnt old enough he replaced the receiver and turned to brady another possibility we can cross off what now brady demanded i still think theres a lot in this idea of father ryans that martin wasnt her real name if thats true its just possible shes been listed as a missing person by someone or other you go and see chuck lazer and ill drop round to the salvation army and see if a chat with martha broadribb produces anything brady grinned dont end up beating a drum for her on sundays but miller had to force a smile in reply and as he went down the steps to the car his face was grim and serious at the best of times a good copper was guided as much by instinct as solid fact and there was something very wrong here something much more serious than appeared on the surface of things and all his training all his experience told him as much chapter the small office of the stone street citadel was badly overcrowded half a dozen young men and women working busily surrounded by green filing cabinets doublebanked to save space ill see if the majors in her office said millers escort a thin earnest young man in blazer and flannels and he disappeared in search of martha broadribb miller leaned against a filing cabinet and waited impressed as always at the industry and efficiency so obviously the order of the day a sheet of writing paper had fallen to the floor and he picked it up and read the printed heading quickly missing relatives sought in any part of the world investigations and enquiries carried out in strictest confidence reconciliation bureau advice willingly given the biggest drawback to tracing a missing person from the official point of view was that there was nothing illegal about disappearing unless there was a suspicion of foul play the police could do nothing which produced the ironical situation that the greatest experts in the field were the salvation army who handled something like ten thousand british and foreign enquiries a year from their headquarters in bishopsgate london and who were constantly in touch with centres throughout the country such as the stone street citadel the young man emerged from the inner office his arm around the shoulders of a middleaged woman in a shabby coat who had obviously been weeping he nodded briefly without speaking and miller brushed past them and went in major martha broadribb was exactly five feet tall her trim uniformed figure bristling with a vitality that belied her sixty years her blue eyes were enormous behind steelrimmed spectacles and she had the smooth unused face of an innocent child and yet this was a woman who had laboured for most of her life in a china mission who had spent three terrible years in solitary confinement in a communist prison camp she came forward quickly a smile of genuine affection on her face nicholas this is nice will you have a cup of tea i wouldnt say no miller said who was that who just left poor soul her husband died a year ago she took a clean cup and saucer from a cupboard and moved to the teatray that stood on her desk she married one of her lodgers last month he persuaded her to sell the house and give him the money she received to buy a business dont tell me let me guess miller said hes cleared off thats about the size of it shes been to the police who told her that as he hadnt committed a criminal offence they were powerless to act she stirred his tea briskly four lumps and much good may it do you do you think youll find him certain to she said and hell face up to his responsibilities and do right by the poor woman after ive had a chance of talking to him im certain of that another one who thought most people were good at heart miller smiled wryly remembering their first meeting on his way home one night he had answered an emergency call simply because he happened to be in the vicinity and had arrived at a slum house near the river in time to find a graceless mindless lout doing his level best to beat his wife to death after knocking martha broadribb senseless for trying to stop him breaking her right arm in the process and the very next day she had visited him in the bridewell plastercast and all she lit a cigarette her one vice and leaned back in her chair you look tired nicholas i feel tired he said a perpetual state these days but dont lets go into that he passed one of the photos across ever seen her martha examined it with a slight frown this is a mortuary photo isnt it thats right i pulled her out of the river this morning suicide there was an expression of real grief on her face poor child poor poor child no ordinary suicide miller said this girl did everything she could to destroy her identity before she died he sketched in the main facts and she nodded sombrely so father ryan thinks that joanna martin wasnt her real name he got that impression which the other two people ive spoken to who knew her confirm coming to see you was just a hunch really i was hoping that somebody might have put out a search for her that you might recognise her photo martha nodded and held up the medal she still hung on to joanna interesting that they nearly always do hang on to their christian name its as if theyre afraid of losing themselves entirely she gave him back the medal and made a few notes on her pad lets see what weve got about nineteen fair hair blue eyes well spoken educated obviously from a superior background and an artist well look under the name of martin first just in case and well check the christian name i didnt know you could do that as i said so many of them hang on to their christian names that its worth crossindexing and joanna isnt very common these days well see what weve got here and ill also put through a call to london should take about fifteen minutes before he could reply the phone on her desk rang she took the call and then held out the receiver for you detective constable brady martha went into the outer office and miller sat on the edge of the desk what have you got plenty brady said ive just had a session with a character named jack fenner hes been a registered addict for just over a year now he makes a living as a dance band drummer i think ive seen him around miller said small fairhaired thats him he says he had a prescription for heroin and cocaine filled at the allnight chemists in city square at midnight on the dot joanna martin stopped him on his way out and offered him a couple of quid for enough pills for a shot his story is that he felt sorry for her said she had the shakes no chance of a mistake definitely not brady laughed harshly in fact this is where it gets interesting fenner says hes seen her before where at max vernons place the flamingo about six weeks ago the regular drummer was ill that night and fenner stood in for him apparently it was vernons birthday and he threw a big private binge fenner remembers the girl because vernon kept her with him for most of the evening which fenner says is highly unusual apparently our max prefers variety now that is interesting miller said fenners certain hes never seen her at any other time dead certain is it important that he should have could be look at it this way the girl wasnt a registered addict we know that so where did she get the stuff from if shed been working the prescription racket outside the allnight chemists regularly fenner would have seen her many times an addict needs at least one fix a day remember usually more which means that someone must be peddling the stuff could be behind miller the door opened as martha broadribb returned and he added hastily ive got to go now jack ill see you back at the office in half an hour he turned eyebrows raised enquiringly and martha shook her head im sorry nicholas not a thing there was one joanna on file thats all a west indian nurse miller sighed and stood up never mind martha it was just a hunch thanks for the tea anyway ill leave you a copy of the photo just in case he dropped it on the desk and as he turned she placed a hand on his arm concern on her face youre worried about this one arent you theres no need to be something will turn up it always does he grinned and kissed her briefly on the forehead dont work too hard martha ill be seeing you the door closed behind him she stood there staring blankly at it for a moment then took a deep breath squaring her shoulders sat down at her typewriter and started to work brady was sitting on the other side of grants desk when miller looked round the door of the superintendents office grant waved him in at once jacks been filling me in on your progress so far you dont seem to be doing too badly at least youve got a name for her now which doesnt seem to mean a great deal miller said im afraid martha broadribb couldnt help at all never mind grant said something will turn up miller smiled the second time ive been told that today anything through from cro on max vernon and company yet grant nodded his face grim and it doesnt make pleasant reading brady started to get up and the superintendent waved him down you might as well hear this jack ill be circularising the information anyway he put on his reading glasses and picked up the white flimsy that had been delivered from records ten minutes earlier lets start with his two bully boys and a nice pair they are benjamin carver last known profession salesman four previous convictions including five years for robbery with violence conspiracy to steal larceny grievous bodily harm hes been pulled in for questioning on twentythree other occasions and stratton even worse mad as a march hare and twisted with it william billy stratton three previous convictions including a five stretch for robbery with violence remember the knavesmire airport bullion robbery he was in on that grant nodded the psychiatrists did what they could for him during his last stretch but it wasnt much psychopathic tendencies and too damned handy with a chiv the next time he stands in the dock itll be for murder mark my words and vernon nothing you mean hes clean miller said in astonishment as a whistle grant dropped the flimsy on the table six years ago he was invited to help scotland yard with their enquiries concerning the knavesmire airport bullion robbery the interview lasted exactly ten minutes thanks to the best lawyer in london and thats all all thats official grant picked up another flimsy now lets look at what they have to say about him unofficially believe me itll make your hair stand on end maxwell alexander constable vernon younger son of sir henry vernon managing director of the red funnel shipping line from eton he went to sandhurst and was commissioned in the guards only the best eh grant nodded the rot set in when he was seconded for duty with a malayan infantry regiment during the emergency vernon proved so successful at rooting out the communists in his area that he was awarded the dso then they discovered hed been indulging in an orgy of sadism and torture no one could afford a public scandal at the time so he was simply persuaded to resign his commission his family disowned him he took to crime thats what it looks like organised prostitution he started with a callgirl racket illegal clubs protection dope peddling anything that pays thats our maxwell and hes a bright boy dont make any mistake about that the knavesmire airport heist was only one of half a dozen big jobs hes probably been behind during the past five or six years why move up here though brady put in it doesnt make sense im not so sure grant said since the middle of last year theres been open warfare in london between the four most powerful gangs mainly over the protection racket these things always run to a pattern the villains carve each other up in this case theyre even using shooters and the police stand by to pick up the pieces when its all over nobody wins that kind of fight and vernon was clever enough to realise that as soon as he heard the first rumblings he sold out to one of his rivals and dropped out of sight to reappear here brady said grant got to his feet and paced to the window ive always thought this might happen one day that the london mobs would start looking for fresh fields ill have to have a word with the old man about it he shook his head id love to know what vernons been up to since hes been here maybe chuck lazer could give me a few pointers miller said grant swung round his face brightening thats a thought see what you can get out of him ill do my best miller said but dont expect too much to a certain extent lazers on the other side of the fence remember ill keep you posted he returned to the main cid room and brady followed him what now about the girl miller shrugged im still considering there are one or two interesting possibilities he pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket and the gold medal and chain fell to the floor brady picked it up and examined the inscription again at least we know one thing for certain her christian name miller paused in the act of lighting his cigarette my god i must be losing my touch what do you mean brady asked im remembering something martha broadribb told me how most people who go missing hang on to their christian name theres a pretty obvious psychological explanation for that its such a common behaviour pattern that they crossindex missing persons under their christian names as well and where does that get us brady demanded looking puzzled she still couldnt help could she no but im wondering whether we might have just a little bit more luck at the college of art miller said simply this must be her henderson said suddenly turning from the file and handing miller a white index card he was a small greying scot with a pleasant lined face obviously fascinated by the present situation which had turned what would otherwise have been a day of dull routine into a memorable one miller read the details on the card aloud and brady made notes joanna maria craig address rosedene grange avenue st martins wood brady pursed his lips in a soundless whistle pretty exclusive we were certainly on the ball there apparently she dropped out of the course just over three months ago miller said it says here see personal file thats what im looking for henderson had opened another filing cabinet and was flicking rapidly through the green folders it contained he nodded suddenly took one out and opened it as he turned after a while he looked up and nodded i remember this case now mainly because of her father her father thats right a hell of a nice chap i felt sorry for him at the time hes managing director of that new firm out on the york road gulf electronics why do you say you felt sorry for him as i recall she was giving him a hard time when she first started here everything was fine and then about four months ago she seemed to go to pieces cutting lectures not turning in her work on time that sort of thing we called him in to discuss the position he frowned suddenly now i remember he brought his other daughter with him charming girl a schoolteacher i believe it emerged during the interview that he was a widower what happened he promised to try and straighten the girl out but im afraid he had no luck in that direction there was a nasty incident about a week later with one of the women lecturers harsh words and then the girl slapped her in the face naturally she had to go after that miller sat there in silence for a moment thinking about it and then got to his feet he held out his hand youve helped us a great deal mr henderson anything else i can do dont hesitate to get in touch henderson said outside the pale afternoon sun picked out the vivid colours of the mosaic in the concrete face of the new shopping precinct on the other side of the road and miller paused at the top of the steps to light a cigarette jack brady looked up at him eyebrows raised and miller sighed and now comes the unpleasant bit st martins wood was on the edge of the city an exclusive residential area not far from millers own home the houses ran very much to a pattern turn of the century mansions in grey stone each one standing in an acre or two of garden the house they were seeking stood at one end of a quiet culdesac behind a high stone wall miller turned the cooper in through the gates and drove along a wide gravel drive breaking to a halt at the bottom of a flight of shallow steps which led to the front door the bell push was obviously electronic the sound echoing melodiously inside and after a while the door was opened by a pleasantfaced young maid in a nylon working overall yes sir she said to miller is mr craig at home by any chance colonel craig she said in a tone of mild reproof is in london at the moment but were expecting him home tonight who is it jenny a voice called and then a young woman appeared from a door to the right the gentlemen wanted to see the colonel but ive told them he isnt at home the maid said all right jenny ill handle it she came forward an open book in one hand im harriet craig is there anything i can do she was perhaps twentytwo or three and nothing like her sister the black shoulderlength hair framed a face that was too angular for beauty the mouth so wide that it was almost ugly and then for no accountable reason she smiled and the transformation was so complete that she might have been a different person miller produced his warrant card i wonder if we could have a word with you miss craig she looked at the card and frowned is anything wrong if we could go inside miss brady said gently the drawing room into which she led them was beautifully furnished in excellent taste and purple and white hyacinths made a brave splash of colour in a pewter bowl that stood on the grand piano she turned a hand on the mantelshelf wont you sit down miller shook his head i think it might be a good idea if you did she stiffened slightly youve got bad news for me is that it and then as if by intuition is it my sister is it joanna miller produced one of the photos from his inside pocket is this her she took the photo from him almost mechanically and her eyes widened in horror when she spoke it was in a whisper shes dead isnt she im afraid so miller said gently she was taken out of the river at dawn today to the best of our knowledge she committed suicide suicide oh my god and then she seemed to crack to break into a thousand fragments and as millers arms opened to her she lurched into them burying her face against his chest like some small child seeking comfort and strength in a world she could no longer understand jack palmer lifted the sheet and for a brief moment harriet craig looked down on the dead face of her sister she swayed slightly and millers grip tightened on her elbow all right to use your office for ten minutes jack help yourself it was warm in the tiny glass office after the cold outside miller sat her in the only chair and perched on the edge of the desk jack brady leaned against the door notebook and pencil ready im afraid im going to have to ask you some questions miller said she nodded gripping her handbag so tightly that her knuckles gleamed white thats all right were you aware that for the past three months your sister was living at a house in grosvenor road under the name of joanna martin she shook her head no in fact it doesnt make sense we understood she was in london weve had three letters from her and they were all postmarked chelsea i understand there was some trouble at the college of art miller said that she had to leave could you tell me about that its rather difficult to explain joanna was always a sweet kid very talented but a little na√Øve thats why my father thought it would be better to let her attend the local college and live at home instead of going away she took a deep shuddering breath and when she continued her voice was much stronger and then about four months or so ago she seemed to change overnight it was as if shed become a different person in what way exactly her whole temperament altered she became violently angry on the slightest excuse it became almost impossible to handle her she came home drunk a couple of times and then she started staying out all night naturally my father didnt like that but hes often away on business and in any case she was hardly a child how old was she twenty last month after a while there was trouble at the college she behaved so badly that she was asked to leave what happened then she had a furious row with my father and ended by packing her bags and leaving she said she intended to continue her studies at one of the london colleges what about money did your father agree to support her there was no need she had some of her own just over a thousand pounds a legacy from an old aunt a year or two ago what about boy friends at the college for instance in the two years she was there she never brought a single one home as ive said until that sudden dreadful change in her she was a shy rather introverted girl very much bound up in her work did she ever mention a man named max vernon at all harriet craig frowned slightly not that i recall who is he just someone who apparently knew her but its of no consequence miller hesitated and went on your sister was a drug addict miss craig were you aware of that fact his answer was plain in the incredulous horror in her eyes as she looked up at him sharply her head moved slightly from side to side her mouth opened as if to speak but no sound was uttered miller stood up as she buried her face in her hands and broke into a storm of weeping he patted her gently on the shoulder and turned to brady take her home jack you can use my car what about you i think ill have another little chat with monica grey and this time ill have some straight answers you can catch up with me there he went out quickly fastening the belt of his trenchcoat as he moved along the corridor and the expression on his face was like the wrath of god chapter the door of her room was unlocked and when he opened it gently and went in she was sitting on the edge of the bed buffing her nails she glanced up sharply and miller closed the door sergeant miller she said and then her voice faltered miller produced one of the photos and held it up joanna maria craig he slipped the photo back into his pocket why did you lie to me i dont know what you mean joanna craig was a student at the college of art for the best part of two years so were you and dont try to tell me you never came across her you were in the same year group ive just checked she stared up at him her face white and he took his time over lighting a cigarette another thing mrs kilroy told me that joanna had just arrived on the doorstep one day complete with baggage that there just happened to be a vacancy now that isnt true is it she knew there was a vacancy because you told her she shook her head vigorously it isnt true isnt it then try this for size you work for max vernon dont you and this time he had her her eyes widened in horror and he went on relentlessly joanna was his girl friend ive got proof are you going to try to tell me you didnt know that as well she tried to get to her feet and he flung her back across the bed fiercely come on damn you what about the truth for a change she turned her face into the pillow and burst into a flood of tears her whole body shaking miller stood looking down at her something close to pity in his eyes and then he moved across the room quickly and went into the small kitchen he found half a bottle of gin in one of the cupboards poured a generous measure into a tumbler and went back he sat on the edge of the bed and she turned her tearstained face towards him hell kill me i know he will no ones going to kill you miller held out the glass drink this youll feel better she struggled up against the pillows you dont know what he can be like max vernon she nodded and sipped some of her gin hes a devil a walking devil cruel arrogant anything he wants he takes and that included joanna craig her eyes widened in amazement how did you know that just a hunch but tell me about it everything that happened all right she swung her legs to the floor stood up and paced restlessly about the room as she talked you were right about the college of art i knew joanna for nearly two years not that we were close friends or anything like that i liked to live it up joanna was more interested in her work what about boy friends she hardly ever bothered this may sound crazy to you but she had something about her she was sort of untouched by life if you know what i mean i think i do miller said not that there was anything weird about her everybody liked her she was the sweetest person ive ever known but they treated her with respect particularly the men thats something for art students believe me and yet she changed miller said so utterly and completely that she might have been a different person why she met max vernon i wouldnt have thought he was her type he wasnt that was the whole trouble she swallowed the rest of her gin and sat on the edge of the bed i answered an advertisement for female croupiers at the flamingo as i told you earlier the money was so good that i dropped out of the college course and started working there max was always throwing big parties and he was pretty free and easy about us bringing our friends along you took joanna to one thats right about four months ago i bumped into her one afternoon quite by chance there was a party that evening and i asked her to come on impulse i never expected her to say yes but she did what happened max took a fancy to her i dont know what it was maybe it was just her innocence she was certainly different from every other girl there did she respond anything but and he tried everything believe me then she passed out i thought that maybe shed had one gin too many or something max took charge he said she could sleep it off there and you left her there was nothing i could do she got to her feet and crossed to the window she phoned me here next day and asked me to meet her in town poor kid she was in a hell of a state im not surprised she swung round to face him oh no it was worse than that much worse you see someone had given her a fix while she was unconscious the bile rose in millers throat threatening to choke him he got to his feet and walked towards the door fists clenched and when he turned she recoiled from the terrible anger on his face max vernon i dont know i havent any proof miller crossed the room in three quick strides and grabbed her savagely by the shoulders was it max vernon well who the hell else could it have been she cried for a long moment he held her and when he turned away she dropped down on to the bed she didnt know what had happened to her all she knew was that her body needed something and only one person was able to supply it miller said bitterly she wasnt only hooked on heroin and cocaine she was hooked on max vernon when monica grey continued her voice was dry and lifeless she had a lot of trouble at home and then they asked her to leave at the college her whole personality changed thats how it affects them ive seen it before so she came to live here with you max thought it was a good idea its a funny thing but for a while there i thought he was really gone on her he had her at the club all the time and if any other man even went near her she shuddered he keeps a couple of heavies around called carver and stratton one night at a party some bloke made a pass at joanna and they took him out into the alley and half killed him i heard he lost his right eye thats the kind they are when did the rot set in she looked up at him quickly you dont miss much do you in my job i cant afford to i dont know what happened but max changed towards her just like that about two or three weeks ago she was pregnant did you know that she shook her head quickly no no i didnt maybe that would explain it did he drop her completely she nodded told her to stay away from the club she did too until last night what happened then max was throwing a private party just a small affair mainly personal friends you were there im always there she said all part of the job something else he didnt tell me at the interview anyway it must have been about nine oclock things had just started to swing when the door opened and joanna walked in just like that apparently she still had a key to the private door in the alley max was furious he dragged her into a corner and started telling her where to get off i couldnt hear what she was saying but youd only to see her face to know that she was pleading with him what happened as i say i couldnt hear what she said but he laughed right in her face and said theres always the river isnt there i wasnt the only one who heard that there was a long silence and then miller said calmly it would seem she took him at his word monica grey didnt reply and he got to his feet does he know shes dead not as far as im aware you havent been in touch with him since i was last here she shook her head and he nodded moved to the door and opened it you do and ill crucify you as he went downstairs brady opened the front door he paused waiting for miller to join him any luck you could say that how about harriet craig shell be fine once she gets over the initial shock shes got a lot about her that one where to now the flamingo club miller said to have a few words with mr maxwell vernon ill explain on the way he went down the steps quickly and when he slipped behind the wheel of the cooper his hands were shaking max vernons office was a showpiece in cream and gold and furnished in perfect taste the walls lined with expensive military prints a fire flickering brightly in the adam grate he made a handsome figure sitting there at his desk the last rays of the afternoon sun lighting up the fair hair picking out the colours of the green velvet smoking jacket the guards brigade scarf at his throat there was a knock on the door it opened and stratton came in ive got those figures you wanted vernon put down his pen and sat back good show billy just leave em on the desk anything else yes this copper you were asking about miller thats right youre on a bum steer there hes anything but bent it seems his brother owns a chain of television shops millers a sleeping partner thats where all his gelt comes from but thats illegal vernon said coppers arent encouraged to have business interests on the side stratton nodded apparently they all know about it on the force but they simply look the other way it seems millers a blueeyed boy hes been to university got a law degree and that sort of thing has he now vernon said now that is interesting there was a sudden disturbance in the corridor outside and then the door was thrown open and miller walked in behind him jack brady and carver glowered at each other chest to chest stratton took one quick fluid step forward like a ballet dancer his right hand sliding into his pocket and miller raised a finger warningly you do and ill break your arm vernon sat there apparently unmoved a slight smile hooked firmly into place do come in he said ironically i intend to miller told him get rid of these two weve got business now look here you bastard carver began and vernons voice rang across the room like cold steel ill call if i need you carver and stratton obeyed without another murmur and as the door closed behind them vernon grinned good discipline thats what i like to see once a guardsman always a guardsman is that it miller said the most exclusive private club in the world vernon fitted a cigarette into a green jade holder and gave a mock sigh youve been checking up on me sergeant and how miller said the yard was more than interested to hear youd turned up again lets get one thing clear vernon said i run a perfectly legitimate business here and that applies to everything else i own if youve anything else to say i suggest you discuss it with my lawyers he reached for the telephone and miller said calmly we pulled joanna craig out of the river this morning vernon for a brief moment only vernons hand tightened on the phone and then an expression of shock appeared on his face joanna in the river but this doesnt make sense youre quite sure it is her why shouldnt we be the fact is i understood shed been living under an assumed name nothing sinister just to stop her family from running her down shed had trouble at home he shook his head this is terrible terrible it was all there beautifully detailed by a steeltrap mind which had assessed the situation in a matter of seconds and had come up with the only possible counter with the speed of a computer when did you first meet her the answer came without the slightest hesitation about four months ago someone brought her along to one of my parties i discovered she was a very talented artist i wanted some murals for the club and she agreed to accept the commission it was as simple as that and that was all just a business arrangement the murals are on the wall of the main casino you can see them for yourself vernon said anything else that was between us is no damned business of yours she wasnt a child she had a good body and she liked the pleasures of the flesh as much as the rest of us so you did have an affair with her if you mean by that did she ever sleep with me the answer is yes if youre really interested so do lots of other women though i cant see what in the hell it has to do with you did you know she was a junkie that she was mainlining on heroin good heavens no not good enough you didnt even bother to look surprised miller shook his head youre a liar something glowed deep in vernons eyes am i miller gripped the edge of the desk to keep his hands from shaking i know this girl vernon the first time i clapped eyes on her she was floating off the central quay two feet under the surface and yet i know more about her now than i do about my own sister she was a sweet shy girl a little bit introverted interested only in her work to use an oldfashioned word for these times she was a lady a term that wouldnt mean a damned thing to you in spite of eton sandhurst and the guards is that a fact now vernon said softly youre from under a stone vernon did you know that miller said now let me tell you what really happened between you and joanna craig she was brought to one of your parties by an old student friend and she must have looked as fresh as the flowers in spring compared to the usual rubbish you keep around you wanted her but she didnt want you and that wasnt good enough for the great maxwell vernon because what he wants he takes you got her boozed up and gave her a fix and from then on she was hooked because she had to have one every day of the week and that meant coming to you accepting your terms thats the terrible thing about addiction to heroin theres no degradation to which the victim wont stoop to get the stuff and you must have been just about as low as she could get vernons face was white the eyes burning have you quite finished ill let you know when i have when youd had enough you threw her out and then last night she forced her way into your party to beg you to help her because she was going to have a baby you laughed in her face vernon you told her there was always the river and she took you at your word miller straightened up and took a deep breath im going to get you for that are you now vernon said calmly well let me tell you something mr bloody miller i knew a girl called joanna craig just like i know a hell of a lot of other girls she painted some murals in the main casino downstairs you or anyone else can see them whenever you like anything else is pure phantasy you try bringing it out in an open court and ill knock you down so hard youll never get up again now im giving you one minute to get out of here or im calling my lawyer and you know what that means perfectly miller said it means youre frightened to death he smiled coldly see you in court vernon he turned and nodded to brady who opened the door and they went out for a while vernon sat there staring into space and then he lifted the phone and pushed a button is that you ben he said send stratton up right away ive got a little job for him monica grey came out of the bathroom listlessly shed hoped a good hot tub would make her feel better instead she felt depressed drained of all energy how she was going to get through the long night at the flamingo she didnt know the knock when it came was so faint that at first she thought shed imagined it she hesitated fastening the belt of her robe quickly and it sounded again when she opened the door she had a vague impression of someone standing there of an arm sweeping up and then liquid splashed across her face she staggered back a scream rising in her throat her hands covering her eyes as they began to burn she was aware of the door closing and then a hand slammed against her shoulder spinning her round so that she fell across the bed someone laughed coldly and fingers fastened in her hair jerking her head back painfully come on now dearie open up for uncle billy she opened her eyes aware that the smarting had somehow eased and looked into billy strattons white bloodless face only his lips had any colour and he smiled showing a row of sharp even teeth water dearie mixed with a little disinfectant to make your eyes sting just imagine what it could have been vitriol for instance he chuckled mirthlessly youd have been blind now she was absolutely terrified and lay there staring up at him in horror as he patted her on the cheek youve been a naughty girl havent you youve been talking to the wrong people mr vernon doesnt like that he doesnt like that at all now get your clothes on youre coming with me it was almost dusk when miller turned the cooper in through the gates of the house in grange avenue and braked to a halt at the bottom of the steps leading up to the front door it had been a long day and he was so tired that he sat at the wheel for a moment before getting out when he rang the bell the door was opened by jenny the young maid and her eyes were red and swollen from weeping sergeant miller she said youd better come in there was a message for me at headquarters miller said apparently colonel craig called at the mortuary to view his daughters body i understand hed like to see me the colonel and miss harriet are out walking in the garden jenny said ill get him for you thats all right miller told her ill find him for myself it was cold in the garden and rooks cawed uneasily in the bare branches of the beech trees as he crossed the lawn already damp with the evening dew somewhere there was a low murmur of voices above the rattle of a small stream over stones and then a familiar voice called to him on the quiet air over here sergeant miller harriet craig leaned against the rail of a tiny rustic bridge the man who stood with her was perhaps a shade under six feet in height with iron grey hair cut close to his skull the eyes were very calm above high cheekbones for a moment they considered miller and then he held out his hand it was good of you to come so quickly there was an extraordinary impression of vitality about him of controlled force that miller found strangely disturbing he must have been at least fortyeight or nine and yet he carried himself with the easy confidence of a man half his age your message said that youd like to talk things over with me miller said ill be happy to help in any way i can ive seen your superintendent grant colonel craig said he gave me as comprehensive a report as he could but felt that the full details would be better coming from you he hesitated and then went on i believe harriet gave you some indication of the trouble we were having with joanna thats right ive been given to understand that shed become addicted to the drug heroin which explains what otherwise would have been her completely inexplicable change in character miller told him you must understand that heroin produces a feeling of wellbeing and buoyancy but in between fixes an addict is sick unwell and has only one thought in mind to get another fix they become paranoid irritable subject to extremes of emotion and thats what happened to joanna the girl who gave you all that trouble wasnt your daughter colonel miller said gently she only looked like her for a long long moment there was silence and then colonel craig said thank you for that sergeant and now if you dont mind id like you to tell me everything everything there is to know about this whole sorry affair it didnt take long that was the strange thing and when he had finished harriet craig leaned against the rail crying quietly her fathers arm about her shoulders this man vernon craig said hell be called as a witness at the inquest thats right is there any possibility of a criminal charge being preferred against him miller sighed heavily and shook his head i might as well be honest with you i dont hold out much hope but he murdered joanna harriet craig cried passionately murdered her as surely as if hed used a gun or a knife i know that miller said morally hes as guilty as any man could be but the facts are all that matters and this is how it will look in court your sister committed suicide she was pregnant and she was also a drug addict one witness monica grey has indicated that someone gave your daughter an injection of heroin at a party at max vernons after shed passed out but even she cant swear definitely that it was vernon she wouldnt last five minutes on the stand with the kind of counsel hed bring in another thing this isnt a criminal matter at the moment all shes done is give me a general verbal statement that she might change completely once shes on the stand but vernon was responsible harriet said he was responsible for everything you believe that yourself proving it is something else again there was another long silence and then craig said theres just one thing i dont understand joanna did everything she could to conceal her identity before she killed herself why would she do that do you really want me to answer that colonel more than anything else in the world all right id say she did it for you the expression on craigs face didnt alter please go on in those final moments i think she must have been thinking more clearly than she had for a long time shed let you down enough she didnt want to shame you any more i think she wanted the river to swallow her up as if shed never been when craig replied only the slightest of tremor disturbed the even tenor of his voice thank you sergeant somehow i thought it might be something like that chapter when brady opened the door of the coroners court and peered inside proceedings had already started in spite of the fact that there were no more than half a dozen members of the public present the court seemed overcrowded with the jury taking up almost one side of the room and the coroner high above them on the bench the court officers below miller was just leaving the stand he noticed brady at once and they went outside quietly and closed the door sorry im late brady said i had a remand hows it going ive just done my little act craigs down front with harriet vernons got henry baxter with him that old shark brady whistled hell charge him plenty any word from grant brady nodded not good im afraid hes just heard from the office of the director of public prosecutions theyve considered the matter and as far as theyre concerned there isnt even the beginnings of a case against vernon never mind it was worth a try and theres still the hearing you can never be sure whats going to happen at a coroners inquest they went back inside and sat down in time to hear monica grey take the oath you are monica alice grey and you reside at argyle road thats right when did you first meet the deceased about two years ago we were both students at the college of art we have heard from detective sergeant miller that she came to reside at the same address as yourself under the name of joanna martin why was that she was having trouble at home she decided to leave but she didnt want her father to know where she was living miller leaned forward slightly intent on the proceedings in his own case he had been compelled to stick strictly to the facts and what monica grey said from now on was going to be of crucial importance you were on close terms with the deceased we were good friends yes she confided in you discussed her troubles for example were you aware that she was a drug addict i was but only found out by accident i happened to go into her room one day and found her giving herself a fix the coroner glanced over the top of his spectacles sharply i beg your pardon an injection of heroin and did she tell you what had started her on the habit yes she said shed passed out after having too much to drink at some party or other someone had given her an injection while she was unconscious why would anyone do that i dont know for a giggle maybe indeed the coroner examined the papers in front of him his face impassive did she ever suggest to you that the party in question was at a gaming club called the flamingo owned by mr maxwell vernon definitely not the coroner looked at her steadily for a moment and then nodded you were aware that she was pregnant yes she told me a couple of weeks ago in what circumstances she was very upset she asked me if i knew anyone who could help her to get rid of the child thats right the coroner made another note one final question as regards the state of mind of the deceased would you say she was a balanced individual monica grey shook her head not during the time she lived with me she sometimes had terrible bouts of depression but i think that was the drugs thank you that will be all the fat welldressed man who was sitting at the front beside vernon half rose and the coroner stayed monica grey with his hand yes mr baxter i appear on behalf of mr maxwell vernon called as a witness in this matter certain rumours seem to be circulating which connect my client and the deceased i think we might be able to clarify the situation if i could put a question or two to miss grey by all means i shant keep you long miss grey baxter said id like to return to this question of the deceaseds pregnancy did she ever tell you who the father was i asked her but she wouldnt disclose his name it has been alleged in certain quarters that my client was responsible he couldnt have been you seem very positive might i ask why monica grey hesitated glanced across at vernon and said with obvious reluctance to tell you the truth i knew joanna had been out with mr vernon a few times and i thought it might be him when i put it to her she said definitely not that it was someone else entirely a last question miss grey i understand you were present at a private party given by mr vernon at his flat at the flamingo club on the night the deceased died thats right please tell us what happened it was about nine oclock the party had just got started when joanna walked in she was in a bit of a state so mr vernon took her into the corner to calm her down could you hear their conversation not really she was obviously very upset and mr vernon seemed to be trying to take her out of herself after a while she just turned and walked out what did mr vernon do he took me on one side and said he hadnt liked the way she was talking he asked me to keep an eye on her to let him know if there was anything he could do thank you miss grey monica grey returned to her seat as baxter sat down and vernon was called he made an impressive figure in the dock erect and manly in a wellcut suit the guards tie standing out against a snow white shirt his occupation was given as company director which made the impression on the jury that miller had expected mr vernon how long had you known the deceased about four months vernon said miss monica grey an employee of mine brought her to a party at my place one night i understood theyd been students together and you became close friends i think it would be fair to say that vernon shrugged as an artist she had real talent and i admired her work i commissioned her to paint a series of murals at my club i see the coroners voice was dry remote was the relationship ever anything more than a business one i took her to dinner now and then or to the theatre we got on very well together i liked her immensely and on occasion you were intimate with her vernon managed to inject just the right amount of outrage into his voice when he replied the girls dead damn you cant she be left in peace there was a flurry of movement amongst the jury an outburst of whispering one man even nodded approvingly and the coroner had to call for silence he removed his spectacles and leaned back in his chair mr vernon i can respect your feelings in this matter but i must insist on a reply and you are still under oath sir vernons shoulders sagged yes we were intimate he drew himself up suddenly and glared fiercely at the coroner and why not she wasnt a child it was our own affair the coroner replaced his spectacles and examined the papers before him again were you aware that she had become a drug addict certainly not do you think i could have stood by and done nothing if id known weve already heard that on the night she died she appeared at a private party you were giving at your club thats right what happened on that occasion there really isnt much to tell she was depressed and unhappy she told me that shed lost the urge to paint that life didnt seem worth living any longer i realise in retrospect that it was the drugs which had reduced her to that state i advised her to go home shed told me previously that she and her father hadnt been seeing eye to eye but it seemed to me that didnt matter any longer that home was the best place for her how did she react to that advice she didnt im afraid i went to get her a drink when i returned shed gone thank you mr vernon you may stand down as vernon went back to his seat baxter rose again if i might insert a word at this time on my clients behalf the coroner nodded and baxter continued certain allegations do seem to have been made in connection with this unfortunate young womans death allegations which would suggest that my client was in some way responsible i would suggest his complete honesty in answering the question put to him and his bearing on the stand added to the statement of miss monica grey an independent witness make nonsense of these allegations which are completely without foundation my client is managing director of a company which controls several important enterprises i might also add although he has attempted to dissuade me from so doing that he was at one time a regular officer in the brigade of guards and in was awarded the distinguished service order for gallantry and outstanding leadership during the malayan emergency vernon looked suitably embarrassed as baxter sat down thank you mr baxter the coroner said call colonel craig please all eyes turned on craig as he got to his feet and moved to the stand he stood there hands resting lightly on the rail the eternal soldier in spite of his dark suit and tie you are colonel duncan stuart craig and you reside at rosedene grange avenue st martins wood that is correct did you see the body of a woman at the city mortuary on tuesday of this week i did who was she my daughter joanna maria craig i will issue you with a burial order there was a pause as the coroner made a note and he continued i know this must be most distressing for you colonel craig so i shant keep you long until four months ago or thereabouts your daughter was a perfectly normal young woman for her age in every way that is so the change when it came was inexplicable to us temper tantrums extremely emotional behaviour that sort of thing she became a completely different person i realise now that her general deterioration was a direct consequence of her addiction to heroin from the time your daughter left home until her death did she ever communicate with you there were three letters all postmarked chelsea they are before the court the coroner nodded i have read them they would seem to imply that she was residing in london and studying at a college of art there presumably some acquaintance posted them for her he hesitated and then went on colonel craig you have heard the evidence before the court have you anything to add miller felt brady stir beside him and held his breath waiting for craigs answer i have nothing to add sir the evidence in this matter seems clear enough and you can make of that what you like brady whispered to miller and then with a rush it was all over the jury didnt even bother to retire and the foreman a small greying bank clerk rose selfconsciously we find that the deceased took her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed and that is the verdict of you all the foreman nodded and sat down let it so be entered there was a sudden hush as people sat up expectantly waiting for the coroners closing words it is not within my province to make moral judgements it is sufficient for me to say that on the evidence presented i must agree completely with the verdict of the jury there is one disturbing feature of this case and it is this joanna craig was not a registered drug addict and yet somehow or other she managed to obtain a daily supply i trust that the representatives of the police present in court will see that this aspect of the affair is most thoroughly investigated the court will rise for her majestys coroner there was a general move towards the exit and brady turned towards miller his face grim and thats that the swines got away with it what else did you expect miller said colonel craig and harriet were still sitting down at the front and vernon and baxter had to pass them for a moment vernon hesitated as if about to speak and then obviously thought better of it he nodded to miller and brady as he passed them face grave and went out i wonder what craig would have done if the bastard had tried to speak to him brady said craig came towards them harriet hanging on to his arm he smiled tightly have you gentlemen time for a drink brady shook his head reluctantly not me im afraid im in court again in ten minutes he nodded to miller ill catch up with you later for the moment they had the court to themselves and harriet craig said bitterly justice is that what they call it im sorry miller said more sorry than i can say we tried the director of public prosecutions but he told us we hadnt got even the shadow of a case i was hoping something might come out at the hearing as you probably noticed things are pretty informal in a coroners court no one gets worked up over procedure and so on which usually means that things have a chance to break through to the surface but not in this case it would appear craig put an arm around her shoulders and gave her a quick squeeze lets have that drink shall we do us all good they sat in the saloon bar of the george across the square and craig ordered brandy all round and offered miller a cigarette while they waited behind them the bar was lined with solicitors and their clerks and councils in wig and gown most of them snatching a beer and a sandwhich between cases and talking shop harriet leaned across and covered one of millers hands with her own im sorry i sounded off back there in court i wasnt getting at you you believe that dont you thats all right you know vernons a very clever man craig said he handled himself superbly made an excellent impression on the jury and the girl helped dont forget that miller said yes she lied didnt she too true she did probably under extreme coercion miller hesitated and then went on it wasnt her fault you know shes just as much a victim of circumstances as joanna was actually shes quite a nice girl craig swirled the brandy around in his glass and drank some you know ive been finding out a few things about our mr vernon hes quite a character is that so miller said carefully come off it sergeant you know what i mean craig swallowed the rest of his brandy and waved to the waiter for another youve heard of pedlar palmer i suppose detective superintendent palmer of the special branch at scotland yard thats right we did some soldiering together in the middle east back in i gave him a ring yesterday just to ask him what he could tell me about vernon he owes me a favour or two thats in confidence mind you naturally quite a boy max vernon do you think hes getting up to the same sort of capers in these parts as he did in london leopards dont change their spots thats what i thought craig nodded a slight abstracted smile on his face what is it they say about justice sergeant it must not only be done it must be seen to be done but what happens when society falls down on the job what happens when the law isnt adequate wouldnt you say the individual was entitled to take matters into his own hands i know one thing miller said it wouldnt be the law he was taking youve got a good point there craig glanced at his watch good heavens is that the time i must go can you get a taxi harriet miller cut in quickly before she could reply ill see she gets home all right i have my own car thanks a lot ill see you later then my dear he squeezed harriets shoulder briefly and was gone another drink miss craig no i dont think so id like to go if you dont mind im feeling rather tired these past few days have been something of a strain the minicooper was in for servicing and he was using his brothers etype jaguar that day she was suitably impressed i didnt know police pay had improved quite this much it hasnt he said as he handed her in and closed the door this belongs to my brother he has more money than he knows what to do with and he worries about me he took the car out into the main traffic stream expertly youre a teacher arent you she nodded thats right dock street secondary modern i took the day off a pretty rough neighbourhood good experience theyre pulling the school down soon therell be a new comprehensive opening about half a mile away they drove in silence for a while and then he said you dont think your father will try to do anything silly do you she frowned what on earth do you mean i wasnt too happy about that conversation we had back at the pub all that stuff about taking the law into ones own hands when society falls down on the job its worth a thought isnt it miller shook his head not if he wants to stay alive max vernons a powerful ruthless criminal without the slightest scruples about who he hurts or how he does it hed crush your father like an ant under his foot she turned on him her mouth slack with amazement crush duncan craig that worm she laughed wildly dont you know who my father is if hes made the decision i think he has then maxwell vernon is a dead man walking chapter when monica grey opened her door and found duncan craig standing there she tried to close it quickly but he was inside before she could stop him she backed away her throat going dry and he shook his head slowly im not going to hurt you im not going to harm you in any way just sit down like a good girl and listen to me suddenly she was no longer afraid in fact for some strange reason she felt like crying and she did as she was told and slumped down on the bed you lied at the inquest didnt you i had to god knows what would have happened to me if i hadnt done as i was told then your original statement to sergeant miller was true it was max vernon who first gave my daughter heroin it had to be him she said it couldnt have been anyone else and vernon who continued to supply her she nodded one of his little sidelines you know a great deal about him dont you plenty she said but you neednt think im going to sing out in open court for you or anyone else you wont have to have you got a passport she nodded somewhere around the place why he took a large buff envelope from his inside breast pocket youll find travellers cheques in here for one thousand pounds plus a ticket on the fourthirty flight to london airport and just how long do you think it would take max vernon to catch up with me at least a couple of days long enough for you to complete any formalities have any necessary inoculations and so on youll find another plane ticket in the envelope a firstclass single to sydney you could be on your way by wednesday you mean sydney australia thats right youll also find a letter to a business friend of mine out there hell fix you up with a job and help you get started youll be all right he owes me a favour her eyes were shining and the lines had been wiped clean from her forehead colonel craig laid the envelope down on the bed beside her in return i want you to tell me everything there is to know about max vernon she didnt hesitate its a deal you talk and ill pack they tell me he was the brains behind one or two big jobs in the london area the knavesmire airport bullion robbery for instance has he pulled anything like that up here not as far as i know but i think theres something in the wind theres been some funny customers in and out of the place lately what about the flamingo is the game honest it has to be she pulled a suitcase down from the top of the wardrobe it caters for the most exclusive clientele in town you wouldnt have a key to the place by any chance sure to the back door she opened her handbag produced a yale key and threw it across my pleasure what other little enterprises does vernon operate theres the betting shops im looking for something rather more illegal thats easy he runs a cut liquor still up the york road gibsons furniture factory it says outside but its a front supplies clubs all over the north where does the liquor come from in the first place your guess is as good as mine some from long distance lorries that took the wrong turning some they make on the premises hes got money tied up in that place but more still in the flamingo she fastened the lid on one suitcase and took down another better than a hundred thousand without the flamingo hes nothing he had to take what he could get when he sold up in london they say he dropped a bundle and what about the betting shops he operates them on a daytoday basis using the cash from the previous nights take at the flamingo he still hasnt got on his feet up here yet so everything revolves around the flamingo i suppose you could say that she frowned suddenly what are you getting at never you mind youve got other things to think about now he glanced at his watch well have to get moving weve got exactly half an hour to get you to the airport the bull bell yard was not far from the market a dirty and sunless cobbled alley named after the public house which had stood there for more than two hundred years beside the entrance to the snug stood several overflowing dustbins and cardboard boxes and packing cases were thrown together in an untidy heap it was raining slightly and an old man squatted against the wall a bottle of beer in one hand a sandwich in the other he wore an ancient army greatcoat and his hair and beard were long and matted the door opened and a barman appeared in the entrance a bucket in one hand he was a large hefty young man in a white apron with long dark sideburns and a cold rather dangerous face he emptied the bucket of slops across the cobbles and looked down at the old man in disgust you still here sailor christ jesus i dont know how you can stand it go on harry the old man said hoarsely aint doing any arm am i the barman went back inside and sailor raised the bottle of beer to his lips he lowered it slowly his mouth gaping in amazement the man who stood facing him had the most extraordinary eyes the sailor had ever seen quite dark and completely expressionless he wore a threequarter length british warm a bowler hat and carried a tightly rolled umbrella his hand disappeared into a pocket and came out holding a pound note do you know mr vernon he said mr max vernon sailor nodded is he inside in the snug governor the man in the bowler hat dropped the pound note into his lap im very much obliged to you he said and went inside sailor waited for no more than a moment and then he scrambled to his feet pushed open the door an inch or two and peered in the bull bell did ninetyfive per cent of its trade in the evenings which was why max vernon preferred to patronise it in the afternoon for one thing it meant that he could have the snug to himself which was handy for business of a certain kind he sat on a stool at the bar finishing a roast beef sandwich a pint of bitter at his elbow and carver and stratton lounged on the window seat chatting idly it was carver who first noticed craig standing in the doorway christ almighty he said and then there was a long silence craig moved into the snug and paused against the bar three or four feet away from vernon there you are vernon you know youre a damned difficult fellow to run down ive been looking everywhere for you im in the telephone book colonel vernon said calmly ah but that wouldnt have suited my purpose at all im afraid craig said what i was hoping for was a private chat just the two of us he glanced at carver and stratton and vernon shrugged theres nothing you can say to me that these two cant hear suit yourself craig took a cigarette from a pigskin case and lit it carefully i expect youll be wondering why monica grey didnt turn up for work last night she gave me a message for you did she now im afraid youll have to manage without her in future craig blew smoke up towards the ceiling in a long streamer actually i had a very informative chat with her after which i put her on a plane with a firstclass ticket to somewhere so far away that she can forget she ever knew a man called max vernon what is this vernon said a declaration of war to the knife craig said pleasantly first of all im going to destroy the things that are important to you vernon after that and only when im ready im going to destroy you stratton took a sudden step forward and vernon raised his hand quickly stay where you are he looked craig up and down and shook his head slowly its been tried colonel its been tried by the best in the business and they all ended up flat on their faces but you did have to get out of london in rather a hurry so what ill be up there on top again im on my way now ill run this town before im finished the great max vernon craig said he always gets what he wants thats it including my daughter including your daughter she saw things my way by the time i was through with her for the first time craigs iron composure cracked and his hand tightened around the handle of his umbrella he half raised it as if to strike but quickly regained control thank you for saying that vernon youve made it a lot easier for me vernons easy smile vanished in an instant you know something you remind me of my old colonel i couldnt stand him either harry he called get in here harry came in from the other bar drying a pewter tankard yes mr vernon vernon nodded towards craig and picked up his newspaper get rid of him certainly mr vernon harry lifted the bar flap and moved out right on your way mate ill go when im ready craig said pleasantly harrys right hand fastened on craigs collar and they went through the door with a rush to a chorus of laughter from stratton and carver as the door to the alley burst open sailor ducked behind a packing case and waited harry was grinning widely an arm around craigs throat we dont like fancy sods like you coming around here annoying the customers he didnt get the chance to say anything else craigs right elbow swung back sharply connecting just beneath the ribs and as harry swung back gasping he pivoted on one foot you should never let anyone get that close they havent been teaching you properly harry gave a cry of rage and sprang forward his right fist swinging in a tremendous punch craig grabbed for the wrist with both hands and twisted it round and up so that he held him in a japanese shoulder lock harry cried out in agony and still keeping that terrible hold in position craig ran him headfirst into the stack of packing cases as he bent down to retrieve his umbrella vernon appeared in the doorway carver and stratton crowding behind him craig nodded briefly ill be in touch vernon he said and walked briskly away it was perhaps ten minutes later that the phone rang on nick millers desk in the main cid room he picked up the receiver at once and a familiar voice roughened by years of drink and disease sounded in his ear that you sergeant miller this is sailor sailor hagen im ringing from a call box in city square ive got something good for you whats it worth depends what its about miller said the bloke who took over harry faulkners place the flamingo max vernon miller was already on his feet ill meet you by the fountain in five minutes he said and hung up when miller was shown in vernon was in the main casino looking over arrangements for the evening opening youre getting to be a permanent fixture around here he said you can cut out the funny stuff miller told him what happened at the bull bell i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about duncan craig visited you there no more than an hour ago as i understand it he threatened to kill you vernon leaned against the edge of the roulette table and laughed gently someones been pulling your leg old man this is serious vernon miller said i dont give a damn what happens to you but i do care what happens to duncan craig vernon shrugged as far as im concerned the whole things over and done with he glanced at his watch theyre burying his daughter at st gemmas church at four oclock i sent a wreath could i do more than that you did what miller said incredulously vernon smiled blandly one does have to do the right thing on these occasions when millers hands came out of their pockets they were both tightly clenched for a long long moment he stood there fighting the impulse to knock vernons teeth down his throat and then he swung on his heel and walked rapidly towards the exit behind him vernon started to laugh gently it was raining quite hard when miller drove up to st gemmas he parked the cooper in the main road and went in through the side gate and along a narrow path lined with poplars leading to the cemetery he could hear father ryans voice as he went forward and then he saw them there were no more than half a dozen people grouped around the open grave and the old priests voice sounded brave and strong as the rain fell on his bare head miller moved off the path and stood behind a large marble tomb and after a while father ryan finished and the group broke up harriet craig was crying steadily and moved away in company with jenny the young maid and father ryan followed them craig was left standing on his own beside the grave and miller went forward slowly it wouldnt work he said softly it wouldnt bring joanna back craig turned to face him what are you a mind reader or something i know what happened at the bull bell this afternoon i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about thats what vernon said when i called on him but someone dislocated harry parsons shoulder and broke his nose who the hell was that mr nobody craig looked down into the open grave she was a nice kid sergeant a lot of dreams gone up in smoke there im sorry about the wreath miller said craig turned frowning what wreath the wreath vernon sent god knows where he gets his gall from im happy to say youve been misinformed duncan craig said weve certainly received no wreath from max vernon as the rain increased into a solid downpour he turned up his collar you must excuse me now but harriets taken this afternoon rather hard id like to get her home as soon as possible of course if theres anything i can do i dont think so craig smiled briefly shook hands and walked briskly away miller watched him until he had disappeared round the side of the church and then he turned and went back to his car it was just after ten on the following morning and max vernon was having a late breakfast at a small table in front of the fire when there was a knock on the door and carver came in now what vernon demanded irritably carver held up a large and very beautiful wreath of white lilies without a word what is it for gods sake its the wreath you told me to get for the craig girls funeral the one i had delivered yesterday the porters just found it pinned to the private door in the alley has he now vernon said softly but thats not all max carver said this came with it vernon took the small pasteboard card that carver offered and held it up to the light it was edged in black and the inscription was simple and to the point in memory of maxwell vernon rip chapter miller came awake slowly and stared up at the ceiling through the early morning gloom he checked his watch it was just coming up to six and then he remembered that he was on a rest day he gave a sigh of pleasure and turned over the outside door opened suddenly and as he struggled up on one elbow there was laughter and the pounding of feet across the floor of the lounge a moment later the bedroom door was flung open and his nephews erupted into the room a large and very eager airedale leading the way the dog scrambled onto the bed and miller shoved it away with a curse get down you brute tommy was eight and roger ten and they moved in on him from both sides gurgling with laughter come on uncle nick were taking fritz to the park for a run not with me you arent miller said hitching the blankets over his shoulders uncle nick you promised when oh ages ago fritz leapt clear across the bed and circled the room briskly and miller sighed all right i know when im beaten but get that brute out of here you can wait for me in the yard after they had gone he went into the bathroom splashed cold water on his face and dressed quickly in cord slacks polo necked sweater and su√®de boots he lit a cigarette and went outside his brothers house stood in two acres of garden a large victorian villa in grey yorkshire stone and millers flat was above the garage block at the rear as he went down the fire escape an engine roared into life inside the garage and the minicooper reversed into the yard tommy and fritz were in the rear roger at the wheel and miller opened the door quickly and pushed him into the passenger seat dont you ever let your mother catch you doing that he said youll get me shot when they reached the park they left the car near the main gates but instead of going inside walked down the road to the public playing fields where miller released fritz the airedale bounded away and the boys ran after him shouting and laughing miller followed at his own pace hands in pockets the morning was cold and grey and yet the wind was bracing and he felt alive again for the first time in weeks the boys had reached the line of iron railings that marked the boundary of the park suddenly roger gave a cry that was echoed by tommy and they disappeared over the skyline miller hurried after them and when he squeezed through a gap in the fence and looked down into the sports arena a man in a black track suit was running round the grass track fritz in hot pursuit roger and tommy were hopping about in the centre calling ineffectually by the time miller reached the bottom of the hill the runner had secured a grip on fritzs collar and was leading him to the boys they stood together in a little group and miller heard a burst of laughter sorry about that he said as he approached the man in the track suit turned and grinned surprise surprise it was duncan craig youre right it is miller said youre up early the best part of the day besides i like to keep fit he ruffled rogers hair these two imps yours my nephews miller said for my sins roger and tommy boys this is colonel craig they were enormously impressed were you in the war roger demanded craig grinned im afraid so commandos nothing so romantic they looked disappointed and miller snapped the lead to fritzs collar dont you believe him colonel craig was something a whole lot more romantic than any commando craig glanced sharply at him been doing a little research sergeant you could say that miller brought fritz to heel and nodded to the boys wed better be getting back they turned and ran across the arena and miller nodded to craig ill be seeing you im sure you will when he reached the top of the hill the boys were waiting for him and miller paused to catch his breath below craig was already halfway round the track i say uncle nick roger said he certainly likes running doesnt he i suppose he does miller said a slight frown on his face and then he smiled i dont know about you two but im starving come on ill race you to the car their excited laughter mingled with the dogs barking died into the distance and below in the silent arena duncan craig started on his second circuit running strongly there was a time when nick miller had aspired to a black belt in karate or judo but the pressure of work had interfered with that pursuit as it had with so many things when he entered the premises of the kardon judo centre on the following morning it was his first visit in a month bert king the senior instructor was dressed for the mat but sat at his desk reading the morning paper a cup of coffee in his hand he was a small shrunken man whose head seemed too big for his body and yet in the dojo he was poetry in motion a third dan in both judo and aikido hello mr miller long time no see he said cheerfully i dont seem to have time to turn round these days miller said but ive got an hour to spare this morning any chance of a private lesson bert shook his head sorry ive got a client in the dojo now warming up i was just going to go in anyone i know i dont think so he isnt one of the regulars a chap called craig miller paused in the act of lighting a cigarette colonel duncan craig thats right do you know him weve met is he any good youre telling me he is bert king said emphatically his aikido is murder brown belt standard at least maybe even first dan and the strange thing is he isnt even graded hes been coming in two hours each day for a fortnight now and its taking me all my time to hold him i can tell you mind if i watch help yourself he moved out of the office opened the door to the dojo and went inside miller hesitated for a moment and then followed him craig and king faced each other in the centre of the mat the colonel was wearing an old judogi and looked fit and active vibrant with energy like an unexploded time bomb free practice bert king said craig nodded all right by me the contest which followed lasted just under fifteen minutes and was one of the finest miller had seen when it finished both men were damp with sweat and bert king looked shaken for the first time since miller had known him i must be getting old he said ten minutes rest and then well brush up on some of the finer points thats fine by me craig picked up his towel from the bench to wipe the sweat from his face and noticed miller in the doorway hello sergeant we seem to be running into each other all over the place well have to get sergeant miller on the mat with you one of these days bert said miller shook his head no thanks hes too rich for my blood dont you believe it bert told craig hell give you a run for your money im sure he will craig dropped his towel on the bench ill go through a few routines till youre ready bert there was a fulllength mirror on the wall and he stood in front of it and started to practice karate kicks knee raised flicking each foot forward in turn with lightning speed hes good isnt he bert king observed too damned good for comfort miller said and he turned and went out quickly his face grim so he likes to take early morning runs in the park and hes keen on judo grant said so what plenty of men of his age like to keep fit wish i had the time myself but duncan craig is no ordinary man miller said ive been doing a little research on him he took a bsc in electrical engineering at leeds university in joined a tank regiment at the outbreak of war and was captured at arras when the panzers broke through in his grandmother was french and he speaks the language fluently which helped when he escaped from prison camp and walked to spain special operations executive recruited him when he got home and dropped him into france on four separate occasions to organise the maquis on his last job he was betrayed but managed to slip through the net again they posted him to the middle east after that and he spent the rest of the war working for the special air service organising guerrillas in the cretan mountains he must have been a pretty hard apple grant observed youre telling me when the war ended he was twentyseven and a lieutenantcolonel dso and bar mc legion of honour you name it hes got it the early march wind drove hail like bullets against the window of grants office and he sighed look here nick dont you think youre getting this thing completely out of proportion do i hell miller said can you imagine a man like that sitting back while his daughters murderer walks the streets a free man now youre being melodramatic grant shook his head i dont buy this one nick i dont buy it at all not that i dont want you to stop keeping a fatherly eye on max vernon hell make his move sooner or later and when he does i want us to be ready for him as for craig just forget about him miller crumpled the sheet of paper he was holding into a ball of paper and grant lost his temper just let me put you straight on one or two things before you go in this town alone crime has quadrupled over the past seven years weve a clearup rate for housebreaking of sixteen per cent the average week in the cid is seventy hours and you want to waste your time on a thing like this go on get out of here and get on with some work miller went back into the outer office and sat down at his desk jack brady came across a sympathetic grin on his face and leaned against the wall as he filled his pipe you did ask for it you know miller sighed and ran his hands over his face im right jack i know i am perhaps you are but i fail to see what you can do about it until something happens did you see that note i left for you this one miller picked a sheet of paper from his intray thats right it came in half an hour ago you did say you wanted to know of anything concerning chuck lazers place didnt you miller read the report quickly and then picked up the telephone get me the district inspector for the rspca he looked up at brady this could mean trouble thats what i thought a voice clicked in on the other end of the wire forbes here good morning inspector detective sergeant miller central cid youve sent us a routine report on two poisoned dogs dalmatians i wonder if youd mind telling me what happened we got a call from a mr lazer of the berkley club in cork square at nine oclock this morning he found his dogs dead in the alley at the side of the club arsenical poisoning which was why i reported it did he have any idea who was responsible he said very little he was obviously quite distressed and i dont blame him they were beautiful animals miller thanked him and replaced the receiver what do you think brady said a declaration of war i should imagine so miller stood up and took down his trenchcoat from the stand wed better go round and see if we can damp down this little affair before it bursts into flame chuck lazer was sitting at the piano in the empty casino a glass at his elbow he gave a tired grin when miller and brady entered and kept right on playing bad news travels fast it certainly does miller said why didnt you let me know my affair not in my book miller pulled a chair forward and sat astride it arms resting on the back hes going to squeeze you out chuck this is only the first step lazer shrugged and moved into a pushing intricate arrangement of blue moon i can look after myself what with a gun lazer cracked suddenly and completely what in the hell do you expect me to do bow out gracefully and let him take over ive put a lot of sweat into this place nick i run an honest game for a nice class of people which suits me and suits them im damned if im going to let max vernon walk all over me miller got to his feet walked across to one of the green baize tables and picked up a pair of dice he rattled them in his hand and turned a frown on his face when do you think theyll start jack probably tonight if what happened to the dogs is anything to go by brady said half a dozen heavies mingling with the regular members complaining about the service starting a punchup or two the usual pattern before you know where you are this place will be as dead as the empire music hall lazers face had gone grey and his shoulders sagged as he stopped playing okay you win what do i do you do nothing miller said just leave everything to us what time do you open eight oclock but things dont really get moving till ninethirty or ten miller turned to brady enquiringly feel like a night on the town jack suits me brady grinned naturally ill expect my chips to be on the house lazer managed a faint smile i might as well get ruined that way as the other miller clapped him on the shoulder dont worry chuck well have the heavy brigade standing by anyone who starts anything tonight is in for the shock of their lives on returning to headquarters miller went in to see grant to report on this latest development and then sat down at his desk and started to work his way through some of the paper that had accumulated in his intray it was just before one and he was thinking about going down to the canteen for a sandwich when the phone rang it was a womans voice cool assured and faintly familiar detective sergeant miller speaking harriet craig here what can i do for you miss craig i was wondering if we could have a chat i dont see why not are you free this afternoon no im afraid not and this evening im going to the symphony concert at the george hall with friends she hesitated as if slightly uncertain it finishes at ten i could meet you then or would that be too late not at all miller said shall i pick you up outside no id rather not if you dont mind theres a bar in gascoigne square the romney do you know it i certainly do ill meet you in the lounge at ten fifteen miller replaced the receiver and stared into space thinking about gascoigne square by night and the lounge bar of the romney the neon lights of the flamingo club flashing across from the other side and now whats she up to he asked himself softly chapter the evening started slowly at the berkley as it did at most gaming clubs but from eight oclock on miller and brady waited sitting in comfort in chuck lazers office watching the activities in the main casino through a twoway mirror lazer was at the piano as always working his way through one standard after another stopping occasionally to chat with a favoured customer he looked cool and immaculate in a mohair evening suit and showed no sign of strain gradually the numbers built up until most of the tables were surrounded by those who came only to watch and all seats were taken it was just after ninethirty when brady gave a sudden exclamation and touched millers sleeve coming through the door now the three at the back miller nodded ive got them the man at the front is manchester charlie ford followed by frank butcher i sent him down for gbh once three years the little bloke with hair like patent leather is sid tordoff a right villain they arent local lads are they hell manchester theyve been imported specially probably via a middle man you know how it goes a pound to a penny they dont even know who theyre working for they waited and a few moments later he nodded again i thought so arthur hart and martin dereham hes the goodlooking one with the buttonhole and the moustache tries to come the public school touch but the highest he ever got up the educational ladder was class four at dock street elementary okay miller said getting to his feet im going in better put a call through to hq well have the heavy brigade standing by just in case it was a quiet wellbehaved crowd mostly moneyed people the kind whod run for cover and never come back at the slightest hint of violence or trouble of any sort miller scanned the faces quickly noting that the gang had dispersed themselves which probably indicated outbursts of trouble in several different places at once and then he saw manchester charlie ford on the other side of the roulette wheel ford was of medium height with powerful sloping shoulders the scar tissue beneath his eyes indicating that he had once been a prize fighter he was wearing a surprisingly wellcut suit and pushed his way through the crowd with an arrogance that was obviously beginning to alarm several people he paused behind a rather attractive woman it was impossible to see what actually happened but she turned sharply and her escort a darkhaired young man rounded on ford whats the game so this was how it was to start miller slipped through the crowd arriving from the rear and secured a grip on fords left wrist before he knew what had hit him get moving he said softly into fords ear try anything funny and ill break your arm before the young couple could say a word miller and ford had been swallowed up by the crowd they came to rest behind a pillar miller still retaining his grip fords right hand dived into his pocket as it came out again jack brady arrived on the scene and relieved him of a wickedlooking spiked knuckleduster well well if it isnt my old friend manchester charlie ford ford looked ready to commit murder and when miller turned and glanced over the crowd he saw the others making rapidly for the exit are they leaving you then charlie brady said isnt that a shame they hustled him into lazers office between them and miller shoved him down into a chair whos paying the piper on this little caper why dont you get knotted ford said brady dangled the knuckleduster in front of him between thumb and forefinger carrying an offensive weapon charlie and with your record good for six months that i can do that standing on my head ford turned as lazer entered the room a worried look on his face are you lazer he laughed harshly had to bring in the bloody scuffers eh thats your lot boyo i hope you realise that youre dead meat why dont you shut up miller said and glanced at his watch ill have to go jack ive got a date will you book him for me my pleasure brady yanked ford to his feet and took him out through the side door and miller turned to lazer dont take any notice of that goon chuck weve made a good start theyll think twice the next time oh sure sure they will lazer said but his eyes were unhappy and miller knew that he didnt believe him for a moment the lounge bar of the romney was only half full when miller entered shortly after ten but there was no sign of harriet craig he sat on a stool at the end of the bar ordered a brandy and ginger ale and lit a cigarette when he glanced up he could see her in the mirror standing in the doorway behind him she was wearing an evening coat in green grosgraine which hung open at the front to reveal a simple black cocktail dress and when she smiled on catching sight of him she looked quite enchanting am i late she asked as she sat on the stool beside him no i was early how about a drink please a dry martini how was the concert fine mendelssohns ruy blas and a mozart piano concerto do you like classical music some im a jazz man myself hows your father fine just fine she stared down into her glass and sighed look im afraid ive rather got you here under false pretences you mean you dont want to chat after all she nodded as a matter of fact i was hoping you might take me out now theres an attractive idea he said where would you like to go id like to go to the flamingo may i ask why those murals joanna painted for vernon id like to see them the only other way would be to ask his permission and id hate that she opened her bag and took out a goldedged card ive got a membership card one of daddys business friends arranged it for me and members are allowed to take guests in with them miller sat there looking down at the card for a long moment a slight frown on his face and she put a hand on his arm please nick id feel safe with you you make a very appealing liar miller said but ill still take you in fact i wouldnt miss it for the world im sure it will prove more than interesting the flamingo had altered a lot since millers last visit but that had been in the old days when harry faulkner had owned it and it had been more a night club than anything else with gambling relegated to a strictly illegal small back room the gaming act had changed all that and now there was money to burn the small thickly carpeted foyer had been decorated in excellent taste and the man who moved forward to check harriets membership card was greying and distinguished and wore hunting pink they went through a door at the end of a short passage and found themselves at the top of a flight of steps which dropped into the main casino oh look nick look harriet clutched at his arm the murals were astonishingly good there were four of them in enormous panels two on either side of the long room they were all battle scenes the foot guards figuring largely in each one and had been executed in a rather stylistic seventeenthcentury manner and yet had a life and originality that was all their own miller shook his head slowly i just didnt realise she was that good she could have been a great painter nick harriet said something special she took a deep breath and smiled as though determined to be cheerful well as long as were here we might as well have a look round there were the usual games chemmy roulette blackjack and in a small side room poker was on offer but it was the clientele which miller found most interesting there was little doubt that vernon was catering for the top people with a vengeance the kind of money being wagered would have been sufficient to indicate that but in any case miller recognised faces here and there wool barons industrialists the managing director of one of the worlds largest readymade clothing factories there were at least four millionaires present to his personal knowledge the whole place had the atmosphere of a westend club only a low buzz of conversation disturbed the silence and gravefaced waiters in hunting pink moved from table to table dispensing free drinks manchester charlie ford and his boys would never have got past the door but if they had they would have closed the place down by just one visit with the kind of clientele it catered for a club like the flamingo depended on its reputation take that away from it and it was finished they stood by the roulette wheel watching the play and she turned suddenly id like to have a go what do i do decide how much you can afford to lose thats lesson number one she opened her handbag and produced two fivepound notes will this be all right he grinned it wont go far in a place like this but never mind who knows you may even break the bank wait here ill get you some chips max vernon sat at his desk magnificent in a midnight blue dinner jacket a white gardenia in his buttonhole for supper the chef had presented him with a mixed grill done to perfection and a glass of champagne was at his elbow the man who stood on the other side of the desk an open ledger in his hand was claudio carelli the casino manager and he looked worried but it isnt good mr vernon we put a lot of money into this place the new d√©cor and refurnishing came to twentytwo thousand and then there are the running expenses at the moment were virtually living from day to day you worry too much claudio vernon said it takes time to build up a prestige club like this but theyre coming now all the right people another three months and well be in the clear i certainly hope so as carelli opened the door to leave stratton came in his face pale with excitement millers downstairs in the casino how did he get in hes with the craig girl ben saw them come in he checked with bruno on the door shes a member all right everything square and above board she brought miller in as her guest who put her up bruno says it was sir frank wooley shall we get rid of them you bloody fool vernon reached across the desk and grabbed him by the tie how many times have i got to tell you no trouble in the club what do you want to do bankrupt me he shoved stratton away from him and poured another glass of champagne keep an eye on them ill be down myself in ten minutes harriet had a small but exciting run of luck at roulette that took her up to seventy pounds i think id better try something else while im ahead she said what are they playing over there one of the oldest games of chance in the world miller told her you simply throw the dice and pray that the right number comes up any skill required not to my knowledge then thats the game for me the table was a popular one and not only were all the seats taken but a fairsized crowd stood around watching harriet had to wait for five minutes before her chance came the first time she threw she didnt cast the dice far enough and the croupier handed them back to her with a whispered instruction there were one or two goodhumoured remarks and then she made two straight passes and doubled her money there were encouraging smiles from the crowd and she laughed excitedly these dice cant possibly have any more luck in them can i have a new pair certainly madame the croupier passed them across and removed the others harriet rattled the dice in one hand and threw a pair of ones snakes eyes said a militarylooking gentleman with a curving moustache who was standing next to her bad luck she tried again with no better luck and the third throw cleaned her out how strange she said with a little laugh i just keep getting a pair of ones dont i the luck of the game my dear the militarylooking man said she picked up the dice and rolled them gently no more than a foot or so look there they are again it just isnt my night the croupiers rake reached out but the military man beat him to it a frown on his face not so fast there i hope monsieur is not suggesting that there could be anything wrong with the dice well see shall we he rattled the dice together and threw them the length of the table snakes eyes the croupiers rake moved out but the military man beat him to it again oh no you dont my friend these dice are loaded there was a sudden hubbub amongst the crowd and he turned to an elderly whitehaired man at his side see for yourself the elderly man tossed the dice across the table and the result was plain for all to see voices were raised suddenly people got up from other tables and came across as the news spread like wildfire harriet craig moved through the crowd to millers side they are getting excited arent they before he could reply vernon appeared on the scene pushing his way through the crowd his face angry whats going on here i was just going to ask you the same question vernon the whitehaired man said to start with youll oblige me by throwing these dice vernon stood there holding them in his hand a bewildered frown on his face and then he threw there was a roar from the crowd and the whitehaired man gathered them up quickly that settles it somebody better get the police he turned and addressed the crowd i dont know about the rest of you but ive dropped four hundred pounds here during the past couple of weeks and im not leaving till i get it back ladies and gentlemen please vernon raised his arms in an attempt to placate them but it was no use the voices rose angrily on either side and miller pushed his way forward and tapped the whitehaired man on the shoulder i think id better have those sir and who the devil might you be detective sergeant miller central cid miller produced his warrant and the dice were passed over without a murmur miller looked across at vernon are these your dice sir of course not i notice that in accordance with a specific regulation of the gaming act they carry this clubs registered mark as placed there by the makers what you are saying is that you have a full set without this pair that these are forgeries but thats rubbish the whitehaired man put in what on earth would be the point of a player substituting for the real dice a pair that would make him lose every time he threw vernons shoulders sagged and his knuckles gleamed whitely as he gripped the edge of the table he glared across at miller who returned his stare calmly right i think thats it for tonight mr vernon what in hell do you mean vernon demanded furiously i mean that im closing you up yes closing you up for good you damned crook the whitehaired man said leaning across the table for a moment vernon gazed wildly about him and then he turned pushed his way through the crowd and disappeared upstairs it was just after eleven when miller went down the town hall steps to the cooper the radio was playing faintly and when he opened the door harriet craig sat in the passenger seat humming softly to herself all finished she said brightly her handbag was at her feet and he picked it up without answering and searched it quickly what on earth are you looking for the other pair of dice the ones you palmed where are they i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about miller tossed the handbag into her lap switched on the engine and drove away i dont like being used not even in a good cause for gods sake harriet dont you realise what youve done youve finished the flamingo an exclusive gaming house lives on its reputation all it takes is one tiny scandal just one and the clientele disappear like the snow in the springtime poor mr vernon what rotten luck if you imagine for one moment hes going to take it lying down youve got another thought coming well see shall we she settled back in her seat arms folded and sighed those murals were wonderful really wonderful who knows maybe hell be willing to sell them now youll come in for a drink she said when they reached the house are you sure it isnt too late of course not well have something to eat if you like im starving she unlocked the front door and led the way into the hall and miller was at once aware of the low persistent hum of a dynamo daddy must still be working she said come on ill take you through to the workshop you two can chat while i make some supper when she opened the door at the end of the corridor miller paused in astonishment the room had been expertly equipped and fitted of that there could be no doubt the walls were lined with shelves which seemed to carry just about every kind of spare imaginable in the electrical field there was an automatic lathe a cutter and several other machines whose purpose was a complete mystery to him duncan craig leaned over a bench spotwelding a length of steel rod to what looked like the insides of a computer he glanced up as the door opened killed the flame on the blow torch and pushed up his goggles hello there he said and what have you two been up to nick took me to the flamingo harriet said quite an experience but ill tell you all about it later keep him occupied while i get the supper the door closed behind her and craig offered miller a cigarette she seems to have enjoyed herself how could she fail to seeing max vernon fall flat on his face must have quite made her day craigs expression didnt alter oh yes what happened then apparently the casino was using crooked dice there was quite a fuss when it was discovered my god i bet there was craig contrived to look shocked this wont do vernon much good will it he might as well close up shop therell be a prosecution of course but even if it doesnt get anywhere the damage is done how did he react oh he said hed been framed that the loaded dice must have been passed by one of the players but thats ridiculous craig said i could imagine a player trying to substitute dice that would win for him but not a pair that would lose anyway a clubs dice have to be specially manufactured and accounted for its a regulation of the gaming act expressly aimed at stamping out this sort of thing miller moved along the bench and picked up a small stick of lead easy enough for a man with some technical knowhow to inject a little lead into a pair of plastic dice but what would be the point of the exercise i think thats been achieved dont you well im hardly likely to shed tears over max vernon am i i suppose not miller wandered round the bench and paused beside a curious contrivance a long chromium tube mounted on a tripod it had a pistol grip at one end and what appeared to be a pair of small headphones clipped to a hook whats this a secret weapon craig chuckled hardly its a directional microphone miller was immediately interested ive heard of those how do they work its a simple electronic principle the tube is lined with carbon to exclude side noises traffic for instance you aim it by ear through the headphones it can pick up a conversation three hundred yards away is that so of course these are even handier he picked up a small metal disk that was perhaps half an inch thick and little larger than a wrist watch not only a microphone but also a radio transmitter works well up to a range of a hundred yards or so if you use a fountain pen receiver wire that up to a pocket tape recorder and youre in business what as miller asked that depends on the individual doesnt it i suppose youre aware that all these gadgets are illegal not for the managing director of gulf electronics miller shook his head youre a fool colonel carry on like this and youll be in trouble up to your neck i dont know what youre talking about craig smiled blandly by the way harking back to what you said earlier about doctoring the dice one would have to get hold of them first easy enough to get into a place like the flamingo especially in the small hours just after theyve closed i should have thought that might have presented some difficulty not for the kind of man who broke into a vichy prison in and spirited away four resistance workers who were due to be executed next morning craig laughed now youre flattering me warning you miller said grimly its got to stop carry on like this and youll go too far and no one will be able to help you just remember that oh i will craig said his smile still hooked firmly into place good miller opened the door tell harriet im sorry but ive suddenly lost my appetite the door closed behind him craigs smile disappeared instantly he stood there staring into space for a while then pulled down his goggles relit the blow torch and started to work again max vernon walked to the fireplace and back to his desk again restless as a caged tiger and carver and stratton watched him anxiously this is serious he said dont you stupid bastards realise that one single scandal thats all you need in a prestige club like this and youre finished my god did you see their faces theyll never come back maybe things arent as bad as you think mr vernon carver ventured and vernon turned on him you bloody fool weve been living from day to day waiting for things to build up ive been using the take from the flamingo to keep the betting shops running now what happens he sat down behind his desk and poured himself a brandy whos done this to me who maybe it was chuck lazer stratton suggested do me a favour vernon drained his glass i know one thing whoever it is will wish hed never been born before im through with him he slammed his fist down hard on the desk and something dropped to the floor and rolled across the carpet vernon leaned over and frowned what was that stratton picked up the small steel disk and passed it over search me mr vernon it fell off the desk when you hit it must have been underneath vernon stared down incredulously and then grabbed a paper knife and forced off the top ive seen one of these before he said its an electronic gadget a microphone and transmitter his face was suddenly distorted with fury and he dropped the disk on the floor and ground his heel into it weve been wired for sound some bastards been listening in he reached for the brandy bottle and paused eyes narrowing just a minute craigs managing director of an electronics firm isnt he stratton nodded eagerly thats right and his daughter was here tonight remember so she was vernon said softly plus that nosy copper miller come to think of it thats twice hes stuck his nose into my business in one night that wont do that wont do at all do you want ben and me to handle it stratton said vernon shook his head and poured himself another glass of brandy not on your life contract it out billy a couple of real pros should be enough one of the south london mobs might be interested just make sure they dont know who theyre working for thats all how much can i offer stratton asked five hundred for craig strattons eyes widened thats a good price mr vernon for both of them you fool miller and craig vernon raised his glass of brandy in an ironic salute down the hatch he said and smiled grimly chapter it was dark in the office except for the pool of light falling across the drawing board from the anglepoise lamp duncan craig put down his sliderule and stretched with a sigh it was almost eight oclock and for the past two hours he had worked on alone after the rest of his staff had left there were footsteps in the corridor and as he turned the door opened and the night guard entered a black and tan alsatian on a lead at his side he put a thermos flask on the desk and grinned just checking colonel ive brought you a cup of tea thanks very much george craig ruffled the dogs ears what times your next round nine oclock isnt it thats right sir will you still be here the way this thing is going ill probably be here all night the door closed behind george and craig stood there listening to his footsteps move along the corridor outside when they had finally faded away he went into the washroom quickly and closed the door when he reappeared five minutes later he presented a strange and sinister picture in dark pants and sweater and wearing an old balaclava helmet his face darkened by a brown makeup stick in his left hand he carried a canvas holdall he dropped it on the floor beside his desk picked up the telephone and dialled a number the receiver was lifted instantly at the other end yes im leaving ill ring you again in thirtyfive minutes ill be waiting he replaced the receiver picked up the holdall and opened the door listening for a moment before moving into the corridor he took the service lift down to the basement walked through the works garage helping himself to a jerry can full of petrol on the way and left through a small judas gate it was raining slightly and he crossed the yard keeping to the shadows scrambled over the low wall and dropped down onto the grass bank that sloped into the canal he crouched at the waters edge opened the holdall and pulled out the collapsible dinghy it contained when he activated the compression cylinder the boat inflated with a soft hiss and he dropped it into the water and pushed off into the darkness hed kept gibsons furniture factory under careful observation for three days now from the top floor of his own factory even going to the lengths of obtaining a groundfloor plan of the place from the city engineers department for most of the area was scheduled for demolition and municipal development it was no more than four hundred yards up the york road from gulf electronics and an approach from the rear via the canal had seemed obvious he grinned as he paddled out into midstream to pass the barge and moved back into the shadows again just like the old days other times other places when to live a life like this had seemed as natural as breathing he passed the coaling wharf of the steel plant dark and lonely in the light of a solitary yellow lamp the furniture factory was the second building along from there and he paddled in quickly scrambled out onto a narrow strip of mud and pulled the dinghy clear the brick wall above his head was about nine feet high but old and crumbling and in spite of being encumbered with the jerry can he found no difficulty in scaling it for a moment he sat there peering into the darkness and then dropped into the yard below a light glowed dimly through the dirty windows and he moved round to the front of the building keeping to the shadows the whole area was enclosed by a crumbling brick wall the main gates were of wood ten feet high and secured by a massive iron bar which dropped into sockets on either side in one corner of the yard was a jumbled mass of packing cases and rubbish which had obviously accumulated over the years and it was for this that he had brought the petrol he emptied the jerry can quickly scattering its contents as widely as possible and then returned to the gates and removed the holding bar he checked his watch it was exactly fifteen minutes since he had left his office from now on speed was essential he hit his first snag when he reached the main door of the factory it was locked he hesitated only for a moment and then tried his alternative route up an old fire escape to the second floor the door at the top was also locked but several panes of glass in the window beside it were broken and it opened with little difficulty he stood in the darkness listening aware of voices somewhere in the distance and moved along a short corridor there was a door at the end with a broken panel through which light streamed he opened it cautiously and was at once aware of a strong smell of whisky he was on a steel landing the hall below was crowded with crates and a large sixwheeler truck which certainly didnt look as if it belonged was parked a yard or two away from the main doors the voices came from his left and he went along the landing passing a small glasswalled office which stood in darkness there was a light in a room at the very end of the landing and he peered round the edge of the glass partition and found three men playing poker he withdrew quietly went back along the landing and descended the iron stairs to the hall below the truck was loaded with crates of whisky consigned to london docks and when he looked inside the cab the ignition key was in the dashboard the main doors were the real snag they were chained together and secured by a large padlock he examined it carefully turned and went back upstairs he crouched in the darkness of the little office the phone on the floor beside him and dialled the number he wanted carefully the reply was instant police headquarters can i help you central cid detective sergeant miller craig said in a hoarse voice i think youll find hes on duty tonight miller was sitting behind his desk listening to a wellknown housebreaker indignantly deny the offence with which he was charged when the phone rang all right arnold you can take a breather he said and nodded to brady who leaned against the wall cleaning his fingernails with a penknife give him a cigarette jack while i see what weve got here he picked up the telephone detective sergeant miller the voice at the other end was strangely hoarse and completely unfamiliar to him gibsons furniture factory on the york road interesting place they even make their own booze youd better get round here quick and bring the fire brigade with you he chuckled harshly i do hope vernons insured craig replaced the receiver and looked at the luminous dial of his watch he was running late but there was nothing he could do about that now he waited exactly four minutes went back downstairs and climbed into the cab of the truck he pulled out the choke pressed the starter and the engine burst into life with a shattering roar there was a cry of alarm from the landing above his head and he rammed the stick into first gear let in the clutch sharply and accelerated the doors burst open and the truck rolled out into the yard craig swerved sharply braking to a halt near the outside gates switched off and jumped to the ground taking the ignition key with him he struck a match quickly and tossed it onto the stacked crates picked up his jerry can turned and ran into the shadows somewhere in the night the jangle of a police cars bell sounded ominously when he drifted into the side of the canal below the wall of his own factory yard five minutes later there was already a considerable disturbance in the vicinity of the furniture factory and a red glow stained the darkness flames leaping into the night from the stack of burning crates he took a knife from his pocket and slashed the dinghy in several places forcing out all air so that he was able to stuff it into the holdall again then he tossed it over the wall with the jerry can and followed them he left the can with a stack of similar ones on his way through the garage and returned to the tenth floor in the service lift the moment he was safely inside his office he reached for the phone and dialled his home as before the receiver was lifted instantly at the other end youre late harriet said sorry about that i must be getting old she chuckled thatll be the day everything go off okay couldnt be better i wont be home just yet by the way i want to finish the details on the vibrator modification in time for the staff conference tomorrow how long will you be another couple of hours should do it ill have some supper waiting he replaced the receiver went into the washroom scrubbed the filth from his body and changed quickly he had hardly returned to the other room when there was a knock on the door and george came in hell of a fuss going on up the road sir dont know what its all about but everybody seems to be there fire police the lot go and have a look if you like craig said sure you dont mind sir not at all id be interested to know whats happening myself he sat down at the drawing board and picked up his sliderule and george went out quickly miller and grant stood by the ashes of the fire and surveyed the scene the fire brigade had left but the big black van that was known throughout the department as the studio was parked just inside the gates and the boys from forensic were already getting to work on the truck so no one was around when the first car got here grant asked for he had only just arrived on the scene and was seeking information thats right sir whoever was here must have cleared off pretty sharpish of course the fire was bound to attract attention what about the truck hijacked two days ago on the a near wetherby carrying a consignment of export scotch to the london docks valued at grant whistled softly thats going to bring the countys crime figures down a bit and you say you didnt recognise the informers voice he added incredulously im afraid not well all i can say is youve got a good snout there by god jack brady emerged from the factory and came towards them an open document in one hand weve found the lease on this place in a filing cabinet in the office sir he said its made out in the name of frank oconnor the propertys been made the subject of a demolition order so its owned by the city oconnors a citizen of eire by the way and probably on his way back there as fast as he can run at this very moment grant observed and turned to miller youre sure the snout mentioned vernons name absolutely doesnt make sense then does it it does if oconnor was just a front man i suppose so just try proving that and see where it gets you i know one thing if it is vernons place then someone certainly has it in for him he glanced at his watch my god its almost eleven too late for me see you two in the morning he moved away and brady turned to miller ready to go nick not much more we can do here you know grants right miller said whoever set this little lot up for us must really have it in for vernon hang on a minute i want to make a phone call checking on someone thats right duncan craig not that again nick brady groaned why dont you leave it alone miller ignored him and went to the phone box on the corner harriet craig sounded cool and impersonal harriet craig speaking nick miller hello nick there was a new warmth in her voice when are you coming round to finish your supper almost any day now im just waiting for the crime figures to fall is your father in id like a word with him im sorry he isnt hes working late tonight was it important not really ive got a rest day saturday and i thought he might be interested in a game of golf im sure he would shall i tell him to give you a call yes you do that ill have to go now harriet were having a hard night poor nick she laughed dont forget to keep in touch how could i he replaced the receiver and went back to brady now theres a thing guess where craig is at this very moment working late at the factory gulf electronics is only just down the road brady said the big new block you can see it from here theres a light in one of the topfloor offices as miller turned the light went out lets take a look suit yourself brady said as they moved to the car but i think youre making a big mistake as they drove away there was a low rumble of thunder in the distance and quite suddenly the light rain which had been falling steadily for the past hour turned into a solid driving downpour the main gates of gulf electronics stood open and miller pulled into the side of the road and switched off at the same moment the glass entrance doors opened and duncan craig appeared the night guard at his side with the alsatian thats old george brown brady said sergeant in b division for years got himself a nice touch there brown went back inside locking the doors and craig stood at the top of the steps belting his raincoat and pulling on his gloves he turned up his collar went down the steps and hurried into the darkness of the car park a second later two men moved out of the shadows at the side of the door and went after him i dont like the look of that one little bit miller said wrenching open the door come on he turned in through the gates running hard and from somewhere in the darkness of the car park there came a scream duncan craig had almost reached his car when he heard the rush of feet through the darkness behind and swung round a fist lifted into his face as he ducked and he staggered back against the car flinging himself to one side one of his assailants raised an iron bar twohanded above his head and brought it down with such force that he dented the roof of the jaguar a razor gleamed in the diffused light from the street lamps on the other side of the railings and he warded off the descending blow with a left block and kicked the man sharply in the stomach so that he screamed in agony there was another rush of feet through the darkness and miller and brady arrived the man with the iron bar started to turn and brady delivered a beautiful right to the jaw that had all his fourteen stone behind it there was a sudden silence and craig laughed right on time i dont know what id have done without you miller snapped the cuffs on the man who was lying on the ground and hauled him to his feet anyone you know jack brady held the other one against craigs car theyre not off our patch thats certain specially imported i shouldnt wonder miller turned on craig savagely maybe youll listen to reason from now on he sent his prisoner staggering into the darkness in front of him come on jack lets take them in craig stood there in the darkness without moving until the cooper had driven away and then he unlocked the door of the jaguar and climbed behind the driving wheel he knew something was wrong the moment she refused to start he tried several times ineffectually then took a flashlight from the glove compartment got out and raised the bonnet the rotor arm had been removed an obvious precaution in case hed beaten them into the car he sighed heavily dropped the bonnet and moved across to the main gates it was only twenty past eleven and there were plenty of late buses about but in any case he would be able to get a taxi in city square he crossed the road quickly head down against the driving rain someone moved out of a doorway behind him he was aware of that and then the pain as a sharp point sliced through his raincoat and jacket to touch bare flesh keep walking billy stratton said calmly just keep walking or ill shove this right through your kidneys they turned into a narrow alley a few yards further along craig walking at the same even pace hands thrust deep into his pockets a lamp was bracketed to the wall at the far end and beyond the river roared over a weir drowning every other sound a good thing i came along wasnt it stratton said but then i have an instinct for these things i knew something would go wrong just as i knew you were trouble from the first moment i clapped eyes on you but not any more you bastard not any more craig took to his heels and ran and stratton cried out in fury and went after him the cobbles at the end of the alley were black and shiny in the light of the old gas lamp and beyond the low wall that blocked the end the river rushed through the darkness as craig turned stratton paused the knife held ready a terrible grin splitting the white face and then he moved with incredible speed the blade streaking up to duncan craig it might have been a branch swaying in the breeze he pivoted cleanly to one side secured the wrist in a terrible aikido grip and twisted the hand back in the one way nature had never intended it should go snapping the wrist instantly stratton screamed soundlessly his agony drowned by the roaring of the river he staggered back clutching his broken wrist mouthing obscenities and as craig picked up the knife and moved towards him turned and stumbled away craig went after him but stratton thundered along the alley as if all the devils in hell were at his heels emerged into the main road and ran headlong into the path of a latenight bus there was a squeal of brakes as the bus skidded a sudden cry and then silence a moment later voices were raised and when craig reached the end of the alley passengers were already beginning to dismount men crouching down to peer under the wheels oh my god look at him a woman sobbed suddenly and craig turned up his collar and walked away quickly through the heavy rain chapter the disk shot high into the air poised for one split second at the high point of its trajectory and disintegrated the sound of the gunshot reverberating through the quiet morning the rooks lifted into the air from their nests in the beech trees at the end of the garden crying in alarm and duncan craig laughed and lowered the automatic shotgun im not too popular it would seem lets have another as harriet leaned over the firer to insert another disk jenny came out through the french windows theres a gentleman to see you colonel craig a mr vernon craig paused in the act of reloading the gower and turned to harriet who straightened slowly does he now he said softly all right jenny show him out here harriet came to him quickly anxiety on her face and he slipped an arm about her shoulders dont get alarmed theres nothing to worry about not a damned thing lets have another one the disk soared into the air and this time he caught it on the way down a difficult feat at the best of times snapshooting from the shoulder scattering the fragments across the lawn am i supposed to be impressed vernon said and craig turned to find him standing in the french windows ben carver at his shoulder well well if it isnt mr vernon craig said and to what do we owe the honour vernon nodded towards harriet what about her craig smiled faintly anything you say to me you say to harriet shes my right arm vernon took a cigarette from a platinum case and carver gave him a light all right colonel ill put my cards on the table i made a mistake about you that i freely admit but i know when im beaten i wish i knew what you were talking about craig said vernon obviously had difficulty in restraining himself lets stop beating about the bush ive lost the flamingo and my place up the york road and then billy stratton meets with a nasty accident you arent going to tell me im just experiencing a run of bad luck it can happen to the best of us all right ill lay it on the line youve had your fun youve broken me so im getting out just as soon as i can find a buyer for whats left im asking you to leave it alone from now on all right oh no mr vernon craig said softly not in a thousand years ill see you in hell first and thats a very definite promise thats all i wanted to know far from being angry vernon now smiled amiably youre being very silly old man i mean it isnt as if youve only got yourself to consider is it theres harriet here he got no further there was an ominous click and the barrel of the shotgun swung round to touch his chest craigs eyes seemed to look right through him and the voice was cold and hard if you even try vernon ill shoot you down like a dog in your own home in the street youll never know when its coming never feel safe again for a long moment vernon held his gaze and then quite suddenly he nodded to carver lets go they walked across the lawn and disappeared round the side of the house harriet moved to her fathers side why did he come for another look at the opposition i think nothing like knowing the enemy a cardinal rule of war and vernon was a good officer make no mistake about that but what was the point of all that business about selling out and asking you to lay off who knows it might have worked perhaps thats what he was hoping he may even be up to something duncan craig smiled well have to find out wont we what now mr vernon ben carver said as he turned the rolls into the main road well go back to the club vernon told him after lunch i want you to drive down to doncaster to pick up joe morgan i told him to leave the london train there just in case do i bring him back to the flamingo vernon shook his head no more indoor meetings too risky ill be waiting on one of those benches next to the fountain in park place thinking of craig vernon nodded theres always the odd chance that he has more of those gadgets of his planted around the place when are we going to do something about him thursday morning vernon said right after the job and just before we leave he leaned forward and his voice was cold and you can forget about the we part right now i settle with craig personally understand it was cold in the mortuary and when jack brady lifted the sheet to reveal billy strattons face it was pale and bloodless but there isnt a mark on him grant said i wouldnt look any lower if i were you miller told him what a way to go youre satisfied with the circumstances oh yes the driver of that bus didnt stand a chance it was raining heavily at the time and stratton simply plunged across the road headdown hed been drinking by the way much five or six whiskies according to the blood sample grant nodded to brady who replaced the sheet who did the formal identification ben carver reluctantly i might add brady chuckled i had to twist his arm a little he wasnt too pleased oh well im not going to weep crocodile tears over the likes of billy stratton grant said were well rid of him he shivered i dont know why but this place always makes me thirsty they must be open by now lets go and have one the saloon bar of the george had just opened and they had the place to themselves they stood at the bar and grant ordered brandies all round what about these two villains who had a go at craig last night he asked miller have you got anywhere with them hurst and blakely miller shook his head a couple of real hard knocks weve had a sheet on each of them from cro a yard long which means they were specially imported brady said grant nodded i dont like the sound of that at all he swallowed some of his brandy and gazed down into the glass reflectively you know im beginning to think i may have been wrong about this whole thing nick its just that it seemed such an incredible idea duncan craigs a pretty incredible person miller said i tried to make that clear at the very beginning have you seen him since last night miller shook his head i tried this morning but he wasnt available gone to manchester on business i was told of course hell have to come in to swear a formal complaint when he does let me know i think id better have a word with him myself youll be wasting your time sir miller said hell insist that the whole thing was quite simply a common assault and we cant prove otherwise but hurst and blakely wont get more than six months apiece for that exactly grant frowned theres no chance at all that they might crack and admit who hired them if i know max vernon they wont even know his name miller said grant sighed and emptied his glass all in a days work i suppose lets have another one on me miller said oh no you dont a cheerful voice interrupted my round the same again maggie and make them big ones chuck lazer grinned hugely as he climbed onto a stool next to brady whats all this miller demanded last time i saw you you were on your knees with the world falling in on me but not now boy not with the pressure off what are you talking about max vernon lazer shrugged i mean hes on the run isnt he everyone knows his betting shops have taken a hammering since the flamingo closed and now last nights little affair and what little affair would that be brady put in come off it chuck said you know what im talking about that place he was running up the york road the cut liquor racket he chuckled he was making a packet there too you mean max vernon was behind that place sure everyone knows that lazer looked surprised didnt you miller looked at grant see what i mean sir grant sighed all right so i was wrong but just try proving it thats all just try proving it park place was a green oasis on the fringe of the city centre surrounded by old victorian terrace houses already scheduled for demolition to make way for an inner ring road it was much favoured by office workers during their lunchbreak but at threethirty when max vernon arrived it was quite deserted except for the cars parked round the edges and the small greying man in the camelhair coat who sat on a bench near the fountain he was reading a newspaper and didnt even bother to look up when vernon sat beside him i hope you arent wasting my time did i ever joe what about that cable diamonds job i got nicked five hard years while you sat laughing your head off in some fancy club or other luck of the draw you never get involved personally do you vernon you never dirty your hands two hundred to two hundred and ten thousand quid joe are you in or out morgans jaw dropped two hundred grand you must be joking i never joke you should know that by now whats in it for me half you provide your own team and pay them out of your cut and what in the hell do you do ive done my share vernon patted his briefcase its all here joe everything you could possibly need and itll go like clockwork you know me i never miss a trick not where youre concerned you dont morgan shook his head i dont know fifty per cent thats a big slice to one man youll only need three men in the team give them ten thousand each contract it beforehand that still leaves you with seventy maybe more morgan sat there a frown on his face and vernon shrugged please yourself ill get somebody else he started to his feet and morgan pulled him back all right no need to get shirty im in on my terms whatever you say when do we make the touch wednesday night you must be joking that only gives us two days no its got to be then youll see why in a moment theres an express to london in an hour youll catch it easily thatll give you plenty of time to recruit your team gather your gear together and be back here by tomorrow night what will i need that depends youll do the vault yourself naturally what is it bodinemartin the latest model burglar proof naturally they always are morgan chuckled a snip what will you use nitro not on your life morgan shook his head theres some new stuff the armys been experimenting with going the rounds handles like nitro but three times as powerful itll open that vault up like a sardine can how long will you need on the vault itself he shrugged ill have to cut a hole into the lock lets say fortyfive minutes and twenty to get you inside vernon nodded just over an hour lets say an hour and a half from going in to coming out sounds too good to be true youll need a good wheelman to stand by with the car frankie harris is available hes just out of the ville could do with some gelt what about a labourer thats settled to start with johnny martin he knows how i like things done and a good heavy and i dont mean some punchdrunk old hasbeen youll need someone who can really handle himself just in case of trouble though i dont think hell even have to flex his muscles i know just the man morgan said jack fallon he used to run with bart keegan and the poplar boys but they had a row vernon nodded approvingly thats a good choice i remember fallon hes got brains too okay now thats settled lets get down to brass tacks whats the pitch chatsworth iron steel down by the river only five minutes from where we are now as a matter of fact nine thousand workers and the management are still daft enough to pay them in cash it takes the staff two days to make the wages up which means theres never less than two hundred thousand sometimes as much as two hundred and twenty in the vault wednesday and thursday depending on earnings of course isnt there a night shift only for the workers the admin side closes down at fivethirty on the dot its housed in a brandnew tenstorey office block between the factory and the river and theyve installed just about every kind of alarm known to man bound to with loot like that lying around how do we get in about a hundred yards from the factory theres a side street called brag alley ive marked it on the map im giving you lift the manhole at the far end and youll find yourself in a tunnel about three feet in diameter that carries the electricity board main cables youll know when youve reached chatsworth steel because theyve been obliging enough to paint it on the wall theres a singlecourse brick wall between you and the cellars of the office block if it takes you longer than ten minutes to get through that ill eat my hat what about the alarm system im coming to that when you get into the cellar youll find a battery of fuse boxes on the far wall and theyre all numbered ive numbered the ones youll have to switch off in your instructions but the most important thing to remember is to cut the green cable youll find running along the skirting board it looks innocent enough but it controls an alarm feeder system in case the others fail are the vaults on the same level thats right at the far end of the corridor what about night guards they only have one morgan raised his eyebrows incredulously and vernon grinned i told you theyd installed every gadget known to man the whole place is rigged for closedcircuit television which is operated by one man from a control room off the main entrance hall the moment you leave that cellar and walk down the passage youll be giving a command performance all he does is lift the phone and the coppers are all over you before you know it okay morgan said the suspense is killing me how do we sort that one out they run a threeshift system and our man takes over at eight he always stops in at a little caf√© near the main gates for sandwiches and a flask of coffee on wednesday night hell get more than he bargained for something in his coffee vernon grinned simple when you know how morgan looked dubious what if he hasnt had a drink by the time we arrive wed be in dead lumber ive thought of that you wont break in till midnight that gives him four hours if he hasnt had a drink by then he never will there was a long silence as morgan sat staring into the distance a slight frown on his face after a while he sighed and shook his head ive got to give it to you max its good its bloody good see you tomorrow night then vernon said calmly and passed him the briefcase everything you need is in there your train leaves at five oclock youve got twenty minutes he watched morgan disappear into the side street in the far corner of the square and nodded so far so good the sun burst through the clouds touching the fine spray of the fountain with colour and he smiled there were times when life could really be very satisfying he lit a cigarette got to his feet and strolled away duncan craig watched him leave from the rear window of the old commer van which was parked on the far side of the square he too was smiling but for a completely different reason he turned and patted the chromium barrel of the directional microphone mounted on its tripod and started to dismantle it chapter it was raining hard when the van turned into brag alley and braked to a halt the light from the headlamps picking out the faded lettering of the sign on the wooden doors that blocked the far end gower co monumental masons this is it morgan said right lets have you jack fallon a large heavily built irishman jumped out a pair of twofoot cutters in his hands that sliced through the padlock that secured the gates like a knife through butter the gates swung open and harris the wheelman took the van into the yard and cut the engine fallon was already levering up the manhole in the alley and morgan and martin unloaded the van quickly and joined him he dropped into the tunnel and they passed down the heavy cylinders for the oxyacetyline cutter and the other equipment and followed him harris dropped to one knee and morgan whispered replace the manhole shut yourself into the yard and sit tight an hour and a quarter at the most the manhole clanged into place above his head as he dropped down to join the others he switched on the powerful battery lantern he carried and its beam cut into the darkness in spite of the thick cables there was room to crawl and he moved off without a word fallon and martin following each dragging a canvas holdall containing the equipment it was bitterly cold the insulating jackets of the heavy cables damp with condensation and at one point there was a sudden whispering like dead leaves rustling through a forest in the evening and a pair of eyes gleamed through the darkness jesus christ rats jack fallon said i cant stand them at these prices you can afford to morgan said and paused as his torch picked out the name chatsworth steel painted in white letters on the wall here we are not much room to swing martin commented never mind that get the bloody gear out and lets have a go martin was a small undersized man with prematurely white hair but his arms and shoulders were overdeveloped from a spell of working in the rock quarry at dartmoor and he lay on his side and swung vigorously with a sevenpound hammer at the cold chisel which fallon held in position when the wall gave it was not one but a dozen bricks which collapsed suddenly into the cellar on the other side martin grinned his teeth gleaming in the light of the lamp theres presentday british workmanship for you i dont know what the countrys coming to morgan shone his lantern into the darkness on the other side and picked out the control panel at once come on lets get in there he said were right on time lets keep it that way it was the work of a couple of minutes to enlarge the hole sufficiently to allow him to pass through and he left the others to manage the equipment and made straight for the control panel there were thirtyseven boxes on the board each one numbered and he had to pull the switch on nine of them he had memorised the numbers but checked them from the list vernon had given him just to make sure everything okay martin said at his shoulder couldnt be sweeter morgan dropped to one knee located the green cable running along the edge of the skirting board and severed it neatly with a pair of pocket cutters thats it unless vernons made a mistake somewhere which i doubt when he opened the door the outside corridor was brilliantly lit by neon light what in the hell is the idea of that martin demanded for the television cameras you fool they wouldnt see much in the dark would they morgan led the way out into the corridor and grinned tightly keep your fingers crossed if that bloke upstairs is still awake hes seen us already i cant see any cameras martin said in bewilderment no but they can see you morgan paused at the foot of the service stairs you stay here jack and i will go and take a look he went up the stairs quickly the door at the top had a yale lock and therefore opened from the inside with no difficulty the hall was tiled in black and white and brilliantly illuminated its great glass doors protected by a bronze security grill morgan knew exactly where he was making for he crossed the hall quickly found the third door on the right with control room painted on it in black letters and turned the handle gently the guard had obviously tumbled from the black leather swivel chair in front of the control panel and sprawled on his face the thermos flask stood open on a small table at one side and morgan poured a little into the empty cup and tested it cold hes been out for ages would you look at this now fallon said in wonder there were at least thirty separate screens on the control panel not only was every entrance to the building covered but cameras had obviously been positioned at strategic sites in all the main corridors theres johnny fallon said pointing they could see martin clearly as he stood in the basement corridor the two canvas holdalls at his feet looks nervous doesnt he morgan said and leaned forward theres the entrance to the strongroom and thats a picture of the vault door look theyve even got a shot of the interior would you credit it its fantastic fallon said you can see everything from up here morgan nodded come to think of it it might be a good idea if you stayed up here jack youve got every entrance to the building covered if anyone did turn up youd know in a flash johnny and i can manage below and how will i know when to join you fallon said youll see on the screen wont you fallon grinned delightedly and so i will off you go then joe and god bless the good work morgan went down the service stairs quickly and rejoined martin lets get moving he said and picked up one of the canvas holdalls the entrance to the strongroom was at the end of the passage a steel door with a double padlock that took him exactly three minutes to pick he crossed the room quickly and examined the face of the vault door testing the handles behind him martin had already got the first cylinder out of his holdall he screwed home one end of the flexible hose that connected it to the blow torch and ignited the flame morgan pulled on a pair of protective goggles and held out his hand okay lets get to work he said a few moments later he was cutting into the steel face of the vault six inches to the right of the locking mechanism with the precision of an expert for something like fortyfive minutes jack fallon had a seat at the show that couldnt have been bettered if hed been sitting in the front circle at his local cinema he leaned back in the swivel chair smoking one cigarette after the other intent on the drama that was being enacted below he was at morgans side when he finished cutting the hole and waited biting his fingernails while the explosive was gently poured inside the lock sealed with a plastic compound and fused he heard no noise but the visual effect of the explosion was dramatic enough the door seemed to tremble then a portion of it around the lock seemed to disintegrate before his eyes and smoke rose in a cloud he saw morgan and martin rush forward heaving on the door together swinging it open and switched his gaze to the next screen in time to see them enter the interior of the vault itself he jumped to his feet excitement racing through him started to turn away and paused a cold chill spreading through his body he was looking at another screen the one that gave a view of the passageway linking the cellar by which they had entered the building with the strongroom a man was moving along the passage cautiously tall and dark in sweater and pants gloves on his hands and a nylon stocking pulled over his face fallon cursed savagely turned and ran to the door knocking over the chair in his haste beyond the van a monumental cross reared into the night and here and there marble tombstones gleamed palely the masons yard was dark and lonely a place of shadows that was too much like a cemetery for comfort and frankie harris huddled into the drivers seat miserably hands thrust deep into the pockets of his overcoat he was getting old that was the trouble too old for this sort of action by night he seemed to have been waiting there for hours and yet it was no more than fortyfive minutes since his three companions had entered the manhole his feet were so cold that he could no longer feel them and after a while he opened the door and stepped into the rain he walked up and down for a minute or two stamping his feet to restore the circulation and then paused to light a cigarette his hands cupped around the flaring match he gave a sudden terrible start as the light picked a face out of the night a dark formless face lacking eyes and mouth that could belong to nothing human he staggered back in horror the match dropping from his nerveless fingers and his throat was seized in a grip of iron frank harris the thing had a voice youre just out of the ville arent you the pressure was released and harris nodded violently thats right how long ten days you bloody fool suddenly he found himself being jerked round and propelled towards the gate now start running the voice said harshly and dont stop anything that happens to you after this you deserve harris ran along the alley as he hadnt run since he was a boy and when he reached the end paused leaning against the wall christ jesus he sobbed oh christ jesus after a while he pulled himself together turned into the main road and started walking briskly in the direction of the central station duncan craig moved rapidly along the tunnel towards the patch of light that streamed in through the broken wall from the cellar when he reached the opening he paused to examine his watch wondering if he had timed things right and a sudden muffled explosion reverberating throughout the basement told him that he had he dropped into the cellar and moved out into the passage a strange and sinister figure in his dark clothing a nylon stocking pulled down over his face a cloud of dust and smoke filtered out through the half open door of the strongroom at the far end of the passage and he moved towards it cautiously and peered inside the room was full of dust and smoke and beyond through the half open vault door he was aware of a vague movement he stepped back into the passageway and slammed the strongroom door shut jerking down the handle the locking bolts clanging into their sockets with a grim finality without the key he was unable to actually lock the door but the important thing was that it would be impossible for it to be opened from the inside he turned and moved back along the passage as he passed the entrance to the service stairs fallon jumped on him from five steps up fourteen stone of bone and muscle driving craig into the floor for the moment he was winded and as he struggled for air the irishmans massive forearm wrapped itself around his throat as the pressure increased craig rammed the point of his right elbow back hard catching fallon in the stomach just under the rib cage fallon gasped and again craig drove his elbow home with all his force as the irishmans grip slackened craig twisted round and slammed him backwards with the heel of his hand fallon rolled against the wall the instinct derived from a hundred street fights bringing him to his feet in a reflex action but craig was already up and waiting for him as fallon moved in craigs right foot flicked out in a perfectly executed karate front kick that caught the irishman in the stomach he started to keel over and craigs knee lifted into his face like a battering ram sending him into darkness ruth miller waved the last of her guests goodbye and closed the door she looked at her watch and smothered a yawn one oclock a good party and the clearing up could wait till morning she started across the hall and the phone rang nick miller and his brother were having a final drink in front of the fire when she looked in its for you nick he wouldnt say who he was i do hope you dont have to go out on a night like this not on your life he went out into the hall and picked up the phone that you miller yes who is it never mind that chatsworth iron steel they usually keep a couple of hundred thousand in their vault on a wednesday night dont they youd better get down there quick they almost lost it there was a hoarse chuckle poor old maxie talk about the bestlaid schemes but miller had already cut him off and was dialling the bestknown telephone number in england furiously the main cid office was a hive of industry when grant entered at two am and miller got up from his desk and went to meet him well this is a turn up for the book and no mistake grant said youve had a look at chatsworths sir never seen anything like it any chance of a cup of tea miller nodded to a young dc who disappeared at once and they went into grants office what about the guard ive just had a phone call from the man i sent with him to the infirmary apparently his coffee was laced with enough chloral hydrate to put him asleep for twelve hours so he still hasnt come round who have we got in the bag joe morgan for one have we by george grants eyebrows went up we certainly dont need a scratch sheet on him one of the best petermen in the game was johnny martin with him miller nodded thats right i thought so they usually work together who else we found a nastylooking piece of work lying in the basement passageway hed taken quite a beating is he okay now alive and kicking but making things awkward for us jack bradys running his fingerprints through cro now we found their transport by the way parked in a monumental masons yard in brag alley at the other end of the tunnel which they used to gain access no sign of a wheelman maybe they didnt use one could be ive put out a general call anyway just in case the tea arrived and grant drank some gratefully warming his hands around the cup fantastic nick thats the only word for it this thing was planned to the last inch you realise that dont you theyd have been in london by morning god knows where after that except for an elusive someone who shut the strongroom door on morgan and martin and left this other bloke lying unconscious in the passageway your informer presumably and he mentioned vernon as far as im concerned he did vernons the only maxie i know and planning a job like this would be right up his street grant emptied his cup and sighed i suppose you think its craig i cant see who else it could be no i suppose not do i pull him in for questioning on what charge grant spread his hands wed have to think up a brandnew one just for him what about accessary before the fact he knew the caper was coming off he should have passed on the information to us i cant imagine a judge giving him more than a stern wigging for that anyway how could craig have obtained such detailed information simple miller said hes an electronics expert directional microphones transistor transmitters the size of matchboxes fountain pen receivers you name it hes got it nothing illegal in that considering the nature of his business grant shook his head proof nick real proof thats what you need you havent got it and you never will have unless i miss my guess all right miller said you win what about vernon do we bring him in grant hesitated no let him stew for a while hes always covered his tracks perfectly in the past so theres no reason to think things will be any easier for us this time if were going to get him it must be through morgan and his boys put two men on watch at his club and leave it at that for the moment brady knocked on the door and entered a sheaf of teletype flimsies in his hand i thought id get the facts on all of them while i was at it our awkward friend is a bloke called jack fallon a real tearaway hes even done time for manslaughter he certainly met his match this time grant said miller was reading the reports quickly and he suddenly frowned cable diamonds that has a familiar sound it should have brady said it was mentioned in that confidential file on vernon that we got from cro in london another of the jobs he was supposed to be behind miller grinned youre going to love this sir he said to grant and passed one of the flimsies across joe morgan was nicked for that job after getting clean away he did five years but the diamonds were never recovered he doesnt seem to be having much luck with max vernon does he brady said grant nodded and got to his feet lets go and remind him of that fact shall we chapter from onethirty onwards max vernon knew in his heart that something had gone badly wrong by twofifteen he was sure of it he poured himself a large brandy went to his desk and flicked one of the switches on the intercom get in here ben the door opened a few moments later and carver entered yes mr vernon somethings up theyre way over time take the car and go for a drive past chatsworths see if you can see any action carver nodded obediently and left and vernon lit a cigarette and moved across to the fire he stared down into the flames a frown on his face what could have possibly gone wrong it didnt make any kind of sense the thing was foolproof the door swung open behind him and carver came in looking pale and excited a couple of coppers out front mr vernon are you sure certain i can smell em a mile away ill show you vernon followed him out into the corridor and carver turned into the cloakroom and paused by the window i came in for my overcoat lucky i didnt turn on the light he pointed across to the sycamore on the other side of the fence beyond the first street lamp there in the shadows yes ive got them what do you think i think it stinks to high heaven vernon said and the telephone started to ring in the other room he moved back quickly carver at his heels and stood by the desk looking down at the phone its morgan carver said it has to be who else would be ringing in at this time in the morning well see shall we you take it on the extension vernon lifted the receiver max vernon here that you old man craigs voice rang mockingly in his ear im afraid joe morgan and his boys wont be able to join you after all they ran into a little trouble vernon sank down in his chair ill kill you for this craig youve had it craig said cheerfully joe morgan and his boys are being squeezed dry at this very moment how long do you think it will be before one of them spills his guts youre on borrowed time vernon as long as ive enough left for you thats all i ask vernon said sorry old man ive decided to take myself off into the country for a couple of days shooting nothing like a change of pace if you want me youll have to come looking he was still chuckling as vernon slammed down the receiver carver replaced the extension phone a bewildered look on his face but how could he have known how the hell do i know another of his damned gadgets probably what do we do now get out while the goings good on foot the back way ive got an old ford brake parked in a lockup garage on the other side of the river i always did believe in covering every eventuality where are we going mr vernon ireland you can if you like i can manage a couple of hundred that should see you through what about you vernon unlocked a drawer in his desk and took out a luger pistol ive got an account to settle with craig you dont even know where hes going i shouldnt imagine ill have any difficulty in finding out carver frowned in bewilderment i dont get it a challenge benny a challenge something you wouldnt understand you mean craig wants you to follow him vernon opened the wall safe and took out a black cash box thats the general idea he returned to his desk with the cash box and unlocked it this is what hes been aiming at from the beginning him and me in a final showdown but hes made a big mistake when vernon smiled he looked like the devil incarnate i was a good man in the jungle ben the best there was craigs still got to find that out he opened the cash box tossed two packets of fivers across and started to fill his pockets with the rest theres two hundred there and good luck to you carver shook his head slowly and threw the money back weve been together a long time mr vernon im not dropping out now vernon stared at him incredulously loyalty at this stage ben and then he laughed harshly and clapped him on the shoulder all right then lets see if we cant show the bastard a thing or two but who turned you in morgan thats what i cant understand miller said it was just after four am and the pale green walls of the interrogation room seemed to float out of the shadows unreal and transitory as if they might disappear at any moment joe morgan sat at the plain wooden table under a strong central light that made him look old and sunken brady leaned against the wall near the window and a young constable stood stolidly in the corner nobody turned us in the whole thing went sour thats all then who closed the strongroom door on you and martin i dont know maybe it just slammed shut all right miracles sometimes happen that still doesnt explain how we found jack fallon lying beaten and unconscious in the passageway morgan didnt reply and brady said helpfully maybe fallon just doesnt like you anymore maybe he decided to lock you and martin in the strongroom just for kicks and took off unfortunately he tripped and fell in the passage knocking himself unconscious morgan turned away contemptuously you ought to see a psychiatrist well provide you with one for free miller said youre going to need him badly morgan youre going to sit for the next ten years staring at the wall asking yourself the same question over and over again until it drives you out of your mind morgan snapped suddenly and completely but i dont know what went wrong i dont know he hammered on the table with a clenched fist cant you get that through your thick skull in the silence which followed grant peered round the door eyebrows raised miller shook his head nodded to brady and they joined the superintendent in the corridor anything grant said miller shook his head no more success than weve had with the others he seems genuinely bewildered to me brady put in i get the impression hed like to know what happened as much as anybody right grant said briskly this is where keeping them separate might have paid off put them together in cell and lets see what happens when the constable pushed joe morgan into the cell martin was sitting despondently on a bench against the wall morgan frowned in bewilderment as the door closed behind him what is this martin shrugged search me maybe the place is wired for sound morgan looked the walls over carefully and behind him the door opened again and jack fallon was pushed into the cell he looked a mess his lips were swollen and gashed several teeth missing and the front of his shirt was soaked in blood he staggered forward a wild look in his eyes and grabbed morgan by the lapels what happened for christs sake who was he morgan tore himself free with some difficulty who was who the bloke who came in through the tunnel and locked you and johnny in the strongroom what are you talking about morgan demanded im trying to tell you i saw him on the bloody television screen big bloke all in black with a stocking over his face he locked you and johnny in the strongroom and i jumped him from the stairs you had a barney not for long henry cooper couldnt have hit me any harder than he did maybe it was harris martin said do me a favour fallon laughed harshly i could break him in two with one hand tied behind my back it wouldnt make sense anyway what would he stand to gain then why havent they put him in with the rest of us search me morgan turned away his hands gripped tightly together only one man knew we were pulling this caper he said the man who organised it vernon martins eyes widened it dont make sense joe ive just got one prayer morgan said that one day they put him in the same nick as me thats all i ask in the next cell grant reached up to switch off the tannoy and nodded to miller and brady thatll do me in we go they went out into the passage and the constable who was standing at the door of cell unlocked it quickly and stood back did i hear somebody mention max vernons name grant said as he led the way in why dont you take a running jump at yourself morgan told him bitterly oh to hell with it jack fallon cursed savagely if you think im going to rot while that bastard goes free you can think again if you dont tell him i will you dont have much luck with vernon do you grant said to morgan remember that cable diamond affair i suppose he saw you all right when you came out five hundred morgan said five hundred quid for five bloody years in the nick the anger came pouring out of him in an uncontrollable flood all right vernons your man and much good itll do you we were supposed to be back at his place no later than onethirty if hes still there when you call then im santa claus it was almost fivethirty when miller went into grants office the superintendent was reading through the statements made by morgan and his cronies and looked up sharply any luck not a sign must have cleared out the back way on foot ive put out a general call weve alerted the county and the regional crime squad as well hell probably try for the irish boat at liverpool grant said he wont get far im not so sure sir what if hes still in town why should he be theres always craig he has a score to settle there i shouldnt think hed be foolish enough to hang around while he still had time to get out all the same sir id like your permission to give craig a ring id feel happier grant leaned back in his chair and looked at him reflectively you like him dont you i suppose the simple answer to that is yes a hell of a lot grant indicated the phone on his desk with a sweep of his hand be my guest the phone rang for a long time at the other end before it was lifted and harriet craig said sleepily yes who is it harriet is that you nick miller here nick there was a pause and he had a mental picture of her struggling up onto one elbow a bewildered frown on her face nick what time is it twenty to six i was hoping to speak to your father im afraid hes gone away for a few days suddenly her voice changed and she came wide awake what is it nick is something wrong there was genuine alarm in her voice and he hastened to reassure her everythings all right i promise you are you on your own no jennys here tell you what how would you like to give me breakfast ill tell you all about it then thats fine by me what time seventhirty too early not at all if you think i could go to sleep again after this youre mistaken miller replaced the receiver and turned to grant shes on her own her fathers out of town mind if i put a car on watch up there just in case just in case grant said and smiled young love its marvellous go on get out of here it was raining heavily when miller drove up to the house and the patrol car was parked by the entrance to the drive he got out of the cooper and walked across and the driver wound down his window anything miller asked not a thing sarge some bird came out of the door about five minutes ago and took a walk in the garden thats all she must be nuts in this weather okay miller said ill take over you can shove off now the patrol car moved away and he got back into the cooper and drove up to the house as he got out a voice hailed him and he turned to find harriet crossing the lawn she was wearing an old trenchcoat of her fathers and a scarf was bound around her head peasantfashion i saw the police car at the gate when i came downstairs she said her face grave what is it nick maybe wed better go inside no id rather not jennys in the kitchen and she doesnt know what you and your father have been up to is that it she turned away an angry flush staining her cheeks and he pulled her round to face him you said your father had gone away for a few days is that the truth of course it is and you didnt know what he was up to last night she shook her head her eyes anxious please nick i dont know what youre talking about he looked at her searchingly for a moment and then nodded all right i believe you he sketched in the events of the night briefly and when he finished she looked pale and drawn i cant believe it but you knew about the other things she gazed up at him searchingly are you here as a friend nick or as a policeman as a friend damn you he took her hands and held them fast you must believe that she nodded yes i knew about the other things it seemed wrong somehow that max vernon should get away with what he did she looked up at him fiercely im not sorry you will be if he gets his hands on your father you think thats possible not really hes too many other problems facing him at the moment but you never can tell what a man like vernon might pull wed better give your father a ring just in case but there isnt a phone she said hes staying in our houseboat on the river at grimsdyke in the marshes thats right he goes for the shooting thats about twenty miles isnt it eighteen on the clock good well drive down and see him its early yet and the roads will be quiet shouldnt take more than half an hour she nodded briefly id better tell jenny ill only be a moment she turned and ran across the lawn to the terrace and miller walked back to the car it was no more than ten minutes after they had left when the phone rang and jenny answered it on the kitchen extension colonel craigs residence the voice was smooth and charming good morning my names fullerton gregory fullerton im a colleague of colonel craigs he told me he was going away for a few days and gave me his address so that i could get in touch with him if anything came up damned stupid of me but ive mislaid it its the houseboat youll be wanting sir jenny said thats on the river at grimsdyke in the marshes about a mile south of cullers bend so kind of you not at all she replaced the receiver and went back to her work when max vernon emerged from the telephone box at the end of the small country lane he was grinning wolfishly he opened the door of the brake and climbed into the passenger seat next to carver right benny boy were in business he said lets have a look at that map chapter the marsh at grimsdyke on the river estuary was a wild lonely place of seacreeks and mud flats and great pale barriers of reeds higher than a mans head since the beginning of time men had come here for one purpose or another roman saxon dane norman but in the twentieth century it was a place of ghosts an alien world inhabited mainly by the birds curlew and redshank and the brent geese coming south from siberia to winter on the flats miller turned the cooper off the main road at cullers bend and followed a track no wider than a farm cart that was little more than a raised causeway of grass on either side miles of rough marsh grass and reeds marched into the heavy rain and a thin sea mist was drifting in before the wind harriet lowered the window and took a deep breath of the saltladen air marvellous i love coming here its like nowhere else on earth a different world i must say im impressed he said ive never been here before lost in a marsh punt in a sea mist it can be terrifying she said in some places there are quicksands and mudholes deep enough to swallow a cart the closer they got to the estuary the more the mist closed in on them until visibility was reduced to no more than twenty yards finally the track emerged into a wide clearing of rough grass surrounded by thorn trees craigs jaguar was parked under one of them and miller braked to a halt we have to walk from here harriet said it isnt very far they followed a narrow path through the reeds wildfowl lifted out of the mist in alarm and somewhere a curlew called eerily the marsh was stirring now water swirling through it with an angry sucking noise gurgling in crab holes baring shining expanses of black mud if we dont hurry we might miss him harriet said the tides on the ebb the best time for duck she halfran along the track and miller followed her and suddenly the wind was cold on his face and she called through the rain waving her hand the mist had cleared a little so that one could see the river the houseboat moored to the bank forty or fifty yards away duncan craig was about to step into a flatbottomed marsh punt and straightened looking towards them he was wearing an old paratroopers beret and combat jacket and carried a shotgun under one arm he stood there staring at them one hand shielding his eyes from the rain and then ran forward suddenly his face was white and set when he grabbed harriet by the arm the first time miller had known him to show real emotion what the hell are you doing here harriet was bewildered by the anger in his voice what is it daddy whats wrong we tried to arrest max vernon early this morning but he gave us the slip miller told him i thought you ought to know he was on the loose craig gave harriet a quick push forward get her out of here miller get her out now before its too late harriet swung round her face white and miller said softly my god youre actually expecting him arent you youve arranged the whole damned thing every step of the way craig patted the shotgun vernon shall have his chance all part of the game it isnt a game any longer you bloody fool miller said cant you get that through your head if max vernon comes looking for you hell have only one thought on his mind which suits me just fine suddenly there was iron in his voice no more arguments just get harriet out of here miller shrugged and said evenly all right if thats the way you want it i might point out that the first thing i shall do is contact the county police good luck to you theres a village bobby at cullers bend two miles up the road jack berkley hes fifty years of age and it takes him all his time to get on his bicycle they do have such things as patrol cars fair enough itll be interesting to see just how efficient they are he isnt worth it craig miller said desperately he isnt worth what it would do to you he murdered my daughter craig said calmly he wasnt even fit to tie her shoes but im still giving him his chance nick god help me but i cant play the game any other way which means only one thing in the final analysis that you wont be able to kill him miller said cant you see that its the essential difference between you and vernon craig didnt reply and harriet simply stood there white and terrified miller sighed and took her arm all right lets get going when they reached the clearing he helped harriet into the passenger seat of the cooper climbed behind the wheel quickly and started the engine he slid back the window and leaned out for the last time duncan please craig smiled strangely and leaned down thanks nick for everything now get her out of it theres a good chap miller moved into gear and took the cooper back along the track and beside him harriet started to sob bitterly oh nick im so afraid she said he isnt like vernon not when it comes down to it hes going to die i know he is not if i can help it miller said and braked violently as a ford station wagon appeared from the mist the two cars were not more than twenty feet apart for one horrified moment they stared at max vernon and carver and then miller slammed the stick into reverse and took the cooper back along the track vernon jumped out of the ford the luger in his hand and fired twice his second shot punching a hole in the coopers windscreen it slewed wildly and went half over the edge of the track as miller got the door open duncan craig appeared on the run he dropped to one knee and fired once in the direction of the ford you two all right harriet nodded shakily i think so get her down into the reeds he told miller briskly ill lead them off as soon as they pass get her out of here he scrambled to his feet before miller could argue and ran through the mist towards the ford vernon waited the luger ready and carver crouched on the other side of the ford a smith wesson revolver in his hand do you think it was craig who fired that shot mr vernon craig answered for himself his voice drifting mockingly out of the mist so you got here vernon all right then lets see how good you really are for a brief moment he appeared from the mist and turned and ran and vernon went after him cold with excitement they reached the cooper halfblocking the track and craig called this way vernon this way as they disappeared into the mist miller emerged from the reeds pulling harriet behind him they ran back along the track and paused beside the ford the key was missing from the dashboard but he reached underneath wrenched out the ignition wires and looped them together quickly a moment later the engine roared into life he turned to harriet can you get this thing out of here i think so good i noticed a telephone box about a mile up the road on the way in ring through to grant hell know what to do the county boys would probably wonder what in the hell you were talking about what about you you dont think im going to let him cut his own throat at this stage do you he shoved her into the car go on get out of it as the ford reversed away a pistol shot echoed across the marshes that was answered by the blast of a shotgun miller turned and ran along the track in the direction of the sound duncan craig turned off the path to the left ran across an expanse of coarse marsh grass into the shelter of the mist and doubled back on his tracks he paused and listened intently the only sound was the lapping of water and further along geese lifted into the sky voicing their annoyance at being disturbed by all the rules he should now be behind vernon and carver and he moved out of the shelter of the mist and approached the path cautiously somewhere to the right there was the sound of running footsteps and as he crouched shotgun ready nick miller ran out of the mist over here craig called softly and miller paused on the edge of the raised path and looked down at him chest heaving thank god i didnt think it would be this easy there was a sudden cold laugh and max vernon scrambled onto the path from the other side about twenty yards to the left it never is he called harshly and his hand swung up the bullet caught miller in the upper arm knocking him back off the path into the soft earth as craig fired his shotgun in reply max vernon had already slipped back into cover and craig reached down and dragged miller to his feet can you still run miller nodded his face white with shock i think so then lets get out of here they stumbled across the rough ground into the mist two more bullets chasing them on their way and suddenly the water was kneedeep and the reeds lifted to meet them another bullet echoed wildly through the mist and miller crouched instinctively stumbling to one knee craig pulled him to his feet and they moved on through a thick glutinous slime covered by water which in places was thigh deep miller was conscious of the pain in his arm as the first shock wore off of the coldness of the water as it ate into his flesh like acid and struggled for breath suddenly craig disappeared with a startled cry the water closing over his head miller lurched forward reaching out and followed him in it was a terrible sensation as the filthy stinking water forced its way into his mouth and nostrils his feet could find no bottom as he struggled frantically and then an iron hand had him by the collar a moment later he was on his hands and knees amongst the reeds and breathing again craig crouched beside him he had lost his red beret and his face was streaked with black mud and slime all right miller coughed and brought up a little marsh water what about you lost the shotgun im afraid if you think you can keep on the move weve a chance of circling round to the houseboat there are a couple of sporting rifles and an extra shotgun there miller nodded getting to his feet and they moved forward again a couple of minutes later the reeds started to thin and a dyke lifted out of the mist they scrambled up out of the water and craig started to run at a jogtrot miller stumbling after him the pain in his arm was much worse now and there was a stitch in his side he stumbled into a thorn tree at the top of a grassy knoll above a small scumcovered pool and managed to cry out no use duncan i cant go on craig didnt even attempt to argue get out of sight and wait he said crisply ill be back in ten minutes there was a clump of bushes just below the path and miller rolled underneath he pillowed his cheek against the wet earth struggling for breath and was suddenly aware of footsteps approaching from the direction in which they had come a moment later ben carver came into view he paused his feet no more than a yard away from millers head the smith wesson held in his left hand and miller didnt hesitate he grabbed for the ankles with all his force carver fell on top of him the smith wesson flying out of his hand into the pool below miller cried out in agony as the pain in his arm seemed to spread throughout his entire body and he reached for carvers throat with his right hand together they burst out of the bushes and rolled down the slope for the briefest of moments miller was on top as they reached the bottom and he used it well his right hand rose and fell the edge catching carver full across the throat he screamed and turned over tearing at his collar miller tried to get to his feet and max vernon said hold it right there wheres craig he was standing halfway down the slope the luger ready his face pale right here vernon craig called he came down the slope like a rugby forward head down catching vernon round the waist the luger exploded once and then they were locked together and falling backwards the waters of the pool closed over them and they rose separately vernon seemed bewildered his face black with mud and craig surged forward and hit him again and again solid heavy punches that drove him into the centre of the pool vernon lost his balance and went under the surface as he got to his feet he screamed suddenly my legs i cant move my legs im sinking craig floundered back towards the edge of the pool the mud releasing him reluctantly with great sucking noises when he reached firm ground he turned a slightly dazed expression on his face and wiped the back of a hand wearily across his eyes vernon was going fast the quagmire under the surface of the water drawing him down for gods sake help me craig help me miller pushed himself to his feet and staggered forward clutching his arm blood oozing between his fingers vernon was already chestdeep and he went to pieces completely babbling hysterically arms thrashing the water miller started forward and craig pulled him back and i thought it was going to be so easy he said bitterly he unzipped his combat jacket taking it off as he waded into the pool he held it by the end of one sleeve and reached out to vernon hold on tight if you want to live vernon grabbed for the other sleeve with both hands like a drowning man and craig started backwards he was already beginning to sink himself and for a moment nothing seemed to be happening miller moved to help him extending his one good arm and craig grabbed at his hand a moment later vernon came out of the slime with a rush he crawled from the water and lay face down at the side of the pool his whole body racked by sobbing miller and craig moved back to the bottom of the slope and slumped down so you were right and i was wrong craig sighed wearily i should have known i couldnt go through with it all part of the service miller said craig turned with a wry grin its been fun hasnt it we must do it again sometime as they started to laugh a police whistle sounded somewhere in the distance and scores of brent geese rose in a protesting cloud and flew out to sea
