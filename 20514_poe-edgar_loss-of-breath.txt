loss of breath by edgar allan poe o breathe not etc moores melodies the most notorious illfortune must in the end yield to the untiring courage of philosophyas the most stubborn city to the ceaseless vigilance of an enemy shalmanezer as we have it in holy writings lay three years before samaria yet it fell sardanapalussee diodorusmaintained himself seven in nineveh but to no purpose troy expired at the close of the second lustrum and azoth as aristaeus declares upon his honour as a gentleman opened at last her gates to psammetichus after having barred them for the fifth part of a century thou wretchthou vixenthou shrew said i to my wife on the morning after our wedding thou witchthou hagthou whippersnapperthou sink of iniquitythou fieryfaced quintessence of all that is abominablethouthou here standing upon tiptoe seizing her by the throat and placing my mouth close to her ear i was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of opprobrium which should not fail if ejaculated to convince her of her insignificance when to my extreme horror and astonishment i discovered that i had lost my breath the phrases i am out of breath i have lost my breath etc are often enough repeated in common conversation but it had never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which i speak could bona fide and actually happen imaginethat is if you have a fanciful turnimagine i say my wondermy consternationmy despair there is a good genius however which has never entirely deserted me in my most ungovernable moods i still retain a sense of propriety et le chemin des passions me conduitas lord edouard in the julie says it did hima la philosophie veritable although i could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree the occurence had affected me i determined at all events to conceal the matter from my wife until further experience should discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity altering my countenance therefore in a moment from its bepuffed and distorted appearance to an expression of arch and coquettish benignity i gave my lady a pat on the one cheek and a kiss on the other and without saying one syllable furies i could not left her astonished at my drollery as i pirouetted out of the room in a pas de zephyr behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir a fearful instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibilityalive with the qualifications of the deaddead with the propensities of the livingan anomaly on the face of the earthbeing very calm yet breathless yes breathless i am serious in asserting that my breath was entirely gone i could not have stirred with it a feather if my life had been at issue or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror hard fateyet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow i found upon trial that the powers of utterance which upon my inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife i then concluded to be totally destroyed were in fact only partially impeded and i discovered that had i at that interesting crisis dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural i might still have continued to her the communication of my sentiments this pitch of voice the guttural depending i find not upon the current of the breath but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat throwing myself upon a chair i remained for some time absorbed in meditation my reflections be sure were of no consolatory kind a thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possesion of my soul and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the obvious and the ready for the fardistant and equivocal thus i shuddered at selfmurder as the most decided of atrocities while the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug and the very water dog wheezed assiduously under the table each taking to itself much merit for the strength of its lungs and all obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears i at length heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase being now assured of her absence i returned with a palpitating heart to the scene of my disaster carefully locking the door on the inside i commenced a vigorous search it was possible i thought that concealed in some obscure corner or lurking in some closet or drawer might be found the lost object of my inquiry it might have a vaporyit might even have a tangible form most philosophers upon many points of philosophy are still very unphilosophical william godwin however says in his mandeville that invisible things are the only realities and this all will allow is a case in point i would have the judicious reader pause before accusing such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity anaxagoras it will be remembered maintained that snow is black and this i have since found to be the case long and earnestly did i continue the investigation but the contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false teeth two pair of hips an eye and a bundle of billetsdoux from mr windenough to my wife i might as well here observe that this confirmation of my ladys partiality for mr w occasioned me little uneasiness that mrs lackobreath should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and necessary evil i am it is well known of a robust and corpulent appearance and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature what wonder then that the lathlike tenuity of my acquaintance and his altitude which has grown into a proverb should have met with all due estimation in the eyes of mrs lackobreath but to return my exertions as i have before said proved fruitless closet after closetdrawer after drawercorner after cornerwere scrutinized to no purpose at one time however i thought myself sure of my prize having in rummaging a dressingcase accidentally demolished a bottle of grandjeans oil of archangelswhich as an agreeable perfume i here take the liberty of recommending with a heavy heart i returned to my boudoirthere to ponder upon some method of eluding my wifes penetration until i could make arrangements prior to my leaving the country for to this i had already made up my mind in a foreign climate being unknown i might with some probability of success endeavor to conceal my unhappy calamitya calamity calculated even more than beggary to estrange the affections of the multitude and to draw down upon the wretch the wellmerited indignation of the virtuous and the happy i was not long in hesitation being naturally quick i committed to memory the entire tragedy of metamora i had the good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero the tones of voice in which i found myself deficient were altogether unnecessary and the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously throughout i practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marshherein however having no reference to a similar proceeding of demosthenes but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own thus armed at all points i determined to make my wife believe that i was suddenly smitten with a passion for the stage in this i succeeded to a miracle and to every question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my most froglike and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tragedyany portion of which as i soon took great pleasure in observing would apply equally well to any particular subject it is not to be supposed however that in the delivery of such passages i was found at all deficient in the looking asquintthe showing my teeththe working my kneesthe shuffling my feetor in any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer to be sure they spoke of confining me in a straitjacketbut good god they never suspected me of having lost my breath having at length put my affairs in order i took my seat very early one morning in the mail stage for giving it to be understood among my acquaintances that business of the last importance required my immediate personal attendance in that city the coach was crammed to repletion but in the uncertain twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished without making any effectual resistance i suffered myself to be placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions while a third of a size larger requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to take threw himself upon my body at full length and falling asleep in an instant drowned all my guttural ejaculations for relief in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of the bull of phalaris happily the state of my respiratory faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question as however the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the outskirts of the city my tormentor arising and adjusting his shirtcollar thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility seeing that i remained motionless all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side his apprehensions began to be excited and arousing the rest of the passengers he communicated in a very decided manner his opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible fellowtraveller here giving me a thump on the right eye by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion hereupon all one after another there were nine in company believed it their duty to pull me by the ear a young practising physician too having applied a pocketmirror to my mouth and found me without breath the assertion of my persecutor was pronounced a true bill and the whole party expressed a determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the future and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the present i was here accordingly thrown out at the sign of the crow by which tavern the coach happened to be passing without meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms under the left hind wheel of the vehicle i must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks which unfortunately falling on my head fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and extraordinary the landlord of the crow who is a hospitable man finding that my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little trouble he might take in my behalf sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance and delivered me to his care with a bill and receipt for ten dollars the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations immediately having cut off my ears however he discovered signs of animation he now rang the bell and sent for a neighboring apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency in case of his suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately correct he in the meantime made an incision in my stomach and removed several of my viscera for private dissection the apothecary had an idea that i was actually dead this idea i endeavored to confute kicking and plunging with all my might and making the most furious contortionsfor the operations of the surgeon had in a measure restored me to the possession of my faculties all however was attributed to the effects of a new galvanic battery wherewith the apothecary who is really a man of information performed several curious experiments in which from my personal share in their fulfillment i could not help feeling deeply interested it was a course of mortification to me nevertheless that although i made several attempts at conversation my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance that i could not even open my mouth much less then make reply to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which under other circumstances my minute acquaintance with the hippocratian pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation not being able to arrive at a conclusion the practitioners remanded me for farther examination i was taken up into a garret and the surgeons lady having accommodated me with drawers and stockings the surgeon himself fastened my hands and tied up my jaws with a pockethandkerchiefthen bolted the door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner leaving me alone to silence and to meditation i now discovered to my extreme delight that i could have spoken had not my mouth been tied up with the pockethandkerchief consoling myself with this reflection i was mentally repeating some passages of the omnipresence of the deity as is my custom before resigning myself to sleep when two cats of a greedy and vituperative turn entering at a hole in the wall leaped up with a flourish a la catalani and alighting opposite one another on my visage betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration of my nose but as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the throne of cyrus the magian or migegush of persia and as the cutting off his nose gave zopyrus possession of babylon so the loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my body aroused by the pain and burning with indignation i burst at a single effort the fastenings and the bandage stalking across the room i cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and disappointment precipitated myself very dexterously from the window this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for his execution in the suburbs his extreme infirmity and long continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining unmanacled and habited in his gallows costumeone very similar to my ownhe lay at full length in the bottom of the hangmans cart which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my precipitation without any other guard than the driver who was asleep and two recruits of the sixth infantry who were drunk as illluck would have it i alit upon my feet within the vehicle immediately he bolted out behind and turning down an alley was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye the recruits aroused by the bustle could not exactly comprehend the merits of the transaction seeing however a man the precise counterpart of the felon standing upright in the cart before their eyes they were of so they expressed themselves and having communicated this opinion to one another they took each a dram and then knocked me down with the buttends of their muskets it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination of course nothing could be said in my defence hanging was my inevitable fate i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid half acrimonious being little of a cynic i had all the sentiments of a dog the hangman however adjusted the noose about my neck the drop fell i forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows although here undoubtedly i could speak to the point and it is a topic upon which nothing has been well said in fact to write upon such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged every author should confine himself to matters of experience thus mark antony composed a treatise upon getting drunk i may just mention however that die i did not my body was but i had no breath to be suspended and but for the knot under my left ear which had the feel of a military stock i dare say that i should have experienced very little inconvenience as for the jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop it merely proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman in the coach for good reasons however i did my best to give the crowd the worth of their trouble my convulsions were said to be extraordinary my spasms it would have been difficult to beat the populace encored several gentlemen swooned and a multitude of ladies were carried home in hysterics pinxit availed himself of the opportunity to retouch from a sketch taken upon the spot his admirable painting of the marsyas flayed alive when i had afforded sufficient amusement it was thought proper to remove my body from the gallowsthis the more especially as the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized a fact which i was so unlucky as not to know much sympathy was of course exercised in my behalf and as no one made claim to my corpse it was ordered that i should be interred in a public vault here after due interval i was deposited the sexton departed and i was left alone a line of marstons malcontent deaths a good fellow and keeps open house struck me at that moment as a palpable lie i knocked off however the lid of my coffin and stepped out the place was dreadfully dreary and damp and i became troubled with ennui by way of amusement i felt my way among the numerous coffins ranged in order around i lifted them down one by one and breaking open their lids busied myself in speculations about the mortality within this i soliloquized tumbling over a carcass puffy bloated and rotundthis has been no doubt in every sense of the word an unhappyan unfortunate man it has been his terrible lot not to walk but to waddleto pass through life not like a human being but like an elephantnot like a man but like a rhinoceros his attempts at getting on have been mere abortions and his circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure taking a step forward it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right and three toward the left his studies have been confined to the poetry of crabbe he can have no idea of the wonder of a pirouette to him a pas de papillon has been an abstract conception he has never ascended the summit of a hill he has never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis heat has been his mortal enemy in the dogdays his days have been the days of a dog therein he has dreamed of flames and suffocationof mountains upon mountainsof pelion upon ossa he was short of breathto say all in a word he was short of breath he thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments he was the inventor of selfmoving fans windsails and ventilators he patronized du pont the bellowsmaker and he died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar his was a case in which i feel a deep interesta lot in which i sincerely sympathize but heresaid ihereand i dragged spitefully from its receptacle a gaunt tall and peculiarlooking form whose remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome familiarityhere is a wretch entitled to no earthly commiseration thus saying in order to obtain a more distinct view of my subject i applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground held it thus at the length of my arm while i continued my soliloquy entitled i repeated to no earthly commiseration who indeed would think of compassioning a shadow besides has he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality he was the originator of tall monumentsshottowerslightningrods lombardy poplars his treatise upon shades and shadows has immortalized him he edited with

gradually convinced that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman whom i soon recognized as my neighbor windenough was in fact the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife time place and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question i did not at least during the long period in which the inventor of lombardy poplars continued to favor me with his explanations in this respect i was actuated by that habitual prudence which has ever been my predominating trait i reflected that many difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount many persons i considered are prone to estimate commodities in their possessionhowever valueless to the then proprietorhowever troublesome or distressingin direct ratio with the advantages to be derived by others from their attainment or by themselves from their abandonment might not this be the case with mr windenough in displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid might i not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice there are scoundrels in this world i remembered with a sigh who will not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even a next door neighbor and this remark is from epictetus it is precisely at that time when men are most anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in others upon considerations similar to these and still retaining my grasp upon the nose of mr w i accordingly thought proper to model my reply monster i began in a tone of the deepest indignationmonster and doublewinded idiotdost thou whom for thine iniquities it has pleased heaven to accurse with a twofold respimtiondost thou i say presume to address me in the familiar language of an old acquaintancei lie forsooth and hold my tongue to be surepretty conversation indeed to a gentleman with a single breathall this too when i have it in my power to relieve the calamity under which thou dost so justly sufferto curtail the superfluities of thine unhappy respiration like brutus i paused for a replywith which like a tornado mr windenough immediately overwhelmed me protestation followed upon protestation and apology upon apology there were no terms with which he was unwilling to comply and there were none of which i failed to take the fullest advantage preliminaries being at length arranged my acquaintance delivered me the respiration for which having carefully examined it i gave him afterward a receipt i am aware that by many i shall be held to blame for speaking in a manner so cursory of a transaction so impalpable it will be thought that i should have entered more minutely into the details of an occurrence by whichand this is very truemuch new light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of physical philosophy to all this i am sorry that i cannot reply a hint is the only answer which i am permitted to make there were circumstancesbut i think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible about an affair so delicateso delicate i repeat and at the time involving the interests of a third party whose sulphurous resentment i have not the least desire at this moment of incurring we were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre the united strength of our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent scissors the whig editor republished a treatise upon the nature and origin of subterranean noises a replyrejoinderconfutationand justificationfollowed in the columns of a democratic gazette it was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy that the appearance of mr windenough and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in the wrong i cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life at all times sufficiently eventful without again recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen felt nor fully understood it was in the spirit of this wisdom that among the ancient hebrews it was believed the gates of heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner or saint who with good lungs and implicit confidence should vociferate the word amen it was in the spirit of this wisdom that when a great plague raged at athens and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal epimenides as laertius relates in his second book of that philosopher advised the erection of a shrine and temple to the proper god
