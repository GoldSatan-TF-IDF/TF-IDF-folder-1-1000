elizabeth george missing joseph november the rain cappuccino that new age answer to driving ones blues momentarily away a few tablespoons of espresso a froth of steamed milk an accompanying and generally tasteless dash of powdered chocolate and suddenly life was supposed to be all in order again what drivel deborah st james sighed she picked up the bill that a passing waitress had slid surreptitiously onto the table good lord she said and she stared both dismayed and disgusted at the amount she was going to have to pay a block away she could have ducked into a pub and acknowledged that importunate inner voice saying whats this chichi rot deb lets just have a guinness somewhere but instead shed made her way to upstairs the stylish marbleglassandchrome coffee shop of the savoy hotel where those who imbibed in anything beyond water paid heavily for the privilege as she was discovering shed come to the savoy to show her portfolio to richie rica an upandcoming producer employed by a newly formed entertainment conglomerate called lasoundmachine he had travelled to london for a brief seven days to select the photographer who would capture for posterity the likenesses of dead meat a fivemember band from leeds whose most recent album rica was shepherding all the way from creation to completion she was he told her the ninth frigging photog whose work hed seen his patience apparently was wearing thin unfortunately it gained no girth from their interview straddling a delicate gilded chair rica went through her portfolio with all the interest and the approximate speed of a man dealing cards in a gambling casino one after another deborahs pictures sailed to the fl oor she watched them fall her husband her father her sisterinlaw her friends the myriad relations shed gained through her marriage there was no sting or bowie or george michael among them shed only got the interview in the first place through the recommendation of a fellow photographer whose work had also failed to please the american and from the expression on ricas face she could tell she was getting no further than anyone else this didnt actually disturb her as much as seeing the blackandwhite tarpaulin of her pictures grow on the floor beneath ricas chair among them was her husbands sombre face and his eyes so greyblue light so much at odds with his jetcoloured hair seemed to be gazing directly into hers this isnt the way to escape he was saying she never wanted to believe simons words at any moment when he was most in the right that was the primary difficulty in their marriage her refusal to see reason in the face of emotion warring with his cool evaluation of the facts at hand she would say god damn it simon dont tell me how to feel you dont know how i feeland she would weep the hardest with the greatest bitterness when she knew he was right as he was now when he was fi ftyfour miles away in cambridge studying a corpse and a set of xrays trying to decide with his usual dispassionate clinical acuity what had been used to beat in a girls face so when in evaluation of her work richie rica said with a martyred sigh at the monumental waste of his time okay you got some talent but you want the truth these pictures wouldnt sell shit if it was dipped in gold she wasnt as offended as she might have been it was only when he jockeyed his chair around prior to rising that her mild ember of irritation feathered into fl ame for he slid his chair into the blanket of pictures hed just created and one of its legs perforated the lined face of deborahs father sinking through his cheek and creating a fi ssure from jaw to nose it wasnt even the damage to the photograph that brought the heat to her face if the truth be told it was ricas saying oh hell im sorry you can print another of the old guy cant you before he heaved himself to his feet which is largely why she knelt keeping her hands steady by pressing them to the fl oor as she gathered her pictures together placing them back into the portfolio tying its strings neatly and then looking up to say you dont look like a worm why is it you act like one which the relative merit of her pictures aside is even more largely why she hadnt got the job wasnt meant to be deb her father would have said of course that was true lots of things in life are never meant to be she gathered up her shoulder bag her portfolio her umbrella and made her way out to the hotels grand entry a short walk past a line of waiting taxis and she was out on the pavement the mornings rain had abated for the moment but the wind was fierce one of those angry london winds that blow from the southeast pick up speed on the slick surface of open water and shoot down streets tearing at both umbrellas and clothes in combination with the traffic rumbling by it created a whiphowl of noise in the strand deborah squinted at the sky grey clouds roiled it was a matter of minutes before the rain began again shed thought about taking a walk before heading home she wasnt far from the river and a stroll down the embankment sounded lovelier than did the prospect of entering a house made tenebrous by the weather and rebarbative by the memory of her last discussion with simon but with the wind dashing her hair into her eyes and the air smelling each moment heavier with rain she thought better of the idea the fortuitous approach of a number eleven bus seemed indication enough of what she ought to do she hurried to join the queue a moment later she was jostling among the crowd in the bus itself however within two blocks an embankment stroll in a raging hurricane looked decidedly more appealing than what the bus ride had to offer claustrophobia an umbrella being driven into her little toe by an aquascutumoutfitted sloane ranger several miles out of territory and the pervasive odour of garlic which seemed to be emanating from the very pores of a diminutive grandmotherly woman at deborahs elbow all joined forces to convince her that the day promised nothing more than an endless journey from bad to worse traffic ground to a halt at craven street and eight more people took the opportunity of jumping into the bus it began to rain as if in response to all three of these events the grandmotherly woman gave a tremendous sigh and aquascutum leaned heavily onto the umbrellas handle deborah tried not to breathe and began to feel faint anything wind rain thunder or an encounter with all four horsemen of the apocalypse would be better than this another interview with richie rica would be better than this as the bus inched forward towards trafalgar square deborah fought her way past five skinheads two punk rockers half a dozen housewives and a happy group of chattering american tourists she gained the door just as nelsons column came into view and with a determined leap she was back in the wind with the rain beating soundly against her face she knew better than to open her umbrella the wind would take it like tissue and hurl it down the street instead she looked for shelter the square itself was empty a broad expanse of concrete fountains and crouching lions devoid of its resident flock of pigeons and of the homeless and often friendless who lounged by the fountains and climbed on the lions and encouraged the tourists to feed the birds the square looked for once like the monument to a hero that it was supposed to be it did not however hold out much promise as a sanctuary in the middle of a storm beyond it stood the national gallery where a number of people huddled into their coats fought with umbrellas and scurried like voles up the wide front steps here was shelter and more food if she wanted it art if she needed it and the promise of distraction which she had been welcoming for the last eight months with the rainwater beginning to drizzle through her hair to her scalp deborah hurried down the steps of the subway and through the pedestrian tunnel emerging moments later in the square itself this she crossed quickly her black portfolio clasped hard to her chest while the wind tore at her coat and drove the rain in steady waves against her by the time she reached the door of the gallery she was sloshing in her shoes her stockings were spattered and her hair felt like a cap of wet wool on her head where to go she hadnt been inside the gallery in ages how embarrassing she thought im supposed to be an artist myself but the reality was that she had always felt overwhelmed in museums within a quarter of an hour a hopeless victim to aestheticoverload other people could walk gaze and comment upon brushstrokes with their noses fixed a mere six inches from a canvas but for deborah ten paintings into any visit and shed forgotten the fi rst she checked her belongings in the cloakroom picked up a museum plan and began to wander happy enough to be out of the cold content with the thought that the gallery contained ample scope for at least a temporary respite a diverting photographic assignment may have been out of her reach at the moment but the exhibitions here at least held out the promise of continued avoidance for another few hours if she was truly lucky simons work would keep him the night in cambridge discussion between them couldnt resume she would have purchased more time in that way she quickly scanned the museum plan looking for something that might engage her early italian italian th century dutch th century english th century only one artist was mentioned by name leonardo it said cartoon room she found the room easily tucked away by itself no larger than simons study in chelsea unlike the exhibition rooms she had passed through to reach it room contained only one piece leonardo da vincis fullscale composition of the virgin and child with st anne and the infant st john the baptist additionally unlike the other exhibition rooms room was chapellike dimly illuminated by weak protective lights directed upon only the artwork itself furnished with a set of benches from which admirers could contemplate what the museum plan called one of da vincis most beautiful works there were however no other admirers contemplating it now deborah sat before it a tightness began to curl in her back and to form a coiled spring of tension at the base of her neck she was not immune to the excellent irony of her choice it grew from the virgins expression that mask of devotion and selfless love it grew from st annes eyes deeply understanding in a face of contentment cast in the virgins direction for who would understand better than st anne watching her own beloved daughter loving the wondrous infant shed borne and the infant himself leaning out of his mothers arms reaching for his cousin the baptist leaving his mother even now even now that would be simons point the leaving that was the scientist speaking in him calm analytical and given to looking at the world in terms of the objective practicalities implied by statistics but his worldview indeed his world itself was different from hers he could say listen to me deborah there are other bonds besides those of bloodbecause it was easy for him of all people to possess that particular philosophical bent life was defined in different terms for her effortlessly she could conjure up the image of the photograph that ricas chair leg had punctured and destroyed how the spring breeze blew at her fathers sparse hair how a tree branch cast a shadow like a birds wing across the stone of her mothers grave how the daffodils he was placing in the vase caught the sun like small trumpets and furled against the back of his hand how his hand itself held the flowers with his fi ngers curled tightly round their stems just as theyd been curling every fifth of april for the last eighteen years he was fiftyeight years old her father he was her only connection of blood and bone deborah gazed at the da vinci cartoon its two female figures would have understood what her husband did not it was the power the blessing the ineffable awe of a life created and brought forth from ones own i want you to give your body a rest for at least a year the doctor had told her this is six miscarriages four spontaneous abortions in the last nine months alone were encountering physical stress a dangerous blood loss hormonal imbalance and let me try fertility drugs shed said youre not listening to me thats beyond consideration at the moment in vitro then you know impregnation isnt the problem deborah gestation is ill stay in bed for nine months i wont move ill do anything then get on an adoption list start using contraceptives and try again this time next year because if you continue to carry on in this fashion youll be looking at a hysterectomy before youre thirty years old he wrote out the prescription but there has to be a chance she said trying to pretend the remark was casual she couldnt allow herself to become upset there must after all be no demonstration of mental or emotional stress on the part of the patient he would note it on the chart and it would count against her the doctor was not unsympathetic there is he said next year when your bodys had an opportunity to heal well look at all the options then in vitro fertility drugs everything else well do all the tests we can in a year so dutifully she began with the pills but when simon brought home the adoption forms she drew the line on cooperation there was absolutely no point in thinking of it now she forced herself to study the cartoon the faces were serene she decided they seemed welldefined the rest of the piece was largely impression drawn like a series of questions that would remain forever unanswered would the virgins foot be raised or lowered would st anne continue to point towards the sky would the infants plump hand cradle the baptists chin and was the background golgotha or was that a future too unsavoury for this moment of tranquillity something better left unsaid and unseen no joseph yes of course no joseph deborah turned at the whisper and saw that a man still fully dressed for the outofdoors in a great wet overcoat with a scarf round his neck and a trilby on his head had joined her he didnt seem to notice her presence and had he not spoken she probably wouldnt have noticed his dressed completely in black he faded into the farthest corner of the room no joseph he whispered again resigned rugby player deborah thought for he was tall and looked hefty beneath his coat and his hands clasping a rolledup museum plan in front of him like an unlit candle were square and blunt fingered and fully capable she imagined of shoving other players to one side in a dash down the fi eld he wasnt dashing anywhere now although he did move forward into one of the muted cones of light his steps seemed reverential with his eyes on the da vinci he reached for his hat and removed it as a man might do in church he dropped it onto one of the benches he sat he wore thicksoled shoes serviceable shoes country shoes and he balanced them on their outer edges as he dangled his hands between his knees after a moment he ran one hand through thinning hair that was the slowgreying colour of soot it didnt seem so much a gesture of seeing to his appearance as it did one of rumination his face raised to study the da vinci looked both worried and pained with crescent bags beneath his eyes and heavy lines on his brow he pressed his lips together the lower one was full the upper one thin they formed a seam of sorrow on his face and they seemed to be acting as inadequate containment for an inner turmoil fellow struggler deborah thought she was touched by his suffering its a lovely drawing isnt it she spoke in the sort of hushed whisper one automatically uses in places of prayer or meditation id never seen it before today he turned to her he was swarthy older than he had seemed at first he looked surprised to have been spoken to out of the blue by a stranger nor i he said its awful of me when you think that ive lived in london for the last eighteen years it makes me wonder what else ive been missing joseph he said sorry he used the museum plan to gesture at the cartoon youre missing joseph but youll always be missing him havent you noticed isnt it always madonna and child deborah glanced again at the artwork id never thought of that actually or virgin and child or mother and child or adoration of the magi with a cow and an ass and an angel or two but you rarely see joseph have you never wondered why perhapswell of course he wasnt really the father was he the mans eyes closed jesus god he replied he seemed so struck that deborah hurried on i mean were taught to believe he wasnt the father but we dont know for certain how could we we werent there she didnt exactly keep a journal of her life were just told that the holy ghost came down with an angel or something andnaturally i dont know how it was supposed to be managed but it was a miracle wasnt it there she was a virgin one minute and pregnant the next and then in nine months there was this little baby and she was holding him probably not quite believing he was real and counting his fi ngers and toes he was hers really hers the baby shed longed fori mean if you believe in miracles if you do she hadnt realised that shed begun to cry until she saw the mans expression change then the sheer oddity of their situation made her want to laugh instead it was wildly absurd this psychic pain they were passing it between them like a tennis ball he dug a handkerchief out of a pocket of his overcoat and he pressed it crumpled into her hand please his voice was earnest its quite clean ive only used it once to wipe the rain from my face deborah laughed shakily she pressed the linen beneath her eyes and returned it to him thoughts link up like that dont they you dont expect them to you think youve quite protected yourself then all of a sudden youre saying something that seems so reasonable and safe on the surface but youre not safe at all are you from what youre trying not to feel he smiled the rest of him was tired and ageing lines at the eyes and flesh giving way beneath his chin but his smile was lovely its the same for me i came here merely for a place to walk and think that would be out of the rain and i stumbled on this drawing instead and thought of st joseph when you didnt want to no id been thinking of him anyway after a fashion he tucked his handkerchief back into his pocket and went on his tone becoming more determinedly light id have preferred a walk in the park actually i was heading to st jamess park when the rain began again i generally like to do my thinking out of doors im a countryman at heart and if ever therere thoughts to be had or decisions to be made i always try to get myself outside to think them or to make them a proper tramp in the air clears the head i find and the heart as well it makes the rights and wrongs of life the yess and the nos easier to see easier to see she said but not to deal with not for me at least i cant say yes just because people want me to no matter how right it may be to do so he directed his gaze back to the cartoon he rolled the museum plan tighter in his hands nor can i always he said which is why i head out for a tramp in the air i was set on feeding the sparrows from the bridge in st jamess watching them peck at my palm and letting every problem find its solution from there he shrugged and smiled sadly but then there was the rain so you came here and saw there was no st joseph he reached for his trilby and set it on his head the brim cast a triangular shadow on his face and you i imagine saw the infant yes deborah forced her lips into a brief tight smile she looked about her as if she too had belongings to gather in preparation for leaving tell me is it an infant you want or one that died or one youd like to be rid of be rid swiftly he lifted his hand one that you want he said im sorry i should have seen that i should have recognised the longing dear god in heaven why are men such fools he wants us to adopt i want my child his child a family thats real one that we create not one that we apply for hes brought the papers home theyre sitting on his desk all i have to do is fill out my part and sign my name but i find that i just cant do it it wouldnt be mine i tell him it wouldnt come from me it wouldnt come from us i couldnt love it the same way if it wasnt mine no he said thats very true you wouldnt love it the same way at all she grasped his arm the wool of his coat was damp and scratchy beneath her fi ngers you understand he doesnt he says therere connections that go beyond blood but they dont for me and i cant understand why they do for him perhaps its because he knows that we humans ultimately love something that we have to struggle for something that we give up everything to have far more than the things that fall our way through chance she released his arm her hand fell with a thud to the bench between them unwittingly the man had spoken simons own words her husband may as well have been in the room with her she wondered how she had come to unburden herself in the presence of a stranger im desperate for someone to take my part she thought looking for a champion to bear my standard i dont even care who that champion is just so long as he sees my point agrees and lets me go my own way i cant help how i feel she said hollowly my dear im not sure anyone can the man loosened his scarf and unbuttoned his coat reaching inside to his jacket pocket i should guess you need a tramp in the air to think your thoughts and clear your head he said but you need fresh air wide skies and broad vistas you cant find that in london if youve a mind to do your tramping in the north youve a welcome in lancashire he handed her his card robin sage it read the vicarage winslough the vic deborah looked up and saw what his coat and scarf had hidden before the white solid collar encircling his neck she should have realised at once from the colour of his clothes from his talk of st joseph from the very reverence with which hed regarded the da vinci cartoon no wonder shed found it so easy to reveal her troubles and her sorrows shed been confessing to an anglican priest december the snow brendan power spon round as the door creaked open and his younger brother hogarth entered the glacial cold of the vestry of st john the baptist church in the village of winslough beyond him the organist accompanied by a single tremulous and no doubt utterly uninvited voice was playing all ye who seek for sure relief as a followup to god moves in a mysterious way brendan had little doubt that both pieces constituted the organists sympathetic but unsolicited comment upon the mornings proceedings nothing hogarth said not a ginger not a git and no vicar to be found everyone on her sides in a real twist bren her mum was moaning about the wedding breakfast being ruined she was hissing about getting revenge on some rotten sow and her dads just left to hunt that little rat down quite the folks they are these townleyyoungs maybe youre off the hook bren tyrone his older brother and best man and by rights the only other person who should have been in the vestry aside from the vicar spoke with guarded hope as hogarth closed the door behind him no way hogarth said he reached in the jacket pocket of his hired morning coat that despite all efforts by the tailor failed to make his shoulders look like anything other than the sides of pendle hill incarnate he took out a packet of silk cuts and lit up flicking the match onto the cold stone fl oor she has him by the curlies she does ty make no mistake about it and let it be a lesson to you keep it in your trousers till its got a proper home brendan turned away they both loved him they both had their own way of offering consolation but neither hogarths joking nor tyrones optimism was going to change the reality of the day come hell or high water and between the two it was more likely to be hell he would be married to rebecca townleyyoung he tried not to think about it which is what hed been doing since shed fi rst dropped by his office in clitheroe with the results of her pregnancy test i dont know how it happened she said ive never had a regular period in my life my doctor even told me that id have to go on some sort of medication just to get myself regular if i ever wanted a family and nowlook where we are brendan look what you did to me was the underlying message as was and you brendan power a junior partner in daddys own solicitors fi rm tsk tsk what a shame it might be to be given the sack but she didnt need to say any of that all she needed to say head lowered penitently was brendan i simply dont know what im going to tell daddy what shall i do a man in any other position would have said just get rid of it rebecca and gone on with his work a different sort of man in brendans own position might have said the same thing but brendan was eighteen months away from st john andrew townleyyoungs decision as to which of the solicitors would handle his affairs and his fortune when the current senior partner retired from the fi rm and the perquisites that went with that decision were of the sort that brendan could not turn from lightly an introduction to society the promise of other clients from townleyyoungs class and stellar advancement in his career the opportunities promised by townleyyoungs patronage had prompted brendan to involve himself with the mans twentyeightyearold daughter in the first place hed been with the firm just short of a year he was eager to make his place in the world thus when through the senior partner st john andrew townleyyoung had extended an invitation to brendan to escort miss townleyyoung to the horse and pony sales of the cowper day fair it had seemed too much a stroke of good fortune for brendan to demur at the time the idea hadnt been repellent while it was true that even under the best of conditions after a good nights sleep and an hour and a half with her makeup and her hair curlers and her very best clothes rebecca still tended to resemble queen victoria in her declining years brendan had felt he could tolerate one or two mutual encounters with good grace and the guise of camaraderie he counted heavily on his ability to dissemble knowing that every decent lawyer had at least several drops of dissimulation in his blood what he did not count on was rebeccas ability to decide dominate and direct the course of their relationship from its very inception the second time he was with her she took him to bed and rode him like the master of the hunt with a fox in sight the third time he was with her she rubbed him fondled him skewered herself on him and came up pregnant he wanted to blame her but he couldnt avoid the fact that as she panted and bobbed and bounced against him with her odd skinny breasts hanging down in his face he had closed his eyes and smiled and called her godwhatawomanyouarebecky and all the time thought of his future career so they would indeed be married today not even the failure of the reverend mr sage to appear at the church was going to stop the tide of brendan powers future from fl ooding right in how late is he he asked hogarth his brother glanced at his watch its gone half an hour now no ones left the church hogarth shook his head but theres a whisper and a titter that youre the one whos failed to show ive been doing my part to save your reputation lad but you might want to pop your head into the chancel and give a bit of a wave to reassure the masses i cant say what thatll do to reassure your bride though whos this sow shes after are you already having a bit of stuff on the side not that id blame you getting it up for becky must be a real treat but you were always one for a challenge werent you stow it hogie tyrone said and put out the fag this is a church for gods sake brendan walked to the vestrys single window a lancet set deeply into the wall its panes were as dusty as was the room itself and he cleared a small patch to look out at the day what he saw was the graveyard its cluster of stones like malformed slate thumbprints against the snow and in the distance the looming slopes of cotes fell that rose coneshaped against a grey sky its snowing again absently he counted how many graves were topped by seasonal sprays of holly their red berries glistening against the spiked green leaves seven of them that he could see the greenery would have been brought this morning by wedding guests for even now the wreaths and sprays were only lightly sprinkled with snow he said the vicar must have gone out earlier this morning thats whats happened and hes caught somewhere tyrone joined him at the window behind them hogarth ground his cigarette into the floor brendan shivered despite the fact that the churchs heating system was busily grinding away the vestry was still unbearably cold he put his hand to the wall it felt icy and damp how are mum and dad doing he asked oh mums a bit nervous but as far as i can tell she still thinks its a match made in heaven her first child to get married and glorytogod hes hopping into the arms of the landed gentry if only the vicarll show his face but dads watching the door like hes had enough he hasnt been this far from liverpool in years tyrone noted hes just feeling nervous no hes feeling who he is brendan turned from the window and looked at his brothers they were mirrors of him and he knew it sloped shoulders beaked noses and everything else about them undecided hair that was neither brown nor blond eyes that were neither blue nor green jaws that were neither strong nor weak they were all of them perfectly cast for potential serial killers with faces that faded into a crowd and thats how the townleyyoungs reacted when theyd met the whole family as if theyd come face to face with their worst expectations and their most dreaded dreams it was no wonder to brendan that his father was watching the door and counting the moments till he could escape his sisters were probably feeling the same he even felt some envy for them an hour or two and it would be over for him it was a lifetime proposition cecily townleyyoung had accepted the role of her cousins chief bridesmaid because her father had instructed her to do so she hadnt wanted to be part of the wedding she hadnt even wanted to come to the wedding she and rebecca had never shared anything other than their relative positions as the daughters of sons on a scrawny family tree and as far as cecily was concerned things could have pretty much stayed that way she didnt like rebecca first she had nothing in common with her rebeccas idea of an afternoon of bliss was to crawl round four or five pony sales talking about withers and lifting rubbery equine lips to have a sharp look at those ghastly yellow teeth she carried apples and carrots like loose change in her pockets and she examined hooves scrotums and eyeballs with the sort of interest most women give to clothes second cecily was tired of rebecca twentytwo years of enduring birthdays easter christmas and new years on her uncles estate all in the name of a spurious family unity that absolutely no one felt had ground to gravel whatever affection she might have harboured for an older cousin a few exposures to rebeccas incomprehensible extremes of behaviour had kept cecily at a safe distance from her whenever they occupied the same house for more than a quarter of an hour and third she found her intolerably stupid rebecca had never boiled an egg written a cheque or made a bed her answer for every little problem in life was daddyll see to it just the sort of lazy parental dependence that cecily loathed even today daddy was seeing to it in fi nest form theyd done their part obediently waiting for the vicar in the icefloored snowspeckled north porch of the church stomping their feet with their lips turning blue while the guests rustled and murmured inside among the holly and the ivy wondering why the candles werent being lit and why the wedding march hadnt begun theyd waited for an entire quarter of an hour the snow making its own lazy bridal veils in the air before daddy had stormed across the street and pounded furiously on the vicarage door hed returned his usual ruddy skin gone white with rage in less than two minutes hes not even home st john andrew townleyyoung had snapped that mindless cowthis was his manner of identifying the vicars housekeeper cecily decidedsaid hed already gone out when she arrived this morning if you can believe it that incompetent foul little his hands formed fi sts in their dovecoloured gloves his top hat trembled get inside the church all of you get out of this weather ill handle the situation but brendans here isnt he rebecca had asked anxiously daddy brendans not missing as well we should be so lucky her father replied the whole familys here like rats who wont leave a sinking ship st john his wife murmured get inside but people will see me rebecca wailed theyll see the bride oh for christs sake rebecca townleyyoung disappeared into the church for another utterly freezing two minutes and came back with the announcement you can wait in the bell tower before he set off again to locate the vicar so at the base of the bell tower they were waiting still hidden from the wedding guests by a gate of walnut balusters that was covered by a dusty foulsmelling red velvet curtain whose nap was so worn that they could see the lights from the church chandeliers shining through they could hear the rising ripple of concern as it fl owed through the crowd they could hear the restless shuffling of feet hymnals opened and shut the organist played beneath their feet in the crypt of the church the heating system groaned like a mother giving birth at the thought cecily gazed speculatively at her cousin shed never believed rebecca would find any man fool enough to marry her while it was true that she stood to inherit a fortune and shed already been given that ghoulish monstrosity cotes hall in which to retire in connubial ecstasy once the ring was on her finger and the register was signed cecily couldnt imagine how the fortune itself no matter how great or the crumbling old victorian mansion no matter how distinct its potential for revival would have induced any man to take on a lifetime of dealing with rebecca but nowshe recalled her cousin just this morning in the loo the noise of her retching the sound of her shrill is it going to be like this every goddamned morning followed by her mothers soothing rebecca please weve guests in the house and then rebeccas i dont care about them i dont care about anything dont touch me let me out of here a door slammed running footsteps pounded along the upstairs passage preggers cecily wondered idly at the time as she carefully applied mascara and smoothed on some blusher she marvelled at the idea that a man might actually have taken rebecca to bed lord if that was the case anything was possible she examined her cousin for telltale signs of the truth rebecca didnt exactly look like a woman fulfi lled if she was supposed to blossom with pregnancy she was adrift somewhere in the prebudding stage somewhat given to jowls with eyes the size and shape of marbles and hair permed into a helmet on her head to her credit her skin was perfect and her mouth was rather nice but somehow nothing really worked together and rebecca always ended up looking as if her individual features were at war with each other it wasnt really her fault cecily thought one ought to have at least a titbit of sympathy for someone so illfavoured by looks but every time cecily tried to dig up one or two empathetic stirrings from her heart rebecca did something to quash them like bugs as she was doing now rebecca paced the tiny enclosure below the church bells furiously twisting her bouquet the fl oor was filthy but she did nothing to hold her dress or her train away from it her mother did this duty following her from point a to point b and back again like a faithful dog with satin and velvet clutched in her hands cecily stood to one side surrounded by two tin pails a coil of rope a shovel a broom and a pile of rags an old hoover leaned against a stack of cartons near her and she carefully hung her own bouquet from the metal hook that would otherwise have been used to accommodate its cord she lifted her velvet dress from the floor the air was fusty in the space beneath the bells and one couldnt move in any direction without touching something absolutely black with grime but at least it was warm i knew something like this would happen rebeccas hands strangled her bridal fl owers its not going to come off and theyre laughing at me arent they i can hear them laughing mrs townleyyoung made a quarter turn as rebecca did the same bunching more of the satin train and the bottom of the gown into her arms no ones laughing she said dont worry yourself darling theres simply been some sort of unfortunate mistake a misunderstanding your father will put things right straightaway how could there be a mistake we saw mr sage yesterday afternoon the last thing he said was see you in the morning and then he forgot he went off somewhere perhaps theres been an emergency someone could be dying someone wishing to see but brendan held back rebecca stopped pacing eyes narrowing she looked thoughtfully at the west wall of the bell tower as if she could see through it to the vicarage across the street id gone to the car and he said hed forgotten one last thing hed wanted to ask mr sage he went back he went inside i waited for a minute two or three and she whirled began her pacing again he wasnt talking to mr sage at all its that bitch that witch and shes behind this mother you know she is by god ill get her cecily found this an interesting twist in the mornings events it held out the tantalising promise of diversion if she had to endure this day somehow in the name of the family and with one eye fixed on her uncles will she decided she might as well do something to enjoy her act of sufferance so she said who mrs townleyyoung said cecily in a pleasant but determinedtodiscipline voice but cecilys question had been enough polly yarkin rebecca said the name through her teeth that miserable little sow at the vicarage vicars housekeeper cecily asked this was a twist to be explored at length another woman already all things considered she couldnt blame poor old brendan but she did think he might have set his sights a bit low she continued the game gosh whats she got to do with anything becky cecily dear mrs townleyyoungs voice had a less pleasant ring she pushes those dugs into every mans face and just waits for him to react to the sight rebecca said and he wants her he does he cant hide it from me brendan loves you darling mrs townleyyoung said hes marrying you he had a drink with her at crofters inn last week just a quick stop before he headed back to clitheroe he said he didnt even know shed be there he said he couldnt exactly pretend he didnt recognise her he said its a village after all he couldnt act like she was a stranger darling youre working yourself up over nothing at all you think hes in love with the vicars housekeeper cecily asked widening her eyes to wear the guise of naiveté but becky then why is he marrying you cecily her aunt hissed he isnt marrying me rebecca cried out he isnt marrying anyone we havent got a vicar beyond them a hush fell over the church the organ had stopped playing for a moment and rebeccas words seemed to echo from wall to wall the organist quickly resumed choosing crown with love lord this glad day mercy mrs townleyyoung breathed sharp footsteps sounded against the stone floor beyond them and a gloved hand shoved the red curtain aside rebeccas father ducked through the gate nowhere he slapped the snow from his coat and shook it from his hat not in the village not at the river not on the common nowhere ill have his job for this his wife reached out to him but didnt make contact st john good lord whatll we do all these people all that food at the house and rebeccas condi i know the bloody details i dont need reminding townleyyoung flipped the curtain to one side and gazed into the church were going to be the butt of every joke for the next decade he looked back at the women at his daughter particularly you got yourself into this rebecca and i damn well ought to let you get yourself out daddy she said his name as a wail really st john cecily decided this was the moment to be helpful her father would no doubt be rumbling down the aisle to join them at any time emotional disturbances were a special source of delectation to him and if that was the case her own purposes would best be served by demonstrating her ability to be at the forefront of solving a family crisis he was after all still temporising on her request to spend the spring in crete she said perhaps we ought to phone someone uncle st john there must be another vicar not far ive spoken to the constable townleyyoung said but he cant marry them st john his wife protested we need to get a vicar we need to have the wedding the foods waiting to be eaten the guests are getting hungry the i want sage he said i want him here i want him now and if i have to drag that low church twit up to the altar myself ill do it but if hes been called out somewhere mrs townleyyoung was clearly trying to sound like the voice of perfect reason he hasnt that yarkin creature caught me up in the village his bed hadnt been slept in last night she said but his cars in the garage so hes somewhere nearby and ive no doubt at all as to what hes been up to the vicar cecily asked achieving horror while feeling all the delight of an unfolding drama a shotgun wedding performed by a fornicating vicar featuring a reluctant bridegroom in love with the vicars housekeeper and a frothing bride hellbent on revenge it was almost worth having to be chief bridesmaid just to be in the know no uncle st john surely not the vicar heavens what a scandal her uncle glanced her way sharply he pointed a finger at her and was beginning to speak when the curtain was drawn to one side once more they turned as one to see the local constable his heavy jacket flaked with snow his tortoiseshell spectacles spotted with moisture he wasnt wearing a hat and his ginger hair wore a cap of white crystals he shook them off running a hand back over his head well townleyyoung demanded have you found him shepherd i have the other man replied but hes not going to be marrying anyone this morning january the frost chapter one what did that sign say did you see it simon it was some sort of placard at the edge of the road deborah st james slowed the car and looked back theyd already rounded a bend and the thick lattice of bare branches from the oaks and horse chestnuts hid both the road itself and the lichenous limestone wall that had been edging it where they were now the roadsides demarcation consisted of a skeletal hedge denuded by winter and blackened by twilight it wasnt a sign for the hotel was it did you see a drive her husband shook off the reverie in which hed spent much of the long drive from manchester airport halfadmiring the winter landscape of lancashire with its subdued blend of moorland russets and farmland sage halfbrooding over the possible identifi cation of the tool which had cut a thick electrical wire prior to its being used to bind together the hands and the feet of a female body found last week in surrey a drive he asked there might have been one i didnt notice but the sign was for palm reading and a psychic in residence youre joking im not is that a feature of the hotel youve not told me about not that i know she peered through the windscreen the road began to slope upwards and the lights from a village shimmered in the distance perhaps a mile farther on i suppose we havent gone far enough whats the place called crofters inn decidedly then the sign didnt say that it must be an advertisement for someones line of employment this is lancashire after all im surprised the hotel isnt called the cauldron we wouldnt have come had it been my love im becoming superstitious in my advancing years i see he smiled in the growing darkness her advancing years she was only twentyfi ve she had all the energy and the promise of her youth still she looked tired he knew she hadnt been sleeping well and her face was wan a few days in the country long walks and rest were what she needed shed been working too much in the past several months working more than he keeping late hours in the darkroom and going out far too early on assignments only marginally connected to her interests in the first place im trying to broaden my horizons she would say landscapes and portraits arent enough simon i need to do more im thinking of a multimedia approach perhaps a new show of my work in the summer i cant get it ready if i dont get out there and see whats what and try new things and stretch myself and make some more contacts and he didnt argue or try to hold her back he just waited for the crisis to pass theyd weathered several during the first two years of their marriage he always tried to remember that fact when he began to despair of their weathering this she pushed a tangle of coppery hair behind her ear put the car back into gear and said lets go on to the village then shall we unless youd like to have your palm read fi rst for my future you mean i think not thank you hed intended it as nothing from the false brightness of her reply he knew she hadnt taken it that way he said deborah she reached for his hand driving her eyes on the road she pressed his palm to her cheek her skin was cool it was soft like the dawn im sorry she said this is our time together dont let me mess it about but she didnt look at him more and more at tense moments she wasnt meeting his eyes it was as if she believed that the act of doing so would give him an advantage she did not want him to have while all the time he felt every single advantage between them was hers he let the moment pass he touched her hair he rested his hand on her thigh she drove on from the palm readers sign it was little over a mile into the small village of winslough which was built along the acclivity of a hill they passed the church fi rst a norman structure with crenellation on its tower and along its roofl ine and a bluefaced clock permanently displaying the time as three twentytwo then the primary school then a row of terraced houses facing an open fi eld at the peak of the hill in a y where the clitheroe road met the westeast junctions leading to lancaster or to yorkshire crofters inn sat deborah idled the car at the junction she wiped at some condensation on the windscreen squinted at the building and sighed well its not much to speak of is it i thoughti was hopingit sounded so romantic in the brochure its fi ne its from the fourteenth century its got a great hall where they used to hold a magistrates court the dining rooms got a timbered ceiling and the bar hasnt been changed in two hundred years the brochure even said that its fi ne but i wanted it to be deborah she finally looked at him the hotels not the point of our being here is it she looked back at the building in spite of his words she was seeing it through the lens of her camera weighing each area of composition how it was situated on its triangle of land how it was placed in the village how it was designed she did it as a secondnature response like breathing no she said at last although she sounded reluctant no its not the point i suppose she drove through a gate at the inns west end and stopped in the car park behind it like all the other structures in the village the building was a combination of the countys tan limestone and millstone grit even from behind aside from white woodwork and green window boxes that were filled with a motley array of winter pansies the inn bore no truly distinguishing features and no adornments its most significant distinction seemed to be an ominous portion of concaved slate roof that st james earnestly hoped wasnt over their room well deborah said again with some resignation st james leaned towards her turned her to face him and kissed her did i mention ive been wanting to see lancashire for years she smiled at that in your dreams she replied and got out of the car he opened the door feeling the cold damp air lap against him like water smelling woodsmoke and the peaty odours of wet earth and decomposing leaves he lifted out his braced bad leg and thumped it to the cobbles there was no snow on the ground but frost rimed the lawn of what would otherwise be a seasonal beer garden it was abandoned now but he could imagine it fi lled with summertime tourists who came to walk on the moors to climb the hills and to fish in the river that he could hear but not see coursing noisily some thirty yards away a path led towards it he could see this as well since its frosty fl agstones reflected the lights at the rear of the inn and although the inns property clearly did not include the river a boundary wall had an access gate built into it the gate was open and as he watched a young girl hurried through it stuffing a white plastic bag into the oversize anorak she was wearing this was neon orange and despite the girls considerable height it hung down to her knees and drew attention to her legs which were encased in enormous muddy green wellingtons she started when she saw deborah and st james but rather than hurry by them she marched right up and without ceremony or introduction grabbed the suitcase that st james had lifted from the boot of the car she peered inside and snatched up his crutches as well here you are she said as if shed been searching them out by the river bit late arent you didnt the register say youd be here by four i dont think i gave any time at all deborah replied in some confusion our plane didnt land until no matter the girl said youre here now arent you and theres plenty of time before dinner she glanced at the misty lower windows of the inn behind which an amorphous shape was moving under the distinctive bright lights of a kitchen a word to the wise is in order skip the beef bourguignon its the cooks name for stew come on this way she began lugging the suitcase towards a rear door with it in one hand and st james crutches under her arm she walked with a peculiar hobbling gait her wellingtons alternately squishing and slapping against the cobbles there seemed to be nothing to do but follow and st james and deborah did so trailing the girl across the car park up a set of back stairs and through the rear door of the inn this gave way to a corridor off of which opened a room whose door was marked with a handlettered sign saying residents lounge the girl thumped the suitcase onto the carpet and leaned the crutches against it with their tips pressing onto a faded axminster rose there she announced and brushed her hands together in an ivedonemypart gesture will you tell mum that josie was waiting for you outside josie thats me this last she said stabbing a thumb to her chest itd be a favour actually ill pay you back st james wondered how the girl watched them earnestly okay she said i can see what youre thinking to be honest shes had it with me if you know what i mean its nothing that i did i mean its lots of stupid stuff but mostly its my hair i mean it doesnt generally look like this except it will for a while i spose st james couldnt decide if she was talking about the style or the colour both of which were dreadful the former was an ostensible attempt at a wedge which seemed to have been rendered by someones nail scissors and someone elses electric razor it made her look remarkably like henry v as depicted in the national portrait gallery the latter was an unfortunate shade of salmon that did battle with the neon jacket she wore it suggested a dye job applied with more enthusiasm than expertise mousse she said apropos of nothing i beg your pardon mousse you know the stuff for your hair it was sposed to just give me red highlights but it didnt actually work she drove her hands into the pockets of her jacket i got just about everything going against me see try finding a fourth form bloke my height sometime so i thought if i made my hair look better id get some notice from a fifth or lower sixth bloke stupid i know you dont have to tell me mums been doing that for the last three days what am i gon to do with you josie josie thats me mum and mr wragg own the inn your hairs awful pretty by the way this last was addressed to deborah whom josie was inspecting with no little interest and youre tall as well but i expect youve stopped growing i think i have yes i havent the doctor says ill be over six feet a throwback to the vikings he says and he laughs and pats me on the shoulder like i ought to get the joke well what the h were the vikings doing in lancashire thats what i want to know and your mother no doubt wants to know what you were doing by the river st james noted josie looked fl ustered and waved her hands its not the river exactly and its nothing bad really and its only a favour just a mention of my name young girl met us in the car park mrs wragg tall bit gawky said her name was josie quite pleasant she was if youd drop it like that mum might unknot her knickers for a bit josephine a womans voice shouted somewhere in the inn josephine eugenia wragg josie winced i hate it when she does that it reminds me of school josephine eugene she looks like a bean she didnt actually but she was tall and she moved with the clumsiness of a young teenager who has suddenly become aware of her body before shes got used to it st james thought of his own sister at this very same age cursed by height by the aquiline features into which she hadnt yet grown and by a wretchedly androgynous name sidney she would introduce herself sardonically the last of the st james boys shed borne the brunt of her schoolmates teasing for years gravely he said thank you for waiting in the car park josie its always nice to be met when one gets where ones going the girls face lit ta oh ta she said and headed for the door through which theyd come ill pay you back youll see ive no doubt of that just go on through the pub someonell meet you there she waved them in the general direction of another door across the room ive got to get out of these wellies quick and with another querying look at them you wont mention the wellies will you theyre mr wraggs which went a long way to explain why shed been flopping about like a swimmer wearing flippers my lips are sealed st james said deborah the very same josie grinned in response and slipped through the door deborah picked up st james crutches and looked about at the lshaped room that served as the lounge its collection of overstuffed furniture was tatty and several lampshades were askew but a breakfront sideboard held an array of magazines for guests to peruse and a bookcase was crammed with a good fi fty volumes above pine wainscotting the wallpaper appeared recently hung poppies and roses twining together and the air bore the decided fragrance of potpourri she turned to st james he was smiling at her what she said just like home he replied someones at least she led the way into the pub they had arrived apparently during offhours for no one was present behind the mahogany bar or at any of the matching pubissue tables which beer mats dotted in small round splodges of orange and beige they dodged their way past these and their accompanying stools and chairs under a ceiling that was low its heavy timbers blackened by generations of smoke and decorated with a display of intricate horse brasses in the fi replace the remains of an afternoons blaze was still glowing giving an occasional snap as fi nal pockets of resin burst whered she get off to that blasted girl a woman was demanding she spoke from what was apparently an office its door stood open to the left of the bar immediately next to it a stairway rose with steps oddly slanted as if strained from bearing weight the woman came out yelled josephine up the stairs and then caught sight of st james and his wife like josie she started like josie she was tall and thin and her elbows were pointed like arrow heads she raised one selfconscious hand to her hair and removed a plastic barrette of pink rosebuds which held it haphazardly off her cheeks she lowered the other to the front of her skirt and brushed aimlessly at a snowfall of lint towels she said in apparent explanation of the latter activity she was supposed to fold them she didnt i had to that sums up life with a fourteenyearold girl i think we just met her st james said in the car park she was waiting for us deborah added cooperatively she helped us in with our things did she the womans eyes went from them to their suitcase you must be mr and mrs st james welcome weve given you skylight skylight the room its our best a bit cold im afraid at this time of year but weve put in an extra heater for you cold didnt really do justice to the condition of the room to which she led them two fl ights up at the very top of the hotel although the freestanding electric heater was ticking away sending out palpable streams of warmth the rooms three windows and two additional skylights acted like transmitters for the cold outside two feet in any direction from them one walked into a shield of ice mrs wragg drew the curtains dinners from half past seven till nine will you be wanting anything prior to that have you had your tea josie can pop up with a pot if you like nothing for me st james said deborah no mrs wragg nodded she rubbed her hands up the sides of her arms well she said she bent to pick a length of white thread from the carpet she wound it round her fi nger baths through that door mind your head though the lintels a bit low but then all of them are its the building its old you know the sort of thing yes of course she went to the chest of drawers between the two front windows and made minute adjustments to a cheval mirror and more adjustments to the lace doily beneath it she opened the clothes cupboard saying extra blankets here and she patted the chintz upholstery of the rooms only chair when it became apparent that there was nothing more to be done she said london arent you yes st james said we dont get lots here from london its quite a distance after all no its not that londoners head south dorset or cornwall everyone does she went to the wall behind the chair and fussed with one of two prints hanging there a copy of renoirs two girls at the piano mounted on a white mat going yellow at the edges theres not a lot likes the cold she added theres some truth in that northerners move to london as well chasing dreams i think like josie does did shei wonder did she ask about london st james glanced at his wife deborah had unlocked the suitcase and opened it on the bed but at the question she slowed what she was doing and stood a single feathery grey scarf in her hands no deborah said she didnt mention london mrs wragg nodded then flashed a quick smile well thats good isnt it because that girls got a mind for mischief when it comes to anything thatll take her from winslough she brushed her hands together and balled them at her waist and said so then youve come for country air and good walks and weve plenty of both on the moors through the fields up into the hills we had snow last month first time its snowed in these parts in ages but weve only frost now fools snow my mum called it makes things muddy but i expect youve brought your wellies we have good you ask my ben thats mr wragg wheres the best place to walk no one knows the lay of the land like my ben thank you deborah said well do that were looking forward to some walks and to seeing the vicar as well the vicar yes mr sage yes mrs wraggs right hand slithered from her waist to the collar of her blouse what is it deborah asked she and st james exchanged a glance mr sages still in the parish isnt he no hes mrs wragg pressed her fi ngers into her neck and completed her thought in a rush i suppose hes gone to cornwall himself like everyone else in a manner of speaking whats that st james asked its she gulped its where he was buried chapter two polly yarkin ran a damp cloth across the work top and folded it neatly at the edge of the sink it was a needless endeavour no one had used the vicars kitchen in the last four weeks and from the looks of things no one was likely to use it for several weeks more but she still came daily to the vicarage as she had been doing for the last six years seeing to things now just as she had seen to things for mr sage and his two youthful predecessors who had both given precisely three years to the village before moving on to grander vistas if there was such a creature as a grander vista in the c of e polly dried her hands on a chequered tea towel and hung this on its rack above the sink shed waxed the linoleum floor that morning and she was pleased to note that when she looked down she could see her refl ection on its pristine surface not a perfect refl ection naturally a fl oor isnt a mirror but she could see well enough the shadowy crinkles of carrot hair that escaped the tight binding of scarf at the back of her neck and she could see far too well her bodys silhouette slopeshouldered with the weight of her watermelon breasts her lower back ached as it always ached and her shoulders stung where the overfull bra pulled its dead weight against the straps she prised her index finger under one of these and winced as the resulting release of pressure from one shoulder only made the other feel that much worse youre so lucky poll her mates had cooed enviously as undeveloped girls lads go all woozy at the thought of you and her mother had said conceived in the circle blessed by the goddess in her typical cryptomaternal fashion and she swatted pollys bum the first and final time the girl had spoken about having surgery to reduce the burden dangling like lead from her chest she dug her fists into the small of her back and looked at the wall clock above the kitchen table it was half past six no one was going to come to the vicarage this late in the day there was no reason to linger there was no real reason at all in fact for pollys continued presence in mr sages home still she came each morning and stayed beyond dark she dusted cleaned and told the church wardens that it was important indeed it was crucial at this time of year to keep up the house for mr sages replacement and all the time that she worked she kept an eye watching for a movement from the vicars nearest neighbour shed been doing that daily since mr sages death when colin shepherd had fi rst come round with his constables pad and his constables questions sifting through mr sages belongings in his quiet knowing constables way hed only glance at her when she answered the door to him each morning hed say hullo polly and slide his eyes away hed go to the study or to the vicars bedroom or sometimes hed sit and sort through the post hed jot down notes and stare for long minutes at the vicars diary as if an examination of mr sages appointments somehow contained the key to his death talk to me colin she wanted to say when he was there make it like it was come back be my friend but she didnt say anything instead she offered tea and when he refused no thanks polly ill be off in a moment she returned to her work polishing mirrors washing the insides of windows scrubbing toilets fl oors basins and tubs till her hands were raw and the whole house glowed whenever she could she watched him cataloguing the details designed to make her lot lighter to bear got too square of a chin does colin his eyes are nice green but far too small wears his hair silly tries to comb it straight back and it always parts in the middle and then fl ops forward so it covers his brow hes always messing it about he is raking his fingers through it in place of a comb but the fingers generally stopped her dead and there the useless catalogue ended he had the most beautiful hands in the world because of those hands and the thought of them gliding their fingers across her skin shed always end up where she started from at first talk to me colin make it like it was he never did which was just as well for she didnt really want him to make it like it had been between them at all too soon for her liking the investigation ended colin shepherd village constable read out his findings in an untroubled voice at the coroners inquest shed gone because everyone in the village had done so filling up the space in the great hall at the inn but unlike everyone else shed gone only to see colin and to hear him speak death by misadventure the coroner announced accidental poisoning the case was closed but closing the case didnt put an end to the titillated whispers the innuendoes or the reality that in a village like winslough poisoning and accidental constituted a sure invitation to gossip and an indisputable contradiction in terms so polly had stayed in her place at the vicarage arriving at half past seven each morning expecting hoping day after day that the case would reopen and that colin would return wearily she dropped onto one of the kitchen chairs and eased her feet into the work boots shed left early that morning on the growing pile of newspapers no one had thought to cancel mr sages subscriptions yet shed been too caught up with thinking of colin to do so herself shed do it tomorrow she decided it would be a reason to return once more when she closed the front door she spent a few moments on the vicarage steps to loosen her hair from the scarf that bound it freed it crinkled like rusty steel wool round her face and the night breeze shifted it the length of her back she folded the scarf into a triangle making sure the words rita read me like a book in blackpool were hidden from view she put it over her head and knotted its ends beneath her chin thus restrained her hair scratched her cheeks and her neck she knew it couldnt possibly look attractive but at least it wouldnt fly about her head and catch in her mouth as she made the walk home besides stopping on the steps beneath the porch light which she always left burning once the sun went down gave her the opportunity for an unimpeded look at the house next door if the lights were on if his car was in the drive neither was the case as she trudged across the gravel and plunged into the road polly wondered what she would have done had colin shepherd actually been at home this evening knock on the door yes oh hullo what is it polly press her thumb against the bell is there something wrong cup her eyes to the windows are you needing the police walk direct in and start up talking and pray that colin would talk as well i dont understand what you want with me polly she buttoned her coat beneath her chin and blew grey steamy breath on her hands the temperature was falling it had to be less than five degrees thered be ice on the roads and sleet if it rained if he didnt drive careful coming round a curve hed lose control of the car perhaps shed come upon him shed be the only one near enough to help shed cradle his head in her lap and press her hand to his brow and brush his hair back and keep him warm colin hell be back to you polly mr sage had said just three nights before his death you stand firm and be here for him be ready to listen hes going to need you in his life perhaps sooner than you think but all of that was nothing more than christian mumbojumbo reflecting the most futile of church beliefs if one prayed long enough there was a god who listened who evaluated requests who stroked a long white beard looked thoughtful and said yesssss i see and fulfilled ones dreams it was a load of rubbish polly headed south out of the village walking on the verge of the clitheroe road the going was rough the path was muddy and clogged with dead leaves she could hear the squish of her footsteps over the wind that creaked above her in the trees across the street the church was dark there would be no evensong till they got a new vicar the church council had been interviewing for the past two weeks but there seemed to be a scarcity of priests who wanted to take up life in a country village no bright lights and no big city seemed to equate with no souls needing to be saved which was hardly the case there was plenty of scope for salvation in winslough mr sage had been quick to see that especially and perhaps most of all in polly herself for she was a long time long ago sinner skyclad in the cold of winter in the balmy nights of summer in the spring and fall she had cast the circle she had faced the altar north placing the candles at the circles four gates and using the water the salt and the herbs she created a holy magical cosmos from which she could pray all the elements were there the water the air the fire the earth the cord snaked round her thigh the wand felt strong and sure in her hand she used cloves for the incense and laurel for the wood and she gave herself heart and soul she declared to the rite of the sun for health and vitality praying for hope where the doctors had said there was none asking for healing when all they promised was morphine for the pain until death finally closed all lit by the candles and the burning laurels flame she had chanted the petition to those whose presence she had earnestly invoked annies health restored be god and goddess grant my plea and she had told herself convinced herself utterly that her every intention was wholesome and pure she prayed for annie her friend from childhood sweet annie shepherd darling colins own wife but only the spotless could call upon the goddess and expect response the magic of those who made the petition had to be pure impulsively polly traced her steps back to the church and entered the graveyard it was as black as the inside of the horned gods mouth but she needed no light to show her the way nor did she need it to read the stone anne alice shepherd and beneath it the dates and the words dearest wife there was nothing more and nothing fancy for more and fancy were not colins way oh annie polly said to the stone that stood in the even deeper shadows where the wall of the yard skirted round a thickbranched chestnut tree its come upon me threefold like the rede says it would but i swear to you annie i never meant you harm yet even as she swore the doubts were upon her like a plague of locusts they laid her conscience bare they exposed the worst of what she had been a woman who wanted someones husband for her own you did what you could polly mr sage had told her covering her hand with his own large mitt no one can truly pray away cancer one can pray that the doctors have the wisdom to help or that the patient develops the strength to endure or that the family learns to cope with the sorrow but the disease itselfno dear polly one cant pray away that the vicar had meant well but he didnt really know her he wasnt the sort who could comprehend her sins there was no absolution saying go in peace for what she had longed for in the foulest part of her heart now she paid the threefold price of having invited upon herself the wrath of the gods but it wasnt cancer that they sent to affl ict her it was a finer vengeance than hammurabi could ever have wrought id trade places with you annie polly whispered i would i would polly a low disembodied whisper in return she jumped back from the grave her hand at her mouth a rush of blood beat against her eyes polly is that you footsteps crunched just beyond the wall gumboots snapping on the icy dead leaves that lay on the ground she saw him then a shadow among shadows she smelled the pipe smoke that clung to his clothes brendan she didnt need to wait for confirmation what little light there was shone itself on brendan powers beak of a nose no one else in winslough had a profile to match it whatre you doing out here he seemed to read in the question an implicit and unintended invitation he vaulted the wall she stepped away he approached her eagerly she could see he held his pipe in his hand ive been out to the hall he tapped the pipebowl against annies gravestone dislodging burnt tobacco like ebony freckles on the frozen skin of the grave he appeared to realise the impropriety of what he had done in the very next instant because he said oh damn sorry and he squatted and brushed the tobacco away he stood buried the pipe in his pocket and shuffled his feet i was walking back to the village on the footpath i saw someone in the graveyard and i he lowered his head and seemed to be studying the barely discernible tops of his black gumboots i hoped it was you polly hows your wife she asked he raised his head the renovation at the halls been tampered with again a bathroom tap left on some carpets got ruined rebeccas worked herself into a state understandable isnt it polly said she wants a home of her own it cant be easy living at her mum and dads with a baby on the way no he said its not easy for anyone polly at the warmth of his tone she looked away in the distant direction of cotes hall where for the last four months a team of decorators and craftsmen had been pounding away at the longabandoned victorian structure attempting to ready it for brendan and his wife i cant think why he doesnt arrange for a night watchman he wont be bullied into a watchman he says hes got mrs spence right on the grounds hes paying her to be there and by god she ought to be bloody enough or so he says and does she worked at saying the name and betraying nothing as she said it does missus spence never hear any mischief being made not from her cottage its too far behind the hall she says and when she makes rounds no ones ever there ah they were silent brendan shifted his weight icy soil crackled beneath him a gust of night wind soughed through the chestnuts branches and blew at the back of pollys hair where the scarf couldnt manage to hold it in place polly she heard both the urgency and the plea in his voice shed seen them before on his face when he asked to join her at her table in the pub appearing as if with preternatural knowledge of her movements each time she went to crofters inn for a drink now as on those other occasions she felt her stomach knot and her limbs grow cold she knew what he wanted it was no different from what everyone wanted rescue escape a secret to cling to a halfformed dream what did it matter to him if she was hurt in the process on what account book was ever written the payment exacted for damage to a soul youre married brendan she wanted to say in a tone that combined both patience and compassion even if i loved you which i dont you know youve got a wife go on home to her now climb into bed and make love to rebecca you were willing enough to do that at one time but she was cursed with being a woman not naturally given to either rejection or cruelty so instead she said only ill be off now brendan my mums waiting supper and she headed out the way she had come she heard him following he said ill walk with you you shouldnt be out here alone its too far she said and youve just come that way havent you but on the footpath he said with an assurance suggesting he believed his answer was the height of logic across the meadow over the walls i didnt walk along the road he matched his steps to hers ive got a torch he added pulling it out of his pocket you shouldnt be walking at night without a torch its only a mile brendan i can cope with that so can i she sighed she wanted to explain that he couldnt simply take a walk with her in the dark people would see them theyd misunderstand but she knew in advance how he would respond to her explanation theyll just think im walking to the hall hed answer i go out there every day what an innocent he was how imperfect was his understanding of village life it would matter little to anyone who saw them that polly and her mother had lived twenty years in the gabled lodge at the mouth of the drive that led to cotes hall no one would stop to think of that or to think that brendan was checking on the halls renovation in anticipation of moving there with his bride assignation by night the villagers would label it rebecca would hear of it thered be hell to pay not that brendan wasnt paying already polly had little doubt of that shed seen enough of rebecca townleyyoung throughout their lives to know that marriage to her under the best of conditions would not be a particularly nurturing affair so among other things she felt sorry for brendan which is why she allowed him to join her at crofters inn in the evening which is why she now just kept walking along the verge with her eyes fastened on the steady bright beam from brendans torch she didnt attempt to make conversation she had a fairly good idea where any conversation with brendan power would ultimately lead a quarter of a mile along she slipped on a stone and brendan took her arm careful he said she could feel the back of his fi ngers pressing against her breast with each of her footsteps the fingers rose and fell acting the part of distant cousin to caress she shrugged hoping to disengage his hand his grip grew fi rmer it was craigie stockwell brendan said diffidently into the growing silence between them she drew her eyebrows together craigie what the carpet at the hall craigie stockwell from london its a ruin now the drain in the basin was plugged with a rag friday night i should guess it looked as if the water had run all weekend and no one knew wed gone down to manchester doesnt anyone go inside when the workmen arent there check thingsre in order mrs spence you mean he shook his head she generally just checks the windows and doors but isnt she supposed to be shes a caretaker not a security guard and i imagine shes nervous out there alone without a man i mean its a lonely spot but shed frightened off intruders at least once polly knew shed heard the shotgun herself and then a few minutes later came the thudding of two or three frantic shouting runners and the gunning of a motorbike afterwards the word went out to the village after that people didnt mess juliet spence about polly shivered the wind was rising it blew in brief frigid gusts through the bare hawthorn hedge that bordered the road it promised a heavier frost in the morning youre cold brendan said no youre shivering polly here he put his arm round her and drew her snugly next to him better isnt it she didnt reply we walk together at the same pace dont we have you noticed that but if you put your arm round my waist its even easier going brendan you havent been to the pub this week why she didnt respond she moved her shoulders his grip remained fi rm polly have you been up cotes fell she felt the cold on her cheeks it insinuated itself like tentacles down her neck ah she thought here it comes at last because hed seen her there one evening last autumn hed heard her petition he knew the worst but he went on easily i find i like hiking more and more every week ive been out to the reservoir three times you know ive done a long tramp through the trough of bowland and another near claughton up beacon fell the air smells so fresh have you noticed that when you reach the top but then i suppose youre too busy to do much walking now hell say it she thought now comes the price ill have to pay him to hold his tongue with all the men in your life the allusion was a puzzle he shot her a glance there must be men lots id guess thats probably why youve not been in the pub busy arent you dating i mean someone special no doubt someone special without consideration polly gave a weary chuckle there is someone isnt there a woman like you i mean i cant imagine a bloke who wouldnt given half a chance i would youre terrific anyone can see that he switched off the torch and put it in his pocket freed his other hand grasped her arm you look so good polly he said and bent closer you smell good you feel good chap doesnt see that needs his head examined his steps slowed then stopped there was reason for this she told herself they had reached the drive at one side of which sat the lodge where she lived but then he turned her to him polly he said urgently he caressed her cheek i feel so much for you i know youve seen it wont you please let me a cars headlamps caught them like rabbits in its beam not coming along the clitheroe road but bumping and jolting along the lane that led beyond the lodge up to cotes hall and just like rabbits they froze in position brendans one hand on pollys cheek his other on her arm there could be no real mistaking his intentions brendan polly said he dropped his hands and put a careful two feet between them but it was too late the car came upon them slowly then slowed even more it was an old green land rover mudspattered and grimy but its windscreen and windows were perfectly clean polly turned her head away from the sight of it not so much because she didnt want to be seen and gossipped over she knew that nothing would spare her that but so she wouldnt have to see the driver or the woman next to him with her blunt greying hair and her angular face and polly could see it all so vividly without even trying with her arm stretched out so that the tips of her fi ngers rested on the back of the drivers neck touching and twining through that slickedback undisciplined ginger hair colin shepherd and missus spence were having another lovely evening together the gods were reminding polly yarkin of her sins damn the air and the wind polly thought there was no justice no matter what she did it came out wrong she slammed the door behind her and drove her fist into it once polly that you luvdoll she heard the roll of her mothers heavy footsteps trundling across the sitting room floor the sound of wheezing accompanied this as did the clink and clatter of jewellery chains necklaces gold doubloons and anything else her mother saw fit to deck herself out with when she made her wintertime morning toilette me rita polly answered who else i dunno luv some goodlooking chappie with a sausage to share got to keep yourself open to the unexpected ats my motto that is rita laughed and wheezed her scent preceded her like an olfactory harbinger giorgio she sprayed it on by the tablespoon she came to the door of the sitting room and filled it so large a woman that she ballooned out in a shapeless mass from her neck to her knees she leaned against the jamb working hard to catch her breath the entry light glistened against the necklaces on her massive chest it cast a grotesque ritashadow on the wall and made a fleshy beard of one of her chins polly squatted to unlace her boots they were thicksoled with mud a fact that did not escape her mother where you been luvdoll rita jinglejangled one of her necklaces an affair of large cat heads fashioned in brass you go for a hike roads muddy polly said with a grunt as she forced off one boot and worked on the other their laces were sodden and her fi ngers were stiff wintertime you forget what its like wish i could i do her mother said so hows things in the metropolis today she pronounced it metropohlis deliberately it was part of her persona she wore a guise of spurious ignorance while in the village an extension of the general style she adopted when she came home for her winters in winslough spring autumn and summer she was rita rularski reader of tarot thrown stones and palms from her shopfront in blackpool she foresaw the future expounded on the past and made sense of the troubled fractious present for anyone willing to part with the cash residents tourists holidaymakers curious housewives fine ladies looking for a giggle and a thrill rita saw them all with equal aplomb dressed in a kaftan big enough to fit an elephant with a bright scarf covering her grizzled brambles of hair but in winter she became rita yarkin again back in winslough for a threemonth stay with her only child she put her handpainted sign on the verge of the road and waited for custom which seldom developed she read magazines and watched the telly she ate like a docker and painted her nails polly glanced at these curiously purple today with a tiny strip of gold crossing each one diagonally they clashed with her kaftan it was pumpkin orange but they were a decided improvement over yesterdays yellow you tiff with someone this evenin luvdoll rita asked you got an aura shrivelled to nothing you do that ant good is it here lemme take a look at your face its nothing polly made herself busier than she needed to be she banged her boots against the inside of the woodbox next to the door she took off her scarf and folded it neatly into a square she put this square in the pocket of her coat and then brushed the coat itself with the flat of her hand removing both speckles of lint and nonexistent splatters of mud her mother wasnt to be easily sidetracked she pushed her huge mass from the doorjamb she waddled to polly and turned her round she peered at her face with her hand palmopen and an inch away she traced the shape of pollys head and her shoulders i see she pursed her lips and dropped her arm with a sigh stars and earth girl stop being such a fool polly stepped to one side and headed for the stairs i need my slippers she said ill be down in a minute i can smell supper have you done goulash like you said listen here pol mr c shepherd ant so special rita said he got nothing to offer a woman like you do you not see that yet rita its living that counts living you hear you got life and knowledge like blood in your veins you got gifts beyond anything i ever had or seen use them damn it all dont throw them away gods above if i had half what you have id own the world stop climbing those stairs and listen to me girl she slammed her hand down on the banister polly felt the stairs tremble she turned blowing out a gust of resigned breath it was only the three months of winter that she and her mother were together but in the last six years day tended to drag upon day as rita used every excuse she could find to examine the manner in which polly was living her life that was him went by in the car just now wasnt it rita asked mr c shepherd his precious self with her wasnt he from up at the hall thats what youre feeling the pain of now isnt it its nothing polly said and there youve got it right its nothing hes nothing wheres the sorrow in that but he wasnt nothing to polly he never had been how could she explain this to her mother whose only experience of love had ended abruptly when her husband left winslough on the rainy morning of pollys seventh birthday headed to manchester to get something special for my extraspecial little girl and never came home deserted was not a word rita yarkin ever used to describe what had happened to her and her only child blessed she called it if he didnt have the sense to know what kind of women he was walking out on they were both better off without the ugly toad rita had always seen her life in those terms every difficulty trial or misfortune could be easily redefined as a blessing in disguise disappointments were wordless messages from the goddess rejections were merely indications that the most desired pathway was not the best for long ago rita yarkin had given herself heart mind and body into the safekeeping of the craft of the wise polly admired her for such trust and devotion she only wished she could feel the same im not like you rita you are rita said youre more like me than me in the first place when did you last cast the circle not since ive been home surely i have done yes since then two or three times her mother raised one sceptical linedrawn eyebrow youre the discreet one arent you where you been casting up cotes fell you know that rita and the rite polly felt prickly heat on the back of her neck shed have chosen not to answer but her mothers power was becoming stronger every time she made a reply she could feel it quite distinctly now as if it were oozing from ritas fingers slithering up the banister and through pollys palm venus she said miserably and tore her eyes from ritas face she waited for the mockery it did not come instead rita took her hand from the banister and studied her daughter thoughtfully venus she said this int about making love potions polly i know that then but its still about love you dont want me to feel it i know that mum but its there all the same and i cant make it go away just because youd have me i love him dont you think id stop it if only i could dont you think i pray to feel nothing for himor at least to feel for him nothing moren what he feels for me dyou think i choose to be tortured like this i think we all choose our tortures rita lumbered to an ancient rosewood canterbury made lopsided by the absence of two of its wheels it leaned against one of the walls in the entry beneath the stairs and with a grunt to rock her weight to one side rita bent as much as her legs would allow and wrestled open its single drawer she brought out two rectangles of wood here she said take em without question or protest polly took the wood she could smell its unmistakable odour sharp but pleasant a permeative scent cedar she said correct said rita burn it to mars pray for strength girl leave love to those who dont have your gifts chapter three mrs wragg left them immediately after making her announcement about the vicar to deborahs dismayed but what happened how on earth did he die she said guardedly i couldnt quite say a friend of his are you no of course they hadnt been friends theyd only shared a few minutes conversation in the national gallery on a rainy blowing november day still the memory of robin sages kindness and his anxious concern made deborah feel leaden struck by a mixture of surprise and dismay when she was told he was dead im sorry my love st james said when mrs wragg closed the door upon her own departure deborah could see the worry darkening his eyes and she knew he was reading her thoughts as only a man who had known her all her life could have possibly read them he didnt go on to say what she knew he wanted to say it isnt you deborah you havent deaths touch no matter what you thinkinstead he held her they finally descended the stairs between the bar and the office at half past seven the pub was apparently in the process of serving its regular evening crowd farmers leaned against the bar engaged in conversation housewives gathered at tables enjoying an evening out two ageing couples compared walking sticks while six noisy teenagers joked loudly in a corner and smoked cigarettes from the midst of this latter group among which accompanied by the ribald comments of their mates one couple necked heavily with an occasional pause from the girl to nip at a flask and from the boy to drag deeply on a cigarette josie wragg emerged shed changed for the evening into what appeared to be a work uniform but part of her black skirts hem was falling out and her red bow tie was hopelessly askew dribbling a long unravelling string down the prairie expanse of her chest she ducked behind the bar where she scooped up two menus and she said formally with a wary eye in the direction of the balding man who pulled the pubs taps with the sort of authority that suggested he had to be mr wragg the proprietor good evening sir madam youve settled in good perfectly st james replied then i expect youll want to have a look at these she handed the menus over with a lowvoiced but mind you dont forget what i said about the beef they skirted past the farmers one of whom was shaking a monitory fi st redfaced and talking about telling him thas a public footpathpublic you hear me and wound their way through the tables to the fi replace where flames were rapidly working on a coneshaped pile of silver birch they met curious glances as they crossed the room tourists were unusual in lancashire at this time of year but to their pleasant good evening the men nodded brusquely in wordless greeting and the women bobbed their heads and while the teenagers remained in their far corner of the pub happily oblivious of everyone but themselves it seemed less groupegocentricity than it was interest in the continuing entertainment provided by the blonde fl asknipper and her companion who was at this moment busy snaking his hand under the bright yellow sweat shirt she wore the material undulated as his fist rose like a mobile third breast deborah sat on a bench beneath a faded and decidedly unpointillistic needlepoint rendering of a sunday afternoon on the grand jatte st james took the stool opposite her they ordered sherry and whisky and when josie brought the drinks to their table she positioned her body to block the young entwined lovers from their view sorry about that she said with a wrinkle of her nose as she placed the sherry in front of deborah and adjusted it just so she did the same with the whisky pam rice that is playing tart for the night dont ask me why shes not a bad sort just when she gets with todd hes seventeen this last was offered as if the boys age explained all but perhaps thinking it might not have done josie continued thirteen pam that is fourteen next month and thirtyfive sometime next year no doubt st james noted drily josie squinted over her shoulder at the young couple despite her previous look of disdain her bony chest rose tremulously yes well and then she turned back to them with what seemed like effort whatll you have then besides the beef the salmons quite good sos the duck and the vealsthe pubs outer door opened letting in a gust of cold air that puffed round their ankles like moving silkcooked with tomatoes and mushrooms and weve got a sole tonight done with capers and josies recitation faltered as behind her the hubbub from the crofters inn patrons dissolved with remarkable speed into silence a man and woman stood just inside the door where an overhead light shone down upon the contrast they made first hair his roughly the colour of ginger hers salt and pepper thick straight and bluntly cut to touch her shoulders then face his youthful and handsome but with a pugnacious prominence to the jaw and chin hers strong and forceful untouched by makeup to hide middle age and clothes his a barbour jacket and trousers hers a worn navy pea jacket and faded blue jeans with a patch on one knee for a moment they remained side by side in the entry the mans hand resting on the womans arm he wore tortoiseshell spectacles whose lenses caught the light and effectively hid his eyes and his reaction to the hush that greeted his entrance she however looked round slowly making deliberate contact with every face that had the courage to hold her gaze capers andand josie appeared to have forgotten the rest of her prepared recitation she poked the pencil into her hair and scratched it against her scalp from behind the bar mr wragg spoke as he scooped the froth off a glass of guinness evening to you constable evening missus spence cold night int it were in for a bad snap you ask me you frank fowler another stout at last one of the farmers turned from the door others began to do the same wouldnt say no ben frank fowler replied and knuckled his glass across the bar ben pulled on the tap someone said billy you got some fags on you a chair scraped against the floor like an animals howl the double ring of the telephone sounded from the office slowly the pub returned to normal the constable went to the bar where he said black bush and a lemonade ben while mrs spence found a table set apart from the others she walked to it without hurry quite a tall woman with her head held up and her shoulders straight but instead of sitting on the bench against the wall she chose a stool that presented her back to the room she removed her jacket she was wearing an ivory wool turtleneck beneath it hows things constable ben wragg asked your dad get settled into the pensioners home yet the constable counted out some coins and laid them on the bar last week he said quite a man your dad was in his day colin quite a copper the constable pushed the money towards wragg he said yes quite we all had years to get to know that didnt we and he picked up the glasses and went to join his companion he sat on the bench so his face was to the room he looked from the bar to the tables one at a time and one at a time people looked away but the conversation in the pub was hushed so much so that the sound of banging pots in the kitchen was quite distinct after a moment one of the farmers said guess thatll be it for the evening ben and another said got to pop round to see my old gran a third merely tossed a fi vepound note on the bar and waited for his change within minutes of the arrival of the constable and mrs spence most of the other patrons of crofters inn had vanished leaving behind one lone man in tweeds who swirled his gin glass and slumped against the wall and the group of teenagers who moved to a fruit machine at the far end of the pub and began to try their luck with its spinning dials josie had stood by the table during all of this her lips parted and her eyes wide it was only ben wraggs barking josephine be about it that brought her back to her explanation of dinner even then all she managed was whatllfor dinner but before they had a chance to make their selections she went on with the dining rooms just this way if youll follow me she led them through a low door next to the fireplace where the temperature dropped a good ten degrees and the predominant scent was of baking bread rather than the pubs cigarette smoke and ale she put them next to a simmering wall heater and said youll have the place all to yourselves this evening no one else is staying here tonight ill just pop into the kitchen and tell them what youve whereupon she finally seemed to realise that she had nothing at all to tell anyone she chewed her lip sorry she said im not thinking right youve not even ordered is something wrong deborah asked wrong the pencil went back into her hair lead first this time and twirling as if she were drawing a design on her scalp is there some sort of problem problem is someone in trouble trouble st james put an end to the game of echo i dont think ive ever seen a local constable clear out a public house so quickly without time being called of course oh no josie said its not mr shepherd i meanits not actuallyits just that thingsve happened round here and you know how it is in a village andgosh praps i ought to take your order mr wragg gets himself in a real fret if i chunter too much with the residents they havent come to winslough to have their ears gnawed off by the likes of you miss josephine thats what he says mr wragg you know is it the woman with the constable deborah asked josie flicked a look towards a swinging door that appeared to give access to the kitchen i really oughtnt talk perfectly understandable st james said and consulted his menu stuffed mushrooms to start and the sole for me and for you deborah but deborah felt reluctant to be put off she decided that if josie was hesitant to talk about one subject a switch to another might loosen her tongue josie she said can you tell us anything about the vicar mr sage josies head flew up from her writing pad howd you know what she flung her arm in the direction of the pub out there howd you know we dont know anything except that hes dead wed come to winslough in part to see him can you tell us what happened was his death unexpected had he been ill no josie dropped her eyes to her writing pad and gave all her concentration to the writing of stuffed mushrooms and sole not exactly ill not for long that is a sudden illness then sudden yes right a heart condition a stroke something like that somethingquick it was he went off quick an infection a virus josie looked pained clearly torn between holding her tongue and spilling her guts she fiddled her pencil across her pad he wasnt murdered was he st james asked no the girl gasped it wasnt like that at all it was an accident really honest and true she didnt meanshe couldnt havei mean i know her we all do she didnt mean him any harm who st james asked josies eyes went towards the door its that woman deborah said its mrs spence isnt it it wasnt murder josie cried she offered them the story in bits and pieces between serving the dinner pouring the wine bringing the cheese board and presenting the coffee food poisoning she told them december last the story came in gulps fits and starts with frequent glances in the direction of the kitchen apparently to make sure no one would catch her in the midst of telling the tale mr sage had been making his rounds of the parish visiting each family for afternoon tea or an evening meal eating his way towards righteousness and glory according to mr wragg but you got to ignore him if you know what i mean because he never goes to church less its christmas or a funeral and he went to mrs spence on a friday night it was just the two of them because mrs spences daughter shes my best mate maggie was spending the evening with josie right here mrs spence had always made it clear to anyone who asked that she didnt think much of going to church as a general rule despite its being the sole dependable social event in the village but she wasnt one to be rude to a vicar so when mr sage wanted to try to talk her into giving the c of e another chance in her life she was willing to listen she was always polite that was her way so the vicar went out to her cottage for the evening prayer book in hand all ready to bring her back to religion he was supposed to be at a wedding the next morning tying up that skinny cat becca townleyyoung and brendan powerhim thats out there in the bar drinking gin did you see him but he never showed up and thats how everyone found out he was dead dead and stiff with his lips all bloody and his jaws locked up like they was wired shut that certainly sounds like an odd bit of food poisoning st james remarked doubtfully because if foods gone bad it wasnt that kind of food poisoning josie informed them with a pause to scratch her bottom through her threadbare skirt it was real food poisoning you mean poison in the food deborah asked the poison was the food wild parsnip picked down by the pond near cotes hall only it wasnt wild parsnip like missus spence thought not at all not at all oh no deborah said as the circumstances of the vicars death began to take on more clarity how dreadful what a terrible thing it was water hemlock josie said in breathless summation like what socrates drunk with his tea in greece she thought it was parsnip did missus spence and so did the vicar and he ate it and she grabbed her throat and made appropriate death noises after which she glanced round furtively only dont tell mum i did like that will you shell tan me if she knows i made light of his dying its sort of a black joke mongst the blokes in the village seecuteanow and seeyoudead inaminute seewhat deborah asked cicuta st james said the latin name for its genus cicuta maculata cicuta virosa the species depends on the habitat he frowned and absently toyed with the knife that he had used to cut a wedge of double gloucester pressing its point into a fragment of the cheese that was left on his plate but instead of seeing it for some reason he found himself teasing a memory from the edge of his subconscious professor ian rutherford at the university of glasgow who insisted upon wearing surgical garb even to lectures whose bywords had been ycant take a scunner to a corpse lads and lassies where the hell had he come from st james wondered swirling like a scots banshee out of the past he never showed up for the wedding next morning josie was continuing affably mr townleyyoungs still got himself in a twist over that it took till half past two to get another vicar and the wedding breakfast was a total ruin moren half the guests had already left the church some people think it was brendans doingcause it was a forced marriage and no one can imagine any bloke facing a lifetime of marriage to becca townleyyoung without trying to do something desperate to stop it but then thats making light of things again and if mum knows im doing it ill be in real trouble she liked mr sage did mum and you i liked him as well everyone did cept for mr townleyyoung he said the vicar was too low church by half because mr sage wouldnt use incense and he wouldnt tart himself up in satin n lace but theres more important stuffn that in being a proper vicar if you ask me and mr sage saw to the important stuff st james halflistened to the girl prattle on she was pouring coffee and presenting them with a decorative porcelain plate upon which lay six petit fours with remarkable and gastronomically questionable rainbow icings the vicar was a great one for visiting in the village josie explained he started a youth groupshe was social chair and vicepresident by the way and he looked in on the housebound and he tried to get people to come back to church he knew everyone in the village by name on tuesday afternoons he read to the children in the primary school he answered his own front door when he was home he didnt put on airs i met him briefly in london deborah said he did seem quite nice he was truly and thats why when missus spence comes round things get a bit difficult josie leaned over their table and made an adjustment to the paper doily under the petit fours centring it carefully on the plate the plate itself she pushed closer to the tables small tasselshaded lamp the better to highlight the confections icing i mean its not like just anyone made the mistake is it crimminycrimeny its not like mum did it but surely no matter who made the mistake that person would have spent some time being looked on with a leery eye deborah noted especially as mr sage was wellliked isnt like that josie said in quick reply shes a herbalist is missus spence after all so she should have bloody well known what she was digging out of the ground before she put it on the flaming table thats what people say at least in the pub you know they chew on the story and they wont let it go doesnt matter to them what the inquest said a herbalist who didnt recognise hemlock deborah asked thats whats got them in a dither all right st james listened silently tilting the fragment of double gloucester with his knife gazing at the craterlike surface of the cheese unbidden ian rutherford returned lining up on the worktable specimen jars which he removed from a trolley with a connoisseurs care while all the time the smell of formaldehyde that emanated from him like a ghoulish perfume put a premature end to anyones thoughts of lunch on to primary symptoms my luvlies he was announcing gaily as he produced each jar with a fl ourish burning pain in th gullet excessive salivation nausea next giddiness before the convulsions begin these are spasmodic rendering the musculature rigid vomitions precluded by convulsive closure of the mouth he gave a satisfied rap on the metallic lid of one of the jars in which appeared to be floating a human lung death in fi fteen minutes or up to eight hours asphyxia heart failure complete respiratory shutdown another rap on the lid questions no good enough of cicutoxin on to curare primary symptoms but st james was having symptoms of his own and he felt them even as josie chattered on disquiet at first a distinct unease now heres a case in point rutherford was saying but the point he was making and the nature of the case were elusive as eels st james set down his knife and reached for one of the petit fours josie beamed her apparent approval of his choice iced them myself she said i think the pinkandgreen ones look best what sort of herbalist he asked her missus spence yes the doctoring sort she picks stuff in the forest and up on the hills and she mixes it good and mashes it up for fevers and cramps head colds and stuff maggie missus spences her mum and shes my best mate and shes ever so nice shes never even been to a doctor fars i know she gets a sore her mum whips up a plaster she gets a fever her mum makes some tea she made me a throat wash from creeping jenny when i was out to the hall on a visit thats where they live up by cotes hall and i gargled for a day and the soreness was gone so she knows her plants josies head bobbed thats why when mr sage died it looked real bad how could she not know peopleve wondered i mean i wouldnt know wild parsnip from hay but missus spence her voice drifted off and she held out her hands in a whatsabodytothink sort of gesture but surely the inquest dealt with all that deborah said oh yes right above stairs in the magistrates court have you seen it yet pop in for a look before you go to bed who gave evidence st james asked the answer promised a renewal of disquiet and he was fairly certain what that answer would be other than mrs spence herself constable the man who was with her tonight him mr shepherd thats right he found mr sage the body i guess on the footpath that goes to cotes hall and the fell on saturday morning did he conduct the investigation alone fars i know hes our constable isnt he st james saw his wife turning to him curiously one of her hands raising to finger a twisted curl of her hair she said nothing but she understood him well enough to realise where his thoughts were heading it was he thought none of their business theyd come to this village for a holiday away from london and away from their home there would be no professional or domestic distractions to prevent the dialogue in which they needed to engage yet it wasnt that easy to walk away from the two dozen scientific and procedural questions that were second nature to him and shouting to be answered it was even less easy to walk away from the persistent monologue of ian rutherford even now it was playing like a nagging nameless melody inside his skull yve got to hae the thickened portion of the plant m luvlies very characteristic this little beauty stem and root stem is thickened as y will note and not one but several roots are attached when we cut into the surface of the stem like so we have oursels the very scent of raw parsnip now to reviewwho shll do the honours and under eyebrows that looked like wild plants themselves rutherfords blue eyes would dart round the laboratory always on the lookout for the hapless student who appeared to have assimilated the least information he had a special gift for recognising both confusion and ennui and whoever was experiencing either reaction to rutherfords presentation was most likely to be called upon to review the material at the lectures end mr allcourtst james enlighten us please or do we ask too much of you this fair morning st james heard the words as if he still stood in that room in glasgow all of twentyone years old and thinking not of organic toxins but of the young woman hed fi nally taken to bed on his last visit home his reverie disturbed he made a valiant attempt at bluffi ng his way through a response to the professors request cicuta virosa he said and he cleared his throat in an effort to buy time toxic principle cicutoxin acting directly on the central nervous system a violent convulsant andthe rest was a mystery and mr st james and and alas his thoughts were too fi rmly attached to the bedroom he remembered nothing more but here in lancashire more than fi fteen years later josephine eugenia wragg gave the answer she always kept roots in the cellar potatoes and carrots and parsnips and everything each in their separate bin so a whisper went round that if she didnt feed it to the vicar on purpose someone mightve snuck in and mixed the hemlock with the other parsnips and just waited till it was cooked and eaten but she said at the inquest that couldnt have happened cause the cellar was always locked up tight so then everyone said all right well accept that thats the case but then she should have known it wasnt wild parsnip in the first place cause of course she should have known because of the root and that had been ian rutherfords main point that was what hed been waiting impatiently for his daydreaming negligent student to say ye dont have a prayer in science my lad yes well they would see about that chapter four there it was that noise again it sounded like hesitant foot steps treading on gravel at fi rst she had thought it was coming from the courtyard and although she knew it wasnt proper to be relieved at the idea her fears were at least moderately soothed by the fact that whoever it was creeping round in the dark he seemed to be heading in the direction not of the caretakers cottage but of cotes hall and it had to be a he maggie spence decided prowling about old buildings at night wasnt the sort of behaviour a she would engage in maggie knew she ought to be on the alert considering everything that had gone on at the hall over the past few months considering especially the ruination of that fancypants carpet only last weekend being on the alert was after all the only thing aside from her school prep that mummy had asked her to do prior to leaving with mr shepherd this evening ill only be gone a few hours darling mummy had said if you hear anything dont go outside just phone all right which is by rights what maggie knew she ought to do now after all she had the numbers they were downstairs next to the telephone in the kitchen mr shepherds home crofters inn and the townleyyoungs just in case she had looked them over as mummy left wanting to say in mock innocence but youre just going to the inn arent you mummy so whyve you given me mr shepherds number as well but she knew the answer to that question already and if she asked it would only have been to embarrass the both of them sometimes though she wanted to embarrass them she wanted to shout march twentythird i know what happened i know thats when you did it i even know where i even know how but she never did even if she hadnt seen them in the sitting room together having arrived home too early after a tiff in the village with josie and pam and even if she hadnt slipped away from the window with her legs gone all peculiar at the sight of mummy and what shed been doing and even if she hadnt gone to sit and think about it all on the weedchoked terrace of cotes hall with punkin curled in a mangy ball of tabbyorange at her feet she still would have known it was pretty obvious with mr shepherd looking at mummy ever since with his eyes all bleary and his mouth gone soft and mummy being careful as careful not to look at him theyre doing it josie wragg had whispered breathlessly and you actually in reality without a doubt in the world saw them doing it naked and stuff in the sitting room maggie she lit a gauloise and lay back on her bed all the windows were open to remove the smoke so that her mummy wouldnt know what she was getting up to but maggie couldnt see how all the breeze in the world could come close to eliminating the foul odour produced by the french cigarettes that josie favoured she placed her own between her lips and filled her mouth with smoke she blew it out she hadnt mastered the inhaling part yet and wasnt sure she wanted to they didnt have all their clothes off she said mummy didnt at least i mean she wasnt actually undressed at all she didnt really need to be didnt need then what were they doing josie demanded oh god josephine pam rice yawned she tossed her head of perfectly bobbed blond hair and it fell as it always did perfectly in place develop a clue in life wont you what dyou think they were doing i thought you were supposed to be the expert round here josie frowned but i dont see howi mean if she had all her clothes on pam raised her eyes to the ceiling in a display of martyred patience she drew in deeply on her cigarette and exhaled and inhaled in something she called frenching it was in her mouth she said mouth do i have to draw you a picture or do you get it now in her josie looked flustered she touched her fingertips to her tongue as if doing so would allow her to understand more completely you mean his thing was actually his thing god its called a penis josie penis all right pam rolled onto her stomach and gazed with narrowed eyes at the glowing tip of her cigarette all i can say is i hope she got something which she probably didnt if she was wearing all her clothes again a toss of that perfect head of hair todd knows better than to finish it off before ive come and thats a fact josies forehead creased she was obviously still trying to come to terms with the information always presenting herself as the living authority on female sexuality courtesy of a dogeared copy of the female sexual animal unleashed at home vol i which shed pinched from the rubbish bin where her mother had deposited it after at the insistence of her husband she had spent two months attempting to become lidibinous or something like that she was out of her depth with this one were they she seemed to struggle for a word were they moving or anything maggie christ in dirty knickers pam said dont you know anything no one needs to move she just needs to suck to josie mashed out her cigarette on the windowsill maggies mum with a bloke thats disgusting pam chuckled languidly no its unleashed right and proper if you ask me didnt your book get round to mentioning that jo or was it all about dipping your tits in clotted cream and serving them up with the strawberries at tea you know the sort of thing make life for your man a constant surprise theres nothing wrong with a woman becoming attuned to her sensual nature josie replied with some dignity she lowered her head and picked at a scab on her knee or to a mans for that matter yes too right a real woman ought to know what gives who a tickle and where dont you think so maggie pam used her unnerving ability to make her eyes look at once both purely innocent and bluer than blue dont you think its important maggie crossed her legs indian fashion and gave a pinch to the heel of her hand it was the way she reminded herself to admit to nothing she knew what information pam wanted from her she could see that josie knew it as well but shed never sneaked on a soul in her life and she wasnt about to sneak on herself josie came to the rescue did you say anything after you saw them i mean she hadnt not then at least and when she finally brought it up as a shrill accusation hurled half in anger and half in selfdefence mummy had reacted by slapping her face not once but twice and as hard as she could one second afterwards and maybe it was seeing the expression of surprise and shock on maggies face because mummy had never hit her in her life shed cried out like shed been struck herself grabbed maggie to her and hugged her so fiercely maggie felt her breath leave but still they hadnt talked about any of it its my business maggie mummy had said fi rmly fine maggie thought and my business is mine but it wasnt really mummy wouldnt let it be she had brought the sludgy tea to maggies bedroom every morning for a fortnight after their row she had stood and made sure maggie drank every drop to her protestations she said i know whats best to her whimpers when the pain cramped through her stomach she said it will pass maggie and she wiped her brow with a cool soft cloth maggie studied the inky shadows in her bedroom and listened again concentrating in order to discern the sound of footsteps from the wind jostling an old plastic bottle against the gravel outside she hadnt turned on any of the lights upstairs and she crept to the window and peered out into the night feeling secure in the knowledge that she could see without being seen below her in the courtyard shadows from the east wing of cotes hall made great caves of dark cast from the mansions gables they loomed like open pits and offered more than ample protection for anyone wishing to hide himself she squinted at them one by one trying to distinguish whether a hulking form against a far wall was only a yew bush in need of clipping or a prowler trying the window she couldnt tell she wished mummy and mr shepherd would return shed never minded being left alone in the past but early on after their arrival in lancashire shed developed a dislike of staying in the cottage by herself either day or night perhaps it was babystuff to feel that way but the minute mummy drove off with mr shepherd the minute she slipped into the opel to go off on her own or headed in the direction of the footpath or went into the oak wood on a search for plants maggie felt the walls start inching close about her she was uniquely aware of being by herself on the grounds of cotes hall and while polly yarkin lived just at the far end of the drive it was nearly a mile away and no matter how she screamed and shouted if she ever needed pollys help for any reason she wouldnt hear it didnt matter to maggie that she knew where mummy kept her pistol even if she had used it before for target practice which she never had she couldnt imagine actually pointing it at anyone let alone pulling the trigger so instead when she was by herself she burrowed into her bedroom like a mole if it was night she kept the lights off and waited for the sound of a returning car or of mummys key scraping in the locked front door and while she waited she listened to punkins soft feline snores rising like steady puffs of auditory smoke from the centre of her bed with her vision fixed on the small birch bookcase atop of which lumpy old bozo the elephant presided among the other stuffed animals with comforting grace she clutched her scrapbook to her chest she thought about her father he existed in fantasy eddie spence dead before he was thirty his body twisted along with the wreckage of his racing car in monte carlo he was the hero of an untold story mummy had hinted at a single time saying daddy died in a car crash darling and please maggie i cant speak of it to anyone with her eyes filled with tears when maggie tried to ask more maggie often tried to conjure up his face from her memory but she failed in the effort so what there was of daddy she held in her arms the pictures of formulaone race cars she clipped and collected placing them into her important events book along with careful notations about every grand prix she plopped onto the bed and punkin stirred he raised his head yawned and then pricked his ears they turned like radar in the direction of the window and he rose in a single lissome movement and leapt silently from the bed to the sill there he hunkered his tail making restless tapping movements as it circled round his front paws from the bed maggie watched him surveying the courtyard much as she had done his eyes blinking slowly as his tail continued to tap in silence she knew from studying up on the subject in his kittendays that cats are hypersensitive to changes in the environment so she rested more easily in the knowledge that punkin would tell her the very moment there was anything outside that she ought to fear an old lime tree stood just beyond the window and its branches creaked maggie listened hard twigs scratched in vibrato against the glass something rasped on the old trees furrowed bark it was only the wind maggie told herself but even as she thought this punkin gave the signal that something wasnt right he rose with an arching back maggies heart thumped jerkily punkin launched himself from the windowsill and landed on the rag rug he was through the door in a streak of orange locomotion before maggie had time to realise that someone must have climbed the tree and then it was too late she heard the soft thud of a body landing on the slate roof of the cottage the quiet tread of footsteps followed then came the sound of gentle rapping on the glass this last made no sense as far as she knew housebreakers didnt announce themselves unless of course they were trying to see if anyone was at home but even then it seemed more sensible to think that theyd just knock on the door or ring the front bell and wait for an answer she wanted to shout youve got the wrong place whoever you are you want the hall dont you but instead she lowered her scrapbook to the floor next to the bed and slid along the wall into the deeper shadows her palms felt itchy her stomach rolled she wanted more than anything to call out for her mummy but that would be of less than no use a moment later she was glad of the fact maggie are you there she heard him call softly open up will you im freezing my bum off nick maggie dashed across the room she could see him crouched on the slope of roof just outside the dormer window grinning at her his silky black hair brushing against his cheeks like soft birds wings she fumbled with the lock nick nick she thought but just as she was about to fling up the sash she heard mummy saying i dont want you alone with nick ware again is that clear margaret jane no more of that its over her fi ngers failed her maggie nick whispered let me in its cold shed given her word mummy had been driven close to tears during their row and the sight of her eyes redrimmed and full over maggies behaviour and maggies stinging words had wrung the promise from her without a thought of what it would really mean to give it i cant she said what nick mummy isnt home shes gone into the village with mr shepherd i promised her he was grinning more widely great excellent come on mag let me in she swallowed past a raw spot in her throat i cant i cant see you alone i promised why becausenick you know his hand was against the window glass and he dropped it to his side but i just wanted to show youoh what the hell what nothing forget it never mind nick tell me he turned his head away he wore his hair bobbed overlong on the top the way the rest of the boys did but it never looked trendy on him it looked right as if hed been the styles inventor nick just a letter he said it doesnt matter forget it a letter from who it isnt important but if youve come all this way then she remembered nick youve not heard from lester piggott is that it has he answered your letter it was hard to believe but nick wrote to jockeys as a matter of course always adding to his collection of letters hed heard from pat eddery graham starkey eddie hide but lester piggott was a plum to be sure she flung up the sash the cold wind gusted like a cloud into the room is that it she asked from his ancient leather jacket long claimed to be a gift to his greatuncle from an american bombardier during world war ii nick took an envelope it isnt much he said just nice to hear from you lad but he signed it real clear no one thought hed answer remember mag i wanted you to know it seemed meanspirited to leave him outside when hed come on such an innocent errand even mummy couldnt object to this maggie said come in not if itll make trouble with your mum its all right he squeezed his lanky frame through the window and made a deliberate point of not closing it behind him i thought youd gone to bed i was looking in the windows i thought you were a prowler whynt you turn on the lights she dropped her eyes i get scared alone she took the envelope from him and admired the address mr nick ware esq skelshaw farm was written clearly in a firm bold hand she returned it to nick im glad he wrote back i thought he would i remembered thats why i wanted you to see he flipped his hair off his face and looked round the room maggie watched in dread hed be noticing all the stuffed animals and her dolls sitting upright in the wicker chair hed go to the bookshelves and see the railway children along with the other favourite titles from her childhood hed realise what a baby she was he wouldnt want to take her about then would he he probably wouldnt want to know her at all why hadnt she thought before letting him in he said ive never been in your bedroom before its real nice mag she felt dread dissolve she smiled ta dimple he said and touched his index finger to the small depression in her cheek i like it when you smile tentatively he dropped his hand to her arm she could feel his cold fingers even through her pullover youre ice she said cold outside she was acutely aware of being in the dark in forbidden territory the room seemed smaller with him standing in it and she knew the proper thing to do was to take him downstairs and let him out by the door except that now he was here she didnt want him to go not without giving her some kind of sign that he was still hers in spite of everything that had happened in their lives since last october it wasnt enough to know that he liked it when she smiled and he could touch the dimple in her cheek people liked babies smiles they said so all the time she wasnt a baby whens your mum coming home he asked any minute was the truth it was after nine but if she told the truth hed be gone in an instant perhaps hed do it for her sake to keep her from trouble but hed do it all the same so she said i dont know she went off with mr shepherd nick knew about mummy and mr shepherd so he knew what that meant the rest was up to him she made a move to close the window but his hand was still on her arm so it was easy enough for him to stop her he wasnt rough he didnt need to be he merely kissed her flicking his tongue like a promise against her lips and she welcomed him shell be a while then his mouth moved to her neck he gave her the shivers shes been getting hers regular enough her conscience told her to defend her mummy from nicks interpretation of the village gossip but the shivers were running along her arms and her legs each time he kissed her and they kept her from thinking as straight as shed like still she was in the process of gathering her wits to make a firm reply when his hand moved to her breast and his fingers began to play with her nipple he rolled it gently back and forth until she gasped with the hurt and the tingling heat and he relinquished the pressure and started the process all over again it felt so good it felt beyond good she knew she ought to talk about mummy she ought to explain but she couldnt seem to hold on to that thought for longer than the instant in which nicks fingers released her once they began to tease her again she could think only of the fact that she didnt want to risk any discussion standing in the way of the sign that things were right between them so she finally said from somewhere outside of herself weve got an understanding now my mum and i and she felt him smiling against her mouth he was a clever boy nick he probably didnt believe her for a moment missed you he whispered and pulled her tight to him god mag give me some hard she knew what he wanted she wanted to do it she wanted to feel it through his blue jeans again going rigid and big because of her she pressed her hand against it he moved her fingers up and down and around jesus he whispered jesus mag he slid her fingers along its length to the tip he circled them round it he felt heavy against her she squeezed it gently then harder when he groaned maggie he said mag his breathing was loud he tugged her pullover off she felt the night wind against her skin and then she felt only his hands on her breasts and then only his mouth as he kissed them she was liquid she was fl oating the fi ngers on his blue jeans werent even hers she wasnt the one easing down the zip she wasnt the one making him naked he said wait mag if your mum comes home she stopped him with her kiss she groped blindly for the sweet full weight of him and he helped her fingers stroke down and round his globes of flesh he groaned his hands went under her skirt his fingers rubbed hot circles between her legs and then they were on the bed together nicks body a pale sapling above her her own body ready hips lifted legs spread nothing else mattered tell me when to stop he said maggie all right we wont do it this time just tell me when to stop he put it against her he rubbed it against her the tip of it the length of it tell me when to stop just once more just this once it couldnt be such a horrible sin she pulled him closer wanting him near maggie mag dont you think we ought to stop she pressed it closer and closer with her hand mag really i cant hold off she lifted her mouth to kiss him if your mum comes home slowly deeply she rotated her hips maggie we cant he plunged it inside scrubber she thought scrubber slut tart she lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling her vision blurred as tears slid from her eyes forking across her temples and down into her ears im nothing she thought im a slut im a tart ill do it with anyone right now its only nick but if some other bloke wants to stick it in me tomorrow ill probably let him im a scrubber a tart she sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the bed she looked across the room bozo the elephant wore his usual expression of pachydermatous bemusement but there seemed to be something else in his face tonight disappointment no doubt shed let bozo down but that was nothing compared to what shed done to herself she eased off the bed and onto the fl oor where she knelt feeling the ridges of the worn rag rug pressing into her knees she clasped her hands together in the attitude of prayer and tried to think of the words that would lead to forgiveness im sorry she whispered i didnt mean it to happen god i just thought to myself if only hell kiss me then ill know thingsre still right between us no matter what i promised mummy except when he kisses me that way i dont want him to stop and then he does other things and i want him to do them and then i want more i dont want it to end and i know its wrong i know it i do but i cant help how i feel im sorry god im sorry dont let bad come out of this please it wont happen again i wont let him im sorry but how many times could god forgive when she knew it was wrong and he knew she knew it and she did it anyway because she wanted nick close one couldnt make endless bargains with god without him wondering about the nature of the deal he was striking she was going to pay for her sins in a very big way and it was only a matter of time before god decided that an accounting was due god doesnt work that way my dear he doesnt keep score hes capable of endless acts of forgiveness this is why hes our supreme being the standard after which we model ourselves we cant hope to reach his level of perfection of course and he doesnt expect us to he merely asks that we keep trying to better ourselves to learn from our mistakes and to understand others how simple mr sage had made it all sound when hed come upon her in the church that evening last october shed been kneeling in the second pew in front of the rood screen with her forehead resting on her two clenched fists her prayer had been much the same as tonights only it had been the fi rst time then on a mound of paintstiffened wrinkled tarpaulins in a corner of the cotes hall scullery with nick easing her clothes off easing her to the floor easing easing easing her ready we wont actually do it hed said just like tonight tell me when to stop mag and he kept repeating tell me when to stop maggie tell me tell me while his mouth covered hers and his fingers worked magic between her legs and she pressed and pressed herself against his hand she wanted heat and closeness she needed to be held she longed to be part of something more than herself he was the living promise of all she desired there in the scullery she merely had to accept it was the aftermath that she hadnt expected that moment when all the nice girls donts came rushing through her conscience like noahs flood boys dont respect girls whothey tell all their matesjust say no you can do thatwho steals my pursethey only want one thing they only think of one thing do you want a diseasewhat if he gets you pregnant do you think hell be so hot for you thenyouve given in once youve crossed a line with him hell be after you now again and againhe doesnt love you if he did he wouldnt and so she had come to st john the baptists for evensong shed halflistened to the reading shed halfheard the hymns mostly shed looked at the intricate rood screen and the altar beyond it there the ten commandments etched into looming individual bronze tablets comprised the reredos and she found her attention helplessly riveted on commandment number seven it was harvest festival the altar steps were spread with an array of offerings sheaves of corn marrows of yellow and green new potatoes in baskets and several bushels of beans fi lled the church air with the fertile scent of autumn but maggie was only imperfectly aware of this as she was only imperfectly aware of the prayers being said and the organ being played the light from the main chandelier in the chancel seemed to glitter directly onto the bronze reredos and the word adultery quivered in her vision it seemed to grow larger seemed to point and accuse she tried to tell herself that committing adultery meant that at least one of the parties had to be in possession of wedding vows to break but she knew that an entire school of loathsome behaviours rested beneath the awning of that single word and she was guilty of most of them impure thoughts about nick infernal desire sexual fantasies and now fornication the worst sin of all she was black and corrupt headed straight for damnation if only she could recoil from her behaviour writhing in disgust over the act itself or how it made her feel god might forgive her if only the act had made her feel unclean he might overlook this one small lapse if only she didnt want it and nick and the indescribable warmth of their bodies connection all over again now right here in the church sin sin sin she lowered her head to her fists and kept it there oblivious of the rest of the service she began to pray making fervent supplications for gods forgiveness with her eyes squeezed shut so tight she saw stars im sorry im sorry im sorry she whispered dont let bad happen to me i wont do it again i promise i promise im sorry it was the only prayer that she could devise and she repeated it mindlessly caught up in her need for direct communication with the supernatural she heard nothing of the vicars approach and she didnt even know the service was over and the church empty until she felt a hand curving firmly round her shoulder she looked up with a cry all of the chandeliers had been extinguished the only light remaining came in a greenish glow from an altar lamp it touched one side of the vicars face and cast long crescent shadows from the bags beneath his eyes he is forgiveness itself the vicar said quietly his voice was soothing just like a warm bath never doubt that he exists to forgive the serenity of his tone and the kindness of his words brought tears to her eyes not this she said i dont see how he can his hand squeezed her shoulder then dropped he joined her in the pew sitting not kneeling and she slid back onto the bench herself he indicated the rood atop its screen if the lords last words were forgive them father and if his father did indeed forgive which we may be assured that he did then why wouldnt he forgive you as well whatever your sin may be my dear it cannot equal the evil of putting to death the son of god can it no she whispered although she had begun to cry but i knew it was wrong and i did it anyway because i wanted to do it he fished a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her thats the nature of sin we face a temptation we have a choice to make we choose unwisely you arent alone in this but if youre resolved in your heart not to sin again then god forgives seventy times seven you may rely upon that possessing resolution in her heart was the problem she wanted to promise she wanted as much to believe in her promise unfortunately she wanted nick more thats just it she said and she told the vicar everything mummy knows she finished plaiting his handkerchief back and forth through her fi ngers mummys so angry the vicar dropped his head and seemed to be examining the faded needlework fl eurdelis on the kneeler how old are you my dear thirteen she said he sighed dear god more tears rose in her eyes she blotted them away and hiccupped as she spoke im bad i know it i know it so does god no it isnt that he covered her hand briefly its the rush to adulthood that disturbs me its taking on such troubles when youre still so young its not a trouble to me he smiled gently no i love him he loves me and thats generally where the trouble starts isnt it youre making fun she said stiffl y im speaking the truth he moved his gaze from her to the altar his hands were on his knees and maggie saw his fingers tense as he gripped them more firmly your name is maggie spence ive not seen you in church before tonight have i no wemummy isnt taken much with going to church i see still he held the grip on his knees well youve come upon one of mankinds biggest challenges at a fairly young age maggie spence how to cope with the sins of the flesh even before the time of our lord the ancient greeks recommended moderation in everything they knew you see the sort of consequences one faces through giving in to ones appetites she frowned confused he caught the look and went on with sex is an appetite as well maggie something like hunger it begins with mild curiosity rather than a rumble in the stomach to be sure but it quickly becomes a demanding taste and unfortunately it isnt like overeating or intoxication from drink both of which provide a rather immediate physical discomfort that can later act as a reminder of the fruits of impetuous indulgence instead it provides a sense of wellbeing and release one that we come to wish to experience again and again like a drug she asked very much like a drug and just like many drugs its harmful properties arent immediately apparent even if we know what they are intellectually the promise of pleasure is often too seductive for us to abstain when we should thats when we must turn to the lord we must ask him to infuse us with the strength to resist he faced his own temptations you know he understands what it is to be human mummy doesnt talk about god maggie said she talks about aids and herpes and warts and getting pregnant she thinks i wont do it if im scared enough youre being harsh on her my dear these are far from unrealistic concerns on her part cruel facts are associated with sexuality these days your mother is wise and kind to share them with you oh too right but what about her because when she and mr shepherd her automatic protest died unfinished no matter her feelings she couldnt betray mummy to the vicar that wouldnt be right the vicar cocked his head but made no other indication that he understood in what direction maggies words had been heading pregnancy and disease are the longterm potential consequences we face when we submit ourselves to the pleasures of sex he said but unfortunately when were in the midst of an encounter leading up to intercourse we rarely think of anything save the moments exigency sorry the need to do it at once he lifted the fleurdelis kneeler from its hook on the back of the pew in front of him and placed it on the uneven stone floor instead we think in terms of it couldnt i wont and it cant out of our desire for physical gratification comes the denial of possibility i wont become pregnant he couldnt give me a disease because i believe he doesnt have one and it is from these little acts of denial that our deepest sorrow ultimately springs he knelt and gestured that she was to join him lord he said quietly eyes on the altar help us to see your will in all things when we are sorely tried and tempted allow us to realise it is through your love that we are so tested when we stumble and sin forgive us our wrongs and give us the strength to avoid all occasion of sin in the future amen maggie whispered through the thick fall of her hair she felt the vicars hand rest lightly on the back of her neck a comradely expression that imparted the fi rst real peace shed had in days can you resolve to sin no more maggie spence i want to then i absolve you in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit he walked out with her into the night the lights were on in the vicarage across the street and maggie could see polly yarkin in the kitchen setting the vicars table for dinner of course the vicar was saying as if in continuation of a previous thought absolution and resolve are one thing the others more diffi cult not doing it again and keeping yourself active in other areas of your life so the temptations not there he locked the church door and pocketed the key in his trousers although the night was quite cool he wasnt wearing an overcoat and his clerical collar gleamed in the moonlight like a cheshire smile he observed her thoughtfully pulling on his chin im starting a youth group here in the parish perhaps youd like to join us therell be meetings and activities things to keep you busy it might be a good idea all things considered id like to exceptwere not members of the church actually mummy and i and i cant think that shed let me join religion she says religion leaves a bad taste in the mouth maggie dropped her head when she revealed this last it seemed particularly unfair considering the vicars kindness to her she went on to add in a rush i dont feel that way myself at least i dont think i do its just that i dont know much about it in the first place i meanive hardly ever been to church that is i see his mouth turned down and he fished in his jacket pocket to bring out a small white card which he handed to her tell your mummy id like to visit with her he said my names on the card my number as well perhaps i can make her feel more comfortable with the church or at least pave the way for you to join us he walked out of the churchyard at her side and touched her shoulder in farewell the youth group seemed like something mummy would agree to once she got over her disapproval of its being tied to the church but when maggie pressed the vicars card upon her mummy had stared down at it for the longest time and when she looked up her face was pasty and her mouth looked queer you went to someone else her expression said as clearly as if shed spoken you didnt trust your mummy maggie tried to soothe her feelings as well as avoid the unspoken accusation by hurriedly saying josie knows mr sage mummy pam rice does as well josie says hes only been in the parish for three weeks now and hes trying to get people back to the church josie says the youth group is nick ware a member i dont know i didnt ask dont lie to me margaret im not i just thoughtthe vicar wants to talk to you about it he wants you to phone mummy walked to the rubbish basket ripped the card in half and buried it with a savage little twist of her wrist among the coffee grounds and grapefruit rinds i have no intention of speaking to a priest about anything maggie mummy he only this discussion is over but despite mummys refusal to phone him mr sage had come three times to the cottage winslough was a small village after all and discovering where the spence family lived was as easy as asking in crofters inn when hed shown up unexpectedly one afternoon doffing his trilby to maggie as she opened the door mummy had been alone in the greenhouse repotting some herbs shed greeted maggies nervous announcement of the vicars visit by saying tersely go to the inn ill phone when you can come home and the anger in her voice and the hardness of her face told maggie it was wiser not to ask any questions she had long known mummy didnt like religion but it was just like trying to gather the facts about her father she didnt know why then mr sage died just like daddy maggie thought and he liked me just like daddy i know he did i do now in her bedroom maggie found she had run out of words to send to heaven she was a sinner a slut a tart a scrubber she was the vilest creature god ever put on earth she got to her feet and rubbed her knees where they were red and sore from the rugs digging into them wearily she wandered to the bathroom and rustled through the cupboard to find what mummy kept hidden there what happens is this josie had explained confidentially when theyd come upon the odd plastic container with its even odder spout deeply buried among the towels after they have sex the woman fills this bottle thing with oil and vinegar then she sort of sticks this nozzle part up inside and pumps it real hard and then she wont have a baby but shell smell like a tossed salad pam rice put in i dont think youve got your facts straight jo i most certainly do miss pamela knowitall right maggie examined the bottle she shuddered at the thought her knees weakened a bit but she would have to do it she carried it downstairs and into the kitchen where she set it on the work top and took down the oil and vinegar josie hadnt said how much to use half and half most likely she uncapped the vinegar and began to pour the kitchen door opened mummy walked in chapter five there was nothing to say so maggie kept pouring keeping her eyes on the vinegar as its level rose when it reached halfway she recapped the bottle and unstoppered the oil her mother spoke what in gods name are you doing margaret nothing she said it seemed obvious enough the vinegar the oil the plastic bottle with its detachable elongated spout lying next to it what else could she be doing but preparing to rid her body of all the internal traces of a man and who else would that man be but nick ware juliet spence shut the door behind her with a snick of the lock at the sound punkin appeared from the darkness of the sitting room and glided across the kitchen to rub against her legs he mewled softly the cat wants feeding i forgot maggie said how did you forget what were you doing maggie didnt reply she poured the oil into the bottle watching it bob and swirl in graceful amber orbs as it met the vinegar answer me margaret maggie heard her mothers handbag drop onto one of the kitchen chairs her heavy pea jacket followed then came the sharp plit plot of her boots as she crossed the room never had maggie been more aware of the advantage her mother had in height than when juliet spence joined her at the work top she seemed to tower above her like an angel of vengeance one false move and the sword would fall what exactly are you planning to do with that concoction juliet asked her voice sounded careful the way someone spoke just before he was sick use it for nothing im glad of it why because if youre developing a bent towards feminine hygiene youre going to have quite a mess on your hands if you douche with oil and i take it that we are talking about hygiene margaret theres nothing else behind this im sure aside of course from a curious and rather sudden compulsion to be certain your private parts are fresh and clean maggie studiously set the oil on the work top next to the vinegar she stared at the undulating mixture shed made i saw nick ware pedalling his bicycle along the clitheroe road on my way home her mother went on her words were coming faster now each one sounding as if her teeth clipped it off i dont particularly want to think what that combined with this fascinating experiment youre apparently conducting in emulsification might actually mean maggie touched her index finger to the plastic bottle she observed her hand like the rest of her it was small dimpled and plump it couldnt possibly be less like her mothers it was unsuited for housework and heavy toil unused to digging and working with the earth this oilandvinegar business isnt connected with nick ware is it tell me it was purely coincidence that i should have seen him heading back towards the village not ten minutes ago maggie jiggled the bottle and watched the oil slip and slide across the surface of the vinegar her mothers hand clamped over her wrist maggie felt the immediate answering numbness in her fi ngers that hurts then talk to me margaret tell me nick ware hasnt been here tonight tell me you havent had sex with him again because you reek of it are you aware of that do you realise you smell like a whore so what you smell of it too her mothers fingers contracted convulsively her short nails creating sharp pressure points of pain on the soft underside of maggies wrist maggie cried out and tried to pull away but only succeeded in flinging their locked hands against the plastic bottle so that it slipped into the sink the pungent mixture arced out to form an oleaginous pool as it drained away it left red and gold beads against the white porcelain i suppose you think i deserve that remark juliet said youve decided sex with nick is the perfect way to get an eye for an eye which is what you want isnt it isnt it what youve been wanting for months mummys taken a lover and youll fix her good if its the last thing you do its nothing to do with you i dont care what you do i dont care how you do it i dont even care when i love nick he loves me i see and when he makes you pregnant and youre faced with having his baby will he love you then will he leave school in order to support the two of you and how will it feel margaret jane spence motherhood before your fourteenth birthday juliet released her and went into the oldfashioned larder maggie rubbed her wrist and listened to the angry pop and snap of airtight containers being opened and closed on the chipped marble work top her mother returned brought the kettle to the sink set it to boil on the cooker sit down she said maggie hesitated running her fingers through the oil and vinegar that remained in the sink she knew what was to follow it was exactly what had followed her fi rst encounter with nick in the hall in october but unlike october this time she understood what those two words presaged and the understanding was a sickness to her that quickly ran ice down her back how stupid shed been just three months ago what had she been thinking each morning mummy had presented her with the cup of thick liquid she passed off as her special female tea and maggie had screwed up her face and drunk it obediently believing it was the vitamin supplement mummy claimed it to be something every girl needed when she became a woman but now in conjunction with her mothers words this evening she remembered a hushed conversation that mummy had had with mrs rice in this very kitchen nearly two years ago with mrs rice begging for something to kill it stop it i beg you juliet and with mummy saying i cant do that marion its a private oath to be sure but its an oath nonetheless and i mean to keep it you must go to a clinic if you want to be rid of it at which mrs rice began to weep saying ted wont hear of it hed kill me if he thought i did anything at all and then six months later her twins were born i said sit down juliet spence repeated she was pouring the water over the dried crushed bark root its acrid odour wafted up with the steam she added two tablespoons of honey to the drink stirred it vigorously and took it to the table come here maggie felt the angry cramps without use of the stimulant a phantom pain that grew from her memory i wont drink that you will i wont you want to kill the baby dont you my baby mummy mine and nicks thats what you were doing before in october you said it was vitamins to make my bones strong and to give me more energy you said women need more calcium than little girls and i wasnt a little girl any longer so i needed to drink it but you were lying werent you werent you mummy you wanted to make sure i didnt have a baby youre being hysterical you think its happened dont you you think theres a baby inside me dont you isnt that why you want me to drink well make it unhappen if its happened thats all to a baby my baby no the edge of the work top dug into her spine as maggie backed away from her mother juliet set the mug on the table resting a hand on her hip with the other hand she rubbed her forehead in the kitchen light her face looked gaunt the streaks of grey in her hair seemed at once duller and more pronounced then what exactly is it that you were planning to do with the oil and vinegar if not try no matter how ineffectively to stop a babys conception thats maggie turned miserably back to the sink different why because its easy because it washes things away without any pain stopping things before they start how convenient for you maggie unfortunately thats not the way its going to be come here sit down maggie pulled the oil and vinegar towards her in a protective and largely meaningless gesture her mother continued even if oil and vinegar were effi cacious contraceptives which they are not by the way a douche is completely useless much more than five minutes after intercourse i dont care i wasnt using it for that i just wanted to be clean like you said i see fine whatever you wish now are you going to drink this or are we going to argue deny and play with reality for the rest of the night because neither of us is leaving this room until youve drunk it maggie depend upon that i wont drink it you cant make me ill have the baby its mine ill have it ill love it i will you dont know the first thing about loving anyone i do really then what does it mean to make a promise to someone you love is it just words is it something you say to get you through the moment something without meaning mouthed to soothe feelings something to get what you want maggie felt tears building behind her eyes in her nose everything on the work top a dented toaster four metal canisters a mortar and pestle seven glass jars shimmered as she began to cry you made a promise to me maggie we had an agreement shall i recall it for you maggie grabbed on to the kitchen sinks tap and shoved it back and forth having no purpose for doing so other than experiencing the certainty of contact with something that she could control punkin leapt to the work top and approached her he wove in and out of the bottles and jars pausing to sniff at some crumbs on the toaster he gave a plaintive mew and rubbed against her arm she reached for him blindly and lowered her face to the back of his neck he smelled of wet hay his fur adhered to the trail her tears were making on her cheeks if we didnt leave the village if i agreed that we wouldnt move on this time youd see i never regretted it youd make me proud do you remember that do you remember giving me your solemn word you were sitting at this very table last august crying and pleading to stay in winslough just this once mummy please dont lets move again ive got such good mates here special mates mummy i want to finish school ill do anything please lets just stay it was the truth my mates josie and pam it was a variation on truth less than a halftruth if you will which is no doubt why within the next two months you were having it off on the floor in cotes hall with a fi fteenyearold farmboy and god knows who else that isnt true which part maggie having it off with nick or pulling down your knickers for any one of his randy little mates who wanted to give you a poke i hate you yes ever since this started youve been making that clear and im sorry about that because i dont hate you youre doing the same maggie swung back to her mother you preach about being good and not having babies and all the time youre doing no better than me you do it with mr shepherd everyone knows which is what this is all about isnt it youre thirteen years old during your entire life ive never taken a lover and youre bound and determined that i wont take one now im to go on living solely for you just as youre used to right no and if you have to get pregnant to keep me in line then thats just fi ne no because what is a baby after all maggie just something you can use to get what you want you want nick tied to you fine give him sex you want mummy preoccupied with your concerns good get yourself pregnant you want everyone to notice how special you are open your legs for any bloke who sniffs you up you want maggie grabbed up the vinegar and hurled the bottle to the floor where it exploded against the tile glass shards shot the length of the room at once the air was eyestingingly sour punkin hissed backing into the canisters his fur on end and his tail a plume ill love my baby she cried ill love it and take care of it and itll love me thats what babies do thats all babies do they love their mummies and their mummies love them juliet spence ran her eyes over the mess on the floor against the tiles which were cream coloured the vinegar looked like diluted blood its genetic she sounded worn out my god in heaven its inbred at your core she pulled out one of the kitchen chairs and sank onto it she cupped her hands round the mug of tea babies arent love machines she said to the mug they dont know how to love they dont know what love is they only have needs hunger thirst sleep and wet nappies and thats the end of it its not maggie said they love you they make you feel good inside they belong to you one hundred percent you can hold them and sleep with them and cuddle them close and when they get big they break you in pieces one way or another it comes down to that maggie rubbed the back of her wrist across her wet cheeks you just dont want me to have something to love thats what it is you can have mr shepherd thats fi ne and good for you but im not supposed to have anything at all do you really believe that you dont think you have me youre not enough mummy i see maggie picked up the cat and cradled it against her she saw defeat and sorrow in her mothers posture slumped into the seat with her long legs outstretched she didnt care she pressed the advantage what did it matter mummy could get comfort from mr shepherd if she felt hurt i want to know about daddy her mother said nothing she merely turned the mug in her hands on the table lay a packet of snapshots that theyd taken over christmas and she reached for this the holiday had fallen before the inquest and theyd worked hard at good spirits and happiness trying to forget what frightening possibilities the future held for them both if juliet stood trial she fl ipped through the pictures all of the two of them it had always been that way years and years of the two of them a relationship that had brooked no interference from any third party maggie watched her mother she waited for an answer shed been waiting like this for all of her life afraid to demand afraid to push overcome with guilt and apologies if her mothers reaction verged upon tears but not tonight i want to know about daddy she repeated her mother said nothing he isnt dead is he hes never been dead hes been looking for me thats why weve kept on the move no because he wants me he loves me he wonders where i am he thinks about me all the time doesnt he this is fantasy maggie doesnt he mummy i want to know what who he is what he does what he looks like why were not with him why weve never been with him theres nothing to tell i look like him dont i because i dont look like you this sort of discussion wont do anything to make you miss having a father yes it will it will because ill know and if i want to fi nd him you cant hes gone he isnt maggie he is and i wont talk about it i wont make up a story i wont tell you lies hes gone from both our lives hes always been gone right from the fi rst maggies lips trembled she tried to control them and failed he loves me daddy loves me and if youd let me find him i could prove it to you you want to prove it to yourself thats all and if you cant prove it with your father youre set to prove it with nick no maggie its obvious that isnt true i love him he loves me she waited for her mother to respond when juliet did nothing more than give the mug of tea a half turn on the table maggie felt herself harden a small black place seemed to grow on her heart if theres a baby ill have it do you hear me only i wont be like you i wont have secrets my babyll know who her daddy is she swept past the table and out of the room her mother made no attempt to detain her her anger and righteousness carried her to the top of the stairs where she finally paused below in the kitchen she heard a chair scrape back the water went on in the sink the cup clinked against the porcelain a cupboard opened the patter of dry cat nibbles poured into a bowl the bowl clicked on the fl oor after that silence and then a harsh gasp and the words oh god juliet hadnt said a prayer for nearly fourteen years not because she had been without the need for theurgy there had in fact been times when she was desperate for it but because she no longer believed in god she had at one time daily prayer attendance at church heartfelt communication with a loving deity were as much a part of her as were her organs her blood and her fl esh but shed lost the blind faith so necessary to belief in the unknowable and the unknown when she began to realise that there was no justice divine or otherwise in a world in which the good were made to suffer torments while the bad went untouched in her youth shed held on to the belief that there was a day of accounting for everyone she had realised that perhaps she would not be made privy to the manner in which a sinner was brought before the bar of eternal justice but brought before that bar he would be in one form or another in life or after death now she knew differently there was no god who listened to prayers righted wrongs or attenuated suffering in any way there was just the messy business of living and of waiting for those ephemeral moments of happiness that made the living worthwhile beyond that there was nothing save the struggle to ensure that no one and nothing endangered the possibility of those moments periodic advents in life she dropped two white towels onto the kitchen floor and watched the vinegar soak through them in growing blossoms of pink while punkin observed the entire operation from his perch on the work top his expression solemn and his eyes unblinking she dumped the towels in the sink and went for a broom and a mop this latter was unnecessary the towels had managed to absorb the mess and the broom would take care of the glass but she had learned long ago that physical toil alleviated any bent towards rumination which is why she worked in her greenhouse every day clambered through the oak wood at dawn with her collection baskets tended her vegetable garden with a zealots devotion and watched over her flowers more with need than with pride she swept up the glass and dumped it in the rubbish she decided to forgo the mop better to scrub the tile floor on her hands and knees feeling the dull circles of ache centring on her kneecaps and beginning to throb the length of her legs below physical labour on the list of activities designed to serve as substitutes for thought resided physical pain when labour and pain were conjoined by either chance or design ones mental processes slowed to nothing so she scrubbed the floor pushing the blue plastic pail before her forcing her arm out in wide sweeping motions that strained her muscles kneading wet rags against tile and grout with such energy that her breath became short when the job was completed perspiration made a damp semicircle round her hairline and she wiped it away with the arm of her turtleneck colins scent was still on it cigarettes and sex the private dark musk of his body when they loved she pulled the turtleneck over her head and dropped it on top of her pea jacket on the chair for a moment she told herself colin was the problem nothing would have happened to alter the substance of their lives had not she in an instant of egocentric need given in to the hunger dormant for years she had long ago stopped believing she had the capacity to feel desire for a man when it came upon her without expectation or warning she found herself without adequate defence she railed against herself for not having been stronger for forgetting the lessons that parental discourses from her childhood not to mention a lifetime of reading great books had laid before her passion leads inescapably to destruction the only safety lies in indifference but none of this was colins fault if he had sinned it was only in loving and in the sweet blindness of that lovings devotion she understood this for she loved as well not colin because she would never be able to allow herself the degree of vulnerability necessary to allow a man to enter her life as an equal but maggie for whom she felt all her lifeblood flowing in a kind of anguished abandon that bordered on despair my child my lovely child my daughter what wouldnt i do to keep you from harm but there was a limit to parental protection it made itself known the moment the child struck out on a path of her own devising touching the top of the cooker despite having heard the word no a hundred thousand times playing too near the river in winter when the water was high pinching a nip of brandy or a cigarette that maggie was choosing wilfully deliberately with an inchoate understanding of the consequences to forge her way into adult sexuality while she was still a child with a childs perceptions of the world was the single act of adolescent rebellion that juliet had not prepared herself to face shed thought about drugs about raucous music about drinking and smoking about styles of dress and ways of cutting hair shed thought about makeup arguments curfews and growing responsibility and you dont understand youre too old to understand but she had never once thought about sex not yet there would be time to think of sex later foolishly she didnt connect it with the little girl who still had her mummy brush her hair in the morning fixing back its long russet mass with an amber barrette she knew all the governing principles behind a childs progression from infant to autonomous adult shed read the books determined to be the best possible mother but how to deal with this how to develop a delicate balancing act between fact and fi ction to give maggie the father she wanted and at the same time set her own mind at rest and even if she was able to do that much for her daughter and herself which she could not do and would not even consider doing no matter the cost what would maggie have learned from her mothers capitulation that sex is not an expression of love between two people but a powerful ploy maggie and sex juliet didnt want to think about it over the years shed grown more and more adept at the art of repression refusing to dwell upon anything that evoked unhappiness or turmoil she moved forward she moved on she kept her attention on the distant horizon where existed the promise of exploration in the form of new places and new experiences where existed the promise of peace and sanctuary in the form of people who through centuries of habit and custom kept their distance from taciturn strangers and until last august maggie had always been perfectly happy to keep her eyes on this horizon as well juliet let the cat out and watched him disappear into the shadows cast by cotes hall she went upstairs maggies door was closed but she didnt tap on it as she otherwise might on another sort of night going in to sit on her daughters bed smoothing back her hair allowing her fingertips to graze against that peachsoft skin instead she went to her own room across the landing and took off the rest of her clothes in the darkness in doing so on another sort of night she might have thought about the pressure and warmth of colins hands on her body allowing herself just fi ve minutes to relive their lovemaking and recall the sight of him etched above her in the semidarkness of his room but tonight she moved like an automaton grabbing up her woollen dressing gown and making her way to the bathroom to draw a bath you smell of it too how could she in conscience counsel her daughter against a behaviour she engaged in looked forward to longed for herself the only way to do it was to give him up and then to move on as they had done in the past no looking back cutting every tie it was the only answer if the vicars death had not been enough to bring her to her senses about what was and was not possible in her life had she actually believed even for an instant that she might make a go of it as the loving wife of the local constable maggies relationship with nick ware would mrs spence my name is robin sage ive come to talk to you about maggie and shed poisoned him this compassionate man who had meant only good to her and her daughter what kind of life could she hope to have in winslough now when every heart doubted her every whisper condemned her and no one save the coroner himself had had the courage openly to ask how she had come to make such a fatal mistake she bathed slowly permitting herself only the immediate physical sensations attendant to the act the flannel on her skin the steam rising round her the water in rivulets between her breasts the soap smelled of roses and she breathed its fragrance to obliterate all others she wanted the bathing to wash away memory and to free her of passion she looked to it for answers she asked it for equanimity i want to know about daddy what can i tell you my dearest love that running his fingers through your downy hair meant nothing that the sight of your eyelashes lying like feathery shadows against your cheeks when you slept did not make him want to hold you close that your grubby hand clutching a dripping ice lolly would never have made him laugh with delight and dismay that your place in his life was quiet and sleeping in the rear seat of a car with no muss and no fuss and no demands please that you were never as real to him as he was to himself you were not the centre of his world how can i tell you that maggie how can i be the one to destroy your dream her limbs felt heavy as she towelled herself off her arm seemed weighted as she brushed her hair the bathroom mirror wore a thin skin of steam and she watched the movements of her silhouette in it a faceless image whose only definition was dusky hair fast going to grey the rest of her body she could not see in refl ection but she knew it well enough it was strong and durable firm of flesh and unafraid of hard work it was a peasants body made for the easy delivery of children and there should have been many they should have tumbled round her feet and cluttered the house with their mates and belongings they should have played learned to read skinned their knees broken windows and wept their confusion at lifes inconsistencies in her arms but there had been only one life given into her care and one chance to mould that life into maturity had it been her failure she wondered not for the first time had she let parental vigilance lapse in the cause of her own desires she set her hairbrush on the edge of the basin and went across the landing to the closed door of her daughters room she listened no light shone from beneath the door so she turned the knob quietly and entered maggie was asleep and she did not awaken when the dim oblong of light from the landing fell across her bed as she so often did shed kicked off the blankets and she was curled on her side her knees drawn up a childwoman wearing pink pyjamas with the top two buttons of the jacket missing so that the crescent of a full breast showed the nipple an aureole flushed against her white skin shed taken her stuffed elephant from the bookcase on which hed resided since their coming to winslough he lay in a lump bunched into her stomach his legs sticking straight out like a soldiers at attention and his old mangled trunk prehensile no longer but loved down to a stub from years of wear and tear juliet eased the blankets back over her daughter and stood gazing down at her the first steps she thought that odd teetering baby walk of hers as she discovered what it was to be upright clutching onto a handful of mummys trousers and grinning at the miracle of her own awkward gait and then the run hair flapping and flying and chubby arms extended full of confidence that mummy would be there with her own arms outstretched to catch and to hold that way of sitting legs splayed out stiffly with the feet pointing northeast and northwest that utterly unconscious posture of squatting scooting her compact little body closer to the ground to pick a wildflower or examine a bug my child my daughter i dont have all the answers for you margaret most of the time i feel that im merely an older version of a child myself im afraid but i cannot show you my fear i despair but i cannot share my sorrow you see me as strong the master of my life and my fate while all the time i feel as though at any moment the unmasking will occur and the world will see me and you will see me as i really am weak and riven by doubt you want me to be understanding you want me to tell you how things are going to be you want me to make things right life right by waving the wand of my indignation over injustice and over your hurts and i cant do that i dont even know how mothering isnt something one learns maggie its something one does it doesnt come naturally to any woman because there is nothing natural about having a life completely dependent upon ones own its the only kind of employment that exists in which one can feel so utterly necessary and at the same moment so entirely alone and in moments of crisis like this one maggie there is no sagacious volume in which one looks up answers and thus discovers how to prevent a child from harming herself children do more than steal ones heart my dear they steal ones life they elicit the worst and the best that we have to offer and in return they offer their trust but the cost of all this is insurmountably high and the rewards are small and long in coming and at the end when one prepares to release the infant the child the adolescent into adulthood it is with the hope that what remains behind is something bigger and more than mummys empty arms what follows suspicion chapter six the single most promising sign was that when he reached out to touch her smoothing his hand along the bare pathway of her spine she neither flinched nor shrugged off the caress in irritation this gave him hope true she neither spoke to him nor discontinued her dressing but at the moment detective inspector thomas lynley was willing to accept anything that wasnt an outright rejection leading to her departure it was he thought decidedly the down side of intimacy with a woman if there was supposed to be a happilyeverafter associated with falling in love and having that love returned he and helen clyde had not yet managed to fi nd it early days he tried to tell himself they were still unused to the role of lover in each others life after having for more than fi fteen years been resolutely living the role of friend still he wished she would stop dressing and come back to bed where the sheets were still warm from her body and the scent of her hair still clung to his pillow she hadnt switched on a lamp nor had she opened the curtains to the watery morning light of a london winter but despite these facts he could see her plainly in what little sun managed to seep first through the clouds and then through the curtains even if this had not been the case he had long ago committed to memory her face each one of her gestures and every part of her body had the room been dark he could have described with his hands the curve of her waist the precise angle at which she dipped her head a moment before she shook back her hair the shape of her calves her heels and her ankles the swell of her breasts he had loved before more often in his thirtysix years than he would have liked to admit to anyone but never before had he felt such a curious utterly neanderthal need to master and possess a woman for the last two months since helen had become his lover hed been telling himself that this need would dissolve if she agreed to marry him the desire to dominate and to have her submit could hardly flourish in an atmosphere of power sharing equality and dialogue and if these were the hallmarks of the sort of relationship he wanted with her then the part of him that needed to control how things would be in the here and now was the part of him that was going to have to be immolated soon the problem was that even now when he knew that she was upset when he knew the reason why and could not begin with any degree of honesty to fault her for it he still found himself irrationally wanting to browbeat her into a submissive and apologetic admission of error one for which the most logical expiation would be her willing return to bed which was in and of itself the second and more imperative problem hed awakened at dawn aroused by the warmth of her sleeping body pressed against his hed run his hand along the curve of her hip and even in sleep shed turned into his arms to make slow earlyinthemorning love afterwards theyd lain among the pillows and the tousled blankets and with her head on his chest and her hand on his breast and her chestnut hair spilling like silk between his fingers shed said i can hear your heart to which hed answered im glad that means youve not broken it yet to which shed chuckled gently bitten his nipple then yawned and asked her question to which like the utterly besotted fool he was hed given an answer no prevarication no equivocation just a hem and a haw a clearing of the throat and then the truth from which rose their argument if the accusation of objectifying women objectifying me me tommy whom you claim to love could be called an argument from which rose helens present determination to be dressed and be gone without further discussion not in anger to be sure but in yet another instance of her need to think things out for myself god how sex makes fools of us he thought one moment of release and a lifetime to regret it and the hell of it was that as he watched her dressing hooking together the bits of silk and lace that posed as womens underwear he felt the heat and tightening of his own desire his body was itself the most damning evidence of the basic truth behind her indictment of him for him the curse of being male seemed to be entrenched inextricably in dealing with the aggressive mindless animal hunger that made a man want a woman no matter the circumstances and sometimes to his shame because of the circumstances as if a half hours successful seduction were actually proof of something beyond the bodys ability to betray the mind helen he said she walked to the serpentine chest of drawers and used his heavy silverbacked brush to see to her hair a small cheval mirror stood in the midst of his family photographs and she adjusted it from his height to hers he didnt want to argue with her but he felt compelled to defend himself unfortunately because of the subject shed chosen for their disagreement or if the truth be admitted the subject which his behaviour and then his words had ultimately propelled her into choosing his only defence appeared to have its roots in a thorough examination of her her past after all was no more unsullied than was his own helen he said were two adults we have history together but we each have separate histories as well and i dont think we gain anything by making the mistake of forgetting that or by making judgements based upon situations that might have existed prior to our involvement with each other i mean this current involvement the physical aspect inwardly he grimaced at his bumbling attempt at putting an end to their contretemps goddamn it were lovers he wanted to say i want you i love you and you bloody well feel the same about me so stop being so blasted sensitive about something which has nothing whatsoever to do with you or how i feel about you or what i want from you and with you for the rest of our lives is that clear helen is it is it clear good im glad of it now get back into bed she replaced the hairbrush rested her hand upon it and didnt turn from the chest of drawers she hadnt yet put on her shoes and lynley took additional if tenuous hope from that as he did from the certainty of his belief that she no more wanted any form of estrangement between them than did he to be sure helen was exasperated with him perhaps only marginally more than he was exasperated with himself but she hadnt written him off entirely surely she could be made to see reason if only through being urged to consider how in the past two months he himself could have easily misconstrued her own erstwhile romantic attachments should he ever have been so idiotic as to evoke the spectral presence of her former lovers as she had done with his she would argue of course that she wasnt concerned with his former lovers at all that she hadnt as a matter of fact even brought them up it was women in general and his attitude towards them and the great hohohoimhavinganotherhotonetonight that she believed was implied by the act of draping a tie on the outer knob of his bedroom door he said i havent lived as a celibate any more than have you weve always known that about each other havent we whats that supposed to mean its just a fact and if we start trying to walk a tightrope between the past and the future in our life together were going to fall off it cant be done what we have is now beyond that the future to my way of thinking that ought to be our primary concern this has nothing to do with the past tommy it does you said not ten minutes ago that you felt just like his lordships squalid little sundaynight score youve misunderstood my concern have i he leaned over the edge of the bed and scooped up his dressing gown which had fallen to the floor in a heap of blue paisley sometime during the night are you angrier about a tie on the door knob about what the tie implies or more specifically about the fact that by my own extremely cretinous admission its a device ive used before i think you know me well enough not to have to ask a question like that he stood shrugged his way into the dressing gown and spent a moment picking up the clothing hed been in such a tearing hurry to divest himself of at half past eleven on the previous night and i think youre at heart more honest with yourself than youre being at the moment with me youre making an accusation i dont much like that nor do i like its connotation of egocentricity yours or mine you know what i mean tommy he crossed the room and pulled open the curtains it was a bleak day outside a gusty wind was scudding heavy clouds from east to west in the sky above while on the ground a thin crust of frost lay like fresh gauze on the lawn and the rose bushes that comprised his rear garden one of the neighbourhood cats perched atop the brick wall against which heavy solanum climbed he was hunched into dual humps of head and body with his calico fur rippling and his face looking shuttered demonstrating that singularly feline quality of being at once imperious and untouchable lynley wished he could say the same about himself he turned from the window to see that helen was watching his movements in the mirror he went to stand behind her if i choose he said i could drive myself mad with thinking of the men youve had as your lovers then in direct avoidance of the madness i could accuse you of using them to meet your own ends to gratify your ego to build your selfesteem but my madness would still be there all the time just beneath the surface no matter the strength of my accusations id merely be diverting and denying it by focusing all my attention not to mention the force of my righteous indignation on you clever she said her eyes were on his what this way of avoiding the central issue which is what i dont want to be my wife no lord ashertons little dolly bird detective inspector lynleys hot new piece the cause of a little wink and a smirk between you and denton when he sets out your breakfast or brings you your tea fine understandable then marry me ive wanted that for the last twelve months and i want it now if youll agree to legitimatising this affair in the conventional manner which is what ive proposed from the first and you know it then youll hardly have to concern yourself with idle gossip and potential derogation its not as easy as that idle gossips not even the point you dont love me of course i love you you know that i love you then i wont be made an object i wont he nodded slowly and youve felt like an object these past two months when weve been together last night perhaps her glance faltered he saw her fi ngers close round the handle of the brush no of course not but this morning she blinked god how i hate to argue with you were not arguing helen youre trying to trap me im trying to look at the truth he wanted to run his fingers the length of her hair turn her to him cup her face in his hands he settled for resting his hands on her shoulders if we cant live with each others past then we have no future thats the real bottom line no matter what else you claim it to be i can live with your past st james cusick rhys daviesjones and whomever else youve slept with for a night or a year the question is can you live with mine because thats really what this is all about it has nothing to do with how i feel about women it has everything to do with it he heard the intensity in her tone and saw the resignation on her face he turned her to him then understanding and mourning the fact at once oh god helen he sighed i havent had another woman i havent even wanted one i know she said resting her head against him why doesnt that help after reading it detective sergeant barbara havers crumpled up the second page of chief superintendent sir david hilliers lengthy memorandum rolled it into a ball and lobbed it neatly across the width of inspector lynleys office where it joined the previous page in the rubbish bin which shed placed for a bit of an athletic challenge next to the door she yawned rubbed her fi ngers vigorously against her scalp rested her head on her fist and continued reading pope davys encyclical on keeping yer nose clean macpherson had called the memorandum sotto voce in the offi cers mess everyone agreed that they had better things to do than to read hilliers epistle on the serious obligations of the national police force when investigating a case with possible connection to the irish republican army while they all recognised that hillier was taking his inspiration from the release of the birmingham six and while few of them had any sympathy for those members of the west midlands police force who had been the focus of her majestys investigation as a result the fact remained that they were far too burdened by their individual workloads to spend time committing to memory their chief superintendents prescriptive treatise barbara however wasnt currently fl oundering in the middle of half a dozen cases as were some of her colleagues rather she was engaged in experiencing a longanticipated twoweek holiday during this time she had planned to work on her childhood home in acton preparing to hand it over to an estate agent and move herself to a tiny studiocumcottage shed managed to find in chalk farm tucked behind a large edwardian house in eton villas the house itself had been subdivided into four flats and a spacious ground floor bedsit none of which were within barbaras limited budget but the cottage sitting in the rear of the garden beneath a false acacia tree was practically too small for anyone but a dwarf to live in comfortably and while barbara was not a dwarf her living aspirations were defi nitely dwarfish she did not look to entertain visitors she did not anticipate marriage and family she worked long hours and simply needed a place to lay her head at night the cottage would do she had signed the lease with no little excitement this would be the first home she had had away from acton in the last twenty of her thirtythree years she thought of how she would decorate it where she would buy her furniture what photographs and prints she would hang on the walls she went to a garden centre and looked at plants making note of what grew well in window boxes and what needed sun she paced the length of the cottage and then the width she measured the windows and examined the door and she returned to acton with her mind awash with plans and ideas all of which seemed unrealistic and impossible to attain when she was confronted with the amount of work that needed to be done to her familys home interior painting exterior repairs replacing wallpaper refinishing woodwork extirpating an entire rear garden of weeds cleaning old carpetsthe list seemed endless and beyond the fact that she was only one person attempting to see to the renovation of a house that had gone uncared for since shed left secondary school which was depressing enough in and of itself there was the vague sense of unease that she felt each time a project was actually completed at issue was her mother for the past two months she had been living in greenford some distance out of london on the central line shed made the adjustment to hawthorn lodge fairly well but barbara still wondered how much she would be tempting fate if she sold the old house in acton and set herself up in a more desirable neighbourhood in an intriguingly bohemian little cottage that wore the label new life enter hopes and dreams in which her mother would have no real place for wasnt she doing more than merely selling an overlarge house in order to fi nance what might be her mothers lengthy stay in greenford indeed wasnt the very idea of selling the house in order to do that merely a blind for her own selfishness or were these occasional twinges of conscience that accompanied her pursuit of freedom really nothing more than a convenient focal point for her attention so that she didnt have to face what lay beneath them you have your own life shed been telling herself stoutly more than a dozen times each day theres no crime in getting on with it barbara but it felt like a crime when the project itself didnt feel more overwhelming than she could bear she fluctuated among making lists of everything that needed to be done despairing that she would be able to do it and fearing the day when the work was completed and the house was sold and she was finally on her own in her rare introspective moments barbara admitted that the house gave her something to cling to a last vestige of security in a world in which she no longer had relations into whom she could sink even the slightest hook of emotional dependence no matter that she had not been able to sink a hook into any relations empathy or reliability for years her fathers lingering illness and her mothers mental deterioration had long precluded that living in the same old house in the same old neighbourhood at least bore the appearance of security to give it up and forge ahead into the unknownsometimes acton seemed infinitely preferable there are no easy answers inspector lynley would have said theres only living through the questions but the thought of lynley made barbara shift restlessly in his desk chair and force herself to read the first paragraph on the third page of hilliers memorandum the words meant nothing she couldnt concentrate having inadvertently conjured up the presence of her superior offi cer she was going to have to deal with him how to do so she squirmed lay the memorandum down among the various reports and folders that were stacking up during his absence and sank her hand into her shoulder bag in search of her cigarettes she lit one and blew smoke at the ceiling eyes narrowed against the smokes acrid sting she was in lynleys debt he would deny it naturally no doubt with an expression of such bemusement that she would momentarily distrust her own deductions but scanty as they were she had the facts and she didnt much like the position in which they placed her how to repay him when he would never allow it as long as their circumstances were so imbalanced he would never begin to entertain the word debt as a given between them damn him she thought he sees too much he knows too much hes too fl aming clever to get caught in the act she swivelled the chair to face a cabinet on top of which sat a picture of lynley and lady helen clyde she scowled at him get knotted she said flicking ash to the floor stay out of my life inspector now sergeant or will later do as well barbara spun round quickly lynley stood in the doorway his cashmere overcoat slung over one shoulder and dorothea harriman their divisional superintendent s secretary bobbing up and down behind him sorry harriman mouthed at barbara with wildly exaggerated and decidedly apologetic movements of her arms i didnt see him coming i couldnt warn you when lynley glanced over his shoulder harriman waggled her fi ngers smiled brilliantly at him and disappeared in a blaze of heavily lacquered blonde hair barbara got to her feet at once youre on holiday she said as are you so whatre you what are you she dragged long on her cigarette thought id stop by i was in the area ah you the same he entered and hung his coat on the rack unlike herself who had at least kept up the imonholiday pretence by coming to the yard wearing blue jeans and a tatty sweat shirt across which had been stencilled buy british by george beneath a faded depiction of that saint making hash of an extremely dispiritedlooking dragon barbara saw that lynley was dressed for work in his customary fashion threepiece suit crisp shirt silk maroon tie with the ubiquitous watch chain looped across his waistcoat he went to his desk the immediate vicinity of which she quickly vacated favoured the smouldering tip of her cigarette with a look of displeasure as he passed her and began sorting through the folders reports envelopes and numerous departmental directives whats this he asked holding up the remaining eight pages of the memorandum which barbara had been reading hilliers thoughts on working with the ira he patted his jacket pocket brought out his spectacles and ran his eyes down the page odd is hillier losing his touch it appears to start in the middle he noted sheepishly she reached into the rubbish and rescued the two top pages which she smoothed out against her chunky thigh and handed to him dropping cigarette ash on the cuff of his suit jacket in the process havers his voice was patience itself sorry she flicked the ash off a spot of it remained she rubbed it into the material good for it she said old wives tale put out that blasted thing will you she sighed and squashed the remaining stub of tobacco against the heel of her left plimsoll she flicked the butt in the direction of the rubbish bin but it missed its mark and landed on the floor lynley lifted his head from hilliers memorandum observed the butt over the tops of his spectacles and raised a single querying eyebrow sorry havers said and went to place the offending article in the rubbish she returned the bin to its original position at the side of his desk he murmured his thanks she plopped onto one of the visitor chairs and began to worry an incipient hole in the right knee of her jeans she stole a look or two at him while he continued to read he appeared perfectly refreshed and entirely untroubled his blond hair lay neatly against his head in its usual wellscissored fashion shed always wanted to know who saw to the miraculous cutting that produced the effect of its never growing so much as a millimetre beyond an established length his brown eyes were clear no circles darkened the skin beneath them no new lines of fatigue or worry had joined the age lines on his brow but the fact remained that he was supposed to be on a holiday that had long been arranged with lady helen clyde they were off to corfu they were supposed to be leaving in fact at eleven but it was now a quarter past ten and unless the inspector was planning on a trip to heathrow via helicopter within the next ten minutes he wasnt going anywhere at least not to greece at least not today so she said breezily is helen with you sir did she stop to chat up macpherson in the mess no to both he continued reading hed just concluded the third page of the tract and he was balling it up as she had done with the first two although in his case the action appeared to be unconscious merely something to do with his hands hed made it a full year off the evil weed but there were times when his fingers seemed to need something to do in place of holding the cigarette hed been used to shes not ill i mean werent you two heading off to we were supposed to yes plans change sometimes he looked at her over the rims of his spectacles it was one of his nowthatweregettingdowntoit looks and what about your plans sergeant have they changed as well just taking a break you know how it is work work work and a girls hands just start to look like dead lobsters im giving them a rest i see not that i need to give them a rest from painting what painting you know the interior of the house three blokes showed up at my place two days ago contractors they were had a deal all drawn up and signed to paint the inside of my house odd that was you know because i hadnt called a contractor odder still when you think the job had been paid for in advance lynley frowned and placed the memorandum on top of a bound psi report on the relationship between civilians and police in london decidedly odd he said youre certain they were at the right house dead certain she said one hundred percent certain they even knew my name they even called me sergeant they even asked what it was like for a woman to work in cid chatty blokes they were but i did wonder how they could ever have known i work here at the met as expected lynleys face was a study in wonderment she halfexpected him to go all miranda on her exclaiming on the braveness and newness of a world they both knew to be generally corrupt and largely hopeless and you read the contract you made certain they were in the right place oh yes and they were bloody good sir the lot of them two days and the house was painted like new how intriguing he went back to the report she let him read for the amount of time it took her to count from one to one hundred then sir hmm whatd you pay them whom the painters what painters give over inspector you know what im talking about the chaps who painted your house whatd you pay them because i know you did dont bother to lie about it besides you only macpherson stewart and hale know that im working on the place during my holiday and they cant exactly put their hands on the kind of lolly were talking about to do this job so whatd you pay them and how much time do i have to pay you back lynley set the report aside and allowed his fi ngers to play with his watch chain they removed the watch from his pocket flipped it open and he made a show of examining the time i dont want your bleeding charity she said i dont want to feel like anyones pet project i dont want to owe it does make demands on one owing he said one always ends up putting the debt onto a scale in which future behaviours are weighed how can i lash out in anger when i owe him something how can i go my own way without discussion when im in his debt how can i maintain a safe businesslike distance from the rest of the world if i have a connection somewhere owing money isnt a connection sir no but gratitude generally is so you were buying me is that it assuming i had anything to do with it in the first place which i feel compelled to warn you is not an inference that will be supported by any evidence you may attempt to glean i generally dont purchase my friendships sergeant which is your way of saying that you paid them cash and you probably paid them a bonus as well to keep their mouths shut she leaned forward slapping her hand lightly against his desk i dont want your help sir not in this way i dont want anything from you that i cant return and besideseven if that wasnt the case im not exactly ready she blew out her breath in a gust of sudden nerve loss sometimes she forgot he was her superior officer worse sometimes she forgot the one thing shed once sworn to keep in the forefront of her mind every instant she was with him the man was an earl he had a title there were people in his life who actually called him my lord given none of his colleagues at the yard had considered him anything other than lynley for more than ten years but she didnt possess the sort of sangfroid that allowed her to feel on equal footing with someone whose family had been rubbing elbows with the sort of blokes who were used to being referred to as your highness and your grace it gave her the crawlies when she thought about it it raised her hackles when she dwelt upon it and when it caught her unawares such as now it made her feel like a perfect fool one didnt unburden ones soul to a blue blood one wasnt really sure that blue bloods were possessed of souls themselves and even if that werent the case lynley picked up her thought with an unconscious if typical correction of her grammar i expect as the day when you leave acton looms closer the prospect looms larger its one thing to have a dream isnt it its quite another when it becomes reality she sank back in her chair staring at him christ she said how the hell does helen put up with you he smiled briefly and removed his spectacles which he returned to his pocket she doesnt at the moment actually no trip to corfu im afraid not unless she goes alone which as we both know shes been perfectly willing to do before why i upset her equilibrium i dont mean why then i mean why now i see he swivelled the chair not towards the cabinet and the picture of helen but towards the window where the upper fl oors of the dreary postwar construction that was the home office nearly matched the colour of the leaden sky he steepled his fingers beneath his chin we fell out over a tie im afraid a tie as a means of clarification he gestured to the one he was wearing id hung a tie on the door knob last night barbara frowned force of habit you mean like squeezing toothpaste from the middle of the tube something that gets on ones nerves once the stars of romance start twinkling less brightly i only wish then what he sighed she could tell he didnt want to go into it she said never mind its none of my business im sorry it didnt work out i mean the holiday i know you were looking forward to it he played with the knot at his throat id left my tie on the door knob outside the door before we went to bed so i didnt pause to think she might notice and beyond that its something im used to doing on occasion so and she didnt notice actually but she did ask how it was that denton has never once disturbed us in the morning since weve beentogether barbara saw the dawn oh i get it he sees the tie its a signal he knows that someones with you wellyes and you told her that jesus what an idiot inspector i wasnt thinking i was wandering like a schoolboy in that blithering state of sexual euphoria when no one thinks she said tommy how is it that denton has never once stumbled in with your morning tea on the nights ive stayed and i actually told her the truth that youd been using the tie to tell denton that helen was in the bedroom yes and that youd done it with other women in the past god no im not that much of an idiot although it wouldnt have made any difference had i said it she assumed id been using it that way for years and had you yes no well not recently for gods sake i mean only with her which isnt meant to imply that i didnt put a tie on the knob for someone else but there hasnt been anyone else since she and ioh blast it he waved off the rest barbara nodded solemnly im certainly getting the idea of how the old grave was dug she claims its an example of my inherent misogyny my valet and i exchanging a lubricious chuckle over breakfast about whos been moaning the loudest in my bed which youve never done of course he swung his chair back to her what exactly do you take me for sergeant nothing just yourself she poked at the hole on her knee with more interest of course you always could have given up early morning tea all together i mean once you started having women spend the night that way youd never have needed a signal or you could have started brewing morning tea yourself and nipping back up to your bedroom with the tray she pressed her lips together at the thought of lynley stumbling round his kitchen assuming he even knew where it was in the first place trying to find the kettle and to work the cooker i mean it would have been sort of liberating for you sir you might even have ultimately ventured into toast and then she giggled although it sounded more like a snort slipping out from between her pressed lips she covered her mouth and watched him over the top of her hand half in shame at her making a joke of his situation and half in amusement at the thought of him in the midst of frenzied determined seduction surreptitiously hanging a tie on his door knob in such a way that his lady love wouldnt notice and question why he was doing it his face was wooden he shook his head he fingered the rest of hilliers report i dont know he said gravely i dont see how i could ever manage toast she guffawed he chuckled at least we dont have that sort of trouble in acton barbara laughed which is no doubt partially why youre reluctant to leave what a marksman she thought he wouldnt miss an opening if he was wearing a blindfold she got up from her chair and walked to the window slipping her fingers into the rear pockets of her jeans isnt that why youre here he asked her i told you why i was in the area you were looking for distraction havers as was i she gazed out the window she could see the tops of the trees in st jamess park completely bare rustling in the wind they looked like sketchings against the sky i dont know inspector she said it seems like a case of becarefulwhatyouwishfor i know what i want to do im scared to do it the telephone rang on lynleys desk she started to answer it leave it he said were not here remember they both watched it as it continued to ring the way people do when they expect their collective will to have some small infl uence over anothers actions it fi nally stopped but i suppose you can relate to that barbara went on as if the telephone had not interrupted them its something about the gods lynley said when they want to make you mad they give you what you most desire helen she said freedom he said were one hell of a pair detective inspector lynley dorothea harriman stood in the doorway wearing a trim black suit relieved by grey piping on collar and lapels a pillbox hat was perched on her head she looked ready for an appearance on the balcony of buck house on remembrance sunday should she be summoned to dwell among the royals only the poppy was missing yes dee lynley asked telephone im not here but the sergeant and i are unavailable dee but its mr st james hes phoning from lancashire st james lynley looked at barbara havent he and deborah gone on holiday barbara raised her shoulders havent we all chapter seven lynley was driving up the acclivity of the clitheroe road towards the village of winslough by late afternoon mellow sunlight fading as day drew towards night pierced the winter mist that lay over the land in narrow bands it glanced against the old stone structures church school houses and shops that rose in a serried display of lancashires stalwart architecture and it changed the colour of the buildings to ochre from their normally sombre tansoakedwithsoot beneath the tyres of the bentley the road was wet as it always seemed to be in the north at this time of year and pools of water from both ice and frost which gathered and melted and gathered again on a nightly basis glimmered in the light upon their surfaces the sky was refl ected as were the vertebral forms of hedges and trees he slowed the car some fifty yards from the church he parked on the verge and got out into the knifesharp air he could smell the smoke from a fresh drywood fire nearby this argued for dominance with the prevalent odours of manure turned earth wet and rotting vegetation which emanated from the expanse of open land lying just beyond the brambly hedge that bordered the road he looked past this to his left the hedge curved northeast with the road giving way to the church and then perhaps a quarter of a mile farther on to the village itself to his far right a stand of trees thickened into an old oak wood above which rose a hill that was sided by frost and topped by a wavering wreath of mist and directly in front of him the open fi eld dipped languidly down to a crooked stream from which the land lifted again on the other side in a patchwork of drystone walls among these stood farms and from them even at this distance lynley could hear the bleating of sheep he leaned against the side of the car and gazed at st john the baptists like the village itself the church was a plain structure roofed in slate and ornamented only by its clockfaced bell tower and norman crenellation surrounded by a graveyard and chestnut trees backdropped by a misty eggshell sky it didnt much look like a player in a set piece with murder at its core priests after all were supposed to be minor characters in the drama of life and death theirs was the role of conciliator counsellor and general intermediary between the penitent the petitioner and the lord they offered a service elevated both in effi cacy and importance as a result of its connection to the divine but because of this fact there was a measured distance between them and the members of their congregation one which seemed to preclude the sort of intimacy that led to murder yet this chain of thought was sophistry lynley knew everything from the monitory aphorism about the wolf in sheeps clothing to that timeworn hypocrite the reverend arthur dimmesdale bore evidence of that even if this were not the case lynley had been a policeman long enough to know that the most guileless exterior not to mention the most exalted position had the fullest potential to hide culpability sin and shame thus if murder had shattered the peace of this somnolent countryside the fault did not lie in the stars or in the ceaseless movement of the planets but rather at the centre of a guarded heart theres something peculiar going on st james had said on the phone that morning from what ive been able to gather the local constable apparently managed to avoid calling in his divisional cid for anything more than a cursory investigation and he seems to be involved with the woman who fed this priest robin sage the hemlock in the fi rst place surely there was an inquest st james there was the woman shes called juliet spence admitted doing it and claimed it was an accident well if the case went no further and the coroners jury brought in a verdict of accidental poisoning we have to assume that the autopsy and whatever other evidence there was no matter who gathered it verifi ed her account but when you consider the fact that shes a herbalist people make mistakes consider how many deaths have risen from a putative fungi experts picking the wrong sort of wild mushroom in the woods and cooking it up for dinner and death this isnt quite the same you said she mistook it for wild parsnip didnt you i did and thats where the story goes bad st james set forth the facts while it was true he said that the plant was not immediately distinguishable from a number of other members of its family the umbelliferaethe similarities among the genera and the species were confi ned largely to the parts of the plant that one wouldnt be drawn to eating in the first place the leaves the stems the fl owers and the fruit why not the fruit lynley wanted to know didnt this entire situation arise from the act of picking cooking and eating the fruit not at all st james told him although the fruit was as poisonous as the rest of the plant it consisted of dry twopart capsules that unlike a peach or an apple werent fleshy and hence gastronomically attractive someone harvesting water hemlock thinking it was wild parsnip would not be eating the fruit at all rather hed be digging up the plant and using the root and thats the rub st james said the root bears the distinguishing characteristics i take it it does lynley had to admit that while the characteristics werent legion they were enough to rouse his own sleeping disquiet this was in part why he unpacked the clothing hed put in his suitcase for a week in the mild winter of corfu repacked it for the insidious bonechill of the north and made his way up the m to the m and thence deep into lancashire with its desolate moors its cloudcovered fells and its antique villages from which more than three hundred years ago had sprung his countrys ugliest fascination with witchcraft roughlee blacko and pendle hill were none of them too distant in either miles or memory from the village of winslough nor was the trough of bowland through which twenty women were marched to their trials and their deaths at lancaster castle it was historical fact that persecution raised its nasty head most often when tensions rose and a scapegoat was needed to diffuse and displace them lynley wondered idly if the death of the local vicar at the hands of a woman was tension enough he turned from his contemplation of the church and went back to the bentley he switched on the ignition and the tape hed been listening to since clitheroe resumed mozarts requiem its sombre combination of strings and woodwinds accompanying the solemn low intonation of the choir seemed appropriate to the circumstances he guided the car back into the road if it wasnt a mistake that killed robin sage it was something else and the facts suggested that something else was murder as did the plant that conclusion grew from the root one distinguishes water hemlock from other members of the umbelliferae by the root st james had explained wild parsnip has a single root stock water hemlock has a tuberous bundle of roots but isnt it within the realm of possibility that this particular plant had only one root stock its possible yes just as another sort of plant might have its opposite two or three adventitious roots but statistically speaking its unlikely tommy still one cant discount it agreed but even if this particular plant had been an anomaly of that sort there are other characteristics to the underground portion of the stem that one would think a herbalist would notice when cut open lengthwise the stem of water hemlock displays nodes and internodes help me out here simon science isnt my fi eld sorry i suppose youd call them chambers theyre hollow with a diaphragm of pith tissue running horizontally across the cavity and wild parsnip doesnt have these chambers nor does it exude a yellow oily liquid when its stem is cut but would she have cut the stem would she have opened it lengthwise the latter no i admit its doubtful but as to the former how could she have removed the root even if it was the anomaly a single one without cutting the stem in some way even breaking the root off from the stem would have produced that singular oil and you believe thats enough of a warning to a herbalist isnt it possible that she might have been distracted from noticing what if someone was with her when she was digging it up what if she were talking to a friend or arguing with her lover or distracted in some way perhaps even deliberately distracted those are possibilities and they bear looking into dont they let me make a few phone calls he had done so the nature of the answers hed managed to dig up had piqued his interest since the holiday in corfu had turned into another one of lifes promises unkept he threw tweeds blue jeans and sweaters in his suitcase and stowed that along with gumboots hiking shoes and anorak into the boot of his car hed been wanting to get out of london for weeks while hed have preferred his escape to be effected by a flight to corfu with helen clyde crofters inn and lancashire would have to do he rolled past the terraced houses that signalled entry into the village proper and found the inn at the junction of the three roads just where st james had told him it would be st james himself along with deborah lynley found in the pub the pub itself was not yet open for its evening business the iron wall sconces with their small tasselled shades hadnt been lit near the bar someone had set out a blackboard upon which the nights specialities had been printed in a hand that employed oddly pointed letters sloping lines and a devotion to fuchsiacoloured chalk lasagnia was offered as were minuet steak and steamed toffy pudding if the spelling was any indication of the cooking things didnt look promising lynley made a mental note to try the restaurant in lieu of the pub st james and deborah were seated beneath one of the two windows that looked out onto the street on the table between them the remains of an afternoon tea mixed with beer mats and a stapled sheaf of papers that st james was in the act of folding and stuffing into his inside jacket pocket he was saying listen to me deborah to which she was replying i wont youre breaking our agreement she crossed her arms lynley knew that gesture he slowed his steps three logs burned in the fi replace next to their table deborah turned in her chair and looked into the fl ames st james said be reasonable she said be fair then one of the logs shifted and a shower of sparks rained onto the hearth st james worked the fire brush deborah moved away she caught sight of lynley she said tommy with a smile and looked a mixture of saved and relieved as he stepped into the greater light that the fire provided he set his suitcase by the stairway and went to join them youve made excellent time st james said as lynley offered his hand in greeting and then brushed a kiss against deborahs cheek the wind at my back and no trouble getting away from the yard youve forgotten im on holiday id just gone into the office to clear off my desk and weve taken you from your holiday deborah asked simon thats dreadful lynley smiled a mercy deb but surely you and helen had plans we did she changed her mind i was at a loose end it was either a drive to lancashire or a prolonged rattle round my house in london lancashire seemed to hold infi nitely more promise its a diversion at least deborah shrewdly assessed the fi nal statement does helen know youve come ill phone her tonight tommy i know ive not behaved well ive picked up my marbles and run away he dropped into the seat next to deborah and picked up a shortbread still left on the plate he poured some tea for himself into her empty cup and stirred in sugar as he munched he looked about the door to the restaurant was shut the lights behind the bar were switched off the office door was open a crack but no movement came from within and while a third door set at an angle behind the bar was open far enough to emit a lance of light that pierced the labels of the spirit bottles that hung upside down awaiting use no sound came from beyond it no ones here lynley asked theyre about somewhere theres a bell on the bar he nodded but made no move to go to it they know youre the yard tommy lynley raised an eyebrow how you had a phone message during lunch it was the talk of the pub so much for incognito it probably wouldnt have served us well anyway who knows that youre cid st james leaned back and let his glance wander as if trying to remember who had been in the pub when the call came through the owners certainly six or seven locals a group of hikers whore no doubt long gone youre certain about the locals ben wragg hes the owner was chatting some of them up at the bar when his wife brought the news from the office the rest got the information with their lunches at least deborah and i did i hope the wraggs charged extra st james smiled they didnt that but they did give us the message they gave everyone the message sergeant dick hawkins clitheroe police phoning for detective inspector thomas lynley i asked him where this detective inspector thomas lynley was from i did deborah added in her best lancashire accent and wouldnt you knowwith a wonderfully dramatic pause tommyhes from new scotland yard staying right here at the inn hell be he booked a room hisself not three hours past i took the call now what you spose hes come to look into deborahs nose wrinkled with her smile youre the weeks excitement youve turned winslough into st mary mead lynley chuckled st james said pensively clitheroes not the regional constabulary for winslough is it and this hawkins said nothing about being attached to anyones cid because if he had we surely would have heard that bit of news along with everything else clitheroes just the divisional police centre lynley said hawkins is the local constables superior officer i spoke to him this morning but hes not cid no and you were right in your conclusions about that st james when i spoke to hawkins earlier he affirmed the fact that clitheroes cid did nothing more than photograph the body examine the crime scene collect physical evidence and arrange for autopsy shepherd himself did the rest investigation and interviews but he didnt do them alone who assisted his father thats deucedly odd odd and irregular but not illegal from what sergeant hawkins told me earlier shepherds father was detective chief inspector at the regional constabulary in huttonpreston at the time evidently he pulled rank on sergeant hawkins and gave the order how things would be was detective chief inspector this sage affair was his last police case he retired shortly after the inquest so colin shepherd must have arranged with his father to keep clitheroes cid out of it deborah said or his father wanted it that way but why st james mused i dare say thats what were here to fi nd out they walked down the clitheroe road together in the direction of the church past the front of terraced houses whose white transomed windows were edged by a hundred years of grime that no mere washing could ever remove they found colin shepherds house next to the vicarage just across the street from st john the baptist church here they separated deborah crossing to the church itself with a quiet i havent seen it yet anyway leaving st james and lynley to conduct their interview with the constable on their own two cars stood on the drive in front of the sorrel brick building a muddy land rover at least ten years old and a splattered golf that looked relatively new no car stood on the neighbouring drive but as they skirted past the rover and the golf on their way to colin shepherds door a woman came to one of the front windows in the vicarage and she watched their progress with no attempt to hide herself from view one hand was freeing kinky carrotcoloured hair from a scarf that bound it at the base of her neck the other was buttoning a navy coat she didnt move from the window even when it was obvious that lynley and st james had seen her a narrow rectangular sign jutted from the side of colin shepherds house blue and white it was printed with the single word police as was the case in most villages the local constables home was also the business centre of his policing area lynley wondered idly if shepherd had brought the spence woman here to do his questioning of her a dog began to bark in answer to their ringing of the bell it was a sound that started at one end of the house rapidly approached the front door and took up a raucous position behind it a large dog by the sound of it and none too friendly a mans voice said quiet leo sit and the barking ceased at once the porch light flicked on although it wasnt yet completely dark and the door swung open with a large black retriever sitting at attention at his side colin shepherd looked them over his face reflected neither the anticipation attendant to greeting a request for his professional services nor the general curiosity attached to finding strangers at ones door his words explained why he said them with a quick formal nod scotland yard cid sergeant hawkins said you might pay me a call today lynley produced his warrant card and introduced st james to whom shepherd said after an evaluative glance youre staying at the inn arent you i saw you last night my wife and i came to see mr sage the redheaded woman she was out by the reservoir this morning shed gone there to walk on the moor the mist comes down fast in these parts its no place for a walk if you dont know the land ill tell her shepherd stepped back from the door the dog rose in response a rumbling in his throat shepherd said be quiet go back to the fi re and the dog trotted obediently into another room use him for your work lynley asked no just for hunting shepherd nodded to a coat rack that stood at one end of the elongated entry beneath it three pairs of gumboots lined up two of them smeared with fresh mud on the sides next to these a metal milk basket stood with an empty cocoon of some longdeparted insect dangling by a thread from one of its bars shepherd waited while lynley and st james hung up their coats then he led the way down the corridor in the direction the retriever had taken they went into a sitting room where a fi re burned and an older man was laying a small log on top of the flames despite the years that separated them in age it was obvious that this was colin shepherds father they shared many similarities the height the muscular chest the narrow hips their hair was different thinning in the father and fading to the colour of sand in the way that blonds do as they move towards grey and the long fi ngers sensitivity and sureness of the hands in the son had in the father become large knuckles and split nails with age the latter man slapped his palms together briskly as if to rid them of wood dust he offered his hand in greeting kenneth shepherd he said detective chief inspector retired huttonpreston cid but i expect you know that already dont you sergeant hawkins passed the information on to me as well he ought its good to meet you both he shot a glance at his son have you something to offer these good gentlemen col the constables face did not change its expression despite the affability of his fathers tone behind his tortoiseshell spectacles his eyes remained guarded beer he said whisky brandy ive a sherry here thats been collecting dust for the last six years your annie was a one for her sherry wasnt she the chief inspector said god rest her sweet soul ill have a go with that and you to the others nothing said lynley nor for me st james said from a small fruitwood side table shepherd poured the drink for his father and something from a spirit decanter for himself as he did so lynley glanced round the room it was sparsely furnished in the manner of a man who shops at jumble sales when a pressing need arises and doesnt give much thought to the look of his possessions the back of a beleaguered sofa was covered by a handknit blanket of multicoloured squares that managed to hide most of the large but mercifully faded pink anemones that decorated its fabric nothing beyond their own worn upholstery covered either of the two mismatched wing chairs the arms of which were threadbare and the backs of which were permanently dented from serving as the resting place for generations of heads aside from a bentwood coffee table a brass floor lamp and the side table on which the liquor bottles stood the only other item of interest hung on the wall this was a cabinet that housed a collection of rifl es and shotguns they were the only things in the room that looked cared for no doubt companion pieces to the retriever who had sunk onto an ancient stained duvet in front of the fi re his paws like the gumboots in the hall were clotted with mud game birds lynley asked with a look at the guns deer at one time as well but ive given that up the killing never lived up to the stalking it seems that it should but it never does does it his sherry glass in hand the chief inspector gestured towards the sofa and chairs sit he said sinking into the sofa weve just come in from a tramp ourselves and can do with taking a load off our feet im off in about a quarter of an hour ive got a sweet young thing of fiftyeight years waiting dinner for me at the pensioners flat but theres time enough for a natter fi rst you dont live here in winslough st james asked havent in years i like a bit of action and a bit of willing soft girlflesh to go with it theres none of the first to be found in winslough and what there is of the seconds long been tied up the constable took his drink to the fire squatted down on his haunches and ran his hand over the retrievers head in response leo opened his eyes and moved to rest his chin against shepherds shoe his tail skittered in contentment against the fl oor got yourself in the mud shepherd said giving a gentle tug to the retrievers ears a fine mess you are his father snorted dogs christ they get under your skin about as bad as do women it was an opening from which lynleys question rose naturally although he was as certain the chief inspector hadnt intended it to be used that way as he was certain the mans visit to his son had little to do with an afternoons hike on the moors what can you tell us about mrs spence and the death of robin sage not exactly a yard concern is it although he said it in a friendly enough fashion the chief inspectors response came too quickly upon the heels of the question it spoke of having been prepared in advance formally no but informally surely youre not blind to the irregularity of the investigation chief inspector no cid your sons attachment to the perpetrator of the crime accident not crime colin shepherd looked up from the dog his glass clasped in an easy grip in his hand he remained squatting next to the fire a countryman born and bred he could no doubt maintain the position for hours without the slightest discomfort an irregular decision but not illegal the chief inspector said colin felt he could handle it i agreed handle it he did i was with him through most of it so if its the lack of cid input thats got the yard in a dither cid was here all the time you sat in on all the interviews the ones that mattered chief inspector you know thats more than irregular i dont need to tell you that when a crimes been committed but no crime was the constable said he kept one hand on the dog but his eyes were on lynley he didnt move them the crimescene team came out to crawl round the moors and overturn stones and they saw the situation well enough in an hour this wasnt a crime it was a clearcut accident i saw it that way the coroner saw it that way the jury saw it that way end of story you were certain of that from the fi rst the dog stirred restlessly as the hand on him tightened of course not yet aside from the initial presence of the crimescene team you made the decision not to involve your divisional cid the very people who are trained to determine if a death is an accident a suicide or murder i made the decision the chief inspector said based upon a phone call from me his son said you reported the death to your father not to the divisional headquarters in clitheroe i reported to both i told hawkins i would handle it pa confi rmed everything seemed straightforward enough once id talked to julietto mrs spence and mr spence lynley asked there is none i see the constable dropped his eyes swirled the liquor in his glass this has nothing to do with our relationship but it adds a complication im sure you see that it wasnt a murder st james leaned forward in the wing chair hed chosen what makes you so certain what made you so certain a month ago constable she had no motive she didnt know the man it was only the third time theyd even met he was after her to start going to church and he wanted to talk about maggie maggie lynley asked her daughter juliet had been having some trouble with her and the vicar got involved he wanted to help mediate between them offer advice thats it thats their relationship in a nutshell should i have called in cid and had them read her the caution over that or would you have preferred a motive fi rst means and opportunity are powerful indicators in themselves lynley said thats a lot of balls and you know it the chief inspector put in pa shepherds father waved him off with his sherry glass i have the means for murder every time i get behind the wheel of my car i have opportunity when i step on the pedal is it murder inspector if i hit someone who dodges into the path of my car do we need to call in cid for that or can we deem it an accident pa if thats your argument and i cant deny its tenability at the moment why involve cid in the person of yourself because he is involved with the woman for gods sake he wanted me here to make sure he kept his mind clear and he did every moment every moment you were here and by your own admission you werent here for each interview i damn well didnt need pa shepherds voice was sharp it altered to quiet reason when he went on obviously it looked bad when sage died juliet knows her plants and it was hard to believe she could have mistaken water hemlock for wild parsnip but thats what happened youre certain of that st james asked of course i am she got ill herself the night mr sage died she was burning with fever she was sick four or five times until two the next morning now you cant tell me that without having a blessed motive in the world shed knowingly eat a few bites of the deadliest natural poison there is in order to paint a murder an accident hemlocks not like arsenic inspector lynley one doesnt build up an immunity to it if juliet wanted to kill mr sage she bloody well wouldnt have been such a fool as to deliberately eat part of the hemlock herself she could have died she was lucky she didnt you know for a fact she was ill lynley asked i was there at the dinner later i stopped by what time towards eleven after i made my last patrol why shepherd tossed back the rest of his drink and placed the glass on the floor he took off his spectacles and spent a moment polishing the outer right lens against the sleeve of his fl annel shirt constable tell him lad the chief inspector said its the only way hes going to be satisfi ed shepherd gave a shrug replacing the spectacles i wanted to see if she was alone maggied gone to spend the night with one of her mates he sighed shifted his weight and you thought sage might be doing the same with mrs spence hed been there three times juliet gave me no reason to think shed taken him as a lover i wondered thats all i wondered its nothing im proud of would it be likely that shed take on a lover after so brief an acquaintance constable shepherd picked up his glass saw it was empty put it back down a spring creaked on the sofa as the chief inspector stirred would she mr shepherd the constables spectacles fl ashed briefl y in the light as he lifted his head to meet lynleys gaze thats hard to know about any woman isnt it especially a woman you love there was truth to that lynley admitted more than he liked to think about people expatiated on the virtues of trust all the time he wondered how many of them actually lived by it with no doubts ever camping like restless gypsies just at the edge of their consciousness he said i take it sage was gone when you arrived yes she said hed left at nine where was she in bed ill yes but she let you in i knocked she didnt answer i let myself in the door was unlocked i have a set of keys he saw st james glance quickly in lynleys direction he added she didnt give them to me townleyyoung did keys to the cottage cotes hall the whole estate he owns it shes the care taker she knows you have the keys yes as a security precaution i suppose do you use them often as part of your evening patrol not generally no lynley saw that st james was looking thoughtfully at the constable his brows drawn together as he pulled at his chin he said it was a bit risky that wouldnt you say letting yourself into her cottage at night what if she had been in bed with mr sage shepherds jaw tightened but he answered easily i suppose i would have killed him myself chapter eight deborah spent the first quarter of an hour inside st john the baptist church beneath the hammerbeam ceiling she wandered down the central aisle towards the chancel tracing a mittened finger along the scrollwork that edged each pew on the far side of the pulpit one of them was boxed separated from the rest by a gate of barleysugar columns on the top of which a small bronze plaque bore blackened letters reading townleyyoung deborah lifted its latch and stepped inside wondering what sort of people would want to maintain the unpleasant centuriesold custom of segregating themselves from those they considered their social inferiors she sat on the narrow bench and looked about the air in the church was musty and frigid and when she exhaled her breath hung whitely before her face for a moment then dissipated like a cirrus in the wind on a pillar nearby the hymnboard hung listing a selection for some previous service number was at the top and idly she opened one of the hymnals to it reading lord christ who on thy heart didst bear the burden of our shame and sin and now on high dost stoop to share the fight without the fear within after which she dropped her eyes to that we may care as thou hast cared for sick and lame for deaf and blind and freely share as thou hast shared in all the sorrows of mankind and then stared at the words with her throat achingtight as if they had been written precisely for herwhich they had notwhich they had not she slapped the book closed to the left of the pulpit a banner hung limply from a metal rod and she scrutinised this winslough was stitched across a faded blue background in letters of yellow below them st john the baptist church was rendered in quilted patchwork from which several tufts of stuffing leaked like snow against the bell tower and on the face of the clock she wondered what the banner was used for when it had been hung if it had ever seen the light of day how old it was who had made it and why she pictured an elderly woman of the parish at work on the design stitching her way into the good graces of the lord by making an offering for his place of worship how long had it taken her what sort of thread had she used for the quilting did anyone help did anyone know was there anyone who kept that sort of history of a church such games deborah thought what an effort she made to keep her mind in check how important it was to feel the tranquillity suggested by a visit to a church and communion with the lord she hadnt come here for that she had come because a walk down the clitheroe road in the late afternoon with her husband and the man who was his closest friend who was her own former lover who was the father of the child she might have had would never have seemed the best way to escape the feeling of having been betrayed dragged up to lancashire on false pretences she thought and gave a weak chuckle at the idea she who had been the ultimate betrayer she had found the sheaf of adoption papers tucked between his pyjamas and his socks and shed felt indignation pinch at her spine at the thought of his deception and at this intrusion into their time away from their real life in london he wanted to talk about it he explained when she flung the papers on the chest of drawers he felt it was time that they sorted things out there was nothing to sort to talk about it was to engage in the kind of conversation that spun like a cyclone gathering speed and energy from misunderstanding wreaking destruction from words hurled in anger and selfdefence a family isnt blood he would say so reasonably because god knew that simon allcourtst james was scientist scholar and reason incarnate a family is people people bond to one another out of time exposure and experience deborah we form our connections from the give and take of emotion from the growing sensitivity to anothers needs from mutual support a childs attachment to his parents has nothing to do with who gave him birth it comes from living day to day from being nurtured from being guided from having someone there someone consistent that he can trust you know this you do it isnt that it isnt that she would want to say even as she felt the tears which she so much despised cutting off her ability to speak then what is it tell me help me understand mineit wouldnt beyours it wouldnt be us cant you see that why wont you see he would look at her without speaking for a moment not to punish her with withdrawal as shed once thought his silences meant but to think and to problemsolve he would be considering a recommendation on a course of action for them to take when all she wanted was that he too would weep and display through his tears that he understood her grief because hed never do that she couldnt say the final unsayable to him she hadnt even yet said it to herself she didnt want to feel the sorrow that would accompany the words so she fought against their encroachment on her consciousness and she fended them off by railing against what she knew very well was his greatest strength that he never allowed a single circumstance to defeat him that he took life as he found it and bent it to his will you dont even care would be the words she chose this means nothing to you you dont want to understand me what a convenience a cycloneargument was shed gone walking that morning to avoid confrontation out on the moors with the wind in her face hiking across the uneven ground dodging the occasional spines of furze and tramping through heather gone brown with winter shed kept everything at bay but the exercise itself now however the quiet church admitted no such means of avoidance she could examine the memorials watch the dying light darken the colours in the windows read the bronze ten commandments that formed the reredos and decide how many shed broken so far she could scrape her feet across the agewarped fl oor of the townleyyoung pew and count the moth holes dotting the red mantle on the pulpit she could admire the woodwork of the rood screen and the tester she could wonder about the tonal quality of the bells but she could not avoid the voice of her conscience that spoke the truth and forced her to hear it filling out those papers means im giving up its admitting defeat it tells me im a failure not a woman at all it says the ache will fade but itll never end and it isnt fair this is the one thing that i wantthis single simple unattainable thing deborah stood and pushed open the boxpews gate with the sound of its creaking came simons words are you punishing yourself deborah does your conscience say youve sinned and the only expiation is to replace one life with another which you yourself create is that what youre doing and are you doing it for me do you think you owe me that perhaps in part for he was if anything forgiveness itself if he had been some other kind of man railing occasionally or throwing into her face the fact that she was at fault in this failure she might have been able to bear it more easily it was because he did nothing save look for solutions and express his growing alarm about her health that she found it so difficult to forgive herself on the worn red carpet she retraced her steps down the aisle to the north door of the church she stepped outside she shivered in the growing cold and tucked her scarf inside the collar of her coat across the street two cars were still parked in the constables drive a light was on in the porch but no one was stirring behind the front window deborah turned away and entered the graveyard it was lumpy like the moorland tangled at the edges with blackberry and bramble the stark red of dogwood growing in a thicket round one tomb on top of this an angel stood with head bowed and arms extended as if in final readiness to throw himself into the fi recoloured stems nothing much had been done to see to the upkeep of the graves mr sage had been dead for a month but the lack of concern for the churchs immediate surroundings seemed to have its genesis further back in time than that the path was overgrown with weeds the graves were mottled with black dead leaves the stones were splattered with mud and green with lichen among them one grave lay like a soundless reproach to the state to which time and lack of interest had reduced the others it was swept clean its blanket of tough moorland grass was clipped its stone was unblemished deborah went to inspect it anne alice shepherd the carving read shed been twentyseven years old at her death shed also been someones dearest wife in life and if the condition of her grave was any indication she was someones dearest wife in death as well a glint of colour caught deborahs eye it seemed as misplaced as did the red dogwood in the otherwise chromatic congruence of the graveyard and she bent to examine the base of the gravestone where two bright pink interlocking ovals shone against a nest of something grey upon her first inspection the grey seemed to flow out of the marble marker as if the stone were disintegrating to dust but on a closer look she saw that it was a small mound of ashes into whose centre an even smaller smooth stone had been carefully laid on this were painted the interlocking ovals which had first caught her eye two rings of neon pink perfectly executed each the same size it seemed an odd offering to make to the dead winter called for holly wreaths and made do with juniper at the worst it accepted those ghastly plastic flowers encased in plastic cases that grew mildew inside but ashes and stone and she now saw four slivers of wood holding the stone in place she touched her finger to it it was smooth as glass it was almost perfectly flat as well it had been placed on the ground directly at the centre of the gravestone but it lay among the ashes like a message for the living and not a fond remembrance of the dead two rings interlocked gently without disturbing the ashes in which the stone lay deborah picked it up its size and weight no more than that of a pound coin in her hand she removed one mitten and she felt the stone lie cold like a pool of standing water in her palm despite their odd colour the rings reminded her of wedding bands the sort one saw engraved in gold or embossed on invitations like their counterparts on paper they were the same sort of perfect circles that priests always seemed to speak of perfect circles of both the union and the unity that a strong marriage was supposed to embody a union of bodies of souls and of minds the minister had said at her own wedding more than two years ago these two before us shall now become one except that it never quite happened that way in anyones life as far as deborah could tell there was love and with it came growing trust there was intimacy and with it came the warmth of assurance there was passion and with it came moments of joy but if two hearts were to beat as one and if two minds were to think in like manner such integration had not occurred between herself and simon or if it had the triumph of its accomplishment had been evanescent yet there was love between them it was vast subsuming most of her life she could not imagine a world without it what she wondered was if the love between them was enough to forge through fear in order to reach understanding her fingers closed round the stone with its two pink rings painted brightly upon it she would keep it as a talisman it would serve as a fetish for what the unity of marriage was supposed to produce youve made a real cockup of things this time you know that dont you theyve settled themselves in to reinvestigate the death and youve not got yourself a sinners chance in hell of stopping them you understand that dont you colin carried his whisky glass into the kitchen he placed it directly beneath the tap although there were no other dishes in the sink and none at the moment that wanted washing on either the work top or the table he squirted a lemonscented detergent into the glass and ran water into it until soap bubbles frothed they slid over the rim and down one side while the water churned up more like foam in a guinness your careers on the line now everyone from constable nit chasing boys from borstal to huttonprestons cc is going to hear about this you realise that dont you youve a blot on you col and when next theres an opening in cid no ones likely to forget it you see that dont you colin unwound the striped dish cloth from the base of the tap and lowered it into the glass with the sort of precision he might have used when cleaning one of his shotguns he knuckled it into a wad shimmied it round and round and ran it carefully along the rim funny how he could still miss annie at an unexpected moment like this it always came without warning a quick surge of grief and longing that rose from his loins and ended near his heart and it always came from something so ordinary that he never considered how insidious was the action that precipitated it he was always unarmed and never unaffected he blinked a tremor shook him he rubbed the glass harder you think i can help you at this point dont you boy his father was continuing i stepped in once because you wanted to step in i didnt need you here pa are you out of your mind have you bloody gone daft has she got you in blinkers or just smiling like a prat with your trousers unzipped colin rinsed the glass dried it with the same care hed used in washing it and placed it next to the toaster which he noted was dusty and littered on its top with crumbs only then did he look at his father the chief inspector was standing in the doorway as was his habit blocking escape the only way to avoid conversation was to push past him to find employment in the pantry off the kitchen or to mess about in the garage in any case his father would follow colin recognised when the chief inspector was building up a good head of steam what in hell were you thinking of his father asked what in godsnamebloodystinking hell were you thinking of weve been through this before it was an accident i told hawkins i followed procedure bleeding hell you did you had a corpse on your hands with the stench of murder oozing from every pore tongue chewed to shreds body bloated like a pig the whole area beat down like hed been wrestling with the devil and you call it an accident you report that to your superior officer christ i cant think why they havent sacked you by now colin folded his arms across his chest leaned against the work top and made his breathing slow they both knew why he put the answer into words you didnt give them the chance pa but for that matter you didnt give me a chance either his fathers face flamed jesus god a chance this isnt a game this is life and death its still life and death only this time boyo youre on your own hed rolled up the sleeves of his shirt upon entering the house when theyd returned from their hike now he began unrolling them shoving the material down his arms and battering it into place on the wall to his right annies cat clock wagged its black pendulum tail as its eyes shifted with every tick and tock it was just about time for him to leave he had his sweet piece of girlflesh to see to all colin had to do was wait him out suspicious circumstances call for cid you know that boy dont you i had cid you had their bleeding photographer the crime team came they saw what i saw there was no indication that anyone other than mr sage had been there no footprints in the snow but his no witness who saw anyone else on the footpath that night the ground was thrashed up because hed had convulsions it was obvious from the look of him that hed had some sort of seizure i didnt need any di to tell me that his fathers fists clenched he raised his arms then dropped them youre as stubborn an ass as you were twenty years ago as stupid as well colin shrugged you have no choice now you know that dont you youve the whole sodding village in a quagmire over this wet fanny youve got such a fancy for colins own fist clenched he forced himself to release it thats it pa be on your way as i recall youve a fanny of your own waiting somewhere this evening youre not too old to be beaten boy true but this time youd probably lose after what i did you didnt need to do anything i didnt ask you to be here i didnt ask you to follow me round like a hound with a good scent of fox up his nose i had it under control his father gave a sharp derisive nod stubborn stupid and blind as well he left the kitchen and went to the front door where he battled his way into his jacket and shoved his left foot into one of his boots youre lucky theyve come i dont need them she did nothing save poison the vicar by accident pa his father jerked on the second boot and straightened up youd better pray on that son because theres one hell of a cloud hanging over you now in the village in clitheroe all the way to huttonpreston and the only way its about to clear off is if the yards cid dont smell something nasty in your lady friends bed he fished his leather gloves from his pocket and began to pull them on he didnt speak again until hed squashed his peaked cap on his head then he peered at his son sharply youve been straight with me havent you youve done no holding back pa because if youve covered up for her youre through youre sacked youre indicted thats the number you understand that dont you colin saw the anxiety in his fathers eyes and heard it beneath the anger in his voice he knew there was a measure of paternal solicitude in it but he also knew that beyond the reality that a coverup would lead to an investigation and a trial it was the complete incomprehensibility of the fact that he wasnt hungry that picked at his fathers peace he had never been restless he didnt yearn for a higher rank and the right to sit comfortably behind a desk he was thirtyfour years old and still a village constable and as far as his father was concerned there had to be a good reason why i like it wasnt good enough i love the countryside would never do the chief inspector might have bought i cant leave my annie a year ago but hed fly into a rage if colin spoke of annie while juliet spence was part of his life and now there was the potential humiliation of his sons involvement in the coverup of a crime hed rested easy when the coroners jury had reached their verdict hed be in a hornets nest of dread until scotland yard completed their investigation and verifi ed that there had been no crime colin his father said again youve been straight with me havent you nothing held back colin met his gaze directly he was proud he could do so nothing held back he said it was only when hed closed the door upon his father that colin felt his legs weaken he grasped onto the knob and leaned his forehead against the wood it was nothing to concern himself with no one would ever need to know hed not even thought of it himself until the scotland yard di had asked his question and triggered the memory of juliet and the gun hed gone to speak to her after receiving three angry phone calls from three frightened sets of parents whose sons had been out for a frolic on the grounds of cotes hall shed been living at the hall in the caretakers cottage just a year then a tall angular woman who kept to herself made her money from growing herbs and brewing up potions hiked vigorously across the moors with her daughter and seldom came into the village for anything she bought groceries in clitheroe she bought gardening supplies in burnley she examined crafts and sold plants and dried herbs in laneshawbridge she took her daughter on the occasional excursion but her choices were always a margin offbeat like the lewis textile museum rather than lancaster castle like hoghton towers collection of dolls houses rather than blackpools diversions by the sea but these were things he discovered later at first bucking down the rutted lane in his old land rover he thought only of the idiocy of a woman whod shoot into the darkness at three young boys making animal noises at the edge of the woods and a shotgun at that anything could have happened the sun was filtering through the oak wood on that afternoon beads of green lined the branches of trees as a late winter day gave way to spring he was rounding a bend in the blasted road that the townleyyoungs had been refusing to repair for the better part of a decade when through the open window came the sharp scent of cut lavender and with it one of those stabbing memories of annie so blinding it was so momentarily real that he trod on the brake half expecting her to come at a run from the woods there where the lavender had been planted thickly at the edge of the road more than one hundred years ago when cotes hall lay in readiness for its bridegroom who had never arrived theyd been out here a thousand times he and annie and she usually plucked at the lavender bushes as she made her way along the lane filling the air with the scent of both the flowers and the foliage collecting the buds to use in sachets among the wools and the linens at home he remembered those sachets as well clumsy little gauze pouches tied with frayed purple ribbon they always came apart within a week he was always picking bits of lavender out of his socks and brushing them off the sheets and despite his protest of come on girl what good do they do she kept industriously tucking the pouches into every corner of the house even once into his shoes saying moths col we cant have moths can we after she died he rid the house of them in an ineffective attempt to rid the house of her directly he swept her medicines from the bedside table directly he pulled her clothes from their hangers and pushed her shoes into rubbish bags directly he took her scent bottles into the rear garden and smashed them one by one with a hammer as if by that action he could smash away the rage he went on a search for annies sachets but the smell of lavender always thrust her before him it was worse than at night when his dreams allowed him to see her remember and long for what she once had been in the day with only the scent to haunt him she was just out of reach like a whisper carried past him on the wind he thought annie annie and stared at the lane with his hands gripping the steering wheel so he didnt see juliet spence at once and thus she had the initial advantage over him which he sometimes thought she maintained to this day she said are you quite all right constable and he snapped his head to the open window to see that she had come out of the woods with a basket on her arm and the knees of her blue jeans crusted with mud it didnt seem the least odd that mrs spence should know who he was the village was small she would have seen him before now even though they had never been introduced beyond that townleyyoung would have told her that he made periodic visits to the hall as part of his evening rounds she might even have noticed him on occasion from her cottage window when he rumbled through the courtyard and shone his torch here and there against the boarded windows of the mansion checking to make sure that its crumble to ruin stayed in the hands of nature and was not usurped by man he ignored her question and got out of the rover he said although he knew the answer already its mrs spence isnt it it is are you aware of the fact that last night you discharged your shotgun in the direction of three twelveyearold boys in the direction of children mrs spence she had odd bits of greenery roots and twigs in her basket along with a trowel and a pair of secateurs she picked up the trowel dislodged a heavy clod of mud from its tip and rubbed her fingers along the side of her jeans her hands were large and dirty her fingernails were clipped they looked like a mans she said come to the cottage mr shepherd she turned on her heel and walked back into the woods leaving him to jostle and jolt the last half mile along the road by the time hed crunched into the courtyard across the gravel and pulled to a halt in the shadow of the hall shed got rid of her basket brushed the mud from her jeans washed her hands so thoroughly that her skin looked abraded and set a kettle to boil on the cooker the front door stood open and when he mounted the single step that did for a porch she said im in the kitchen constable come in tea he thought questions and answers all controlled through the ritual of pouring passing sugar and milk shaking hob nobs onto a chipped floral plate clever he thought but instead of making tea she poured the boiling water slowly into a large metal pan in which glass jars stood in water of their own she set the pan onto the cooker as well things need to be sterile she said people die so easily when someone is foolish and thinks of making preserves without sterilising fi rst he looked round the kitchen and tried to get a glimpse of the larder beyond it the time of year seemed decidedly odd for what she was proposing what are you preserving i might ask the same of you she went to a cupboard and took down two glasses and a decanter from which she poured a liquid that was in colour somewhere just between dirttoned and amber it was cloudy and when she placed a glass in front of him on the table where hed gone to sit unbidden in an attempt to establish some sort of authority over her he picked it up suspiciously and sniffed what did it smell like bark old cheese she chuckled and swallowed a healthy portion of her own she put the decanter on the table sat down across from him and circled her hands round her glass go ahead she said its made from dandelion and elder i drink it every day whats it for i use it for purging she smiled and drank again he lifted the glass she watched not his hands as he lifted not his mouth as he drank but his eyes that was what struck him later when he thought about their fi rst encounter how she never took her eyes from his he himself was curious and gathered quick impressions about her she wore no makeup her hair was greying but her skin was lined only faintly so she couldnt be that much older than he she smelled vaguely of sweat and earth and a smudge of dirt made a patch above her eye like an oval birth mark her shirt was a mans overlarge frayed at the collar and ripped at the cuffs at the v made where it buttoned he could see the initial arc of one breast her wrists were large her shoulders were broad he imagined the two of them could wear each others clothes this is what its like she said quietly dark eyes she had with pupils so large that the eyes themselves looked black at fi rst its the fear of something larger than yourself something over which you have no control and only limited understanding thats inside her body with a power of its own then its the anger that some rotten disease cut into her life and yours and made a mess out of both and then its the panic because no one has any answers that you can believe in and everyones answer is different from everyone elses anyway then its the misery of being saddled with her and her illness when what you wanted signed up for made your vows to cherish was a wife and a family and normality then its the horror of being trapped in your house with the sights and the smells and the sounds of her dying but oddly enough in the end it all becomes the fabric of your life simply the way you live as man and wife you become accustomed to the crises and to the moments of relief you become accustomed to the grim realities of bed pans commodes vomit and urine you realise how important you are to her youre her anchor and her saviour her sanity and whatever needs you have of your own they become secondary unimportant selfish nasty even in light of the role you play for her so when its over and shes gone you dont feel released the way everyone thinks you probably feel instead you feel like a form of madness they tell you its a blessing that god finally took her but you know there isnt a god at all theres just this gaping wound in your life the hole that was the space she took up the way she needed you and how she fi lled your days she poured more of the liquid into his glass he wanted to make some sort of response but he wanted even more to run so that he wouldnt have to he removed his spectacles turning his head away from them rather than simply drawing them off the bridge of his nose and in doing so he managed to remove his eyes from hers she said death isnt a release for anyone but the dying for the living its a hell whose face just keeps on changing all the time you think youll feel better you think youll let the grief go someday but you never do not completely and the only people who can understand are the ones whove gone through it as well of course he thought her husband he said i loved her then i hated her then i loved her again she needed more than i had to give you gave what you could not in the end i wasnt strong when i should have been i put myself first while she was dying perhaps youd borne enough she knew what id done she never said a word but she knew he felt confined the walls too close he put on his spectacles he pushed away from the table and walked to the sink where he rinsed out his glass he looked out the window it faced not the hall but the woods shed planted an extensive garden he saw shed repaired the old greenhouse a wheelbarrow stood to one side of it filled with what looked like manure he imagined her shoveling it into the earth with the strong bold movements that her shoulders promised shed sweat as she did it shed pause to wipe her forehead on her sleeve she wouldnt wear gloves shed want to feel the wooden handle of the shovel and the sunlit heat of the earth and when she was thirsty the water she drank would pour down the sides of her mouth to dampen her neck a slow trickle of it would run between her breasts he made himself turn from the window to face her you own a shotgun mrs spence yes she stayed where she was although she changed her position one elbow on the table one hand curved round her knee and you discharged it last night yes why the lands posted constable approximately every one hundred yards theres a public footpath superseding any posting you know that very well as does townleyyoung these boys werent on the path to cotes fell nor were they headed back towards the village they were in the woods behind the cottage circling up towards the hall youre sure of that from the sound of their voices of course im sure and you warned them off verbally twice you didnt think to phone for help i didnt need help i just needed to be rid of them which you must admit i did fairly well with a shotgun blasting into the trees with pellets that with salt she ran her thumb and middle finger back through her hair it was a gesture that spoke more of impatience than vanity the gun was loaded with salt mr shepherd and do you ever load it with anything else on occasion yes but when i do i dont shoot at children he noticed for the first time that she was wearing earrings small gold studs that caught the light when she turned her head they were her only jewellery save for a wedding band that like his own was unadorned and nearly as thin as the lead of a pencil it too caught the light when her fi ngers tapped restlessly against her knee her legs were long he saw that shed taken off her boots somewhere and wore nothing now but grey socks on her feet he said because he needed to say something to keep his focus mrs spence guns are dangerous in the hands of the inexperienced she said if i had wanted to hurt someone believe me i would have done mr shepherd she stood he expected her to cross the kitchen bringing her glass to the sink returning the decanter to the cupboard invading his territory instead she said come with me he followed her into the sitting room which hed passed earlier on his way to the kitchen the late afternoons light fell in bands on the carpet flashed light and dark against her as she walked to an old pine dresser against one wall she pulled open the left top drawer she took out a small package of towelling that was done up with twine uncoiled and unwrapped the towelling fell away to expose a handgun a revolver looking particularly welloiled she said again come with me he followed her to the front door it still stood open and the march air was crisp with a breeze that lifted her hair across the courtyard the hall stood empty broken windows boarded old rainpipes rusted stone walls chipped she said second chimney pot from the right i think its left corner she lifted her arm aimed the gun and fired a wedge of terra cotta shot off the second chimney like a missile launched she said once again if i had wanted to hurt someone i would have done mr shepherd she returned to the sitting room and placed the gun on its wrapping which lay on the dresser top between a basket of sewing and a collection of photographs of her daughter do you have a licence for that he asked her no why not it wasnt necessary its the law not for the way i bought it she was standing with her back against the dresser he stayed in the doorway he thought about saying what he ought to say he considered doing what the law required of him the weapon was illegal she was in possession of it and he was supposed to remove it from the premises and charge her with the crime instead he said what do you use it for target practice mostly but otherwise protection from whom from anyone who isnt warned off by a shouting voice or a shotgun blast its a form of security you dont seem insecure anyone with a child in the house is insecure especially a woman on her own do you always keep it loaded yes thats foolish thats asking for trouble a smile fl ickered briefly round her mouth perhaps but ive never fired it in the company of anyone other than maggie before today it was foolish of you to show it to me yes it was why did you for the same reason i own it protection constable he stared at her across the room feeling his heart beating rapidly and wondering when it had begun to do so from somewhere in the house he heard water dripping from outofdoors the sharp trill of a bird he saw the rise and fall of her chest the v of her shirt where her skin seemed to glisten the stretch of blue jeans across her hips she was gangly and sweaty she was more than unkempt he couldnt have left her without a single coherent thought he took two strides and she met him in the centre of the room he pulled her into his arms his fi ngers diving through her hair his mouth on hers he hadnt known that such hunger for a woman could even exist had she resisted in the least he knew he would have forced her but she didnt resist and she clearly didnt want to her hands were in his hair at his throat against his chest and then her arms encircled him as he pulled her closer cradling her buttocks and grinding grinding grinding against her he heard the snap of buttons falling away as he pulled off her shirt seeking her breasts and then his own shirt was off and her mouth was on him kissing and biting a trail to his waist where she knelt fumbled with his belt and pushed down his trousers jesus god he thought jesus jesus jesus he knew only two terrors that he might actually explode into her mouth that she might release him before he could do so chapter nine she couldnt possibly have been less like annie perhaps that had been the initial attraction in place of annies soft willing compliance he had put juliets independence and strength she was easily taken and eager to be taken but not easily known during the fi rst hour of their lovemaking on that march afternoon shed said only two words god and harder the second of which she repeated three times and when theyd had enough of each other long after theyd moved from the sitting room up the stairs to her bedroom where theyd tried out both the floor and the bed she turned on her side with one arm cradling her head and she said whats your christian name mr shepherd or am i to go on calling you mr shepherd he traced the faint lightning bolt of skin that puckered her stomach and was the only indication besides the child herself that shed given birth he felt there wasnt suffi cient time in his life to come to know every inch of her body well enough and as he lay beside her having had her four times already he began to ache to have her again hed never made love to annie more than once in any twentyfourhour period hed never thought to try and while the loving of his wife had been tender and sweet leaving him feeling at once at peace and somehow in her debt the loving of juliet had ignited his senses unearthing a desire that no amount of having her seemed to sate after an evening a night an afternoon together he could catch the scent of her on his hands on his clothes when he combed his hair and find himself wanting her driven to telephone her saying only her name to which her low voice would respond yes when but to her first question he merely said colin what did your wife call you col and your husband im called juliet and your husband his name what did he call you she ran her fingers along his eyebrows the curve of his ear his lips youre terribly young was her reply im thirtythree and you she smiled a small sad movement of her mouth im older than thirtythree old enough to be what wiser than i am far wiser than ive been this afternoon his ego replied you wanted it didnt you oh yes as soon as i saw you sitting in the rover yes i wanted it you whatever was that some sort of potion you had me drink she raised his hand to her mouth took his index finger between her lips sucked on it gently he caught his breath she released him and chuckled you dont need a potion mr shepherd how old are you too old for this to be anything more than a single afternoon you dont mean that i have to over time hed chipped away at her reluctance she revealed her age fortythree and she surrendered time and again to desire but when he talked of the future she turned to stone her answer was always the same you need a family children to raise you were meant to be a father i cant give that to you rot women older than you have babies ive had my baby colin indeed maggie was the equation to be solved if he was to win her mother and he knew it but she was elusive a spritechild who had watched him solemnly from across the courtyard when he left the cottage on that first afternoon she was clutching a mangy cat in her arms and her eyes were solemn she knows he thought he said hello and her name but she disappeared round the side of the hall and ever since then shed been polite a very model of good breeding but he could see the judgement on her face and he could have predicted the manner in which she would exact retribution from her mother long before juliet realised where maggies infatuation with nick ware was heading he could have interceded in some way he knew nick ware after all he was wellacquainted with the boys parents he could have been useful had juliet let him instead shed allowed the vicar to enter their lives and it hadnt taken robin sage long to forge what colin himself had been unable to create a fragile bond with maggie he saw them talking together outside the church strolling into the village with the vicars heavy hand at rest on the girls shoulder he watched them perched on the graveyard wall with their backs to the road their faces towards cotes fell and the vicars arm arcing out to illustrate the curve of the land or some point he was making he noted the visits maggie had paid to the vicarage and he used these last to broach the subject with juliet its nothing juliet said shes looking for her father she knows it cant be you she thinks youre too young and besides youve never left lancashire have you so shes trying out mr sage for the role she thinks her fathers out searching for her somewhere why not as a vicar which gave him the opening who is her father her face settled into the familiar firm lines of withdrawal he sometimes wondered if her silence was a way she maintained his level of passion for her keeping herself more intriguing than other women and thus challenging him to prove an entirely nonexistent dominance over her by cooperatively continuing to perform in her bed but she seemed unaffected by that as well saying only nothing lasts forever does it colin whenever his desperation to know the truth forced him to allude to leaving her which he never would which he knew he never could who is he juliet he isnt dead is he the most she had ever said she said in bed one june night with a wash of moonlight against her skin making a dappled pattern from the summer leaves outside the window she said maggie wants to think that is it the truth she closed her eyes briefly he lifted her hand kissed its palm rested it against his chest juliet is it the truth i think it is think are you married to him still colin please were you ever married to him her eyes closed again he could see the faint glimmer of tears beneath the lashes and for a mindless moment he couldnt understand the source of either her pain or her sadness then he said oh god juliet juliet were you raped is maggiedid someone she whispered dont humiliate me you were never married were you please colin but that fact made no difference still she wouldnt marry him too old for you was the excuse she gave not however too old for the vicar standing in his house his head pressed against the cool front door the sound of his fathers departure long faded colin shepherd felt inspector lynleys question bouncing round his skull like a persistent echo of all his doubts was it likely shed take on a lover after so brief an acquaintance he squeezed his eyes shut what difference did it make that mr sage had gone out to cotes hall just to talk about maggie the village constable had merely gone out there to caution a woman about discharging a shotgun only to find himself tearing off her clothes in a fever to mate after less than an hour in her company and she didnt protest she didnt try to stop him if anything she was as aggressive as he when one considered it what kind of a woman was that a siren he thought and he tried to turn away from his fathers voice you got to take the upper hand with a woman boyo and you got to keep it right from the first theyll make you a ninny give em the chance had she done that with him with sage as well shed said he was visiting her to talk about maggie he meant well she said and she ought to listen shed declared herself at the end of her rope when it came to reasonable discussion with the girl so if the vicar had ideas who was she to turn a deaf ear to them and then shed searched his face you dont trust me colin do you no not an inch not a moment of being alone with another man in that isolated cottage where the solitude itself was a call for seduction nonetheless hed said of course i do you can come as well if youd like sit between us at the table make certain i dont take off my shoe and rub my foot against his leg i dont want that then what i just want things settled between us i want people to know things cant be settled in the way youd like and now they never would be unless and until scotland yard cleared her name because all her protests of their age difference aside he knew he couldnt marry juliet spence and maintain his position in winslough while so many doubts filled the atmosphere with whispered speculations whenever they appeared in public together and he couldnt leave winslough married to juliet if he hoped to keep peace with her daughter he was caught in a trap of his own devising only new scotland yard cid could spring him the doorbell rang above his head so shrill and unexpected a sound that he started the dog began barking colin waited for him to trot out of the sitting room quiet he said sit leo complied head cocked to one side waiting colin opened the door the sun was gone dusk was drawing quickly towards night the light on the porch which hed switched on to welcome new scotland yard now shone on the wiry hair of polly yarkin she was clutching a scarf twined between her fingers and pinching closed the collar of her old navy coat her felt skirt dangled overlong to her ankles which were themselves encased in battered boots she moved uneasily from foot to foot she offered a quick smile i was finishing up in the vicarage wasnt i and i couldnt help but notice she cast a look back in the direction of the clitheroe road i saw th two gentlemen leave ben at the pub said scotland yard i wouldnt have known except ben phoned him being a church warden you know and told me theyd probably want to have themselves a poke through the vicarage he said for me to wait but they didnt come is everything all right one hand squeezed her collar more tightly and the other grappled with the loose ends of the scarf he could see her mothers name upon it and he recognised it as a souvenir advertising her business in blackpool shed gone through scarves beer mats printed matchbook covers like she was running some posh hotel and shed even given out free chopsticks for a while when she was purely truly positive that tourism from the orient was about to reach an alltime high rita yarkin aka rita rularski was nothing if not a born entrepreneur colin he realised he was staring at the scarf wondering why rita had chosen neon lime green and decorated that colour with crimson diamonds he stirred glanced down saw that leo was wagging his tail in welcome the dog recognised polly is everything all right she asked again i saw your dad leave as well and i spoke to him i was sweeping the porch but he didnt seem to hear because he didnt say anything so i wondered is everything all right he knew he couldnt leave her standing on the porch in the cold hed known her from childhood after all and even if that had not been the case shed come on an errand that at least wore the guise of a friends concern come in he closed the door behind her she stood in the entry balling up her scarf rolling it round and round in her hands before shoving it into her pocket she said ive got these muddy old boots on dont i its all right shll i leave them here not if youve just put them on at the vicarage he returned to the sitting room with the dog at his heels the fire was still burning and he added another log to it watching fresh wood settle into flame he felt the heat reaching out in waves towards his face he remained where he was and let it bake his skin behind him he heard pollys hesitant footsteps her boots squeaked her clothing rustled havent been here in a while she said diffi dently she would find it considerably changed annies chintzcovered furniture gone annies prints off the wall annies carpet torn out and everything replaced helterskelter without taste merely to meet need it was functional which was all hed required of the house and its furnishings once annie had died he expected her to remark upon it but she said nothing he finally turned from the fi re she hadnt removed her coat she had only come three paces into the room she smiled at him tremulously bit cold in here she said stand by the fi re ta think i will she held her hands out towards the flames then unbuttoned her coat but didnt remove it she was wearing an overlarge lavender pullover that clashed with both the rust of her hair and the magenta of her skirt a faint odour of mothballs seemed to rise from its wool you all right colin he knew her well enough to realise shed go on asking the question until he answered it shed never been one to make the connection between refusal to respond and reluctance to reveal fine would you like a drink her face lit oh yes ta sherry she nodded he went to the table and poured her some taking nothing for himself she knelt by the fire and petted the dog when she took the glass from him she stayed where she was on her knees resting on the heels of her boots there was a substantial crust of dried mud upon them speckles of it had settled on the fl oor he didnt want to join her although it would have been the natural thing to do theyd sat with annie in a ring before this fi replace many times before she died but their circumstances had been different then no sin made a lie of their friendship so he chose the armchair and sat on the edge of it resting his arms against his knees his hands clasped loosely like a barrier in front of him who phoned them she asked scotland yard the crippled man phoned for the other i imagine hed come to see mr sage what do they want to reopen the case they said they didnt have to say it but do they know somethinghas something new come up they dont need anything new they just need to have doubts they share them with clitheroe cid or huttonpreston constabulary they start nosing about are you worried should i be she dropped her gaze from him to her glass she had yet to take a drink of the sherry he wondered when she would your dads a bit hard on you is all she said hes always been that hasnt he i thought he might use this to ride you rough he looked real cheesed off when he left im not worried about pas reaction if thats what you mean thats good then isnt it she pivoted the small sherry glass on her palm next to her leo yawned and settled his head on her thighs hes always liked me she said ever since hes a pup hes a nice dog is leo colin made no reply he watched the fl ames dance the light against her hair and cast a golden hue on her skin she was attractive in a quirky sort of way the fact that she didnt seem to realise this had at one time been part of her charm now it served as the key to a memory hed long tried to forget she looked up he moved his eyes away she said in a low uncertain voice i cast the circle for you last night colin to mars for strength rita wanted me to petition for myself but i didnt i did it for you i want the best for you colin polly i remember things we used to be such friends didnt we wed hike out by the reservoir wed see films in burnley we went to blackpool once with annie but we were friends as well me and you he gazed at his hands so that he wouldnt have to meet her eyes we were but we made a mess of it all we didnt we only annie knew directly i walked into the bedroom she knew she could read it all over me and i could see that reading on her face she said how was your picnic did you have a nice time did you get some fresh air col she knew we didnt mean to hurt her she never asked me to be faithful did you know that she didnt expect it once she knew she was going to die she reached for my hand one night in bed and she said take care of yourself col i know how youre feeling i wish we could be that way again with each other but we cant dear lover so you must take care of yourself its all right then why dont you see because that night i swore to myself that whatever it took i wouldnt betray her and i did it anyway with you her friend we didnt intend it it wasnt like it was planned he looked at her again a sharp movement of lifting his head that she apparently didnt expect him to make because she fl inched in response a bit of the sherry she held slopped over the side of her glass and onto her skirt leo sniffed at it curiously what does it matter he said annie was dying you and i were fucking in a barn on the moors we cant change either one of those facts we cant make them pretty and we cant tart them up but if she told you no notwithherfriend pollys eyes grew bright but she didnt shed the tears you closed your eyes that day colin you turned your head away you never touched me and barely spoke to me ever again how much more do you want me to suffer for what happened and now you she gulped for breath now i she dropped her eyes now i what now her answer sounded like a chant i burnt cedar for you colin i put the ashes on her grave i put the ring stone with them i gave annie the ring stone its sitting on her grave you can see it if you want i gave up the ring stone i did it for annie what now he asked again she bent to the dog rubbed her cheek against his head answer me polly she raised her head now youre punishing me more how and it isnt fair because i love you colin i loved you first ive loved you longer than her her who how am i punishing you i know you better than anyone ever could you need me youll see mr sage even told me her final statement brought gooseflesh upon him told you what that you need me that you dont know it yet but you will soon enough if i just stay true and i have been true all these years always i live for you colin her avowal of devotion was less than important when the implication behind mr sage even told me demanded exploration and action sage talked to you about juliet didnt he colin asked what did he say what did he tell you nothing he gave you some sort of assurance what was it that she would end things between us no you know something i dont tell me theres nothing he stood he was three feet from her but still she shrank back leo raised his head his ears perking up a growl in his throat as he sensed the tension polly set her sherry glass on the hearth and kept her eyes and one hand on its base as if it might take flight should she not keep watch what do you know about juliet nothing i told you i said that already about maggie nothing about her father what did robin sage tell you nothing but you were sure enough about me and juliet werent you he made you sure what did you do to get the information from him polly her hair sailed round her shoulders as her head flew up whats that supposed to mean did you sleep with him you were alone with the man for hours in the vicarage every day did you try some kind of spell i never did you see a way to ruin things between us did he give you an idea no colin did you kill him polly is juliet taking the blame she jumped to her feet planted them apart punched her fists to her hips just listen to yourself you talk about me shes got you bewitched she put you in place got you eating from her hand murdered the vicar and got away with it clean and youre so blinded by your own stupid lust that you cant even see how shes used you it was an accident it was murder murder murder and she did it and everyone knows she did it no one can think you could be such a fool as to believe a single word that she says except we all know why you believe her dont we we all know what youre getting we even know when so dont you imagine she might have been giving our precious little vicar just a bit of the same the vicarthe vicarcolin felt it all at once bones blood and heat his muscles coiling and his mothers voice shouting no ken dont as his arm soared up right palm to left shoulder and he made the primary lunge to strike lungs full heart raging wanting contact and pain and retribution and polly cried out staggered back her boot hit the sherry glass it flew towards the fi re and broke on the fender the sherry dripped and sizzled the dog began to bark and colin stood there at the ready aching to strike with polly not polly and himself not himself and the past and the present howling round him like the wind arm raised features twisted into an expression hed seen a thousand times but never felt on his face never thought to feel never dreamed to feel because he couldnt actually be the man hed sworn to himself would never exist leos barking turned to yelps they sounded wild and fearful quiet colin snapped polly cringed she took another step backwards her skirt skimmed the fl ames colin grabbed her arm to draw her from the fi re she jerked away leo backed off his nails scraped on the floor aside from the fi re and colins torn breathing they made the only sound in the room colin held his hand up at the level of his chest he stared at the shaking fi ngers and palm hed never struck a woman in his life he wouldnt have thought he was even capable of doing so his arm dropped like a weight polly i cast the circle for you for annie as well polly im sorry im not thinking right im not thinking at all she began to button her coat he could see that her hands were trembling worse than his and he made a move to help her but stopped when she cried no as if with the expectation of being struck polly his voice sounded desperate even to himself but he didnt know what he wanted to say shes got you not thinking polly said thats what it is but you dont see that do you you dont even want to cause how can you face it if the very same thing that makes you hate me is what keeps you from seeing the truth about her she took out her scarf made a shaky attempt to fold it into a triangle and fl ipped it over her head to hold down her hair she knotted its ends beneath her chin she moved past him without a glance squeaking across the room in her ancient boots she paused at the door and spoke without looking back while you were fucking that day in the barn she said quite clearly i was making love on the sitting room sofa josie wragg asked incredulously you mean right here with your mum and dad in the house you never she got as close as she could to the mirror above the basin and applied the eyeliner with an inexpert hand a blob of it went into her lashes she blinked then squinted when it made contact with her eyeball ooooh it stings oh crikey moses now look what ive done shed given herself a makeup black eye she rubbed it with a tissue and spread the mess across her cheek you didnt really she said i dont believe it pam rice balanced on the edge of the bathtub and blew cigarette smoke towards the ceiling to do it she let her head hang back on her neck in a lazy movement that maggie was sure shed seen in an old american film bette davis joan crawford maybe lauren bacall want to see the stain for yourself pam asked josie frowned what stain pam flicked ash into the bathtub and shook her head lord you dont know anything do you josephine bean i most certainly do really great you tell me what stain josie worked this one over maggie could tell she was trying to think up a reasonable answer even though she pretended to be concentrating on the mess shed made of her eyes this was second to the mess shed already made of her nails last night having purchased a doityourself acrylic nail kit through the post when her mother had refused to allow her to make a trip to blackpool in order to have artificial nails put on by a stylist the result of josies attempt to extend her own stubs to what she called drivemenwild length looked like elephantmanofthefi ngers they were in the upstairs and only bathroom of pam rices terraced house across the street from crofters inn while directly below them in the kitchen pams mummy fed the twins an afternoon tea of scrambled eggs and beans on toast to the accompaniment of edwards happy shouting and alans laughter they watched josie experiment with her most recent cosmetic acquisition a halfbottle of eyeliner purchased from a fifth former whod pinched it from his sisters chest of drawers gin josie finally announced everyone knows you drink it weve seen the fl ask pam laughed and did her smokeattheceiling routine again she flipped her cigarette into the toilet it made a sound like psst as it sank she held on to the edge of the bathtub and leaned back again farther this time so that her breasts jutted towards the ceiling she still wore her school uniform all three of them did but shed removed the jersey unbuttoned the blouse to expose her cleavage and rolled up the sleeves pam had the ability to make an inanimate white cotton blouse just scream to be stripped from her body god im horny as a shegoat she said if todd doesnt want to do it tonight im getting it off with some other bloke she swivelled her head in the direction of the door where maggie sat on the fl oor crosslegged hows our nickie she asked casual and cool maggie rolled her cigarette in her fi ngers shed taken six obligatory puffs in by the mouth out through the nose nothing in the lungs and was waiting for the rest to burn itself down so that she could let it join pams in the toilet fine she said and big pam asked swinging her head so that her hair moved like a single curtain of blonde just like a salami thats what ive heard is it true maggie looked at josies reflection in the mirror she made a wordless plea for rescue well is it josie said in pams direction what the stain gin like i said semen pam said looking largely bored seewhat come where christ alive youre a twit thats what it is what the stain its from him okay it drips out all right when youre done understand josie studied her reflection making another heroic attempt with the eyeliner oh that she said and dipped the brush into the bottle from the way you were talking i thought it was sposed to be something weird pam snagged up her shoulder bag that lay on the floor she pulled out her cigarettes and lit up again mum was frothing like a dog when she saw it she even smelled it do you believe that she started in with you miserable little tart went on to youre a real cheap piece for any one of these blokes and fi nished with i cant hold my head up in the village any longer neither can your dad i told her if i had my own bedroom i wouldnt have to use the sofa and she wouldnt have to see the stains she smiled and stretched todd goes on and on so long he must come a bloody quart every time and with a sly look at maggie what about nick all i can says i hope youre taking precautions josie put in quickly ever maggies friend because if he does it as many times as you said and if he makes you well you know get fulfilled each time then youre heading for trouble pam rice pams cigarette stopped midway to her lips whatre you talking about you know dont act like you dont i dont jose explain it to me she took a deep drag but maggie could see that she did it mostly to hide her smile josie took the bait if you have ayou know orgasm right what about it it helps the swimmy things get up inside you more easy which is why lots of women dont you know have an orgasm because they dont want the swimmy things oh and they cant relax that too i read it in a book pam hooted she swung off the bathtub and opened the window through which she shouted josephine eugene the brains of a bean before dissolving into laughter and sliding down the wall to sit on the fl oor she took another hit from her cigarette pausing now and then to give in to the giggles maggie was glad shed opened the window it was getting harder and harder to breathe part of her knew it was just because of the amount of cigarette smoke in the little room the other part knew it was because of nick she wanted to say something to rescue josie from pams funmaking but she wasnt sure what would serve to deflect the ridicule at the same time as it revealed nothing about herself when was the last time you read anything about it josie asked recapping her bottle of eyeliner and examining in the mirror the fruits of her labour i dont need to read i experience pam replied research is as important as experience pam really and exactly what sort have you done i know things josie was combing her hair it made no difference no matter what she did to it it flopped right back into the same frightful style fringe high on the forehead bristles on the neck she should never have tried to cut it herself you know things from books and observation imperial evidence thats called provided by mum and mr wragg this piece of information seemed to strike pams fancy she kicked off her shoes and drew her legs beneath her she fl icked her cigarette into the toilet and made no comment when maggie took the opportunity of doing the same what she asked eyes dancing happily at the potential for gossip how i listen at the door when theyre having relations he keeps saying come on dora come on come on come on baby come on love and she never makes a sound which is also by the way how i know for a fact that he isnt my dad when pam and maggie greeted this news blankly she went on with well he cant be can he look at the evidence shes never once been you know fulfilled by him im her only kid i was born six months after they got married i found this old letter from a bloke called paddy lewis where in the drawer where she keeps her knickers and i could tell shed done it with him and been fulfilled lots before she married mr wragg how long before two years so what were you pam asked the longest pregnancy on record i dont mean they only did it once pam rice i mean they were doing it regular two years before she married mr wragg and she kept the letter didnt she she must still love him but you look exactly like your dad pam said he isnt all right all right you look like mr wragg thats just coincidence josie said paddy lewis must look like mr wragg as well and that makes sense doesnt it shed be looking for someone to remind her of paddy so then maggies dad must look like mr shepherd pam announced all her mums lovers must have looked like him josie said pam in a pained fashion fair was only fair one could speculate indefi nitely about ones own parents but it wasnt proper to do the same about anyone elses not that pam ever worried much about what was proper before she opened her mouth maggie said softly mummy never had a lover before mr shepherd she had at least one pam corrected she didnt she did where else did you come from from my dad and mummy right her lover her husband really what was his name maggie picked at a loose thread on her jersey she tried to poke it through the knitting to the other side what was his name maggie shrugged you dont know because he didnt have a name or maybe she didnt know it because youre a bastard pam josie took a quick step forward with the eyeliner bottle closed in her fi st what watch your mouth pam flipped back her hair with a languid movement of her hand oh stop the drama josie you cant tell me that you believe all this rot about race car drivers and mummies running off and daddies out looking for their darling little girls for the next thirteen years maggie felt the room growing larger about her felt herself shrinking with a hollowness inside she looked at josie but couldnt quite see her because she seemed to be standing in a mist if they were married at all pam was continuing conversationally she probably gave him his cards along with some parsnip at dinner one night pam maggie pushed herself against the door and from there to her feet she said i have to be going i think mummy will be wondering god knows we wouldnt want that pam said their coats were in a pile on the fl oor maggie pulled hers out but could not make her fingers and hands work well enough to get it on it didnt matter she was feeling rather hot she threw open the door and hurried down the stairs she heard pam saying with a laugh nick ware better watch he doesnt cross maggies mum and josie responding oh shove it wont you before she came clattering down the stairs herself maggie she called out on the street it was dark a cold breeze from the west funnelled down the road from north yorkshire and turned into a gust at the centre of the village where crofters inn and pams house stood maggie blinked and wiped the wet from beneath her eyes as she thrust one arm into her coat and started walking maggie josie caught her up less than ten steps from pams front door its not what you think i mean it is but it isnt i didnt know you good then pam and i talked i told her about your dad its true but thats all i ever told her i swear it it was wrong of you to tell josie dragged her to a halt it was yes yes but i didnt tell her in fun i wasnt making fun i told her cause it made us alike you and me we arent alike mr wraggs your father and you know it josie oh maybe he is that would be my luck wouldnt it mum running off with paddy lewis and me stuck in winslough with mr wragg but thats not what i mean i mean we dream were different we think bigger thoughts we got our sights set on stuff bigger than this village i used you as a point of illustration see i said im not the only one pamela bammela maggie has thoughts about her dad too and she wanted to know what your thoughts were and i told her and i shouldnt have but i wasnt making fun she knows about nick never not from me i never said a word and i never will then why does she ask because she thinks she knows something she keeps hoping she can make you say maggie scrutinised her friend there wasnt much light but in what little shed itself upon josies face from a single street lamp that stood at the drive of the crofters inn car park across the road she looked earnest enough she looked a little odd as well the eyeliner hadnt dried thoroughly when she opened her eyes after having applied it so her eyelids were streaked in the way ink runs when water pours over it i didnt tell her about nick josie said again thats between me and you always i promise maggie looked down at her shoes they were scuffed above them her navy tights were speckled with mud maggie its true really he came over last night weit happened again mummy knows no josie grasped her arm and led her across the street and into the car park they sidestepped a glossy silver bentley and headed down the path that led to the river you never said i wanted to tell you i was waiting all day to tell you but she kept hanging about that pam josie said as they went through the gate shes just like a bloodhound when it comes to gossip a narrow path angled away from the inn and descended towards the river josie led the way some thirty yards along an old icehouse stood built into the bank where the river plunged sharply through a fall of limestone sending up a spray that kept the air cool on the hottest days of summer it was fashioned from the same stone used in the rest of the village and like the rest of the village its roof was slate but it had no windows just a door whose lock josie had long ago broken turning the icehouse into her lair she shouldered her way inside just a sec she said ducking beneath the lintel she fumbled about bumped into something said holy hell on wheels and struck a match light flared a moment later maggie entered a lantern stood atop an old nail barrel sending out an arc of hissing yellow light this fell upon a patchwork of carpet worn through here and there to its strawcoloured backing two threelegged milking stools a cot covered by a purple eiderdown and an upended crate overhung by a mirror this last made do for a dressing table and into it josie placed the bottle of eyeliner new companion to her contraband mascara blusher lipstick nail polish and assorted hairgoo she hustled up a bottle of toilet water and sprayed it liberally on walls and floor like a libation offered to the goddess of cosmetics it served to mask the odours of must and mildew that hung in the air want a smoke she asked once she made sure the door was closed snugly upon them maggie shook her head she shivered it was clear why the icehouse had been built in this spot josie lit a gauloise from a packet she took from among her cosmetics she fl opped onto the cot and said whatd your mum say howd she fi nd out maggie pulled one of the two stools closer to the lantern it gave off a substantial amount of heat she just knew like before and i dont care what she thinks i wont stop i love him well she cant follow you everywhere can she josie lay on her back one arm behind her head she raised her bony knees crossed one leg over the other and bounced her foot god youre so lucky she sighed the tip of her cigarette glowed firered is hewell you knowlike they say does hefulfi ll you i dont know it goes sort of fast oh but is heyou know what i mean like pam wanted to know yes god no wonder you dont want to stop she squirmed deeper into the eiderdown and held out her arms to an imaginary lover come n get me baby she said past the cigarette that bobbed in her lips its waiting right here and its all for you and then squirming on her side youre taking precautions arent you not really her eyes became saucers maggie i never you got to take precautions or he does at least does he wear a rubber maggie cocked her head at the oddity of the question a rubber what on earth i dont think so where would he i mean he may have one in his pocket from school josie bit her lip but didnt quite manage to catch the grin not that kind of rubber dont you know what it is maggie stirred uneasily on the stool i know of course i do i know right look its like this squishy plastic stuff he puts on his thing before he puts it in you so you dont get pregnant is he using that oh maggie twisted a lock of her hair that no i dont want him to use it dont wantare you crazy he has to use one why because if he doesnt youll have a baby but you said before that a woman needs to be forget what i said there are always exceptions im here arent i im mr wraggs arent i mum was panting and moaning with this bloke paddy lewis but i came along when she was cold as ice thats pretty much proof that anything can happen no matter if you get fulfi lled or not maggie thought this over running her fi nger round and round the last button on her coat good then she said good maggie bleeding saints on the altar you cant i want a baby she said i want nicks baby if he tries to use a rubber i wont even let him josie goggled at her youre not yet fourteen so so you cant be a mummy when you havent fi nished school why not what would you do with a baby where would you go nick and i would get married then wed have the baby then wed be a family you cant want that maggie smiled with real pleasure oh yes i can chapter ten lynley murmured good god at the sudden drop in temperature when he crossed the threshold between the pub and the dining room of crofters inn in the pub the large fireplace had managed to disperse enough heat to create pools of at least moderate warmth in its farthest corners but the weak central heating of the dining room did little more than provide the uncertain promise that the side of ones body closest to the wall heater would not go numb he joined deborah and st james at their corner table ducking his head each time he passed beneath one of the low ceilings great oak beams at the table an additional electric fire had been thoughtfully provided by the wraggs and from it semisubstantial waves of heat lapped against their ankles and floated towards their knees enough tables were laid with white linen silverware and inexpensive crystal to accommodate at least thirty diners but it appeared that the three of them would be sharing the room only with its unusual display of artwork this consisted of a series of giltframed prints which depicted lancashires most prominent claim to fame the good friday gathering at malkin tower and the charges of witchcraft that both preceded and followed it the artist had depicted the principals in an admirably subjective fashion roger nowell the magistrate looked suitably grim and barrelchested with wrath vengeance and the power of christian justice incised upon his features chattox looked appropriately decrepit wizened bent and dressed in rags elizabeth davies with her rolling eyes uncontrolled by ocular muscles looked deformed enough to have sold herself for the devils kiss the rest of them comprised a leering group of demonlovers with the exception of alice nutter who stood apart eyes lowered ostensibly maintaining the silence she had taken with her to her grave the only convicted witch among them who had sprung from the upper class ah lynley said in acknowledgement of the prints as he shook out his table napkin lancashires celebrities dinner and the prospect of disputation did they or didnt they were they or werent they more likely the prospect of loss of appetite st james said he poured a glass of fumé blanc for his friend theres truth in that i suppose hanging halfwitted girls and helpless old women on the strength of a single mans apopleptic seizure does give one pause doesnt it how can we eat drink and be merry when dyings as close as the dining room wall who are they exactly deborah asked as lynley took an appreciative sip of the wine and reached for one of the rolls which josie wragg had only moments before deposited on the table i know theyre the witches but do you recognise them tommy only because theyre in caricature i doubt id know them if the artist had done a less hogarthian job of it lynley gestured with his butter knife you have the godfearing magistrate and those he brought to justice demdike and chattox theyre the shrivelled ones i should think then alizon and elizabeth davies the motherdaughter team the others ive forgotten save alice nutter shes the one who looks so decidedly out of place frankly i thought she looked like your aunt augusta lynley paused in buttering a portion of roll he gave the print of alice nutter a fair examination theres something in that they have the same nose he grinned ill have to think twice about dining at aunts next christmas eve god knows what shell serve in disguise for wassail is that what they did mix some sort of potion cast a spell on someone make it rain toads that last sounds vaguely australian lynley said he looked the other prints over as he munched on his roll and sifted through his memory for the details one of his papers at oxford had touched upon the seventeenthcentury hue and cry over witchcraft he remembered the lecturer vividly twentysix years old and a strident feminist who was as beautiful a woman as he had ever seen and approximately as approachable as a feeding shark wed call it the domino effect today he said one of them burgled malkin tower the home of one of the others and then had the audacity to wear in public something shed stolen when she was brought before the magistrate she defended herself by accusing the malkin tower family of witchcraft the magistrate might have concluded that this was a ridiculous stab at deflecting culpability but a few days later alizon davies of that same tower cursed a man who within minutes was stricken with an apopleptic seizure from that point on the hunt for witches was on successfully it seems deborah said gazing at the prints herself quite women began confessing to all sorts of ludicrous misbehaviours once they were brought before the magistrate having familiars in the form of cats dogs and bears making clay dolls in the persons of their enemies and stabbing thorns into them killing off cows making milk go bad ruining good ale now theres crime worthy of punishment st james noted was there proof deborah asked if an old woman mumbling to her cat is proof if a curse overheard by a villager is proof but then why did they confess why would anyone confess social pressure fear they were uneducated women brought before a magistrate from another class they were taught to bow before their betters if only metaphorically what more effective way to do it than to agree with what their betters were suggesting even though it meant their death even though but they could have denied it they could have kept silent alice nutter did they hanged her anyway deborah frowned what an odd thing to celebrate with prints on the walls tourism lynley said dont people pay to see the queen of scots death mask not to mention some of the grimmer spots in the tower of london st james said the chapel royal wakefi eld tower why bother with the crown jewels when you can see the chopping block lynley added crime doesnt pay but death brings them running to part with a few quid is this irony from the man whos made at least five pilgrimages to bosworth field on the twentysecond of august deborah asked blithely an old cow pasture in the back of beyond where you drink from the well and swear to richards ghost you would have fought for the yorks thats not death lynley said with some dignity lifting his glass to salute her thats history my girl someones got to be willing to set the record straight the door that led to the kitchen swung open and josie wragg presented them with their starters muttering smoked salmon here pâté here prawn cocktail here as she set each item on the table after which she hid both the tray and her hands behind her back enough rolls she asked the question of everyone in general but she made a poor job of surreptitiously examining lynley fine st james said get you more butter i dont think so thanks wine okay mr wraggs got a cellarful if thats gone off wine does that sometimes you know you got to be careful if you dont store it right the cork gets all dried up and shrivelled and the air gets in and the wine turns salty or something the wines fine josie were looking forward to the bordeaux as well mr wragg hes a connoisseur of wine she pronounced it connoyser and bent to scratch her ankle from which activity she looked up at lynley youre not here on holiday are you not exactly she straightened up reclasping the tray behind her thats what i thought mum said you were a detective from london and i thought at first youd come to tell her something about paddy lewis which she of course wouldnt be likely to share with me for fear id spread it to mr wragg which of course i would definitely not do even if it meant she was to run off with him paddy that is and leave me here with mr wragg i know what true loves about after all but youre not that kind of detective are you what kind is that you know like on the telly someone you hire a private detective no i thought thats what you were at first then i heard you talking on the phone just now i wasnt exactly eavesdropping only your door was open a crack and i was taking fresh towels to the rooms and i happened to hear her fingers scratched against the tray as she grasped it more tightly behind her before going on shes my best friends mum you see she didnt mean any harm its like if someone is making preserves and they put in the wrong stuff and a bunch of people get ill say they buy the preserves at a church fête even strawberry or blackberry well they might do that huh and then they take them home and spread them on their toast the next morning or on their scones at tea then they get sick and everyone knows it was an accident see naturally that could happen and thats what happened here only it wasnt a fête and it wasnt preserves none of them replied st james was idly twirling his wineglass by the stem lynley had stopped tearing apart his roll and deborah was looking from the men to the girl waiting for one of them to respond when they didnt josie went on its just that maggies my best mate see and ive never had a best mate before her mum missus spence she keeps to herself lots people call that queer and they want to make something of it but theres nothing to make you got to remember that dont you think lynley nodded thats wise id agree with that well then she bobbed her illclipped head and looked for a moment as if she intended to dip into a curtsy instead she backed away from the table in the direction of the kitchen door youll want to start eating wont you the pâtés mums own recipe you know the smoked salmons real fresh and if you want anything her voice faded when the door closed behind her thats josie st james said in case you havent been introduced a strong advocate of the accident theory so i noticed what did sergeant hawkins have to say i take it thats the conversation josie overheard you having it was lynley speared a piece of salmon and was pleasantly surprised to find it as josie had declared quite fresh he wanted to restate that he was following huttonprestons orders from the first huttonpreston constabulary got involved through shepherds father and as far as hawkins was concerned everything from that moment was on the up and up still is in fact so hes backing his man in shepherd and hes none too pleased that were poking about thats reasonable enough hes responsible for shepherd after all what falls on the village constables head isnt going to look good on hawkins record either he also wanted me to know that mr sages bishop had been entirely satisfied with the investigation the inquest and the verdict st james looked up from his prawn cocktail he attended the inquest he sent someone evidently and hawkins seems to feel that if the investigation and inquest had the blessing of the church they damn well ought to have the yards blessing as well he wont cooperate then lynley speared more salmon onto his fork it isnt a question of cooperation st james he knows the investigation was a bit irregular and the best way to defend it himself and his man is to allow us to prove their conclusions correct but he doesnt have to like any of it none of them do theyre going to start liking it a great deal less when we take a closer look at juliet spences condition that night what condition deborah asked lynley explained what the constable had told them about the womans own illness on the night the vicar died he explained the ostensible relationship between the constable and juliet spence he concluded with and i have to admit st james that you might have got me here on a fools errand after all it looks bad that colin shepherd handled the case by himself with only his fathers intermittent assistance and a cursory glance at the scene by clitheroe cid but if she was ill too then the accident theory bears far more weight than we originally thought unless deborah said the constables lying to protect her and she wasnt ill at all theres that of course we cant discount it although it does suggest collusion between them but if alone she had no motive to murder the man a point of course which we know is moot what on earth would theirs together have been theres more to it than uncovering motives if were looking for culpability st james said he pushed his plate to one side theres something peculiar about her illness that night it doesnt hold together what do you mean shepherd told us that she was repeatedly sick she was burning with fever as well and and those arent symptoms of hemlock poisoning lynley toyed a moment with the last piece of salmon squeezed some lemon on top of it but then decided against eating after their conversation with constable shepherd hed been on the path to dismissing most of st james earlier concerns regarding the vicars death indeed hed been well on his way to chalking the entire adventure up to one hell of a long drive away from london to cool himself off from his mornings altercation with helen but nowtell me he said st james listed the symptoms for him excessive salivation tremors convulsions abdominal pain dilation of the pupils delirium respiratory failure complete paralysis it acts on the central nervous system he concluded a single mouthful can kill a man so shepherds lying not necessarily shes a herbalist josie told us that last night and you told me this morning it was largely the reason why you had me tearing up the motorway like nemesis on wheels but i dont see what herbs are just like drugs tommy and they act like drugs theyre circulatory stimulants cardioactives relaxants expectorantstheir functions run the virtual gamut of what a chemist supplies under a doctors prescription youre proposing she took something to make herself ill something to induce fever something to induce vomiting but isnt it possible that she ate some of the hemlock thinking it was wild parsnip began to feel ill once the vicar left and mixed herself a purgative to relieve her discomfort without connecting her discomfort to what she thought was wild parsnip that would account for the constant vomiting and couldnt the constant vomiting have raised her temperature its possible yes marginally so but if thats the case and frankly i wouldnt lay money on it tommy considering how quickly water hemlock works on the system wouldnt she have told the constable that shed drunk a purgative after eating something that didnt agree with her and wouldnt the constable have passed that message on to us today lynley raised his head once again to the prints on the wall there was alice nutter as before maintaining her obdurate silence her complexion becoming more perfect gallows with every moment she refused to speak a woman of secrets she carried all of them to her grave if it was an outlawed roman catholicism which held her tongue if it was pride if it was the angry knowledge that she had been framed by a magistrate with whom she had quarrelled no one knew but in an isolated village there was always an aura of mystery about a woman with secrets who was unwilling to share them there was always a pernicious little need to smoke the creature out in an unrelated fashion and make her pay for what she kept to herself one way or another somethings not right here st james was saying i tend to think juliet spence dug up the water hemlock knew exactly what it was and cooked it up for the vicar for whatever reason and if she had no reason lynley asked then someone else surely did after polly had gone colin shepherd drank the first of the whiskies got to get the hands to stop shaking he thought he gulped the initial shot down it raced fire through his gullet but when he set the glass upon the side table it chattered like a woodpecker knocking bark for its food another he decided the decanter shivered against the glass the next he drank to make himself think of it the great stone of fourstones then back end barn the great stone was a hulking oblong of granite an unexplained country oddity sitting on the rough grassland of loftshaw moss a number of miles to the north of winslough there they had gone for their picnic on that fine spring day when the harsh moors wind blew only as a breeze and the sky was brilliant with its fleece of clouds and its blue forever back end barn was the object of their walk when the meal was eaten and the wine was drunk hiking had been pollys suggestion but hed chosen the direction and he knew what was there he who had walked on these moors since his childhood he who recognised every spring and rivulet knew the name of every hill and could fi nd the location of each pile of stones hed led them directly towards back end barn and hed been the one to suggest they have a look inside the third whisky he drank to bring all of it back the feel of a splinter piercing his shoulder as he pushed open the weatherpitted door the strong scent of sheep and the feathery tufts of wool clinging to the mortar between the stones that made up the walls the two shafts of light that fell from gaps in the old slate roof making a perfect v at whose point polly had gone to stand with a laugh saying looks like a spotlight doesnt it colin when he shut the door the rest of the barn seemed to recede with the dimming of the light with the barn receded the world so that all that was left were those two simple yellowgold shafts provided by the sun and at their juncture polly she looked from him to the door hed closed then she ran her hands down the sides of her skirt and said like a secret place isnt it with the door shut and all dyou and annie come here i mean did you come here before you know he shook his head she must have taken his quiet for a reminder of the anguish that waited for him back in winslough she said impulsively ive brought the stones let me cast them for you before he could reply she dropped to her knees and from her skirt pocket she brought forth a little black velvet bag embroidered with red and silver stars she unloosed its drawstrings and poured the eight rune stones into her hand i dont believe in that he said thats because you dont understand it she settled onto her heels and patted the fl oor at her side it was stone uneven rutted and pockmarked from the hooves of ten thousand sheep it was utterly filthy he knelt to join her what dyou want to know he made no reply her hair was all ablaze in the light her cheeks were fl ushed come on with you colin she said there must be something theres nothing there must be well there isnt then i shall cast them for myself she shook the stones like dice in her hand and closed her eyes head cocked to one side now what shall i ask the stones clicked and rattled finally she said in a rush if i stay in winslough shall i meet my true love and then to colin with an impish smile cause if hes there hes being a bit skittish about introducing himself with a snap of her wrist she threw the stones away from her they clattered and skipped across the fl oor three stones showed their decorated sides polly leaned forward to see them and clasped her hands at her bosom in delight you see she said the omens are good heres the ring stone farthest thats for love and marriage and the lucky stone next see how it looks like an ear of corn that means wealth and the three birds in flight nearest to me that means sudden change so youll have a sudden marriage to someone with money that sounds like youre heading for townleyyoung she laughed wouldnt he be in a fright to know that our mr st john she scooped up the stones your turn now it didnt mean anything he didnt believe but he asked it anyway the only question he wanted to ask it was the one he asked each morning when he rose each night when he finally made his way to bed will annies new chemotherapy help her pollys brow furrowed are you sure throw the stones no if its your question you throw them he did so casting them away as she had done but looking to see that only one stone showed its decorated side painted with a black h like the ring stone that polly had thrown this one lay farthest from him she gazed upon them he saw her left hand begin to gather the material of her skirt she reached forward as if to sweep the stones into a single pile you cant read only one stone im afraid youll have to try again he clasped her wrist to stop her that isnt the truth is it whats it mean nothing you cant read one stone dont lie im not it says no doesnt it only we didnt have to ask the question to know the answer he released her hand she picked up the stones one by one and replaced them in the bag until only the black one remained on the fl oor whats it mean he asked once again grief her voice was hushed parting bereavement yes well right he raised his head to gaze at the roof trying to relieve the odd pressure behind his eyes concentrating on how many slates it would take to obliterate the sunlight that streamed to the fl oor one twenty could it even be done if one stepped on the roof to repair the damage wouldnt the entire structure collapse im sorry polly said it was stupid of me im stupid like that i dont think when i ought its not your fault shes dying we both know it but i wanted today to be special for you just a few hours away from everything so you wouldnt have to think about it for a while and then i brought out the stones i didnt think youd askbut what else would you ask im so stupid stupid stop it i made it worse it cant be any worse it can i made it you didnt oh col he lowered his head he was surprised to see his own pain reflected in her face his eyes were hers his tears were hers the lines and shadows that betrayed his grief were etched on her skin and shaded onto her temples and along her jaw he thought no i cant even as he reached out to cup her face he thought no i wont even as he began to kiss her he thought annie annie as he pulled her to the fl oor felt her hovering over him felt his mouth seek the breasts that she freed for him freed for him even as his hands slid up her skirt slipped off her panties pulled down his own trousers urged her down to him down to him needing her wanting her the heat so soft and that first night together what a wonder she was not timid at all like hed thought shed be but open to him loving him gasping at first at the strangeness of it before she moved with his body and rose to meet him and caressed the length of his naked back and cradled his buttocks and forced him deeper inside her with each thrust deeper and all the time all the time her eyes on his liquid with happiness and love as all his energy gathered its force from the pleasure of her body from the heat from the wet from the silky prison that held him that wanted him even as he wanted and wanted and wanted crying annie annie as he reached his orgasm inside the body of annies friend colin drank a fourth whisky to try to forget he wanted to blame her when he knew the responsibility was his slut hed thought she didnt have the decency to be loyal to annie she was ready and willing she didnt try to stop him she even pulled off her blouse and took off her bra and when she knew that he wanted inside she let him without a murmur of protest or afterwards even a word of regret except hed seen her expression when he opened his eyes only moments after crying out annies name hed recognised the magnitude of the blow he had dealt her and selfi shly hed considered it her just deserts for that afternoons seduction of a married man she brought the stones deliberately hed thought she planned it all no matter how they fell when he cast them to the floor she would have interpreted them in such a way that fucking her would be the logical outcome she was a witch was polly every moment every day she knew what she was doing she had it all planned colin knew that im sorry did nothing to mitigate his sins committed against polly yarkin on that spring afternoon in back end barn and every day since then she had reached out to him with the hand of friendship no matter how complicated it might have been by the fact of her love and time and again he had turned away caught up in the need to punish her because he lacked the courage to admit the worst that he was to himself and now shed given up the ring stone laying it and all her simple hopes for the future on annies grave he knew shed done it as yet another act of contrition attempting to pay for a sin in which shed played only a minor role it wasnt right leo colin said by the fire the dog perked up his head expectant come he grabbed a torch and his heavy jacket from the entry he went out into the night leo walked at his side unleashed his nose quivering with the scents of the icy winter air woodsmoke damp earth the lingering exhaust fumes of a car that passed a faint smell of frying fish for him a walk at night lacked the excitement of a walk in the day when there were birds to chase and the occasional ewe to startle with his bark but still it was a walk they crossed the road and entered the graveyard they wound their way towards the chestnut tree colin directing them with the torchs cone of light leo snuffling along just ahead of him to the right out of its beam the dog knew where they were going theyd been there often enough before so he reached annies grave before his master and he was sniffing round the marker and sneezing when colin said leo no he shone the light on the grave and then all round it he squatted to get a better look what had she said i burnt cedar for you colin i put the ashes on her grave i put the ring stone with them i gave annie the ring stone but it wasnt here and the only thing that could possibly be interpreted as ashes from cedar was a faint coating of grey flecks on the frost while he admitted that these could have come from the ashes if theyd been blown by the wind and disturbed by the dogs snuffling through them the rune stone itself couldnt have been blown away and if that was the case he walked round the grave slowly wanting to believe polly willing to give her every chance he thought the dog might have knocked it to one side so he searched with the light and turned over every stone that appeared the right size looking upon each for the interlocking pink rings he fi nally gave up he chuckled with derision at his own gullibility how guilt makes us want to believe in redemption obviously she had offered the first thought that had come into her head putting herself forward trying as always to make him take the blame and as everyone appeared to be doing at the same time she was giving it her all to wrest him away from juliet it wasnt going to work he lowered the torch to shine in a white bright circle on the ground he gazed fi rst to the north in the direction of the village where lights climbed the hillside in a pattern so familiar that he could have named each family behind every point of illumination he gazed then to the south where the oak wood grew and where beyond it cotes fell rose like a blackcloaked figure against the night sky and at the base of the fell across the meadow tucked into a clearing that had long ago been made among the trees cotes hall stood and with it the cottage and juliet spence what a damn fools errand he had come on to the churchyard he stepped over annies grave reached the wall in two strides with a third he was over it calling for the dog and swiftly moving in the direction of the public footpath that led from the village to the top of cotes fell he could have gone back for the rover it would have been faster but he told himself that he wanted the walk needing to feel completely grounded in the choice he was making and what better way to do that than to have the solid earth beneath his feet to have his muscles working and his blood at the fl ow he brushed aside the thought that fl uttered against his mind like a wetwinged moth as he strode along the path in his position going the back way to the cottage implied not only a clandestine visit to juliet but also collusion between them as well why was he using the back way to the cottage when he had nothing whatsoever to hide when he had a car when it was faster in a car when the night was cold as it had been in december when robin sage made the identical walk with the identical destination in mind robin sage who had a car who could have driven who chose to walk despite the snow that already lay upon the ground and in ignorance of or indifference to the fact that more had been promised before morning why had robin sage walked that night he liked exercise fresh air a ramble on the moors colin told himself in the two months sage had lived in the village prior to his death hed seen the vicar often enough in his crusty wellingtons with a walking stick stabbing into the ground he called upon all the villagers by foot he went to the common by foot when he fed the ducks what reason was there to conclude he would have done anything but walk when it came to the cottage the distance the weather the time of year the growing cold the night the answers presented themselves to colin as rose the one fact he kept trying to discount hed never seen sage do his walking at night if the vicar made a call outside the village after dark he took his car hed done as much the single time hed gone out to skelshaw farm to meet nick wares family hed done the same when hed made the rounds of the other farms hed even driven to dine at the townleyyoung estate shortly after his arrival in winslough before st john andrew townleyyoung had fully comprehended the extent of the vicars low church leanings and cut him off his list of acceptable acquaintances so why had sage walked to see juliet the same moth fluttered its wetwinged answer sage hadnt wanted to be seen just as colin himself didnt want to be seen paying a call at the cottage on the very night of the day that new scotland yard had come to the village admit it admit it no colin thought that was the venomous greeneyed monster making its attack on trust and belief surrendering to it in any way meant a sure death to love and a certain extinction of his hopes for the future he determined to think no more about it and made good that promise by turning off the torch although he had walked the footpath for nearly thirty years he had to concentrate on something beyond robin sage in order to anticipate a sudden dip in the land and to find his way over the occasional stile the stars assisted they were brilliant in the sky a dome of crystals that fl ickered like beacons on a distant landmass across an ocean of night leo led the way colin couldnt see him but he could hear the dogs feet breaking through the skin of frost on the ground and the sound of him scrambling over a wall with a happy yelp made colin smile a moment later the dog began to bark in earnest and then a mans voice called no hey there steady on colin switched on the torch and picked up the pace against the next wall leo was bounding back and forth leaping up towards a man who sat atop the stile colin shone the light on his face the man squinted and shrank back in response it was brendan power the solicitor had a torch with him but he wasnt using it instead it lay next to him its light extinguished colin ordered the dog down leo obeyed although he lifted one front leg and pawed rapidly at the walls rough stones as if greeting the other man sorry colin said he must have given you a start he saw that the dog had interrupted power in the midst of a sit and a smoke which explained why he hadnt been using his torch his pipe still glowed weakly and what was left of the burning tobacco gave off the odour of cherries bumboys tobacco colins father would have called it with a scoff if youre going to smoke boyo at least have the sense to choose something that makes you smell like a man quite all right power said extending his hand to let the dog sniff his fingers i was out for a walk i like to get out in the evening if i can get in a bit of exercise after sitting behind a desk all day keep myself in shape that sort of thing he sucked on the pipe and seemed to be waiting for colin to make some sort of similar reply out to the hall the hall power reached in his jacket and brought forth a pouch which he opened and sank the pipe into packing it with fresh tobacco without having cleared the bowl of the old colin watched him curiously yes the hall right checking things the work and all beckys getting anxious things havent gone well but you know that already theres been no more trouble since the weekend no nothing but one cant be too careful she likes me to check and i dont mind the walk fresh air breeze good for the lungs he took a deep breath as if to prove his point then he tried to light the pipe with only a moments success the tobacco caught but the clogged bowl prevented the stem from drawing he gave up the effort after two tries and replaced pipe pouch and matches in his jacket he hopped off the wall beckyll be wondering where ive got off to i suppose good evening constable he began to walk off mr power the man turned abruptly he kept himself clear of the light which colin was directing his way yes colin picked up the torch which still lay on the wall youve forgotten this power bared his teeth in what passed for a smile he gave a short laugh fresh air must have gone right to my head thanks when he reached for the torch colin held on a moment longer than was absolutely necessary testing the waters because they needed to be tested because new scotland yard would be doing its own testing soon enough he said do you know this is the spot where mr sage died just on the other side of the stile powers adams apple seemed to travel the length of his neck he said i say he did his best to make it over but he was having convulsions did you know he hit his head on the lower step powers glance shifted quickly from colin to the wall i didnt know only that he was foundthat you found him somewhere on the footpath you saw him the morning before he died didnt you you and miss townleyyoung yes but you know that already so that was you with polly in the lane last night wasnt it outside the lodge power didnt answer at once he looked at colin with some curiosity and when he replied the answer came slowly as if with some thought as to why the question had been asked in the fi rst place he was after all a solicitor i was on my way out to the hall polly was on her way home we walked together is there a problem with that and the pub the pub crofters youve been there with her drinking in the evenings once or twice while i was out for a walk when i stopped by the pub on my way home polly was there i joined her he played the torch from one hand to the other what of it anyway you met polly before your marriage you met her at the vicarage did she treat you well whats that supposed to mean did she seek you out ask you any favours no of course not what are you getting at youve access to keys to the hall havent you to the caretakers cottage as well she never asked to borrow them she never made any offer in return for the loan of them thats some bloody cheek what in hell are you trying to suggest that polly as his words died power looked towards cotes fell whats all this about i thought it was over no colin said scotland yards come to call powers head turned his gaze was even and youre looking to misdirect them im looking for the truth i thought you did that already i thought we heard it at the inquest power removed his pipe from his jacket he tapped the bowl against the heel of his shoe dislodged the tobacco and all the time kept his eyes on colin youre in hot water arent you constable shepherd well let me make a suggestion dont look to pour any of it on polly yarkin he strode off without another word pausing some twenty yards away to repack and relight his pipe the match fl ared and from the glow that followed it was clear that the tobacco had caught chapter eleven colin kept the torch lit for the rest of the walk to the cottage using darkness as a means of distraction was futile at this point brendan powers final words had made further avoidance impossible he was hedging his bets and he knew it setting up a secondary set of possibilities and arranging an unexamined point of departure he was looking for a viable direction in which he could lead the london police just in case he told himself because the what ifs were increasing their restless murmur inside his skull and he had to do something to quell them he had to take an action that was well within his purview called for under the circumstances and guaranteed to set his mind at rest he hadnt considered what that direction would be until he saw brendan power and realised with a rush of intuition so powerful that he could feel its certainty in the hollow of his gut what could have happened what must have happened and how juliet was blaming herself for a death she had only indirectly caused right from the start hed believed that the death was accidental because he couldnt consider any other explanation and continue to look at himself in the mirror every morning but now he saw how wrong he might have been and what an injustice he had done to juliet in those dark and isolated moments when he like everyone else in the village wondered how she of all people could possibly have made such a fatal mistake now he saw how she might have been manipulated into believing that she had made a mistake in the first place now he saw how it all had been done that thought and the rising desire to avenge the wrong committed against her drove him forward at new speed along the footpath with leo happily loping ahead they veered off into the oak wood a short distance beyond the lodge in which polly yarkin and her mother lived how easy it was to slip from the lodge to cotes hall colin realised one didnt even need to walk along the gouged disaster of a lane to get there the path led him beneath the trees across two footbridges whose wood was mossy and slowly rotting with each winters damp and over a spongy drugget of leaves that lay in sodden decomposition under a delicate coating of frost it ended where the trees made way for the rear garden of the cottage and when colin reached this point he watched leo bound through the piles of compost and the fallow earth to scratch at the base of the cottage door he himself directed the torchlight here and there assessing the details the greenhouse to his immediate left detached from the cottage no lock on its door the shed beyond it four wooden walls and a tarpaper roof where she kept the tools which she used for her gardening and for the forays she made into the woods for her plants and roots the cottage itself with the green cellar door its thick paint fl aking away in large chips that led to the dark loamscented cavity beneath the cottage where she stored her roots he fixed the torchlight on this and kept it fixed steadily as he crossed the garden he gazed down at the padlock that held the door closed leo joined him bumping his head against colins thigh the dog walked across the sloping surface of the door his nails scraped the wood and a hinge creaked in answer colin flashed the light to this it was old and rusty quite loose against the wooden jamb that was itself bolted to the angled stone plinth that served as its base he played the hinge in his fingers back and forth up and down he dropped his hand to the lower hinge it held firmly to the wood he shone the light against it examined it closely wondering if the marks he saw could be construed as scratches against the screws or merely an indication of some sort of abrasive used against the metal to remove the stains left by a slipshod worker when he painted the wood he should have seen all this before he realised he shouldnt have been so desperate to hear death by accidental poisoning that he overlooked the signs which might have told him that robin sages death had been something else had he argued with juliets own frantic conclusions had his mind been clear had he trusted her loyalty he could have spared her the stain of suspicion the subsequent gossip and her own distorted belief that she had killed a man he turned off the torch and walked to the back door he knocked no one answered he knocked a second time and then tried the knob the door swung open he said stay to leo who obediently sank onto his haunches he entered the cottage the kitchen smelled of dinner the fragrance of roasted chicken and newly baked bread of garlic sautéed in olive oil the odour of the food reminded him that he hadnt eaten since the previous night hed lost appetite along with selfassurance the moment sergeant hawkins phoned him this morning and told him to expect a visit from new scotland yard juliet he flipped on the kitchen light a pot was on the cooker a salad on the work top two places laid on the old formica table with its burn mark shaped like a crescent moon two glasses held liquid one milk one water but no one had eaten and when he touched his fingers to the glass filled with milk he could feel from its temperature that it had stood there undrunk for quite some time he called her name again and went through the passage to the sitting room she was by the window in the dark just a shadow herself standing with her arms crossed beneath her breasts looking out at the night he said her name she replied without turning from the glass she hasnt come home ive phoned around she was with pam rice earlier then with josie and now she let out her breath in a brief bitter laugh i can guess where shes gone and what shes up to he was here last night colin nick ware again shall i go out and have a look for her what would be the point shes made up her mind we can drag her back now and lock her in her room but that would only be post poning the inevitable what she means to get herself pregnant juliet pressed the tips of her fingers against her forehead rubbed them up to her hairline grasped the front of her hair and pulled hard as if to give herself pain she doesnt know anything about anything god in heaven neither do i why did i ever think id be good for a child he crossed the room stood behind her and reached round her to loose her fi ngers from her hair you are good for her this is just a stage shes in one ive set in motion how with you he felt an odd settling within him one churn of the stomach and nothing more presage of a future he wouldnt consider juliet he said but he had no idea of what would reassure her along with her blue jeans she was wearing an old work shirt it smelled faintly like a herb rosemary he thought he didnt want to think of anything else he pressed his cheek against her shoulder and felt the material soft against his skin if her mummy can take a lover why cant she juliet said i let you into my life and now im to pay shell grow past this give it time while shes having regular sex with a fi fteenyearold boy she pulled away from him he felt the cold sweep in to take the place of the pressure of her body against his there isnt time and even if there were what shes doing what shes after is complicated by the fact that she wants her father and if i cant produce him in double quick time shell make a father out of nick let me be her father that isnt the point she wants him the real thing not a starsinhiseyes substitute ten years too young whos blithering with some sort of idiotic love who thinks marriage and babies are the answer to everything who she stopped herself oh god im sorry he tried to sound unaffected its a fair enough description we both know that it wasnt it was cruel she hasnt been home ive been phoning everywhere i feel caught on the edge and she balled her hands together and pressed them to her chin in the meagre light that came from the kitchen she looked like a child herself colin you cant understand what shes like or what im like the fact that you love me wont change that and you what dont love me in return she squeezed her eyes shut love you what a joke on the both of us of course i love you and look where its brought me to with maggie maggie cant run your life maggie is my life why cant you see that this isnt about us about you and me colin this isnt about our future because we dont have a future but maggie does i wont let her destroy it he heard only part of her words and said in careful repetition to make certain hed understood we dont have a future youve known that from the fi rst you just havent wanted to admit it to yourself why because love makes us blind to the real world it makes us feel so complete so much part of someone else that we cant see its equal power to destroy i didnt mean why havent i wanted to admit it i meant why dont we have a future he said because even if i werent too old even if i wanted to give you babies even if maggie could live with the idea of our getting married you dont know she cant let me finish please this once and listen she waited for a moment perhaps to bring herself under control she held her hands out towards him cupped together as if she would give him the information i killed a man colin i cant stay here in winslough any longer and i wont let you leave this place you love the police have come he said in answer from london at once she dropped her hands to her sides her face altered as if she were drawing a mask into place he could feel the distance it created between them she was invulnerable and unreachable her armour secure when she spoke her voice was utterly calm from london what do they want to find out who killed robin sage but who how it doesnt matter who phoned them or why it only matters that theyre here they want the truth she lifted her chin fractionally then ill tell it this time dont make yourself look guilty there isnt any need i said what you wanted me to say before i wont do that again youre not hearing me juliet there isnt any need for selfsacrifice in this youre no more guilty than i am ikilledthisman you fed him wild parsnip what i thought was wild parsnip which i myself dug up you cant know that for sure of course i know it for sure i dug it up that very day all of it all what are you asking juliet did you take some parsnip from the root cellar that evening was it part of what you cooked she took a step backwards as if to distance herself from what his words implied the action cast her into deeper shadow yes dont you see what that means it means nothing there were only two roots left when i checked the cellar that morning thats why i went out for more i he could hear her swallow as she began to understand he went to her so you see dont you colin youve taken the blame without cause no i havent i didnt you cant believe that you mustnt he smoothed his thumb along her cheekbone ran his fingers round the curve of her jaw god she was like an infusion of life you dont see it do you thats the goodness of you you dont even want to see it what it wasnt robin sage at all it was never robin sage juliet how can you be responsible for the vicars death when you were the one who was meant to die her eyes grew wide she began to speak he stopped her words and the fear which he knew lay behind them with his kiss they were scarcely out of the dining room making their way through the pub to the residents lounge when the older man accosted them he gave deborah a cursory glance that took in everything from her hair always somewhere in the evolutionary cycle between haphazardly disarrayed and absolutely dishevelled to the splotchy stains of ageing on her grey suede shoes then he moved his attention to st james and lynley both of whom he scrutinised with the sort of care one generally gives to assessing a strangers potential for committing a felony scotland yard he asked his tone was peremptory it managed to suggest that only a handwringing obsequious response to the question would do at the same time it implied i know your sort walk two steps to the rear and pull at your forelock it was a lordofthemanor voice the sort that lynley himself had spent years trying to shed and thus it was guaranteed to raise his hackles the moment he heard it which it did st james said quietly im having a brandy you deborah tommy yes thank you lynley allowed his gaze to follow st james and deborah to the bar the pub appeared to be serving its regulars none of whom seemed to be paying much attention to the older man who stood before lynley waiting for a response yet everyone seemed at the same time to be aware of him their effort to ignore his presence was too studied their eyes darting towards him then just as quickly fl itting away lynley looked him over he was tall and spare with thinning grey hair and a fair complexion made ruddy round the cheeks through an exposure to the outofdoors but this was a huntingandfi shing exposure for there was nothing about the man to suggest that the time he spent exposed to the elements was anything other than leisures employment he wore good tweeds his hands looked manicured his air was sure and from the expression of distaste he cast in the direction of ben wragg who was slapping the bar and laughing heartily at a joke he himself had just told st james it was clear that coming to crofters inn constituted something of a descent from on high look here the man said i asked a question i want an answer now is that clear which of you is from the yard lynley took the brandy that st james brought him i am he said detective inspector thomas lynley and something tells me that youre townleyyoung he loathed himself even as he did it the man would have had no way of determining a thing about him or about his background from a simple examination of his clothes because he hadnt bothered much about dressing for dinner he wore a burgundy pullover over his pinstriped shirt a pair of grey wool trousers and shoes that still had a thin crease of mud along the seam so until lynley spoke until he made the decision to employ the voice whose every inflection shouted public school educated blue blood born and bred to possess a series of cumbersome useless titles townleyyoung would have had no way of knowing that he was addressing his questions to a belted earl he still didnt exactly no one was whispering eighth earl of asherton into his ear no one was listing the accoutrements of fortune class and birth the town house in london the estate in cornwall a seat in the house of lords if he wished to take it which he decidedly did not into townleyyoungs startled silence lynley introduced the st jameses then he sipped his brandy and observed townleyyoung over the rim of his glass the man was undergoing a major adjustment in attitude the nostrils were unpinching and the spine was loosening it was clear that he wanted to ask half a dozen questions absolutely verboten in the situation and that he was attempting to look as if hed known from the first that lynley was less them and more us than townleyyoung himself would ever be may i speak to you privately he said and then added hastily with a glance at the st jameses i mean out of the pub i should hope your friends would join us he managed the request with considerable dignity he may have been surprised to discover that more than one class of individual could rest at ease beneath the title of detective inspector but he wasnt about to go all uriah heepish in an effort to mitigate the scorn with which hed fi rst spoken lynley nodded towards the door to the residents lounge at the far side of the pub townleyyoung led the way the lounge was if anything colder than the dining room had been and without the extra electric fi res placed strategically to cut the chill deborah switched on a lamp straightened its shade and did the same to another st james removed an unfolded newspaper from one of the armchairs tossed it to the sideboard on which crofters inn kept its supply of other reading material mostly ancient copies of country life that looked as if theyd crumble if opened precipitately and sat in one of the armchairs deborah chose a nearby ottoman for her own seat lynley noted that townleyyoung glanced once at st james disability a swift look of curiosity that moved quickly on its way to fi nd a place for himself in the room he chose the sofa above which hung a dismal reproduction of the potato eaters ive come to you for help townleyyoung said id got the word at dinner that youd appeared in the village that sort of news passes like a blaze in winslough and i decided to come round and see you myself youre not here on holiday i take it not exactly this sage business then comrades in class did not constitute an invitation to professional disclosure as far as lynley was concerned he answered with a question of his own do you have something to tell me about mr sages death townleyyoung pinched the knot of his kellygreen tie not directly then he was a good enough chap in his way i suppose we just didnt see eyetoeye on matters of ritual low church versus high indeed surely not a motive for his murder however a motive townleyyoungs hand dropped from his tie his tone remained icily polite ive not come here to confess inspector if thats what you mean i didnt much like sage and i didnt much like the austerity of his services no flowers no candles just the bare bones not what i was used to but he wasnt a bad sort for a vicar and his heart was in the right place as far as churchgoing was concerned lynley took up his brandy and let the balloon glass warm in the palm of his hand you werent part of the church council who interviewed him i was i dissented townleyyoungs ruddy cheeks grew momentarily ruddier that the apparent lord of the manor had held no sway with the council on which he was undoubtedly the most important member went leagues to reveal his position in the hearts of the villagers i dare say you dont especially mourn his passing then he wasnt a friend if thats what youre getting at even if friendship had been possible between us hed only been in the village for two months when he died i realise that two months count for two decades in some arenas of our society these days but frankly im not of the generation that takes to calling its fellows by their christian names on a moments notice inspector lynley smiled since his father had been dead for some fourteen years and since his mother was nothing if not decidedly given to breaking her way past traditional barriers he sometimes had occasion to forget the older generations reliance upon the choice of name as an indicator of intimacy it always caught him offguard and amused him mildly to come up against it in his work whats in a name indeed he thought you mentioned that you had something to tell me that was indirectly involved with mr sages death lynley reminded townleyyoung who looked as if he was about to embellish upon his nominal theme in that he was a visitor on the grounds of cotes hall several times prior to his death im not sure i follow you ive come about the hall the hall lynley glanced at st james the other man lifted one hand fractionally in a dontaskme gesture id like you to look into whats been happening out there malicious mischief being made pranks being pulled ive been trying to renovate it for the past four months and some group of little hooligans keep getting in the way a quart of paint spilled here a roll of wallpaper ruined there water left running graffiti on the doors are you assuming that mr sage was involved that hardly seems likely for a clergyman im assuming someone with a bone to pick with me is involved im assuming you a policeman will get to the bottom of it and see that its stopped ah as he felt himself bristle beneath the final imperious statement their relative positions in an ostensibly classless society brushed aside in the mans exigent need to have his personal problems resolved posthaste lynley wondered how many people in the immediate vicinity felt they had serious bones to pick with townleyyoung youve a local constable to see to things of this sort townleyyoung snorted hes been dealingthe word heavy with the weight of townleyyoungs sarcasmwith this from the first hes done his investigating after every incident and after every incident hes turned up nothing have you given no thought to hiring a guard until the work is fi nished i pay my bloody taxes inspector what else are they to be used for if i cant call upon the assistance of the police when i have a need what about your caretaker the spence woman she frightened off a group of young thugs once and quite competently if you want my opinion despite the ruckus it caused round here but whoevers at the bottom of this current rash of mischief has managed to do it with a great deal more finesse no sign of forced entry no trace left behind save for the damage someone with a key i dare say who has them myself mrs spence the constable my daughter and her husband any of you wishing that the house go unfinished whos supposed to live there beckymy daughter and her husband their baby in june does mrs spence know them st james asked hed been listening his chin in his palm know becky and brendan why might she prefer it if they didnt move in might the constable prefer it might they be using the house themselves weve been given to understand theyre involved with each other lynley found that this line of questioning did indeed lead in an interesting direction if not exactly the one intended by st james has someone dossed there in the past he asked the place was locked and boarded a board is fairly easy to loosen if one needs entry st james added obviously continuing with his own line of thought and if a couple were using the place for an assignation they might not take lightly to having it denied them i dont much care whos using it and for what i just want it stopped and if scotland yard cant do it what sort of ruckus lynley asked townleyyoung gaped at him blankly what the devil you mentioned that mrs spence caused a ruckus when she frightened someone off the property what sort of ruckus discharging a shotgun got the little beasts parents in a snit over that he gave another snort let their lads run about like hooligans they do this lot of parents in the village and when someone tries to show them a touch of discipline youd think armageddon had begun a shotguns rather heavy discipline st james remarked aimed at children deborah added thesearent exactly children and even if they were is it with your permission or perhaps your advice that mrs spence uses a shotgun to carry out her duties as caretaker of cotes hall lynley asked townleyyoungs eyes narrowed i dont particularly appreciate your efforts to turn this round on me i came here for your assistance inspector and if youre unwilling to give it then ill be on my way he made a movement as if to rise lynley raised a hand briefly to stop him saying how long has the spence woman worked for you more than two years now nearly three and her background what of it what do you know about her why did you hire her because she wanted peace and quiet and i wanted someone out there who wanted peace and quiet the locations isolated i didnt want to employ as caretaker anyone who felt compelled to mingle with the rest of the village on a nightly basis that would hardly have served my interests would it where did she come from cumbria where outside of wigton where townleyyoung sat forward with a snap look here lynley lets get one thing straight i came here to employ you not the opposite i wont be spoken to as if im a suspect no matter who you are or where youre from is that clear lynley placed his balloon glass on the birch side table next to his chair he regarded townleyyoung evenly the mans lips had fl attened to broomstraw width and his chin jutted out pugnaciously if sergeant havers had been in the residents lounge with them she would have yawned widely at this point fl ipped her thumb towards townleyyoung said get this bloke will you and followed that up with a lessthanfriendly and morethanbored answer the question before we have you in the nick for failure to cooperate in a police investigation it was always havers way to stretch the truth to serve her purposes when hot on the scent of a piece of information lynley wondered whether that approach would have worked with someone like townleyyoung if nothing else it would have afforded him a moment of pleasure just to see townleyyoungs reaction to being spoken to in such a way and with such an accent as havers she didnt have the voice by any stretch of the imagination and she generally made the most of that fact when confronted with someone who did deborah moved restlessly on the ottoman out of the corner of his eye lynley saw st james hand move to her shoulder i realise why youve come to see me lynley said at last good then and its one of those unfortunate quirks of fate that youve walked into the middle of an investigation you can of course telephone your solicitor if youd prefer to have him here while you answer the question where exactly did mrs spence come from it bent the truth only partially lynley gave a mental salute to his sergeant he could live with that the question was whether townleyyoung could do also they engaged in a silent skirmish of wills their eyes locked in combat townleyyoung fi nally blinked aspatria he said in cumbria yes how did she come to work for you i advertised she applied she came to interview i liked her shes got common sense shes independent shes fully capable of taking whatever action is necessary to protect my property and mr sage what about him where was he from cornwall and before lynley could press the point with a further question via bradford thats all i recall thank you lynley got to his feet townleyyoung did likewise as to the hall ill be speaking to mrs spence lynley said but my suggestion is to follow the keys and to think about who might not want your daughter and her husband to move into the hall townleyyoung hesitated at the door to the residents lounge his hand on the knob he seemed to be studying it because he kept his head bent for a moment and his forehead was creased as if with thought he said the wedding sorry sage died the night before my daughters wedding he was to perform the ceremony we none of us knew where to find him and we had the devil of a time fi nding someone else he looked up someone who doesnt want becky at the hall could be someone who didnt want her to marry in the fi rst place why jealousy revenge thwarted desire for townleyyoung gazed back at the door an act of seeing through it to the pub beyond for what becky already has he said brendan found polly yarkin in the pub he went to the bar for his gin and bitters bobbed his head in good evening to three farmers and two maintenance men from fork reservoir and joined her at her table near the fi replace where she was toeing the bark from a piece of birch at her feet he didnt wait for an invitation to sit with her tonight at least he had an excuse she looked up as he decisively placed his glass on the table and lowered himself onto the threelegged stool her eyes moved from him to the far door that gave way to the residents lounge she kept them fixed on it as she said bren you mustnt sit here you best go on home she didnt look well although she was sitting right next to the fire she hadnt removed either her coat or her scarf and as he unbuttoned his jacket and slid his stool closer to hers she seemed to draw her body inward protectively she said bren in a low insistent voice mind what i say brendan cast a casual glance round the pub his conversation with colin shepherd and especially the parting remark hed shot at the constable as he sauntered off had given brendan a surge of confidence he hadnt experienced in months he felt invulnerable to stares or gossip or even direct confrontation itself what have we got here polly day labourers farmers a few housewives the local teen gang i dont care what they think theyll think what they want no matter what wont they its not just them all right dint you see his car whose his mr townleyyoungs hes in there she gave a nod in the direction of the residents lounge her eyes still averted with them with whom the london police so be off with you before he comes out and and what what she replied with a shrug he could see what she thought of him in the movement of her shoulders and the settling of her mouth it was the very same thing that rebecca thought it was what they all thought every man jack of them in the whole bloody village they saw him under townleyyoungs thumb under everyones thumb like a cart horse in bridle and blinkers for life he took an irritated gulp of his drink the liquor washed back in his throat too quickly misdirected itself and made him cough he fished in his pocket for a handkerchief his pipe tobacco and matches spilled onto the fl oor god damn he snatched them back he coughed and hacked he could see polly looking round the pub smoothing her scarf trying to achieve some distance by ignoring his plight he found his handkerchief and pressed it to his mouth he took a second slower sip of the gin it roared across his tongue and down his throat leaving fire in its wake but it warmed him this time both to his topic and to the situation im not afraid of my fatherinlaw he said tersely despite what everyone thinks im fully capable of standing my ground with him im fully capable of a hell of a lot more than this lot round here gives me credit for he considered adding an iftheyonlyknew innuendo to give his assertion an air of credibility but polly yarkin was nobodys fool shed question and probe and hed end up revealing what he most wanted to keep to himself so instead he said i have a right to be here i have a right to sit wherever i please i have a right to speak to whomever i like youre acting the fool besides this is business he threw back more gin it went down smoothly he considered a trip to the bar for a second glass hed toss that down and perhaps have a third and bugger anyone who tried to stop him polly was toying with a stack of beer mats concentrating on them as if by that action she could continue to avoid an open acknowledgement of his presence he wanted her to look at him he wanted her to reach over and touch his arm he was important in her life now and she didnt even know it but she would soon enough he would make her see i was out at cotes hall he said she didnt reply i came back on the footpath she stirred on the stool as if to leave one hand went to the back of her neck her fi ngers dug into its nape i saw constable shepherd her movement ceased her eyelids seemed to tremble as if she wanted to look at him but couldnt allow herself even that much contact so she said so youd better watch where youre stepping all right contact at last she met his gaze but it wasnt curiosity he read in her face it wasnt a need to possess information or obtain clarity a slow ugly flush was climbing her neck and spreading streaks of crimson up from her jaw he was disconcerted she was supposed to ask what he meant by his statement which was supposed to lead to a request for his advice which he would be only too happy to give which would lead to her gratitude gratitude would prompt her to establish a place for him in her life obtaining that would lead her to love and if it wasnt love exactly that she ended up feeling desire would do except that his statement wasnt engendering anything close to that primary domino of curiosity that would topple the defences shed kept raised against him from the instant hed met her she looked enraged ive done nothing to her or to anyone she hissed i dont know nothing about her all right he drew back she leaned forward about her he said blankly nothing she repeated and if a chat with constable shepherd on the footpath makes you think mr sage told me something i could use to kill him brendan said what he thinks youre responsible for the vicars death hes looking for evidence shepherd is she sat back on her stool her mouth opened and closed opened again she said evidence yes so watch where youre stepping and if he questions you polly you phone me at once youve got the number of my office dont you dont talk to him alone dont be with him alone do you understand evidence she said it as if to convince herself as if to try out the word for size the menace behind it didnt seem to reach her polly answer me do you understand the constables looking for evidence to establish the fact that youre responsible for the vicars death he was heading out towards cotes hall when i saw him she stared at him without appearing to see him but col was only angry she said he didnt mean it i pushed him too far i do that sometimes and he said something he didnt really mean i knew that he knew it as well she was speaking greek as far as brendan was concerned she was drifting in space he needed to bring her back to earth and more importantly back to him he took her hand eyes still unfocussed she didnt withdraw it he twined his fingers with hers polly youve got to listen no its nothing he didnt mean a thing he asked me about keys brendan said whether id given a set of keys to you whether youd asked for them she frowned said nothing i didnt answer him polly i told him that line of enquiry wasnt on i told him to bugger off as well so if he comes to see you he cant think that she spoke so low that brendan had to lean forward to hear her he knows me does colin he knows me brendan her hand tightened round his pulled his towards her breast he was startled delighted and more than ready to be of whatever assistance he could how can he think i would ever everno matter whatbrendan she fl ung his hand to one side she backed her stool into the corner she said now its worse and just as brendan was about to question her seeking to understand how anything could possibly be worse if shed finally started to accept him a heavy hand descended on his shoulder brendan looked up into the face of his fatherinlaw flaming bloody hell st john andrew townleyyoung said concisely get outside before i thrash you to pieces you miserable worm lynley shut the door of his room and stood with his back to it his eyes on the telephone next to the bed on the wall above it the wraggs continued to display their love affair with the impressionists and postimpressionists monets tender madame monet and child made an odd companion piece to toulouselautrecs at the moulin rouge both of them mounted and framed with more enthusiasm than care the latter hanging at an angle that suggested all of montmartre had been hit by an earthquake just as the artist was rendering immortal its most famous nightclub lynley straightened the toulouselautrec he pinched a cobweb that seemed to be dangling from madame monets hair but neither a contemplation of the prints nor a few minutes consideration of their quixotic pairing was sufficient to prevent his reaching for the telephone and punching in her number he dug in his pocket for his watch it was just after nine she wouldnt be in bed he couldnt even use the hour as a plausible reason for avoidance he had no excuse for not placing the call except cowardice which he had in spades whenever it came to dealing with helen did i really want love he wondered wryly and if so when did i want it and wouldnt an affair a dozen affairs be less diffi cult and more convenient than this he sighed what a monstrosity love was it was nothing so simple as the beast with two backs the sex part had been effortless between them from the first hed driven her home from cambridge on a friday in november theyd not stirred from her flat until sunday morning they didnt even have a meal until saturday night he could close his eyes even now as he thought of it and still look up into her face see the way her hair framed it in a colour not so different from the brandy hed just drunk feel her moving against him sense the warmth beneath his palms as he ran them from her breasts to her waist to her thighs and hear the way her breathing caught then changed altogether as it rose with her climax and she cried out his name hed touched his fingers beneath her breast and felt her heart pounding she laughed a little embarrassed at the ease of it all between them she was what he wanted together they were what he wanted but life never took a permanent definition from the hours they spent with each other in bed because one could love a woman make love to her and have her make love completely in return and with considerable care and a refusal to reveal still never be touched at the core of ones being for that was a fi nal breaking of barriers from which one never walked away the same and both of them knew it because both of them had crossed all conceivable boundaries with other people before how do we learn to trust he wondered how do we ever develop the courage to make the heart vulnerable a second or third time exposing it to yet another chance of breaking helen didnt want to do that and he couldnt blame her he wasnt always certain that he could risk it himself he thought with chagrin about his behaviour that day hed been eager enough to take the first opportunity to dash out of london this morning he knew his motivations well enough to admit that in part hed snatched at the promise of distance from helen as well as the chance to punish her her doubts and fears exasperated him perhaps because they so accurately mirrored his own wearily he sank onto the edge of the bed and listened to the steady plinkplink of water dripping from the tap in the bath in the way of all night noises it dominated as it could never do at any other time and he knew that if he didnt do something to stop it he would toss turn and fight with the pillow once he put out the light and attempted to sleep he decided it probably wanted a washer if bath taps had washers the way basin taps did ben wragg could no doubt provide him with one all he needed to do was pick up the phone and ask what would it take to repair the thing anyway five minutes four and he could think while he did it taking the time to engage his hands with an odd job so that his mind was free to make a decision regarding helen he couldnt after all telephone her without knowing what his objective was in doing so five minutes would prevent him from rushing in thoughtlessly and just as thoughtlessly taking the risk of exposing himself not to mention helen who was far more sensitive than he tohe paused in the mental colloquy with himself to what what love commitment honesty trust god alone knew how either one of them might survive the challenges of that he laughed sourly at his own capacity for selfdeception and reached for the telephone just as it rang denton told me where to find you was the first thing she said the first thing he said was helen hullo darling i was just about to phone you realising that she probably wouldnt believe him and that he couldnt blame her if that was the case but she said im glad of it and then they grappled with the silence in it he could imagine where she was in her bedroom in the onslow square flat on the bed with her legs curled beneath her and the ivoryandyellow counterpane acting as contrast to her hair and her eyes he could see how she was holding the phone twohanded and cradled as if she would protect it herself or the conversation she was having he could guess at her jewellery earrings that shed already removed and placed on the walnut table by the bed a thin gold bracelet still encircling her wrist a matching chain round her neck that her fingers touched talismanlike when they moved the scant inches from the phone to her throat and there at the hollow of her throat was the scent she wore something between flowers and citrus they both spoke at once saying i shouldnt have ive been feeling and then breaking off with the quick laughter of nerves that serves as the underpinning of a conversation between lovers who are both afraid of losing what theyve so recently found which is why in an instant lynley mentally abjured every plan hed just been pondering before she had phoned he said i love you darling im sorry about all this were you running away this time i was yes after a fashion i cant be angry over that can i ive done it often enough myself another silence she would be wearing a silk blouse wool trousers or a skirt her jacket would be lying where shed laid it at the foot of the bed her shoes would be sitting nearby on the floor the light would be on casting its inverted triangular glow against the blossoms and stripes of the wallpaper at the same time as it diffused through the lampshade to touch her skin but youve never run away to hurt me he said is that why youve gone off to hurt me again after a fashion its nothing im proud of he reached for the cord of the telephone and twined it between his fingers restless for something of substance to touch since hed placed himself more than two hundred and fifty miles to the north and he couldnt touch her he said helen about that blasted tie this morning that wasnt the issue you knew it at the time i didnt want to admit it it was just an excuse for fear of what moving forward i suppose loving you more than i do at the moment making you too much of my life helen i could easily lose myself in the love of you the problem is i dont know if i want to how can something like that be bad how can it be wrong its neither but grief comes with love eventually it has to its only the timing that no one can be sure of and thats what ive been trying to come to terms with whether i want the grief and in what proportion sometimes she hesitated he could see her fingers move to rest on her collar bone her gesture of protection before she went on its closer to pain than anything ive ever experienced isnt that mad im afraid of that i suppose im actually afraid of you you have to trust me helen at some point in all this if were ever to go on i know that i wont cause you grief not deliberately you wont i know that as well then if i lose you tommy you wont how could you why in a thousand different ways because of my job because of who you are he felt the sensation of being swept away from everything but most of all from her so it is the tie after all he said other women she said yes marginally but its more a worry over the daytoday the business of living the way people grind at each other and wear the best parts down over time i dont want that i dont want to wake up some morning and discover i stopped loving you five years in the past i dont want to look up from dinner one night and fi nd you watching me and read on your face the very same thing thats the risk helen it all comes down to a leap of faith although god knows whats in store for us if we cant even manage to get to corfu together for a weeks holiday im sorry about that about me as well i was feeling boxed in this morning well youre free of that now and i dont want to be free of that free of you i dont want that tommy she sighed it caught on the edge of what he wanted to believe was a stifled sob except that helen had only sobbed once in her life that he knew of as a girl of twentyone with her world smashed to bits by a car which he himself had driven and he seriously doubted that she would begin sobbing again for his benefi t now i wish you were here my wish as well will you come back tomorrow i cant denton didnt tell you theres a case of sorts then you wont want me there to bother with either you wouldnt be a bother but it wouldnt work will anything ever work that is that was the question indeed it was he looked down at the floor at the mud on his shoes at the floral carpet at the patterns it made i dont know he said and thats the full hell of it i can ask you to risk it all with a jump into the void i simply cant guarantee what youll fi nd there but then no one can no one whos truthful thats the bottom line we cant predict the future we can only use the present to guide us hopefully in its direction do you believe that tommy with all my heart i love you i know thats why i believe chapter twelve maggie was lucky he came out of the pub alone shed been hoping he would ever since she saw his bicycle propped against the white gates that led into the crofters inn car park it was hard to miss it an odd girls bike with big balloon tyres once the treasure of his older sister but since her marriage appropriated by nick without a care in the world as to the queer sight he made on it pedalling through the village towards skelshaw farm with his old leather bombers jacket flapping round his waist and the radiotape player hanging from one of the handlebars usually something by depeche mode was rockandrolling from the speakers nick was particularly fond of them he was fiddling with the radio as he left the pub all his concentration apparently given to finding a station that he could tune in with minimum static and maximum volume simple minds ub an ancient piece by fairground attraction all bleeped by like people interrupted in the midst of a conversation before he found something that he settled with it consisted mostly of high screeching notes on an electric guitar she heard nick say clapton all right as he slipped the radios grip piece over the bicycles handlebars he stooped to tie his left shoelace and as he did so maggie melted out of the doorway shadows of the pentagram tearoom across the street from the inn shed stayed in josies lair by the river long after the other girl had left to set the tables in the restaurant and to act the part of waitress there shed intended to go home eventually when dinner was long past ruined and her continuing absence couldnt be rationally assigned to anything other than murder abduction or inyourface rebellion two hours past dinner would do nicely for that mummy deserved it despite what had happened between them last night shed put another cup of that horrid tea on the table in front of maggie this morning saying drink this margaret now before you leave she sounded hard not like mummy at all but at least there was no more of her saying it was good for her bones no matter the taste filled to the brim with the vitamins and minerals that a womans developing body had to have that lie was gone but mummys determination was not neither was maggies however i wont you cant make me you did it before but you cant make me drink it again her words were high and shrill even to her own ears she sounded like a mouse being swung by its tail and when mummy had held the cup to her lips with her other hand locked on the back of maggies neck saying you will drink this margaret youll sit here till you do maggie had flung up her arms dashing the cup and its liquid hot and steaming against mummys chest her wool jersey soaked it up like a desert in june and moulded itself into a scalding second skin mummy cried out and rushed to the sink maggie watched in horror she said mummy i didnt get out of here get out mummy gasped and when maggie didnt move she dashed back to the table and yanked her chair away from it you heard me get out it wasnt mummys voice it wasnt anybodys voice that shed ever known it wasnt mummy at the sink with the icecold water flooding out of the tap taking handfuls throwing them against the wool jersey with her teeth clamped over her lower lip she was making noises like she couldnt breathe at last when she was through and the jersey was soaked with new water over old she bent over and began to pull it off her body shuddered mummy maggie had said in that same mouse voice get out i dont even know who you are the reply shed stumbled into the grey morning had sat by herself in a corner of the bus all the way to school she had slowly come to terms with the extent of her loss over the course of the day she recovered she developed a brittle little shell to protect herself from the whole situation if mummy wanted her out she would get out she would and it wouldnt be hard to do at all nick loved her hadnt he said it over and over again didnt he say it every day when he had the chance she didnt need mummy how dim it was to think she ever had and mummy didnt need her when she was gone mummy could have her nice private life with mr shepherd which is probably what she wanted in the fi rst place in fact maybe thats why she kept trying to make maggie drink that tea maybe maggie shivered no mummy was good she was she was it was half past seven when maggie left the river lair it would be after eight by the time she made the walk home to the cottage shed go inside majestic and silent shed go up to her room and close the door shed never once speak to mummy again what was the point then the sight of nicks bicycle had changed her purpose taking her across the street to the tearoom with its recessed doorway out of the wind she would wait for him there she hadnt thought the wait would be so long somehow shed believed that nick would sense she was lingering outside and would leave his mates to fi nd her she couldnt go in to him in case mummy phoned the pub on a search for her but she didnt mind waiting hed be out soon enough nearly two hours later hed emerged and when she sneaked up beside him and slipped her arm round his waist he jumped with the shock of it and gave a cats yowl he whirled around the movement and the wind caught his hair and flung it into his eyes he fl ipped it back saw her mag he grinned the guitar on the radio climbed a few high wild notes i was waiting for you over there he turned his head the wind dashed his hair about his head once again where the tearoom outside mag are you daft in this weather i bet youve gone all ice why dint you come in he glanced at the lighted windows of the inn nodded once and said because of the police thats it isnt it she frowned police new scotland yard got here round fi ve from what ben wragg was saying dint you know i thought for certain you would why your mum mummy what theyre here to sniff round mr sages death look we need to talk his eyes darted down the road to north yorkshire in the direction of the common where the car park across the street was supplied with an old stone shed of public toilets there was shelter there from the wind if not the cold but maggie had a better idea come with me she said and with a pause for him to grab the radio whose volume he lowered as if in understanding of the clandestine nature of their movements she led him through the gates of the crofters inn car park they wove between the cars nick lowwhistled his admiration of the same silver bentley that had been parked there several hours before when josie and maggie had walked to the river where are we special place maggie said its josies she wont mind have you a match well need one for the lantern they descended the path carefully it was slick with the nights developing coat of ice with rushes and weeds made constantly damp by the river that tumbled through the limestone boulders below nick said let me and went on ahead his hand extended back to her to keep her steady and on her feet each time he slid an inch or two he said steady on mag and firmed up his grip he was taking care of her and the thought of that made her warm inside to out here she said as they reached the old icehouse she pushed against the door it creaked on its hinges and scraped against the fl oor rucking up part of the patchwork carpet this is josies secret place maggie said you wont tell anyone about it nick he ducked inside the door as maggie fumbled for the nail barrel and the lantern on top of it she said ill need the matches and felt him press a book of them into her hand she lit the lantern lowered its glow to a candles softness and turned back to him he was gazing about wizard he said with a smile she moved past him to shut the door and as she had seen josie do earlier she sprayed the floor and the walls with toilet water its colder in here than outside nick said he zipped his bombers jacket and beat his hands against his arms here she said she sat on the cot and patted the spot next to her when he dropped down beside her she took up the eiderdown that served as a coverlet and they wore it like a cape he loosed himself from it long enough to produce the marlboros he favoured maggie returned him his matches and he lit two cigarettes at once one for each of them he inhaled deeply and held his breath maggie pretended to do the same more than anything she liked the nearness of him the sound of his leather jacket rustling the pressure of his leg against hers the heat of his body and when she gave a quick look the length of his eyelashes and the heavily lidded sleepy shape of his eyes bedroom eyes shed heard one of the teachers call them bet that blokell be giving the ladies something nice to remember in a few more years another had added i wouldnt mind something nice from him now actually and they all had laughed stopping abruptly when they realised maggie was close enough to hear not that they knew anything about maggie and nick no one knew about them except josie and mummy and mr sage there was an inquest maggie said reasonably they said it was an accident didnt they and once the inquest says its an accident no one can say anything else isnt that it they cant do another dont the police know that nick shook his head the cigarette glowed he tapped ash onto the carpet and ground it in with the toe of his shoe thats the trial part mag you cant be tried twice for the same crime unless theres new evidence sort of i think but that doesnt matter because there wasnt any trial in the first place an inquests not a trial will there be one now depends on what they fi nd find where are they looking for something will they come to the cottage theyll be talking to your mum thats for sure theyve already been holed up tonight with mr townleyyoung i got money says he mustve phoned for them in the fi rst place nick gave a little chuckle you shouldve been there mag when he came out of the lounge poor ol brendan was having a gin with polly yarkin and ty went white to his lips and deadcod stiff when he saw them they werent doing nothing but drinking but ty had bren outa that pub faster n anything his eyes just sort of shot laser blasts at him like in a fi lm but mummy didnt do anything maggie said she felt a small burning point of fear in her chest it wasnt on purpose thats what she said the jury agreed sure based on what they were told but someone mightve lied mummy didnt lie nick seemed to recognise her fears immediately he said its okay mag theres nothing to worry about except that theyll probably want to talk to you the police right you knew mr sage you and him were mates in a way when the police investigate they always talk to all the dead blokes mates but mr shepherd never talked to me the inquest man didnt i wasnt there that night i dont know what happened i cant tell them anything i hey he took a final deep drag of his cigarette before he squashed it against the stone wall behind them and did the same to hers he put his arm round her waist at the far side of the icehouse nicks radio was hissing spasmodically its station lost its okay mag its nothing to worry about its nothing to do with you at all i mean you didnt exactly kill the vicar did you he chuckled at the very impossibility of the thought maggie didnt join him at heart it was all about responsibility wasnt it responsibility with a capital r she could remember mummys anger when shed been told of maggies visits to mr sages house to the shrill outraged defence of who told you whos been spying on mewhich mummy wouldnt answer but it didnt really matter did it because maggie knew precisely who had done the spying mummy had said listen to me maggie have some common sense you dont actually know this man and he is a man not a boy hes at least fortyfi ve years old are you aware of that what are you doing paying visits alone to a fortyfi veyearold man even if hes a vicar especially because hes a vicar cant you see the position youre putting him in and to the explanation but he said i could come for tea when i wanted and he gave me a book and her mother said i dont care what he gave you i dont want you to see him not in his house not alone not at all when maggie had felt the tears rise in her eyes when she let them trickle down her cheeks while she said hes my friend he says so you dont want me to have any friends do you mummy had grabbed her arm in a grip that meant listenanddontyoudarearguewithmemissy saying you stay away from him to the petulant question why she released her and said only anything could happen everything does happen thats the way of the world and if you dont know what i mean start reading the newspaper those words closed the discussion between them that night but there were others you were with him today dont lie about it maggie because i know its the truth as from now youre gated thats not fair what did he want with you nothing dont be sullen with me or youll regret it more than having disobeyed in the fi rst place is that clear what did he want with you nothing what did he say what did he do we just talked we ate some jaffa cakes polly made tea she was there yes shes always in the room no but what did you talk about stuff such as school god mummy made a noise through her nose maggie countered it with he asked did i ever go to london do i think id like to see it he said id like london he said hes been there lots he even went for a two days holiday last week he says people who get tired of london oughtnt be alive or something like that mummy didnt reply instead she watched her hands grating and grating and grating some cheese so fast she held the block of cheddar that her knuckles were white but not as white as her face maggie felt comfortable with the advantage indicated by mummys silence and she pressed it he said we might go to london sometime on an excursion with the youth group he said theres families in london whod let us stay so we wouldnt even have to find a hotel he said londons grand and we could go to museums and see the tower and go to hyde park and have lunch at harrods he said go to your room mummy you heard me but i was only mummys hand stopped her words it moved in less than an eyeblink to slap her face shock and surprise far more than pain brought the tears to her eyes anger came with them as did the desire to hurt back in kind hes my friend she cried hes my friend and we talk and you dont want him to like me you never want me to have any friends at all thats why we move isnt it over and over so no one will like me so ill always be alone and if daddy stop it i wont i wont if daddy fi nds me ill go with him i will wait and see you wont be able to stop me no matter what i wouldnt depend on that margaret then mr sage died just four days later who was really responsible and what was the crime mummys good she said in a low voice to nick she didnt mean anything bad to happen to the vicar i believe you mag nick replied but someone round here doesnt what if they put her on trial what if she goes to gaol ill take care of you truly a fact he sounded strong and certain he was strong and certain he felt good to be near she worked one arm round his waist and rested her head on his chest i want us to be like this always she said then thats the way itll be really really youre my number one mag youre the only one dont worry about your mum she slid her hand from his knee to his thigh cold she said and snuggled closer to him you cold nick bit yeah i can warm you nice she could feel his smile bet you can at that want me to wouldnt say no i can i like to she did it just the way he had shown her her hand making the slow sinuous friction she could feel it growing hard in response feel good nick hmm she rubbed the heel of her hand from base to tip then her fingers lightly retraced the pathway nick gave a shaky sigh he stirred what he was reaching in his jacket there was crackling in his hand got this from one of the blokes he said we cant do it any more without a durex mag its crazy too risky she kissed his cheek and then his neck her fingers sank between his legs where she remembered he felt the most he lost his breath in a groan he lay back on the cot he said we got to use the durex this time she worked the zip of his blue jeans worked the jeans below his hips she slipped off her tights lay down next to him and lifted her skirt mag we got to use not yet though nick in a minute all right she draped a leg over his she began to kiss him she began to caress and caress and caress it without using her hands that good she whispered his head was thrown back his eyes were closed he moaned for reply a minute was more than enough time she found st james sat in the bedrooms only chair an overstuffed wingback aside from the bed it was the most comfortable piece of furniture hed yet to encounter at crofters inn he drew his dressing gown round him against the pervasive chill descending from the glass of the bedrooms two skylights and settled himself behind the closed door of the bathroom he could hear deborah splashing away in the tub she usually hummed or sang as she bathed for some reason invariably choosing either cole porter or one of the gershwins and rendering them with the enthusiasm of an undiscovered edith piaf and all the talent of a street hawker she couldnt carry a tune if kings college choir were trying to assist her tonight however she bathed in silence normally he would have welcomed any extended interlude between anything goes and summertime especially if he was trying to read in their bedroom while she was paying tribute to old american musicals in the adjoining bath but tonight he would have preferred to hear her cheerful dissonance rather than listen to her quiet bathing and be forced to consider not only how best to interrupt it but also whether he wanted to do so aside from a brief skirmish over tea theyd declared and maintained an unspoken truce upon her return from her extended tramp on the moors that morning it had been easy enough to effect with mr sages death to consider and lynleys arrival to anticipate but now that lynley was with them and the machinery of an investigation oiled and ready st james found that his thoughts kept returning to the unease in his marriage and what he himself was doing to contribute to it where deborah was all passion he was all reason he had liked to believe this basic difference in their natures constituted the bedrock of fire and ice upon which their marriage was soundly fixed but they had entered an arena in which his ability to reason seemed not only a disadvantage but also the very spark that ignited her refusal to approach confl ict in any way other than pigheadedly the words about this adoption business deborah were enough to send up every one of her defences against him she moved from anger to accusation to tears with such dizzying speed that he didnt know where to begin to contend with it or with her and because of this when discussions concluded with her banging out of the room the house or this morning the hotel he more often breathed a sigh of relief than did he wonder what he himself could do to approach the problem from another angle i tried he would think when the reality was that hed gone through the motions without trying much at all he rubbed the stiff muscles at the base of his neck they were always the primary indicator of the amount of stress he was currently refusing to acknowledge he shifted in the chair his dressing gown slid partially open with his movement the cold air climbed his good right leg and forced his attention to his left which as always felt nothing he made a disinterested observation of it an activity in which hed engaged only rarely in the past several years but one which hed obsessively pursued day after day in the years before his marriage the object was always the same to inspect the muscles for their degree of atrophy intent upon fending off the disintegration that was the eventual byproduct of paralysis hed regained the use of his left arm over time and through months of teethgrating physical therapy but the leg had been a different creature altogether resistant to every effort at rehabilitation like a soldier unable to heal from psychic war wounds as if they alone could prove hed seen action many of the workings of the brain are still veiled in mystery the doctors had said in contemplative explanation of why the use of his arm would return but not that of his leg when the head undergoes as serious an injury as yours did the prognosis for a full recovery has to be couched in the most guarded terms which was their way of beginning the list of perhapses perhaps he would regain complete use of it over time perhaps he would walk unassisted one day perhaps he would awaken one morning and have sensation restored flexing muscles moving toes and bending the knee but after twelve years it wasnt likely so he held on to what was left after the fi rst four years of obstinate delusion had been stripped away the appearance of normality as long as he could keep atrophy from doing its worst to the muscles hed declare himself satisfied and dismiss the dream hed fended off the disintegration with electrical current the fact that this was an act of vanity was something which he never denied telling himself that it wasnt such a sin to want to look like a perfect physical specimen even if he could no longer be one still he hated the oddity of his gait and despite the number of years that he had lived with it he sometimes still grew momentarily sticky on the palms when exposed to the curiosity in a strangers eyes different they said not quite one of us and while he was different in the limited fashion described by his disability and he couldnt deny it in a strangers presence it was always underscored even for an instant a hundredfold we have certain expectations of people he thought as he idly evaluated the leg theyll be able to walk to talk to see and to hear if they cant or if they do it in a way that defi es our preconceived notions about them we label them we shy away from contact we force them to want to be part of a whole that is in itself without distinction the water in the bathroom began to drain and he glanced at the door wondering if thats what was at the root of the diffi culty he and his wife were having she wanted what was her due the norm he had long believed normality had little intrinsic value he pushed himself to his feet and listened to her movements the surge of water told him she had just stood she would be stepping out of the tub reaching for a towel and wrapping it round her he tapped against the door and opened it she was wiping the mirror free of steam her hair spilling tendrils against her neck from the turban shed fashioned from a second towel her back was to him and from where he stood he could see that her back was lightly beaded with moisture as were her legs which looked smooth and sleek softened by the bath oil that filled the room with the scent of lilies she looked at his reflection and smiled her expression was fond i suppose its well and truly over between us why you didnt join me in the bath you didnt invite me i was sending you mental invitations all through dinner didnt you get them was that your foot under the table then it didnt feel much like tommys come to think of it she chuckled and uncapped her lotion he watched her smooth it against her face muscles moved with the circular motion of her fingers and he made an exercise out of identification trapezius levator scapulae splenius cervicis it was a form of discipline to keep his mind heading in the direction in which he wished it to go the prospect of deferring conversation with deborah till another time was always heightened by the sight of her freshly out of her bath im sorry about bringing the adoption papers he said we made a bargain and i didnt keep my part of it i was hoping to romance you into talking about the problem while we were here ascribe it to male ego and forgive me if you will forgiven she said but there isnt a problem she capped the lotion and began to towel herself off with rather more energy than the task required seeing this he felt the palm of caution fl atten itself against his chest he said nothing else until she had slid into her dressing gown and freed her hair from its towel she was bent from the waist combing her fi ngers through the tangles in lieu of using a brush when he spoke again he chose his words carefully thats an issue of semantics what else can we call whats been happening between us disagreement dispute those dont seem to hit the mark particularly well and god knows we cant stumble in the process of applying scientifi c labels that isnt fair no she raised herself and rooted through her makeup case to produce the slender jacket of pills she popped one from its plastic casing held it up in presentation to him between her thumb and index finger and put it into her mouth she turned on the tap with such decided force that the water hit the bottom of the basin and rose up like spume deborah she ignored him she drank the pill down there now you can set your mind at rest ive just eliminated the problem taking the pills or not is going to be your decision not mine i can stand over you i can attempt to force you i choose not to do so i choose only to make certain you understand my concern which is your health youve made that clear for two months now so ive done what you wanted and ive taken my pills i wont be getting pregnant arent you satisfi ed with that her skin was beginning to mottle always a primary sign that she was feeling backed into a corner her movements were becoming clumsy as well he didnt want to be the cause of her panic but at the same time he wanted to clear the air between them he knew he was being as obstinate as she was but still he pressed on you make it sound as if we dont want the same thing we dont are you asking me to pretend i dont realise that she moved past him into the bedroom where she went to the electric heater and made an adjustment that took too much time and concentration he followed her keeping his distance by resuming his place in the wingback chair a careful three feet away its family he said children two of them perhaps three isnt that the goal wasnt that what we wanted our children simon not two that social services condescends to give us but two that we have thats what i want why she looked up her posture stiffened and he realised he had somehow cut to the quick with a question hed simply not thought to ask before in their every discussion hed been too intent upon pressing home his own points to wonder at her singleminded determination to have a baby no matter the cost why he asked again leaning towards her his elbows on his knees cant you talk about it with me she looked back at the heater reached for one of its knobs twisted it fi ercely dont patronise me you know i cant stand that im not patronising you you are you psychologise everything you probe and twist why cant i just feel what i feel and want what i want without having to examine myself under one of your damned microscopes deborah i want to have a baby is that some sort of crime im not suggesting that does it make me a madwoman no of course not am i pathetic because i want that baby to be ours because i want it to be the way we send down roots because i want to know we created it you and i because i want to be connected to it why does this have to be such a crime it isnt i want to be a real mother i want to experience it i want the child it shouldnt be an act of ego he said and if it is for you then i think youve mistaken what being a parent is all about her head turned back to him her face was aflame thats a nasty thing to say i hope you enjoyed it oh god deborah he reached out to her but couldnt manage to bridge the space between them i dont mean to hurt you youve a fine way of hiding it im sorry yes well its been said no not everything he sought the words with a fair degree of desperation walking the line between trying not to hurt her further and trying himself to understand it seems to me that if being a parent is more than just producing a baby then you can have that experience with any child one you have one you merely take under your wing or one you adopt if the act of parenting and not simply producing is indeed what you want in the fi rst place is it she didnt reply but she also didnt look away he felt it safe to go on i think a great many people go into it without the slightest consideration given to what will be asked of them over the course of their childrens lives i think they go into it without consideration given to anything at all but seeing an infant through to adulthood and beyond takes its own special kind of toll on a person and you have to be prepared for that you have to want the entire experience not simply the act of producing a baby because you feel otherwise incomplete without having done so he didnt need to add the rest that hed had the experience of parenting a child to back up his words that hed had it with her she knew the facts of their shared history eleven years her senior hed made her one of his primary responsibilities from the time he was eighteen years old who she was today was in large part due to the influence hed had in shaping her life the fact that hed been a second father of sorts was part blessing in their marriage and large part curse he drew upon the blessing of it now hoping that she could fight her way through the fear or anger or whatever it was that kept getting in the way of their reaching each other banking on their shared past to help them fi nd a way into the future deborah he said you dont have to prove anything to anyone not to the world and certainly not to me never to me so if this is all about proving for gods sake let it go before it destroys you its not about proving what then if not that its just thati always pictured what it would be like her lower lip trembled she pressed her fingertips to it it would grow inside me all those months id feel it kick and id put your hand on my stomach youd feel it as well wed talk about names and make a nursery ready and when i delivered youd be there with me it would be just like an act of forever between us because wed made this this little person together i wanted that but thats fiction deborah thats not the binding the stuff of life is the binding this between us now this is the binding and were the forever he held out his hand once again this time she took it although she remained where she was those careful three feet away come back to me he said race up and down the stairs with your knapsack and your cameras clutter up the house with your photographs play music too loudly leave your clothes on the floor talk to me and argue and be curious about everything be alive to your fingertips i want you back her tears spilled over ive forgotten the way i dont believe that its all there inside you but somehow for some reason the idea of a baby has taken its place why deborah she lowered her head and shook it her fi ngers loosened in his their hands dropped to their sides and he realised that despite his intentions and all of his words there was more to be said that his wife wasnt saying the case at hand chapter thirteen in best victorian fashion cotes hall was a structure that seemed to consist solely of weathervanes chimneys and gables from which bay and oriel windows reflected the ashen morning sky it was built of limestone and the combination of neglect and exposure to weather had caused the exterior to grow unappealingly lichenous with streaks of greygreen descending from the roof in a pattern that resembled a vertical alluvial fan the land that immediately surrounded the hall had been taken over by weeds and while it commanded an impressive view of the forest and the hills to its west and its east the bleak winter landscape in conjunction with the propertys general condition made the idea of living there more repellent than welcome lynley eased the bentley over the last of the ruts and into the courtyard round which the hall loomed like the house of usher he gave a moments thought to st john townleyyoungs appearance at crofters inn on the previous night on the way out hed encountered his soninlaw plainly having a drink with a woman who was not his wife and from townleyyoungs reaction it appeared that this was not the younger mans first such transgression at the time lynley had thought that theyd unwittingly stumbled upon the motive behind the pranks at the hall as well as the identity of the prankster a woman who was the third point of a lovetriangle might go to extreme lengths to disrupt the tranquillity and the marriage of a man she wanted for herself however as he ran his eyes from the halls rusting weathervanes to the great gaps in its rainpipes to the snarl of weeds and patches of damp where the base of the structure met the ground lynley was forced to admit that that had been a facile and largely chauvinistic conclusion he who didnt even have to face it shuddered at the thought of having to live here no matter the renovation inside the exterior of the hall as well as its gardens and park would take years of devoted labour to turn round he couldnt blame anyone wedded blissfully or otherwise for trying to avoid it in whatever way he could he parked the car between an openback lorry stacked high with lumber and a minivan with crackwell and sons plumbing ltd emblazoned in orange letters on its side from inside the house came the mixed sounds of hammer saw cursing and march of the toreadors at medium volume in unconscious time to the music an elderly man in ruststained coveralls teetered out a rear door balancing a roll of carpet on his shoulder it appeared to be sodden he dumped it along the side of the lorry nodding at lynley he said help you with something mate and lit a cigarette while waiting for the answer the caretakers cottage lynley said im looking for mrs spence the man lifted his bristly chin in the direction of a carriage house across the courtyard abutting it was a smaller building an architectural miniature of the hall itself but unlike the hall its limestone exterior had been scrubbed clean and there were curtains in the windows round the front door someone had planted winter irises their blooms made a bright screen of yellow and purple against the grey walls the door was closed when lynley knocked and no one answered the man called out try the garden the greenhouse before he trudged back into the hall the garden proved to be a plot of land behind the cottage separated from the courtyard by a wall into which a green gate was recessed this opened easily despite the rust on its hinges and it gave way to what was clearly juliet spences demesne here the earth was ploughed and free of weeds the air smelled of compost in a flower bed along the side of the cottage twigs crisscrossed over a covering of straw that protected the crowns of perennials from the frost it was clear that mrs spence was preparing to do some sort of planting at the far side of the garden for a large vegetable patch had been marked out with boards pounded into the earth and pinewood stakes stood at the head and the foot of what would be rows of plants some six months from now the greenhouse was just beyond this its door was closed its glass panes were opaque behind these lynley could see the form of a woman moving her arms extended to tend to some sort of plant that was hanging on a level with her head he crossed the garden his wellingtons sank into damp soil that formed a path from the cottage to the greenhouse and ultimately into the wood beyond the door wasnt latched the pressure of a single light tap swung it soundlessly open mrs spence apparently neither heard the tap nor immediately noticed the influx of cooler air because she went on with her work giving him the welcome opportunity to observe the hanging plants were fuchsias they grew from wire baskets lined with some sort of moss theyd been trimmed for the winter but not stripped of all their leaves and it was these that mrs spence appeared to be attending to she was pumping a malodorous spray upon them pausing to turn each basket so that she doused the plant thoroughly before moving on to the next one she was saying take that you little bastards and working the pump swiftly she looked harmless enough poking round the greenhouse among her plants true her choice of headgear was a little bit odd but one couldnt judge and condemn a woman for wearing a faded red bandana round her forehead if anything it made her look like an american navajo and it served its purpose anchoring her hair away from her face this bore smudges of dirt which she further smeared by rubbing the back of her hand protected by a frayed and fingerless mitten across one cheek she was middleaged but her activity had the concentration of youth and watching her lynley found it difficult to call her murderess this marked hesitation made him uneasy it forced him to consider not only the facts he already had but also those in the process of unveiling themselves as he stood in the doorway the greenhouse was a hotchpotch of plants they stood in both clay and plastic pots along a central table they lined the two work tops that ran the length of the greenhouse sides they came in all shapes and sizes in every imaginable type of container and as he worked his eyes through them he wondered how much of colin shepherds investigating had gone on in here juliet spence turned from the last of the hanging baskets of fuchsias she started when she saw him her right hand reached instinctively for the loose cowlneck of her black pullover in an inherently female defensive manoeuvre her left hand still held the pump however obviously she had the presence of mind not to set it down when she could use it on him if necessary what do you want sorry he said i knocked you didnt hear me detective inspector lynley new scotland yard i see he reached for his identifi cation she waved him off revealing a large hole in her pullovers armpit it acted as companion evidently to the threadbare condition of her muddy jeans thats unnecessary she said i believe you colin told me youd probably come round this morning she placed the pump on the work top amid the plants and fingered the remaining leaves of the nearest fuchsia he could see that they were abnormally ragged capsids she said in explanation theyre insidious like thrips you generally cant tell theyre attacking the plant until the damage is evident isnt that always the case she shook her head giving another blast of insecticide to one of the plants sometimes the pest leaves a calling card other times you dont know hes come for a visit until its too late to do anything but kill him and hope you dont kill the plant in the process except that i dont suppose i ought to be talking to you about killing as if i enjoy it even when i do perhaps when a creature is the instrument of anothers destruction it has to be killed thats certainly my feeling ive never been one to welcome aphids into my garden inspector he started to enter the greenhouse she said in there first please and pointed to a shallow plastic tray of green powder just inside the door disinfectant she explained it kills microorganisms theres no sense in bringing other unwelcome visitors inside on the soles of ones shoes he obliged her closing the door and stepping into the tray in which her own footprints had already left their mark he could see the residue of disinfectant speckling the sides and crusting the seams of her roundtoed boots you spend a great deal of time in here he noted i like to grow things a hobby its very peaceful raising plants a few minutes with ones hands in the soil and the rest of the world seems to fade away its a form of escape and you need to escape doesnt everyone at one time or another dont you i cant deny it the floor consisted of gravel and a slightly elevated path of brick he walked along this between the central table and the peripheral work top and joined her with the door closed the air in the greenhouse was some degrees warmer than the air outside it was heavily tinctured with the scent of potting soil fi sh emulsion and the odour of the insecticide shed been pumping what sorts of plants do you grow in here he asked aside from the fuchsias she leaned against the work top as she spoke pointing out the examples with a hand whose nails were clipped like a mans and crusted with dirt she didnt appear to mind or even to notice ive been babying along some cyclamen for ages theyre the ones with the stems that look nearly transparent lined up over there in the yellow pots the others are philodendrons grape ivy amaryllis ive got african violets ferns and palms but something tells me you probably recognise them well enough and theseshe moved to a shelf above which a growlight glowed over four wide black trays where tiny plants were sproutingare my seedlings seedlings i start my garden in here in the winter green beans cucumbers peas lettuce tomatoes these are carrots and onions im trying vidalias although every gardening book ive read predicts utter failure there what do you do with it all the plants i generally offer in prestons carboot sale the vegetables we eat my daughter and i and parsnips do you grow those as well no she said and folded her arms but weve come to it havent we we have yes im sorry theres no need to apologise inspector youve a job to do but i hope you wont mind if i work while we talk she gave him little choice in the minding she picked up a small cultivator from among the clutter of gardening utensils which filled a tin pail underneath the central table she began to move along the potted houseplants gently loosening their soil have you eaten wild parsnip from this area before several times so you know it when you see it yes of course but you didnt last month i thought i did tell me about it the plant the dinner what both where did the water hemlock come from she pinched a straggly stem from one of the larger philodendrons and threw it into a plastic sack of rubbish beneath the table i thought it was wild parsnip she clarifi ed accepted for the moment where did it come from not far from the hall theres a pond on the grounds its terribly overgrown you probably noticed the state things are in and i found a stand of wild parsnip there what i thought was parsnip had you eaten parsnip from the pond before from the grounds but not from that location by the pond id only seen the plants what was the root stock like like parsnip obviously a single root a bundle she bent over a particularly verdant fern parted its fronds examined its base and then lifted the plant to the work top opposite she went on with her cultivating it must have been a single but i dont actually recall the look of it you know what it should have been a single root yes i know that inspector and it would make it far easier on both of us if i just lied and declared it was definitely a single root i dug up but the fact is i was in a rush that day id gone to the cellar discovered i had only two small parsnips and hurried out to the pond where i thought id seen more i dug one up and came back to the cottage i assume the root i brought with me was a single but i cant recall for a fact that it was i cant picture it dangling from my hand odd wouldnt you say it is after all one of the most important details i cant help that but i would appreciate being given some credit for telling the truth believe me a lie would be far more convenient and your illness she set down her cultivator and pressed the back of her wrist to the faded red headband she dislodged upon it a speckling of soil what illness constable shepherd said you were ill yourself that night he said youd eaten some of the hemlock as well he claimed to have dropped by that evening and found you colins trying to protect me hes afraid hes worried now then as well she replaced the cultivator among the other tools and went to adjust a dial on what appeared to be the irrigation system the slow dripping of water began a moment later somewhere to their right she kept her eyes and her hand on the dial as she continued that was part of the convenience inspector colins saying hed just dropped by lynley followed the previously established euphemism i take it he didnt drop by at all oh he did he was here but it wasnt a coincidence he didnt just happen to be on his rounds thats what he told the inquest thats what he told his father and sergeant hawkins thats what he told everyone but thats not what happened you arranged for him to come i telephoned him i see the alibi she looked up at that her expression seemed resigned rather than culpable or afraid she took a moment to strip off her tattered mittens and tuck them into the sleeves of her sweater before saying thats exactly what colin said people would think that i was phoning him to establish a form of innocence she ate the stuff as well hed have to say at the inquest i was at the cottage i saw for myself which is what he said as i understand it hed have said the rest if id had my way but i couldnt convince him of the necessity of saying id phoned him because id been sick three times i wasnt handling the pain of it very well and i wanted him near so he ended up putting himself at risk by colouring the truth and i dont much like living with that knowledge hes at risk in any number of ways at this point mrs spence the investigation is fi lled with irregularities he needed to hand the case over to a cid team from clitheroe since he didnt do that hed have been wise to conduct any interrogations with an offi cial witness present and considering his involvement with you he should have stepped out of the process altogether he wants to protect me that may be the case but it looks a far sight nastier than that what do you mean it looks as if shepherds covering up his own crime whatever that may have been she pushed herself abruptly from the central table against which she had been leaning she walked two paces away from him then back again pulling off her headband look please these are the facts her words were terse i went out to the pond i dug up water hemlock i thought it was parsnip i cooked it i served it mr sage died colin shepherd had no part of this did he know mr sage was coming to dinner i said he had no part of this did he ever ask you about your relationship with sage colins done nothing is there a mr spence she balled the bandana into her fi st i no and your daughters father thats none of your business this has absolutely nothing to do with maggie not at all she wasnt even here that day for the dinner she was in the village spending the night with the wraggs but she was here that day earlier when you went out to look for the wild parsnip in the first place perhaps while you were cooking her face seemed rigid hear me inspector maggie isnt involved youre avoiding the questions that tends to suggest youve something to hide something about your daughter she moved past him towards the door of the greenhouse the space was confi ned her arm brushed against him as she passed and it would have taken little enough effort to detain her but he chose not to do so he followed her out before he could ask another question she spoke id gone to the root cellar there were only two left i needed more thats the extent of it show me if you will she led him across the garden to the cottage where she opened the door to what appeared to be the kitchen and removed a key from a hook just inside not ten feet away she unfastened the padlock on the sloping cellar door and lifted it a moment he said he lowered and lifted it for himself like the gate in the wall it moved easily enough and like the gate it moved without noise he nodded and she descended the steps there was no electricity in the root cellar light was supplied from the doorway and from a single small window at the level of the ground this was the size of a shoe carton and partially obstructed by the straw which covered the plants outside the result was a chamber of moisture and shadow comprising perhaps an eightfoot square its walls were an unfinished mixture of stone and earth its floor was the same although some effort had been expended at one time to make it even mrs spence gestured towards one of four roughly hewn shelves bolted to the wall that was farthest from the light aside from a neat stack of bushel baskets the shelves were all the room contained save what they themselves held on the top three sat rows of canning jars their labels indecipherable in the gloom on the bottom stood five small wire bins potatoes carrots and onions fi lled three the other two held nothing lynley said youve not replenished your supply i dont think much of eating parsnips any longer and certainly not wild ones he touched the rim of one of the empty bins he moved his hand to the shelf that held it there was no sign of either dust or disuse he said why do you keep the cellar door locked have you always done when she didnt reply at once he turned from the shelves to look at her her back was to the muted light of morning that shone through the door so he couldnt read her expression mrs spence ive kept it locked since october last why it has nothing to do with any of this id appreciate an answer nonetheless ive just given one mrs spence shall we pause to look at the facts a man is dead at your hands youve a relationship with the police offi cial who investigated the death if either of you thinks all right because of maggie inspector i wanted to give her one less place to have sex with her boyfriend shed already used the hall id put a stop to that i was trying to eliminate the rest of the possibilities this seemed to be one of them so i locked it up not that it mattered as ive since discovered but you kept the key on a hook in the kitchen yes in plain sight yes where she could get to it where i could get to it quickly as well she ran an impatient hand back through her hair inspector please you dont know my daughter maggie tries to be good she thought shed been wicked enough already she gave me her word that she wouldnt have sex with nick ware again and i told her id help her keep the promise the lock itself was suffi cient to keep her out i wasnt thinking about maggie and sex lynley said he saw her glance move from his face to the shelves behind him he knew what she was looking at largely because she didnt allow her eyes to rest upon it longer than an instant when you go out do you lock your doors yes when youre in the greenhouse when you make your rounds of the hall when you leave to look for wild parsnips no but then im not out for long and id know if someone were prowling round do you take your handbag your car keys the keys to the cottage the cellar key no so you didnt lock up when you went out to look for parsnips on the day that mr sage died no but i know where youre heading and it isnt going to work people cant come and go here without my knowing that simply doesnt happen its like a sixth sense whenever maggie met with nick i knew yes lynley said quite please show me where you found the water hemlock mrs spence ive told you i thought it was indeed wild parsnip she hesitated one hand lifted as if there was a point she wanted to make she dropped both saying this way quietly they went out through the gate across the courtyard three of the workers were having morning coffee in the bed of the openback lorry their thermos jugs were lined up on one stack of lumber another they used as their chairs they watched lynley and mrs spence with undisguised curiosity it was clear that this visit was going to be fuel for the fi res of gossip by the end of the day in the better light lynley took a moment to evaluate mrs spence as they crossed the courtyard and walked round the gabled east wing of the hall she was blinking rapidly as if in an effort to free her eyes of soot but the cowlneck of her pullover showed how the muscles of her neck were straining he realised that she was trying not to cry the worst part of policework lay buried in the effort it took not to empathise an investigation required a heart that attached itself to the victim alone or to a crime whose commission called out for justice while lynleys sergeant had mastered the ability to wear emotional blinkers when it came to a case lynley found himself more often than not torn in a dozen unlikely directions as he gathered information and came to know the facts and the principals involved they were rarely black or white he had come to find it was inconveniently not a blackorwhite world he paused on the terrace outside the east wing the paving stones here were cracked and clotted with winterdead weeds and the view was of a frostcoated hillside this sloped down to a pond beyond which another hillside rose steeply its summit hidden by the mist he said youve had trouble here as i understand work disrupted that sort of thing it sounds as if someone doesnt want the newlyweds to take over the hall she seemed to misunderstand his intentions in speaking seeing it as another attempt at accusation rather than as an opportunity for a moments reprieve she cleared her throat and rebounded from whatever distress she was feeling maggie used it less than half a dozen times thats all he briefly toyed with the idea of reassuring her about the nature of his comments he rejected it and followed her lead how did she get in nick her boyfriend loosened a board covering one of the windows in the west wing ive nailed it shut since unfortunately that hasnt put a stop to the mischief you didnt know at once that maggie and her friend were using the hall you couldnt tell someone had been prowling round i was referring to someone prowling round the cottage inspector lynley surely you yourself would be aware if some sort of intruder had been in your own home if he conducted a search or took something yes otherwise im not certain believe me i am with the toe of her boot she dislodged a tangle of flowerless dandelions from between two of the terrace stones she picked up the weed examined several rosettes of the scratchy toothed leaves and hurled it aside but youve never managed to catch the prankster here he or she has never made a sound to attract your attention never stumbled into your garden by mistake no youve never heard a car or a motorbike i havent and your rounds have been varied enough that someone bent on mischief wouldnt be able to predict when youd be likely to take another turn round the grounds impatiently she shoved her hair behind her ears thats correct inspector may i ask what this has to do with what happened to mr sage he smiled affably im not entirely sure she looked in the direction of the pond at the base of the hill her intention clear but he found that he wasnt quite ready to move on he gave his attention to the east wing of the house its lower bay windows were boarded over two of the upper ones bore seamlike cracks it looks as if its stood vacant for years its never been lived in aside from three months shortly after it was built why not its haunted by whom the sisterinlaw of mr townleyyoungs greatgrandfather what does that make her his greatgrandaunt she didnt wait for reply she killed herself here they thought shed gone out for a walk when she didnt return by evening they began a search it was five days before they thought of searching the house and shed hanged herself from a beam in the luggage room next to the garret it was summer the servants were tracking down the smell her husband couldnt face continuing life here a romantic thought but he was dead already hed been killed on their wedding trip they said it was a hunting accident but no one was ever particularly forthcoming about how it happened his wife returned alone so everyone thought they didnt know at first she brought syphilis with her his gift to their marriage evidently she smiled without humour not at him but at the house according to legend she walks the upper corridor weeping the townleyyoungs like to think its with remorse for having killed her husband i like to think its with regret for having married the man in the first place it was after all there was no easy cure for syphilis or for marriage she strode off the terrace in the direction of the pond he watched her for a moment she took long steps despite her heavy boots her hair lifted with her movement in two greying arcs sweeping back from her face the slope he followed her down was icy its grass long defeated by purslane and furze at its base the pond lay in the shape of a kidney bean it was thickly overgrown resembling a marsh with water that was murky and no doubt in the summer a breeding ground for everything from insects to disease unkempt reeds and denuded weeds grew waisttall round it the latter sent out tendrils to grasp at clothes but mrs spence seemed oblivious of this she waded into their midst and brushed the clinging bits of them aside she stopped less than a yard from the waters edge here she said as far as lynley could tell the vegetation she indicated was indistinguishable from the vegetation everywhere else in the spring or summer perhaps flowers or fruit might give an indication of the genera if not the species that now appeared to be little more than skeletal shrubs and brambles he recognised nettle easily enough because its toothed leaves still clung to the stem of the plant and reeds were the same in shape and size from season to season but as for the rest he was mystifi ed she apparently saw this for she said part of it is knowing where the plants grow when theyre in season inspector if youre looking for roots theyre still in the ground even when the stems leaves and flowers are gone she pointed to her left where an oblong of ground resembled nothing more than a mat of dead leaves from which a spindly bush grew meadowsweet and wolfbane grow there in the summer farther up theres a fine patch of chamomile she bent and rooted through the weeds at her feet saying and if youre in doubt the leaves of the plant dont go much farther than the ground beneath it they disintegrate ultimately but the process takes ages and in the meantime youve got your source of identifi cation right here she extended her hand in it she held the remains of a feathery leaf not unlike parsley in appearance this tells you where to dig she said show me she did so no trowel or hoe was necessary the earth was damp it was simple enough for her to uproot a plant by pulling on the crown and the stems that remained of it above the ground she knocked the root stock sharply against her knee to dislodge the clods of earth that were still clinging to it and both of them stared without speaking at the result she was holding a thickened stock of the plant from which a bundle of tubers grew she dropped it immediately as if without even being ingested it still had the power to kill tell me about mr sage lynley said chapter fourteen her eyes couldnt seem to move from the hemlock she had dropped surely i would have seen the multiple tubers she said i would have known even now id remember were you distracted did someone see you did someone call out to you while you were digging still she didnt look at him i was in a rush i came down the slope made for this spot cleared away the snow and found the parsnip the hemlock mrs spence just as you did now it had to have been a single root i would have seen otherwise i would have known tell me about mr sage he repeated she raised her head her expression seemed bleak he came to the cottage several times he wanted to talk about the church and maggie why maggie shed grown fond of him hed taken an interest in her what sort of interest he knew she and i were having our troubles what mother and daughter dont he wanted to intercede did you object to this i didnt particularly enjoy feeling inadequate as a mother if thats what you mean but i let him come and i let him talk maggie wanted me to see him i wanted to make maggie happy and the night he died what happened then nothing more than had happened before he wanted to counsel me about religion about maggie about both actually he wanted me to join the church and he wanted me to let maggie do the same that was the extent of it not exactly she wiped her hands on the faded bandana which she took from the pocket of her jeans she balled it up tucked it into the sleeve of her sweater to join her mittens and shivered her pullover was heavy but it would not be enough protection against the cold seeing this lynley decided to continue the interview right where they were her uprooting of the water hemlock had given him the whip hand if only momentarily he was determined to use it and to strengthen it by whatever means were available cold was one of them then what he asked he wanted to talk to me about parenthood inspector he felt i was keeping too tight a rein on my daughter it was his belief that the more i insisted upon chastity from maggie the more id drive her away he felt if she was having sex she should be taking precautions against pregnancy i felt she shouldnt be having sex at all precautions or not shes thirteen years old shes little more than a child did you argue about her did i poison him because he disagreed with how i was bringing her up she was trembling but not from distress he thought aside from the earlier tears which she had managed to control within moments of being tested by them she didnt really appear to be the sort of woman who would allow herself an overt display of anxiety in the presence of the police he didnt have children he wasnt even married its one thing to express an opinion growing out of a mutual experience its quite another to offer advice having no basis in anything but reading psychology texts and possessing a glorified ideal of family life how could i possibly take his concerns to heart despite this you didnt argue with him no as i said i was willing to hear him out i did that much for maggie because she was fond of him and thats the extent of it i had my beliefs he had his he wanted maggie to use contraceptives i wanted her to stop complicating her life by having sex in the fi rst place i didnt think she was ready for it he thought it was too late to turn her behaviour around we chose to disagree and maggie what where did she stand in this disagreement we didnt discuss it did she discuss it with sage i wouldnt know but they were close she was fond of him did she see him often now and again with your knowledge and approval she lowered her head her right foot dug at the weeds in a spasmodic kicking motion weve always been close maggie and i until this business with nick so i knew about it when she saw the vicar the nature of the answer said everything dread love and anxiety he wondered if they went hand in hand with motherhood what did you serve him for dinner that night lamb mint jelly peas parsnips what happened we talked he left shortly after nine was he feeling ill he didnt say only that he had a walk ahead of him and since it had been snowing he ought to be off you didnt offer to drive him i wasnt feeling well i thought it was fl u i was just as happy to have him leave frankly could he have stopped somewhere along the way home her eyes moved to the hall on its crest of land from there to the oak wood beyond it she appeared to be evaluating this as a possibility but then she said fi rmly no theres the lodge his housekeeper lives there polly yarkin but that would have taken him out of his way and i cant see what reason hed have to stop by and visit with polly when he saw her every day at the vicarage beyond that its easier to get back to the village on the footpath and colin found him on the footpath the next morning you didnt think to phone him that night when you yourself were being sick i didnt attach my condition to the food i said already i thought id got flu if hed mentioned feeling unwell before he left i might have phoned him but he hadnt mentioned it so i didnt make the connection yet he died on the footpath how far is that from here a mile less hed have been stricken rather quickly wouldnt you say he must have been yes i wonder how it was that he died and you didnt she met his gaze squarely i couldnt say he gave her a long ten seconds of silence in which to move her eyes off him when she didnt do so he finally nodded and directed his own attention to the pond the edges he saw wore a dingy skin of ice like a coating of wax that encircled the reeds each night and day of continued cold weather would extend the skin farther towards the centre of the water when entirely covered the pond would look like the frosty ground that surrounded it appearing to be an uneven but nonetheless innocuous smear of land the wary would avoid it seeing it clearly for what it was the innocent or oblivious would attempt to cross it breaking through its false and fragile surface to encounter the foul stagnation beneath how are things between you and your daughter now mrs spence he asked does she listen to you now that the vicars gone mrs spence took the mittens from the sleeves of her pullover she thrust her hands into them her fingers bare it was clear she intended to go back to work maggie isnt listening to anyone she said lynley slipped the cassette into the bentleys tape player and turned up the volume helen would have been pleased with the choice haydns concerto in eflat major with wynton marsalis on the trumpet uplifting and joyful with violins supplying the counterpoint to the trumpets pure notes it was utterly unlike his usual selection of some grim russian good lord tommy didnt they compose anything just the merest bit listenerfriendly what made them so ghoulish dyou think it was the weather he smiled at the thought of her johann strauss she would request oh all right i know simply too pedestrian for your lofty taste then compromise mozart and in would pop eine kleine nachtmusik the only piece by mozart which helen could invariably identify announcing that her ability to do so kept her free of the epithet absolute philistine he drove south away from the village he put the thought of helen aside he passed beneath the bare tree branches and headed for the moors thinking about one of the basic tenets of criminology there is always a relationship between the killer and the victim in a premeditated murder this is not the case in a serial killing where the killer is driven by rages and urges incomprehensible to the society in which he lives nor is it always the case in a crime of passion when a murder grows out of an unexpected transitory but nonetheless virulent blaze of anger jealousy revenge or hate nor is it like an accidental death in which the forces of coincidence bring the killer and the victim together for one moment of inalterable time premeditated murder grows out of a relationship sort through the relationships that the victim has had and inevitably the killer turns up this bit of knowlege was part of every policemans bible it went hand in glove with the fact that most victims know their killers it was second cousin to the additional fact that most killings are committed by one of the victims immediate relatives juliet spence may well have poisoned robin sage in a horrible accident the consequences of which she would have to wrestle with for the rest of her life it would not be the first time someone with a bent towards the natural and organic life picked up a wildgrown bit of root or fungi flowers or fruit and ended up killing himself or someone else as a result of an error in identification but if st james was correct if juliet spence couldnt have realistically survived even the smallest ingestion of water hemlock if the symptoms of fever and vomiting couldnt be attached to hemlock poisoning in the first place then there had to be a connection between juliet spence and the man who had died at her hands if this was the case then the superficial connection appeared to be juliets daughter maggie the grammar school an uninteresting brick building that sat at the triangle created by the juncture of two converging streets was not far from the centre of clitheroe it was elevenforty when he pulled into the car park and slid carefully into the space left between an antique austinhealey and a conventional golf of recent vintage with an infants safety seat riding as passenger a small homemade sticker reading mind the baby was affixed to the golfs rear window lessons were in progress inside the school judging from both the emptiness of the long linoleumfloored corridors and the closed doors that lined them the administration offices were just inside facing one another to the left and the right of the entrance at one time suitable titles had been painted in black upon the opaque glass that comprised the upper half of their doors but the passing years had reduced the letters to speckles the approximate colour of wet soot from which one could barely make out the words headmistress bursar masters common room and second master in selfimportant graecoroman printing he chose the headmistress after a few minutes loud and repetitive conversation with an octogenarian secretary whom he found nodding over a strip of knitting that appeared to be the sleeve of a sweater appropriate in size for a male gorilla he was shown into the headmistress study mrs crone was engraved across a placard that sat on her desk an unfortunate name lynley thought he spent the moments until her arrival considering all the possible sobriquets the pupils probably had invented for her they seemed infi nite in both variety and connotation she turned out to be the antithesis of all of them in a penciltight skirt hemmed a good five inches above the knee and an overlong cardigan with padded shoulders and enormous buttons she wore discoidal gold earrings a necklace to match and shoes whose skyscraper heels directed the eye inexorably to an outstanding pair of ankles she was the sort of woman who asked for the onceover twice or more and as he forced his eyes to remain on her face lynley wondered how the schools board of governors had ever settled upon such a creature for the job she couldnt have been more than twentyeight years old he managed to make his request with the minimum of time given to speculating what she looked like naked forgiving himself for the instant of fantasy by telling himself it was the curse of being male in the presence of a beautiful woman he had always experienced that kneejerk reaction of being reduced if only momentarily to skin bone and testosterone he liked to believe that this response to an exposure to feminine stimuli had nothing to do with who he really was and where his loyalties lay but he could imagine helens reaction to this minor and assuredly inconsequential battle with lustintheheart so he engaged in a mental explanation of his behaviour using terms like idle curiosity and scientifi c study and for gods sake stop overreacting to things helen as if she were present standing in the corner silently watching and knowing his thoughts maggie spence was in a latin lesson mrs crone told him couldnt this wait until lunch a quarter of an hour it couldnt actually and even if it could hed prefer to make contact with the girl in complete privacy at lunch with other pupils milling about there was the chance theyd be seen hed like to spare the girl whatever potential embarrassment he could it couldnt be easy for her after all with her mother having been under police scrutiny once already and now under it again did mrs crone know her mother by the way shed met her on speech day in easter term last year a very nice woman a fi rm disciplinarian but very loving towards maggie obviously devoted to the childs every interest society could use a few more parents like mrs spence behind our nations youth couldnt it inspector indeed mrs crone would get no disagreement from him now about seeing maggie did her mother know hed come if mrs crone would like to phone her the headmistress eyed him carefully and scrutinised his warrant card with such attention that he thought she was going to try it for gold between her teeth at last she handed it back to him and said she would send for the girl if the inspector would be so good as to wait here they could use this study as well she informed him as she herself was on her way to the dining hall where she would remain on duty while the pupils had their lunch but she expected the inspector to allow maggie time for hers she warned in parting and if the girl wasnt in the dining hall by a quarter past twelve mrs crone would send someone to fetch her was that clear did they under stand each other they certainly did in less than five minutes the study door opened and lynley stood as maggie spence came into the room she shut the door behind her with unnecessary care turning the knob to make certain the activity was done in perfect silence she faced him across the room hands clasped behind her back head lowered he knew that in comparison with todays youth his own introduction to sexual activity enthusiastically orchestrated by the mother of one of his friends during the halfterm at lent in his final year at eton had been relatively late hed just turned eighteen but despite the change in mores and the bent towards youthful profligacy he found it diffi cult to believe that this girl was engaged in sexual experimentation of any kind she looked too like a child part of this was her height she couldnt have been much more than an inch over five feet tall part was her posture and demeanour she stood slightly pigeontoed with her navy stockings bunched a bit at her ankles and she shuffled on her feet bent her ankles outwards and looked as if she expected to be caned the rest was personal appearance the rules of the school may have forbidden the wearing of makeup but surely nothing prevented her from taking a more adult approach with her hair this was thick the only attribute she shared with her mother it fell to her waist in a wavy mass and was drawn back from her face and held in place with a large amber barrette shaped like a bow she wore no bob no shelfcut no sophisticated french braid she made no attempt to emulate an actress or a rockandroll star hello he said to her fi nding that he spoke as gently as he would have done to a frightened kitten has mrs crone told you who i am maggie yes but she neednt have done i knew already her arms moved she seemed to be twisting her hands behind her back nick said last night youd come to the village he saw you in the pub he said youd be wanting to talk to all of mr sages good mates and youre one of them arent you she nodded its rough to lose a friend she made no reply merely shuffl ed again on her feet this appeared to be another similarity to her mother he was reminded of mrs spences digging at the terrace weeds with the toe of her boot join me he said id prefer to sit down if you dont mind he drew a second chair to the window and when she sat she finally looked up at him her skyblue eyes regarded him frankly with hesitant curiosity but no trace of guile she was sucking on the inside of her lower lip the action deepened a dimple in her cheek now that she was closer to him he could more easily recognise the budding woman that was altering forever the shell of the child she had a generous mouth her breasts were full her hips were just wide enough to be welcoming hers was the sort of body that was probably going to fight off weight in middle age but now under the staid school uniform of skirt blouse and jumper it was ripe and ready if it was at the insistence of juliet spence that maggie used no makeup and wore a hairstyle more suited to a tenyearold than to a teenager lynley found he couldnt blame her you werent at the cottage the night that mr sage died were you he asked her she shook her head but you were there during the day off and on it was christmas hols see you didnt want to have dinner with mr sage he was your mate after all i wonder you didnt welcome the chance her left hand covered her right she held them balled in her lap it was the night of the monthly dossround she said josie pam and me we spent the night with each other something you do every month in alphabetical order josie maggie pam it was josies turn thats always the funnest because if they arent booked up josies mum lets us choose whatever room in the inn we fancy we took the skylight room its up under the eaves it was snowing and we liked to watch it settle on the glass she was sitting up straight her ankles properly crossed wisps of russet hair uncontrolled by the barrette curled against her cheeks and her forehead dossing at pams is the worse because we have to sleep in the sitting room thats on account of her brothers they have the upstairs bedroom theyre twins pam doesnt like them much she thinks its disgusting that her mummy and dad made more babies at their age theyre fortytwo pams mummy and dad pam says it gives her the creeps to think of her mum and dad like that but i think theyre sweet the twins i mean how do you organise the dossround lynley asked we dont acshully we just do it with no plan well we know its the third friday of the month dont we and we just follow the alphabet like i said josiemaggiepam pams next we did my house this month already i thought maybe josie and pams mummies wouldnt let them doss with me this time round but they did you were worried because of the inquest it was over wasnt it but people in the village she looked out the window two greyhooded jackdaws had landed on the sill and were pecking furiously at three crusts of bread each bird trying to jockey the other from the perch and hence claim the remaining crust mrs crone likes to feed the birds shes got a big cagething in her garden where she raises finches and she always puts seed or something else to eat on the windowsill here i think thats nice except birds quarrel over food have you ever noticed they always act like there wont be enough i cant think why and the people in the village she said i see them watching me sometimes they stop talking when i pass but josie and pams mummies dont do that she dismissed the birds and offered him a smile the dimple made her face both lopsided and endearing last spring we had a dossround in the hall mummy said we could so long as we didnt mess anything about we took sleeping bags we dossed in the dining room pam wanted to go upstairs but josie and i were afraid wed see the ghost so pam went up the stairs with a torch n slept by herself in the west wing only we found out later she wasnt by herself at all josie didnt think much of that did she she said this was supposed to be just for us pamela no men allowed pam said youre just jealous because youve never had a man have you josie said ive had plenty of men missanyblokesscrubber which wasnt exactly the truth and they had such a quarrel that for the next two months pam wouldnt come to the dossround at all but then she did again do all of your mums know which night the dossround is set for the third friday of the month everyone knows did you know youd be missing a dinner with the vicar if you went to josies for the december dossround she nodded but i sort of thought he wanted to see mummy alone why she played her thumb back and forth against the sleeve of her jumper rolling and unrolling it against her white blouse mr shepherd does doesnt he i thought prhaps it would be like that thought or hoped she looked at him earnestly hed come before mr sage mummy sent me to visit with josie so i thought she was interested they talked him and mummy then he came again i thought if he fancied her i could help out by being off but then i found out he didnt fancy her at all not mummy and she didnt fancy him lynley frowned a small alarm was buzzing in his head he didnt like the sound of it what do you mean well they didnt do anything did they not like her and mr shepherd theyd only seen each other a few times though isnt that the case her head bobbed in agreement but he never talked about mummy when i saw him and he never asked after her like i thought he would if he fancied her what did he talk about he liked films and books he talked about them and the bible sometimes he read me stories from the bible he liked the one about the old men who watched the lady taking a bath in the bushes i mean the old men were in the bushes not the lady they wanted to have sex with her because she was so young and beautiful and even though they were old it wasnt like theyd stopped feeling desires themselves mr sage explained it he was good at that what other things did he explain mostly about me like why i was feeling how i felt about she gave the wrist of her jumper a little twist oh just stuff your boyfriend having intercourse with him she dropped her head and concentrated on the jumper her stomach growled hungry she mumbled still she didnt look up you must have been close to the vicar lynley said he said it wasnt bad what i felt for nick he said desire was natural he said everyone felt it he even felt it he said again the buzzing that insidious alarm lynley observed the girl carefully trying to read behind every word she was uttering wondering how much she was leaving unsaid where did you have these conversations maggie in the vicarage pollyd make tea and bring it into the study wed eat jaffa cakes and talk alone she nodded polly didnt much like to talk about the bible she doesnt go to church course we dont either but he talked about the bible with you mostly because we were friends you can talk about stuff with your friends he said you can tell who your friends are because they listen you listened to him he listened to you you were special to each other we were mates she smiled josie said the vicar liked me bettern anyone in the parish and i didnt even go to church she was miffed at that was josie she said why does he want you for tea and for walks on the moors miss maggie spence i said he was lonely and i was his friend did he tell you he was lonely he didnt have to i knew he was always glad to see me he always gave me a hug when i left he was good at hugs you liked them yes he let a moment pass as he considered how best to approach the subject without frightening her off mr sage had been her friend her trusted companion whatever they had shared had been sacred to the girl its nice to be hugged he said musingly few things are nicer if you ask me he could tell she was watching him and he wondered if she sensed his hesitation this type of interview wasnt his forte it required the surgical skill of a psychologist touching as it did upon fear and taboo he was feeling his way forward on precarious ground and not particularly happy about being there friends have secrets sometimes maggie things they know about each other things they say things they do together sometimes its the secrets and the promise of keeping them that make them friends in the first place was that how it was between you and mr sage she was silent he saw that she had gone back to sucking on the inside of her lower lip a wedge of mud had fallen to the fl oor from between the heel and the sole of one of her shoes in her restless movement on the chair she had crushed the mud to brown shards on the axminster carpet mrs crone wouldnt be pleased with that were they a worry to your mum maggie the promises perhaps the secrets he liked me bettern anyone she said did your mum know that he wanted me to be in the social club he said hed speak with her so she would let me join they were going to take an excursion to london he asked me special did i want to go they were going to have a christmas party as well he said surely mummy would let me come to that they talked on the phone the day he died it was too quick a question she blinked rapidly and said mummy didnt do anything mummy wouldnt hurt anyone did she ask him for dinner that night maggie the girl shook her head mummy didnt say she didnt invite him she didnt say she asked him but she told you he was coming maggie weighed an answer he could see her doing so the action evident from the manner in which her eyes lowered to the level of his chest he needed no additional reply how did you know he was coming if she didnt tell you he phoned i heard what it was about the social club the party like i said mummy sounded cross i have no intention of letting her go theres no point in discussing this any further thats what she said then he said something he went on and on and she said he could come for dinner and theyd talk about it then but i didnt think she was going to change her mind that very night mr sage always said one had to strike while the poker could get to the wood she frowned thoughtfully or something like that he never took a first no to mean an always no he knew i wanted to be in the club he thought it was important who directs the club no one not now that mr sages dead who was in it pam and josie girls from the village some from the farms no boys just two she wrinkled her nose the boys were being stubborn about joining but we shall win them over in the end mr sage said we shall put our heads together and develop a plan thats part of the reason why he wanted me in the club you see so that you could put your heads together lynley asked blandly she didnt react so that nick would join cause if nick joined the rest would follow mr sage knew that mr sage knew everything rule one trust your intuition rule two back it up with the facts rule three make an arrest rule four had something to do with where an officer of the law should relieve himself after consuming four pints of guinness at the conclusion of a case and rule five referred to the single activity most highly recommended as a form of celebration once the guilty party was brought to justice detective inspector angus macpherson had handed out the rules printed on garish hotpink cards with suitable illustrations during a divisional meeting at new scotland yard one day and while the fourth and fifth rules had been the cause of general guffawing and lewd remarks the first three lynley had clipped from the rest during an idle moment while waiting on hold on the telephone he used them for a bookmark he considered them an addendum to the judges rules the intuitive deduction that maggie was central to mr sages death had brought him to the clitheroe grammar school in the fi rst place nothing she had said during their conversation disabused him of that belief a lonely middleaged man and a young girl poised on the brink of womanhood made for an uneasy combination no matter the mans ostensible rectitude and the girls overt naiveté if sifting through the ashes of robin sages death disclosed a meticulous approach to the seduction of a child lynley would not be at all surprised it wouldnt be the first time molestation had worn the guise of friendship and sanctity it wouldnt be the last the fact that the violation was perpetrated upon a child was part of its insidious allure and in this case because the child was already sexual whatever guilt might otherwise stay the hand of captivation could be easily ignored she was eager for friendship and approval she yearned for the warmth of contact what better fodder could possibly exist to satiate a mans mere physical desire it wouldnt necessarily have been an issue of power with robin sage nor would it have naturally been a demonstration of his inability to forge or maintain an adult relationship it could have been human temptation pure and simple he was good at hugs as maggie had said she was a child who welcomed them that she was actually far more than a child might have been something the vicar discovered to his own surprise and what then lynley wondered arousal and sages failure to master it the itch in the palms to peel back clothing and expose bare flesh those two traitors to detachment heat and blood pulsing in the groin and demanding action and that clever whisper in the back of the brain what difference does it make shes already doing it shes nobodys innocent its not as if youre seducing a virgin if she doesnt like it she can tell you to stop just hug her close so she can feel you and know graze her breasts quickly glide a hand between her thighs talk about how nice it is to be cuddled just the two of us maggie our special secret my fi nest little mate it all could have happened over a few short weeks she was at odds with her mother she needed a friend lynley pulled the bentley into the street drove to the corner and made the turn to head back into the centre of the town it was possible he thought but at this point so was anything else he was running before his horse to market rule one was crucial there was no doubting that but it could not overshadow rule two he began to look for a phone chapter fifteen hear the summit of cotes fell from above the standing stone they called great north colin shepherd gathered what he hadnt previously added to his storehouse of facts surrounding the death of robin sage when the mist dissipated or when the wind made it drift one could see the grounds of cotes hall quite clearly especially in winter when the trees bore no leaves a few yards below leaning against the stone for a smoke or a rest one was limited to viewing the old mansions roof with its mishmash of chimneypots dormer windows and weathervanes but climb a bit higher to the summit and sit in the shelter of that limestone outcropping that curved like the punctuation of a question which no one would ask and one could see everything from the hall itself in all its ghoulish decrepitude to the courtyard it surrounded on three sides from the grounds that crept out from it reclaimed by nature to the outbuildings intended to serve its needs among these last was the cottage and it was to the cottage and into its garden that colin had watched inspector lynley go while leo dashed from one point of canine interest to another at the summit of the fell led by his nose into a happy exploration of scent colin followed lynleys movements across the garden and into the greenhouse marvelling at the clear vista he had from below the mist had looked much like a solid wall impedimentary to movement and impenetrable to vision but here what had seemed both impassable and opaque proved to have the substance of cobwebs it was damp and cold but otherwise of little account he watched everything counting the minutes they spent inside the greenhouse taking note of their exploration of the cellar he fi led away the fact that the kitchen door of the cottage had been left unlocked behind them when they made their way into the courtyard and across the grounds just as it had been unlocked while juliet worked in solitude in her greenhouse and when she opened it to fetch the cellar key he saw them pause for conversation upon the terrace and when juliet gestured towards the pond he could have predicted what would follow throughout it all he could hear as well not their conversation but the distinct sound of music even when a sudden gust of wind altered the density of the mist he could still hear that spritely march playing anyone who took the trouble to climb cotes fell would know of the comings and goings at the hall and at the cottage it wasnt even necessary to take the risk of trespassing on the townleyyoung land the hike to the summit was a public footpath after all while the going was occasionally steep especially the last stretch above great north it wasnt enough to tax the endurance of anyone lancashire born and bred it was especially not enough to tax the endurance of a woman who made it a regular climb when lynley had reversed his monster of a car out of the courtyard in preparation for the return drive through the potholes and mud that kept most visitors away colin turned from the view and walked over to the questionmark limestone outcropping he squatted in its shelter thoughtfully scooped up a handful of shards and pebbles and let them spill back onto the ground from his loosened fi st leo joined him giving the exterior of the outcropping a thorough olfactory examination and dislodging a miniature landslide of shale from his jacket pocket colin removed a chewedup tennis ball he played it back and forth beneath leos nose hurled it into the mist and watched the dog trot happily in pursuit he moved with perfect surefooted grace did leo he knew his job and had no trouble doing it a short distance from the outcropping colin could see a thin earthen scar marking the hardy grass that was indigenous to the moors and the hillsides it formed a circle approximately nine feet in diameter its circumference delineated by stones that were spaced out evenly perhaps twelve inches apart at the circles centre lay an oblong of granite and he didnt need to approach and examine it to know it would bear the leavings of melted wax the scratches made by a gypsypot and the distinct etching of a fi vepointed star it was no secret to anyone in the village that the top of cotes fell was a sacred place it was heralded by great north long reputed to be capable of giving psychic answers to questions if the questioner both asked and listened with a pure heart and a receptive mind its oddly shaped outcropping of limestone was seen by some as a fertility symbol the stomach of a mother swollen with life and its finial of granite so like an altar that the similarities could not be easily ignored had been wellestablished as a geological oddity in the early decades of the last century this then was a place of ancients where the old ways endured the yarkins had been chief practitioners of the craft and worshippers of the goddess for as long as colin could remember they had never made a secret of it they went about the business of chants rituals candle or cord spells and incantations with a devotion that had garnered them if not respect at least a higher degree of toleration than one would normally expect from villagers whose circumscribed lives and limited experience often promoted a conservative bias towards god monarch country and nothing else but in times of desperation anyones infl uence with any almighty was generally welcome so if illness struck a beloved child if a farmers sheep were dropping with disease if a soldier was due to be posted in northern ireland no one ever declined rita or polly yarkins offer to cast the circle and petition the goddess who really knew after all which deity listened why not hedge ones religious bets cover every one of the supernatural bases and hope for the best hed even done it himself allowing polly to climb this hill time and again for annies sake she wore a gold robe she carried laurel branches in a basket she burned them along with cloves for incense with an alphabet he couldnt read and didnt truly believe was real she carved her request into a thick orange candle and burned it down asking for a miracle telling him that anything was possible if the heart of the witch was pure after all hadnt nick wares mum got her boychild at last and her all of fortynine years old when she had him hadnt mr townleyyoung seen fit to grant an unheard of pension to the men who worked his farms hadnt fork reservoir been developed to provide new jobs for the county these polly said were the boons of the goddess she never permitted him to watch a ritual he wasnt a practitioner after all nor was he an initiate some things she said couldnt be allowed so if the truth be faced he never knew what she actually did when she reached the top of the fell he had never once heard her make a request but from the top of the fell where from the wax drippings on the granite altar colin knew she still was practising the craft polly could see cotes hall she would have been able to monitor movements in the courtyard on the grounds and in the cottage garden no arrival or departure would have gone unnoticed and even if someone headed from the cottage into the wood she could see that from here colin stood and whistled for leo the dog came bounding out of the mist he carried the tennis ball in his mouth and dropped it playfully at colins feet his snout a mere inch or two away ready to snatch it back should his master reach for it colin entertained the retriever with the bit of tugandpull that he wanted smiling at the artificiality of the dogs protective growls finally leo released the ball backed off a few steps and waited for the throw colin hurled it down the hillside in the direction of the hall and watched as the dog gambolled after it colin followed slowly keeping to the footpath he paused by great north and put his hand against it feeling the quick shock of cold that the ancients would have called the rocks magical power did she he asked and closed his eyes for the answer he could feel it in his fingers yesyes the descent wasnt consistently sharp the walk was a cold one but it wasnt impossible so many feet had carved out the track over time that the grass which was slippery with frost in other areas was worn through to the earth and stones on the path the resulting friction against the soles of ones shoes eliminated much risk anyone could make the walk up cotes fell one could walk it in the mist one could walk it at night it switched back on itself three times so that the vista it provided was continually changing a view of the hall became one of the dale with skelshaw farm in the distance a moment later the sight of skelshaw farm gave way to the church and cottages of winslough and finally as the slope became pasture at the bottom of the fell the footpath edged the grounds of cotes hall colin paused here there was no stile in the drystone wall to allow a hiker easy access to the hall but like many areas of the countryside that have gone untended the wall was in marginal disrepair brambles overgrew it in some sections others gaped open with small pyramids of rubble lying beneath them it would take little effort to climb through the gap he did it himself whistling for the dog who followed the land here dipped a second time in a gradual slope that ended at the pond some twenty yards away reaching this colin looked back the way he had come he could make out great north but beyond it nothing the mist and the sky were monochromatic and the frost on the land provided no contrast they hid without even appearing to hide an observer couldnt have asked for more he skirted the pond with the dog at his heels stopping to crouch and examine the root that juliet had unearthed for lynley he rubbed its surface disclosing the dirtyivory flesh and he pressed his thumbnail against the stem a thin bleeding of oil the width of a needle oozed out yesyes he fl ung it into the middle of the pond and watched it sink the water undulated in growing circles that lapped at the edges of the grimy ice he said leo no when the dogs instincts to fetch took him too close to the waters edge he took the tennis ball from him threw it the distance to the terrace and followed him after it she would be back in the greenhouse hed seen her return there when lynley left and he knew shed be seeking the release that came from potting trimming and otherwise working with her plants he thought about stopping he felt the urge to share with her what he knew so far but she wouldnt want to hear it she would protest and fi nd the idea repellent so instead of crossing the courtyard and entering the garden he headed down the lane when he came to the first gap in the bordering lavender he slipped through it with the dog and went into the wood a quarter of an hours walk brought him to the rear of the lodge there was no garden just an open plot of land comprising leaves mud and one anemic italian cypress that appeared to be longing for transplantation this leaned at a windblown angle against the lodges only outbuilding a ramshackle shed with gaps in the roof the door bore no lock it also possessed neither knob nor handle just a rusty ring survivor of neglect and the vicissitudes of weather when he pushed upon it one hinge came apart from the frame screws tumbled out of the rotten wood and the door sagged into a narrow depression in the soggy ground where it fit quite naturally as if used to the place the resulting aperture was large enough for him to slip through he waited for his eyes to adjust to the change in light there was no window just the gray illumination of the day filtering through the poorly sealed walls and streaking in a thin seam from the door outside he heard the dog sniffing round the base of the cypress inside he heard nothing save the sound of his own breathing amplified as it struck the wall in front of him and returned forms began to emerge what was fi rst a slab of wood at waist height jammed with an odd assortment of shapes became a workbench holding sealed gallon tins of paint among these lay stiffened brushes petrifi ed rollers and a stack of aluminum trays two cartons of nails lay behind the paint along with a quart jar on its side spilling out an assortment of screws nuts and bolts everything was covered with what appeared to be at least a decade of grime between two of the paint tins a spiders web hung it trembled with his movement but held no spider lying in wait at its centre colin passed his hand through it feeling the ghosttouch of the strands against his skin they bore no trace of the mucilage produced to trap flying insects the webs solitary architect was long since gone none of that mattered one could enter the shed without disturbing its appearance of disuse and its air of decay he had done so himself he ran his eyes over the walls where nails held tools and gardening implements a rusty saw a hoe a rake two shovels and one balding broom beneath them a green hose pipe coiled at its centre stood a dented pail he looked inside the pail held only a pair of gardening gloves with thumb and index fi nger worn through on the right hand he examined these they were large a mans they fi tted his own hands and in the spot where they had laid at the bottom of the pail the metal shone bright and winked clean in the light he returned them and went back to the search a sack of lawnseed another of fertiliser and a third of peat leaned against a black wheelbarrow which was upended into the farthest corner he moved these to one side and pulled the barrow away from the wall to look behind it a small wooden crate fi lled with rags gave off a faint odour of rodents he upended the crate saw two small creatures scurry for cover under the workbench and rustled through the rags with the toe of his boot he found nothing but the barrow and the bags had looked as undisturbed as the rest of the objects in the shed so he wasnt surprised just thoughtful there were two possibilities and he mulled them over as he returned everything to its appropriate place one was implied by the unmistakable absence of small handtools he had seen no hammer for the nails no driver for the screws no spanner for the nuts and the bolts more importantly he had seen neither trowel nor cultivator despite the presence of rake hoe and shovels disposing of either the trowel or the cultivator would have been too obvious of course disposing of them all was decidedly clever the second possibility was that there had been no handtools in the first place that the longdeparted mr yarkin had removed them along with himself upon his hasty fl ight from winslough more than twentyfive years ago they would have made an odd addition to his baggage to be sure but perhaps hed wanted them for his work what had it been colin tried to recall was it carpentry then why leave the saw if that was the case he carried his developing scenario further if there were no handtools here at the lodge she would have known where to borrow what she needed she would have known when to do the borrowing since she could have waited for the moment from her perch on cotes fell for that matter she could even have watched for her moment from the lodge it sat on the edge of the estate grounds after all she would have heard any car pass and a quick trip to the window would have told her who was driving that made the most sense even if she had her own tools why would she run the risk of using them when she could use juliets and replace them in the greenhouse with no ones being the wiser shed have to go into the garden anyway in order to get to the cellar yes that was it she had motive means and opportunity and although colin felt certainty quicken his pulse he knew he couldnt afford to proceed along this line of suspicion without making solid a few more facts he eased the door closed and tramped through the mud to the lodge leo trotted out of the wood a picture of complete dog bliss with his coat hung with small clods of humus and his ears decorated with blackened dead leaves this was a day to be celebrated for the dog a hike up the fell a bit of runandchase a chance to get thoroughly filthy in the wood forget retrieving when he could root round the oaks like a pig after truffl es stay colin said to him pointing to a beatendown patch of weeds by the door he knocked and hoped the day would be one of celebration for himself as well he heard her before she opened the door the sound of her footsteps rumbled on the floor the sound of her wheezing accompanied her action of unfastening bolts then she stood before him like a walrus on ice one hand spread out on her massive chest as if its pressure could relieve her breathing he could see that he had interrupted her in the process of painting her nails two were aquamarine three were uncoloured all were inhumanly long she said by the stars and sun if it ant mr c shepherd hisself and she looked him over from head to foot her eyes lingering longest upon his groin under her gaze he felt the oddest sensation of heat throbbing in his testicles as if she knew this rita yarkin smiled and emitted a sigh of what appeared to be pleasure so whatre you about mr c shepherd you here as the hopeful answer to a maidens prayers myself being the maiden of course wouldnt want you to misapprehend my meaning id like to come in if thats all right he said would you now she shifted her bulk against the doorjamb the wood groaned she reached out at least a dozen bangles rattling like manacles round her wrist and ran her fingers over his hair he did his best not to cringe cobwebs she said mmmmm heres another where you been putting this pretty head luv may i come inside mrs yarkin rita she looked him over i spose it depends on what you mean by come inside now theres lots of women would welcome you coming wherever you want and just about whenever the fancy takes you but me well im just a bit prticular about my toy boys always have been is polly here its polly youre after is it mr c shepherd now i wonder why is she good enough for you all of a sudden did you get thrown over by her up the lane look rita i dont want a row with you are you going to let me in or shall i come back later she played with one of the three necklaces she wore it was beads and feathers with the wooden head of a goat as its pendant i cant think we got anything here as will interest you perhaps when did you come this year he saw his error in vocabulary from the way her mouth twitched in response he headed her off by saying when did you arrive in winslough twentyfourth of december same as always after the vicars death yeah never got to meet the bloke from the way polly talked about him and everything that happened i wouldve liked to read his palm she reached for colins hand have yours done luv and when he freed himself from her grip scared to know the future are you sos most people lets have a look the news is good you pay the news is bad i keep my mug tight shut sound like a deal if youll let me in she smiled and waddled back from the door have at me luv have you ever poked a woman weighing twenty stone i got more places you can stick it than you got time to explore right colin said he squeezed past her she was wearing enough perfume to permeate the entire lodge it came off her in waves like heat from a coal fire he tried not to breathe they stood in a narrow entrance that did duty as a service porch he untied his muddy boots and left them among the wellingtons umbrellas and mackintoshes he took his time about this process of untying and removing using the activity as a means of observing what the porch held he made particular note of what stood next to a rubbish bin of mouldy brussels sprouts mutton bones four empty packets for custard cremes the remains of a breakfast of fried bread and bacon and a broken lamp without its shade this was a basket and it contained potatoes carrots marrows and a head of lettuce pollys done the shopping he asked thats day before yesterdays brought it by at noon she did does she bring you parsnips for dinner occasionally sure long with everything else why because one doesnt need to buy them they grow wild hereabouts did you know that ritas talon nail was tracing the pendanthead of the goat she played with one horn then the other she gave a sensual stroke to the beard she regarded colin thoughtfully and what if i do did you tell polly i wonder it would be a waste of money to have her buy from the greengrocer what she could dig up herself true but my pollys not much for rooting mr constable we like the natural life make no mistake there but pollys a girl who draws the line at grubbing round the wood on her hands and knees unlike some as i could name shes got better things to do does polly but she knows her plants its part of the craft you have to know all the different woods for burning youd have to recognise your herbs as well doesnt the ritual call for their use ritas face became blank ritual calls for the use of moren you know or understand mr c shepherd and none of it ill be likely to share with you but theres magic in herbs theres magic in lots of things but all of it springs from the will of the goddess praised be her name whether youre using the moon the stars the earth or the sun or the plants or water or fire or anything its the mind of the petitioner and the will of the goddess that make the magic its not to be found in mixing potions and drinkingm down she lumbered through the far doorway and into the kitchen where she went to the tap and held a kettle beneath a dismal trickle of water colin took the opportunity to complete his examination of the service porch it held a bizarre variety of yarkin possessions everything from two bicycle wheels minus their tyres to a rusty anchor with one prong missing a basket for a longdeparted cat occupied one corner and it was heaped with a mound of tattered paperback books whose covers appeared to feature women of impressive bosom caught up in the arms of men on the verge of ravishing them loves savage desperation blazed across one cover passions lost child adorned another if a set of handtools were secreted in the porch among the cardboard cartons of old clothes the antique hoover and the ironing board it would take a thirteenth labour of heracles in order to fi nd them colin joined rita in the kitchen shed gone to the table where among the remains of her midmorning coffee and crumpets she had returned to painting her nails the scent of the polish was making a valiant effort to dominate both her perfume and the smell of bacon grease that seemed to be crackling in a frying pan on the cooker colin switched the pans place with the kettle of water rita gestured her thanks with the nailpolish brush and he wondered what had inspired her choice of colour and where she had managed to purchase it in the fi rst place he said by way of edging cagily towards the purpose of his visit i came in the back way so i noticed sweet face i mean through the garden i had a look at your shed its in bad shape rita the doors come off its hinges shall i fix it for you why thats a firstrate bangon idea mr constable have you any tools must have somewhere she examined her right hand languidly holding it out at arms length where dont know sweet would polly she waggled her hand does she use them rita could be could not but its not like were dead interested in home improvement is it thats typical id think when women dont have a man in the house for a long period of time they i didnt mean me and polly she said i mean me and you or is that part of your job these days popping through back gardens and checking on sheds and offering to fix them for helpless ladies were old friends im happy to be of help she sputtered with a laugh i bet you are happy as a ram at the rut mr constable just being helpful bet if i ask polly shell tell me you been stopping by once or twice a week for years ready to help her out with her chores she laid her left hand on the table and reached for her polish the kettle began to boil he fetched it from the cooker she had already prepared two thick mugs for the water a glittering heap of what appeared to be instant coffee crystals lay at the bottom of each one mug had already been used if the ring of red lipstick was any indication the other printed with the word pisces above which a silvery green fi sh swam in a current of cracked azure glaze apparently was intended for him he hesitated fractionally before pouring the water tilting the mug towards him as surreptitiously as possible for examination rita eyed him and gave him a wink gon luvbunny take a little chance we all got to go sometime dont we she chuckled and bent her head to the work of painting her nails he poured the water there was only one teaspoon on the table already used by the look of it his stomach felt queasy at the thought of putting it into his mug but considering the boiling water as a steriliser he dipped it in quickly and made a few rapid conciliatory revolutions he drank it was defi nitely coffee he said ill have a look for those tools now and took the mug with him to the dining room where he placed it on the table and intended to forget it you have a look for whatever you like rita called after him we got nothing much to hide but whats under our skirts let me know if you want a look there her shriek of laughter followed him from the dining room where a hasty exploration through a dresser disclosed a set of dishes and several tablecloths redolent of moth balls at the foot of the stairs a battleweary canterbury held yellowing copies of a london tabloid a quick glance proved that one of the yarkins had saved only the more delectable issues featuring twoheaded babies corpses giving birth inside coffi ns wolfchildren of the circus and the authorised account of extraterrestrial visitations to a convent in southendonsea he pulled out the single drawer and found himself fi ngering through small chunks of wood he recognised the scent of cedar and pine a leaf was still attached to the laurel the others he would have been hard pressed to name but polly and her mother would have no trouble with the identification they would know by the colour the density the scent he climbed the stairs moving quickly knowing that rita was bound to put an end to his search as soon as shed discovered its limit in amusement value he looked right and left assessing the possibilities presented by a bath and two bedrooms immediately in front of him stood a leatherbound chest upon which sat an unappealing squat bronze of someone male priapic and horned across the passage from this a cupboard gaped open spilling forth linens and assorted jumble fourteenth labour of heracles he thought he went for the first bedroom as rita called his name he ignored her stood in the doorway and cursed the woman was a sloth shed been in the lodge for more than a month and she was still living from her mammoth suitcase what wasnt oozing from this was lying on the fl oor on the backs of two chairs and at the foot of the unmade bed a dressing table next to the window looked as if it had once been a setpiece in a criminal investigation cosmetics and a colour wheel of nailpolish bottles crowded its surface with an impressive patina of face powder dashed across everything much like fingerprint dust necklaces hung from the door knob and from one of the posters of the bed scarves snaked on the fl oor through discarded shoes and every inch of the room seemed to emanate ritas characteristic scent part ripe fruit on the verge of going bad part ageing woman in need of a bath he made a cursory check of the chest of drawers he moved on to the wardrobe and then knelt to examine the space beneath the bed his sole discovery was that the latter served as repository for an extensive array of sluts wool as well as one stuffed black cat with its back arched its fur at the bristle and rita knows and sees printed on a banner that extended from its tail he went to the bath rita called his name a second time he made no reply he shoved his hands through to the rear of a stack of towels that sat on one of the recessed shelves along with cleanser scrubbing rags two kinds of disinfectant a halftorn print of some lady godiva type standing in a clam shell covering her privates and looking coy and a pottery toad somewhere in the lodge there had to be something he felt the facts certainty just as solidly as he felt the lumpy green linoleum beneath his feet and if it wasnt the tools whatever else it might be he would be able to recognise its signifi cance he slid open the mirror of the medicine chest and rooted through aspirin mouth wash toothpaste and laxatives he went through the pockets of a terry bathrobe that hung limply on the back of the door he picked up a stack of paperback books on the top of the toilets cistern fl ipped through them and set them on the edge of the tub and then he found it the colour caught his eye first a streak of lavender against the yellow bathroom wall wedged behind the cistern to keep it out of sight a book not large perhaps five by nine inches and thin with its title worn from the spine he used a toothbrush from the medicine chest to force the book upwards it flopped onto the floor face up next to a balledup washing flannel and for a moment he merely read its title savouring the sensation of having his suspicions vindicated alchemical magic herbs spices and plants why had he thought the proof might be a trowel a threepronged cultivator or a box of tools had she used any of those had she even owned them in the first place what a simple thing it would have been to dispose of them somewhere dig a hole on the estate grounds bury them in the wood but this slim volume of incrimination spoke to the truth of what had happened he flipped the book open haphazardly reading chapter titles and feeling each moment ever more sure the harvests magic potential planets and plants magical attribution and application his eye fell upon descriptions of use he read the warnings appended as well hemlock hemlock he murmured and riffled through the pages his hunger for information grew and facts about hemlock leapt out as if theyd only been waiting for the opportunity to sate him he read turned more pages read again the words flew up at him glowed as if rendered in neon against a night sky and finally the phrase when the moon is full stopped him he stared at this unprepared for memory thinking no no no he felt rage and grief make a knot in his chest shed been lying in bed shed asked him to open the curtains wide shed watched the moon it was the bloody orange of autumn a lunar disc so huge it looked within grasp harvest moon best col annie had whispered and when he turned from the window she had sunk into the coma that led to her death no he whispered not annie no mr c shepherd ritas voice calling imperiously from below closer than before she was near the stairs you having a bit of fun with me undies he fumbled with the buttons of his woollen shirt slipped the book inside flat against his stomach and tucked it into the waistband of his trousers he felt dizzy a glance in the mirror and he saw the high colour smearing palm prints across his cheeks he removed his spectacles and bathed his face holding the icy water against his skin until from out of the pain of the chill anaesthesia spread he dried his face and studied his refl ection he ran both hands through his hair he looked at his skin and examined his eyes and when he was ready to face her with equanimity he went to the stairs she was standing at the bottom and she slapped the banister her bangles rattled her triple chin bounced whatre you up to mr constable shepherd this ant about shed doors and it ant a social call do you know the signs of the zodiac he asked her as he descended he marvelled at the calm of his words why want to see if me and yous compatible sure i knowm aries cancer virgo sagi capricorn he said thats you no im libra the scales nice one that just the thing for your line of work libras october when does capricorn fall in the calendar year do you know rita course i know who dyou think youre jawing some yobbo on the street its december when starts the twentysecond runs for a month why is her up the lane more goat than you thought its just a fancy i had ive one or two of my own she trundled her enormous weight around and headed back in the direction of the kitchen where she positioned herself at the door to the service porch and wiggled her fingers at him in a cometomama gesture made awkward by her care to make certain that the stilltacky nail polish didnt smudge your half of the bargain she said the thought of what she might mean made his legs quiver unexpectedly bargain he asked cmere luvbunny nothing to fear i only bite fellahs whose sign is the bull give us your palm he remembered rita i dont believe in the palm again she gestured more comehither than cometomama this time he cooperated she was after all blocking the only reasonable access to his boots oh nice hand this she ran her fi ngers the length of his and crossed his palm with a feathery touch she whispered a circular caress on his wrist very nice she said her eyes fluttering closed very nice indeed a mans hands these hands that belong on a womans body pleasure hands these they light fi res in the fl esh this doesnt sound much like a fortune to me he tried to pull away she tightened her grip one hand on his wrist and the other holding his fi ngers fl at she turned his hand and placed it on one of her mounds of flesh that he took to be her breast she forced his fingers to squeeze like some of that wouldnt you mr constableperson never had anything quite like it have you there was truth in that she didnt feel like a woman she felt like a quadruple batch of lumpy bread dough the caress had the approximate appeal of gripping onto a fi stful of drying clay make you want more luvbunny mmm her eyelashes were painted thick with mascara they made a crescent of spider legs against her cheek her chest rose and fell with a tremulous sigh and the odour of onions whiffed into his face horned god make him ready rita murmured man to a woman plough to a field giver of pleasure and the force of life aaahhioooouuuu he could feel her nipple huge and erect and his body was responding despite the revolting prospect of the two of themhimself and rita yarkinthis whale in a turban of scarlet and pinkthis mass of fat with fi ngers that slid up his arm cast a blessing on his face and began a suggestive descent down his chest he pulled his hand away her eyes popped open they seemed dazed and unfocussed but a shake of her head cleared them she studied his face and seemed to read what he couldnt hide she chuckled then guffawed then leaned against the kitchen work top and howled you thoughtyou thoughtme and you between the words more laughter spewed forth tears formed in the creases near her eyes when she finally controlled herself she said i told you mr c shepherd when i want it from a man i get it from a bull she blew her nose on a grimylooking tea towel and held out her hand cmere give it no more prayers to get your poor little bowels in an uproar ive got to go dont you though she snapped her fi ngers for his hand she was still blocking egress so he offered it to her he made certain his expression telegraphed how little to his liking this gameplaying was she pulled him to the sink where the light was better good lines she said nice indication of birth and marriage love is she hesitated frowning absently pulling at one of her eyebrows get behind me she said what do it slip your hand beneath my arm so i can get a better look at this right side up when he hesitated she snapped i dont mean no funny business just do it now he did so because of her girth he couldnt see what she was doing but he could feel her fingernails tracing his palm finally she balled up his hand and released it so she said briskly not much to see after all your grumbling just the regular bit nothing of importance nothing to worry you she turned on the tap in the sink and made a project out of rinsing out three glasses on which a residue of milk had formed a skin youre keeping your part of the bargain arent you colin asked whas that pretty face your mugs shut tight s nothing is it you dont believe in it anyways but you do rita i believe in lots of things dont mean theyre real given so tell me ill be the judge i thought you had important stuff to do mr constable wasnt that you in a rush to be gone youre avoiding the answer she shrugged i want it you cant have everything you want sugar pie much as youve been currently getting it she held the glass up to the light of the window it was nearly as dirty as when she began she reached for some liquid detergent and poured a few drops in she returned to the water and used a sponge exerting some rather serious pressure whats that supposed to mean dont ask ninny questions youre a clever enough bloke you figure it out thats the reading convenient for you the phrasing of it rita is that the sort of thing you tell the twits who pay you for their fortunes in blackpool steady on she said it all follows the same pattern this mumbojumbo that you and polly play at stones palms and tarot cards none of its anything more than a game you look for a weakness and use it to benefit yourselves with money your ignorance ant worth the effort of response and thats a manoeuvre as well isnt it turn the other cheek but still score a hit is that what the crafts all about driedup women with nothing to live for but the thought of damaging others lives a spell here a curse there and what does it matter because if someone gets hurt only another member of the craft will know and you all hold your tongues dont you rita isnt that the blessing of a coven she continued washing one glass after another shed chipped one nail the polish was scarred on another love and death she said love and death three times what your palm a single marriage but love and death three times death everywhere you belong to the priesthood of death mr constable oh quite she turned her head from the sink but her hands went on washing its on your palm my boy and the lines dont lie chapter sixteen st james had been at a loss the previous night lying in bed and gazing through the skylight at the stars he thought about the maddening futility of marriage he knew that the slowmotion runningtowardseachotheralongthebeachforthepassionateembracebeforefadeout celluloid depiction of relationships led the romantic in everyone to anticipate a lifetime of happilyeverafter he also knew that the reality taught inch by merciless inch that if there was a happily of any kind it never came for an extended stay and when one opened the door to its ostensible knock one faced the possibility of admitting instead grumpily angrily or a host of others all clamouring for attention it was sometimes extremely disheartening to have to contend with the messiness of life hed been at the point of deciding that the only reasonable way to deal with a woman was not at all when deborah moved towards him from across the bed im sorry she had whispered and slipped her arm across his chest youre my numberone bloke he turned to her she buried her forehead against his shoulder he put his hand on the back of her neck feeling the heavy weight of her hair as well as the childlike softness of her skin im glad of it he whispered in return because youre my numberone bit of fl uff always have been you know always will be he could feel her yawn its hard for me she murmured the paths there isnt it but its the first step thats difficult it keeps messing me up thats the way of things i suppose its how we learn he cradled her he felt the sleep start to take her he wanted to call her back from it but he kissed her head and let her go over breakfast hed still maintained caution however telling himself that while she was his deborah she was also a woman more mercurial than most part of what he savoured about life with her was the unexpected a newspaper editorial alluding to the possibility of the police manufacturing a case against an ira suspect was enough to send her into a fury out of which she might decide to organise a photographic odyssey to belfast or derry to find out whats what for myself by god a report about cruelty to animals took her to the streets to join in a protest discrimination against sufferers from aids dispatched her to the first hospice she could fi nd which accepted volunteers to read to patients to talk and to be a friend because of this from one day to the next he was never quite certain what sort of mood he might find her in when he descended the stairs from his lab to join her for lunch or for dinner the only certainty about life with deborah was that nothing was particularly certain at all he generally revelled in her passionate nature she was more alive than anyone he knew but living completely demanded that she feel completely as well so while her highs were delirious infused with excitement her lows were correspondingly empty of hope and it was the lows that worried him making him want to advise her to rein herself in try not to feel so deeply was the counsel he always found himself ready to voice hed learned long ago to keep that prescription to himself however telling her not to feel was as good as telling her not to breathe besides he liked the whirl of emotion in which she lived if nothing else it kept him from ever being bored so when she said finishing up her grapefruit wedges heres what it is i need a direction i dont like the way ive been fl oundering about its time i narrowed my fi eld of vision i need to make a commitment and go with it he made a vaguely supportive reply as he wondered what on earth she was talking about he said good thats important he buttered a triangle of toast she nodded vigorously at his approval and with gastronomical enthusiasm tapped her spoon against the top of her boiled egg when she didnt appear to be forthcoming with any additional information he said in a tentative reconnaissance of her meaning floundering makes one feel as if theres no foundation dont you think simon thats just exactly it you always understand he mentally patted himself on the back saying a decision about direction gives the foundation doesnt it absolutely she munched happily on her toast she was looking out the window at the grey day damp street and bleak sooty buildings her eyes were alight with whatever obscure possibilities the icy weather and dismal surroundings promised so he said walking a fi ne line between expansive conclusion and information gathering what have you narrowed your vision to i havent entirely decided she said oh she reached for the strawberry jam and plopped a teaspoonful onto her plate except just look at what ive been doing so far landscapes still lifes portraits buildings bridges the interior of hotels ive been eclecticism personified no wonder im not developing a reputation she smeared jam on the toast and waved it at him its this i need to make a decision about what sort of photography gives me the most pleasure i need to follow my heart ive got to stop striking out in every direction whenever someone offers me work i cant excel at everything no one does really but i can excel at something i thought it would be portraits at first when i was in school dyou know then i got sidetracked onto landscapes and still lifes now im just dabbling in whatever commercial assignment comes to hand but thats no good its time to commit so during their morning walk to the common where deborah took the ducks the rest of her toast and while they examined the world war i memorial with its solitary soldier head bowed rifle extended she chatted about her art still lifes presented a wealth of opportunity did he know what the americans were currently doing with flowers and paint had he seen the studies of metal scored heated and treated with acid was he aware of yoshidas depictions of fruit but on the other hand they did seem rather distant didnt they not much emotional risk involved in shooting a tulip or a pear landscapes were lovely what a treat to be a travel photographer and go on assignment to africa or the orient wouldnt that be smashing but they demanded only an eye for composition the skill for lighting the knowledge of fi lters and film all of it technique whereas portraits well there was an element of trust that had to be established between artist and subject and trust required risk portraits forced both parties to come out of themselves you took a picture of a body but if you were good you captured the personality beneath now there was real living didnt he think so engaging the heart and mind of the sitter earning his trust capturing his realness something of a cynic st james wouldnt have put money on most people having much realness under their surface personae but he was happy enough to be involved in deborahs conversation when she first began chatting he tried to evaluate her words tone and expression for the likelihood of their being avoidance shed been upset last night with his intrusion into her territory she wouldnt want a repeat of that but the more she talked weighing this possibility rejecting that exploring her motivations for each the more he felt reassured there was an energy to her that he hadnt seen in the last ten months whatever her reasons for entering into a discussion of her professional future the mood it seemed to engender in her was a far sight better than her previous depression so when she set up her tripod and hasselblad saying the lights good right now and wanted him to pose in the deserted beer garden of crofters inn so that she might test her regard for portraits he let her snap away at every possible angle for more than an hour despite the cold until they received lynleys call she was saying you see i dont think i want to do conventional studio portraits i mean i dont want people coming in and posing for their anniversary snaps i wouldnt mind being called out to do something special but largely i think i want to work on the street and in public places i want to fi nd interesting faces and let the art grow from there when ben wragg announced from the rear door of the inn that inspector lynley was wanting to speak to mr st james the result of that conversation lynley shouting over the noise of some sort of roadwork that appeared to call for minor explosives was a drive to the cathedral at bradford were looking for a connection between them lynley had said perhaps the bishop can provide it and you ive an appointment with clitheroe cid after that the forensic pathologist its formality mostly but its got to be done you saw mrs spence the daughter as well and i dont know im uneasy ive not much doubt that the spence woman did it and knew what she was doing ive plenty of doubt it was conventional murder we need to know more about sage we need to unearth the reason he left cornwall are you on to something he heard lynley sigh in this case i hope not st james thus with deborah at the wheel of their hired car and a phone call made to ensure their reception they drove the considerable distance to bradford skirting pendle hill and swinging to the north of keighley moor the secretary to the lord bishop of bradford admitted them into the offi cial residence not far from the fi fteenthcentury cathedral that was the seat of his ministry he was a toothy young man who carried a maroon leather diary under one arm and continually riffled through its goldedged pages as if to remind them how limited was the bishops time and how fortunate were they that a halfhour had been carved out for them he led the way not into a study library or conference room but through the woodpanelled residence to a rear stairway that descended to a small personal gym in addition to a wallsize mirror the room contained an exercise bike a rowing machine and a complicated contraption for lifting weights it also contained robert glennaven bishop of bradford who was occupied with pushing shoving climbing and otherwise tormenting his body on a fourth machine that consisted of moving stairs and rods my lord bishop the secretary said he made the introductions snapped a turn on his heel and went to sit in a straightbacked chair by the foot of the stairs he folded his hands over the diary now opened meaningfully to the appropriate page took his watch off his wrist and balanced it on his knee and placed his narrow feet flat on the fl oor glennaven nodded at them brusquely and wiped a rag across the top of his sweatsheened bald head he was wearing the trousers to a grey sweat suit along with a faded black tshirt on which tenth unicef jogathon was printed above the date may both trousers and shirt were mottled by rings and streaks of perspiration this is his graces exercise time the secretary announced unnecessarily he has another appointment in an hour and hell need an opportunity to shower prior to that if youll be so good as to keep it in mind there were no other seats in the room aside from those provided by the equipment st james wondered how many other unexpected or unwanted guests were encouraged to limit their visits to the bishop by having to conduct them standing up heart glennaven said jabbing his thumb to his chest before he adjusted a dial on the stair machine he puffed and grimaced as he spoke no exercise enthusiast but a man without options ive another quarter of an hour sorry cant let up or the benefits diminish so the cardiologist tells me sometimes i think he has profi t sharing going with the sadists who create these infernal machines he pumped lunged and continued to sweat according to the deaconwith a tilt of his head to indicate his secretaryscotland yard wants information in the usual fashion of people wanting something in this new age by yesterday if possible true enough st james said dont know that i can tell you anything useful dominic hereanother head tilt towards the stairscould probably tell you more he attended the inquest at your request i take it the bishop nodded he grunted with the effort of addressing the additional tension hed added to the machine the veins became swollen on his forehead and arms is that your usual procedure sending someone to an inquest he shook his head never had one of my priests poisoned before i had no procedure would you do it again if another priest died under questionable circumstances depends on the priest if he was like sage yes glennavens introduction of the topic made st james job easier he celebrated this fact by taking a seat on the bench of the weight machine deborah went to the exercise bike and made it her perch at their movement dominic looked disapprovingly at the bishop the bestlaid plans gone awry his expression said he tapped the face of his watch as if to make sure it was still in working order you mean a man likely to be deliberately poisoned st james said we want priests who are dedicated to their ministry the bishop said between grunts especially in parishes where the temporal rewards are minimal at best but zeal has its negatives people find it offensive zealots hold up mirrors and ask people to look at their own refl ections sage was a zealot in some eyes in yours yes but not offensively so ive a high tolerance for religious activism even when its not politically sound he was a decent sort he had a good mind he wanted to use it still zeal causes problems so i sent dominic to the inquest ive been given to understand that you were satisfied by what you heard st james said to the deacon nothing that was recorded by the adjudicating party indicated mr sages ministry to be wanting in any way the deacons monotone a demonstration of hearnoevil speaknoevil and steponnotoes no doubt served him well in the politicalreligious arena in which he worked it did little to add to their knowledge however as to mr sage himself st james asked the deacon ran his tongue over his protruding teeth and picked a piece of lint from the lapel of his black suit jacket yes was he himself wanting as far as the parish was concerned and from the information i was able to gather from my attendance at the inquest i mean in your eyes was he wanting you must have known him as well as heard about him at the inquest we none of us are capable of achieving perfection was the deacons prim response actually non sequiturs arent of much help in examining an untimely death st james said the deacons neck seemed to lengthen as he lifted his chin if youre hoping for more perhaps something detrimental then i must tell you i am not in the habit of sitting in judgement upon fellow clerics the bishop chuckled what balderdash dominic most days you sit in judgement like st peter himself tell the man what you know your grace dominic you gossip like a tenyearold schoolgirl always have done now stop equivocating before i climb off this damnable machine and box your bloody ears pardon me dear madam to deborah who smiled the deacon looked as if he smelled something unpleasant but had just been told to pretend it was roses all right he said it seemed to me that mr sage had a rather narrow field of vision his every reference point was specifi cally biblical i shouldnt think that a limitation in a priest st james noted it is perhaps the most serious limitation a priest can take with him into his ministry a strict interpretation of and consequent adherence to the bible can be perfectly blinding not to mention severely alienating to the very flock whose membership one might be trying to increase we are not puritans mr st james we do not harangue from the pulpit any longer nor do we encourage religious devotion based upon fear nothing weve heard about sage indicates that he was doing that either not yet in winslough perhaps but our last meeting with him here in bradford certainly stands as monumental evidence of the direction in which he was determined to head there was trouble brewing all round that man one sensed it was just a matter of time before it came to a boil trouble between sage and the parish or a member of the parish do you know something specifi c for someone whod spent years in the ministry he had no essential grasp of the concrete problems faced by his parishioners or anyone else example he took part in a conference on marriage and the family not a month before he died and while a professional a psychologist mind you here in bradford attempted to give our brothers some guidance on how to deal with parishioners having marital problems mr sage wanted to engage in a discussion of the woman taken in adultery the woman john chapter eight the bishop said and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery etcetera etcetera you know the story feel free to throw stones if youve not sinned yourself the deacon continued as if the bishop hadnt spoken there we were in the middle of discussing the best approach to take with a couple whose ability to communicate is clouded by the need to control each other and sage wanted to talk about what was moral versus what was right because the laws of the hebrews declared it to be so it was moral to stone this woman he said but was it necessarily right and oughtnt that be what we explore in our conferences together brothers the dilemma we face between that which is moral in the eyes of our society and that which is right in the eyes of god it was all perfect rubbish he didnt want to talk about anything concrete because he lacked the ability to do so if he could keep our heads up in the air and fill up our time with nebulous discussions his own weaknesses as a priest not to mention his defi ciencies as a man might never be revealed in conclusion the deacon waved his hand in front of his face as if whisking away a pesky fl y he gave a derisive tut the woman taken in adultery should we or shouldnt we stone sinners in the marketplace my god what drivel this is the twentieth century nearly the twentyfi rst dominic always has his fingers on the pulse of the obvious the bishop noted the deacon looked miffed you disagree with his assessment of mr sage no its accurate unfortunate but true his zealotry had a distinctly biblical fl avour and frankly thats offputting even for clerics the deacon bowed his head briefly in humble acceptance of the bishops laconic approbation glennaven continued to pump away on the stair machine adding ever more to the increasing stains of sweat on his clothes it clicked and whirred the bishop panted st james thought about the oddity of religion all forms of christianity sprang from the same source the life and words of the nazarene yet the ways of celebrating that life and those words seemed as infinite in variety as the individuals who were the celebrants while st james recognised the fact that tempers could flare and dislikes could brew over interpretations and styles of worship it seemed more likely that a priest whose mode of devotion irritated parishioners would be replaced rather than eliminated st john townleyyoung may have found mr sage too low church for his taste the deacon may have found him too fundamental the parish may have been irked by his passion but none of these seemed significant enough reasons to murder him the truth had to lie in another direction biblical zealotry did not appear to be the connection that lynley was hoping to unearth between killer and victim he came to you from cornwall as i understand it st james said he did the bishop used the rag to scour his face and to sponge the sweat from his neck nearly twenty years there round three months here part of it with me whilst he went on his interviews the rest in winslough is that the ordinary procedure to have a priest stay here with you during the interview process special case glennaven said why a favour to ludlow st james frowned the town michael ludlow dominic clarified bishop of truro he asked his grace to see to it that mr sage was the deacon made much of sifting through the chaff of his thoughts for a wheatlike euphemism he felt mr sage needed a change of environment he thought a new location might increase his chance of success i had no idea a bishop might be so involved in the work of an individual cleric is that typical in the work of this cleric yes a buzzer sounded from the stair machine glennaven said saints be praised and reached for a knob that he turned anticlockwise he slowed his pace for a cooldown period his breathing began to return to normal robin sage was michael ludlows archdeacon originally he said hed spent the first seven years of his ministry climbing to that position he was only thirtytwo when he received the appointment he was an unqualified success he made carpe diem his personal watchword that doesnt sound at all like the man from winslough deborah murmured glennaven acknowledged her point with a nod he made himself indispensable to michael he served on committees involved himself in political action churchapproved political action dominic added he lectured at theological colleges he raised thousands of pounds for the maintenance of the cathedral and for the local churches and he was fully capable of mingling without either effort or discomfort in any level of society a jewel a real catch in other words dominic said he didnt seem overly pleased with the thought its odd to think a man like that would suddenly be satisfied living the life of a village cleric st james said that was michaels thought exactly he hated to lose him but he let him go it was sages request he went to boscastle for his fi rst posting why the bishop wiped his hands on the rag and folded it perhaps hed been to the village on holiday but why the sudden change why the desire to go from a position of power and influence to one of relative obscurity thats hardly the norm even for a priest i dare say hed travelled on a personal road to damascus a short time before evidently hed lost his wife his wife killed in a boating accident according to michael he was never the same afterwards he saw her death as a punishment from god for his temporal interests and he decided to eschew them st james looked at deborah across the room he could tell she was thinking his very same thought theyd all of them made an uninformed assumption based upon limited information they had assumed the vicar hadnt been married because no one in winslough had mentioned a wife he could see from deborahs thoughtful expression that she was reflecting upon the day in november when shed had her only conversation with the man so i assume that his passion for success was replaced with a passion to make up for his past in some way st james said to the bishop but the problem was that the latter passion didnt translate as well as the former had he went through nine placements in what period of time the bishop looked at his secretary some ten to fifteen years wasnt it dominic nodded with no success anywhere a man with his talents as i said the passion didnt translate well he became the zealot we spoke of earlier vehement about everything from the decline in church attendance to what he called the secularisation of the clergy he lived the sermon on the mount and he wasnt accepting of a fellow clergyman or even a parishioner who failed to do the same if that wasnt enough to cause him problems he firmly believed that god shows his will through what happens to people in their lives frankly thats a difficult draught of medicine to swallow if youre the victim of a senseless tragedy which he himself was and which he believed to be his just deserts i was selfcentred hed say the deacon intoned i cared only for my own need for glory gods hand moved to change me you can change as well unfortunately true though his words may have been they didnt constitute a recipe for success the bishop said and when you heard that he was dead did you think there was a connection i couldnt avoid considering it the bishop replied thats why dominic went to the inquest the man had inner demons dominic said he chose to wrestle them in a public forum the only way he could make expiation for his own worldliness was to castigate everyone he met for theirs is that a motive for murder he snapped closed the bishops appointment diary it was clear that their interview was at an end i suppose it depends upon how one reacts when confronted with a man who seemed to feel that his was the only correct way to live ive never been good at this simon you know that theyd finally stopped for a rest in downham on the other side of the forest of pendle they parked by the post offi ce and walked down the sloping lane they circled round a stormstricken oak that had been reduced to trunk and truncated branches and headed back towards the narrow stone bridge theyd just crossed in the car pendle hills greygreen slopes hulked in the distance with fingers of frost curling down from the summit but they were not intent upon a hike towards this rather they had spied a small green on the near side of the bridge where a stream cut a scythes curve along the lane and flowed behind a neat line of cottages here a worn bench backed up to a drystone wall and perhaps two dozen mallards quacked happily on the grass explored the roadside and paddled in the water dont worry about it this isnt a contest remember what you can the rest will come when it comes why are you so obnoxiously undemanding he smiled ive always thought it was part of my charm the ducks came to greet them with the expectation of food on their minds they quacked and set about examining footwear investigating and rejecting deborahs boots moving on to st james shoelaces these caused a flurry of interest as did the metal crosspiece of his brace however when none of this produced the tiniest edible morsel the ducks fluffed and resettled their feathers reproachfully and from that moment displayed a disappointed aloofness to the human presence altogether deborah sat on the bench she nodded a hello to a parkaclad woman who trudged by them in red wellingtons with an energetic black terrier on a lead then she rested her chin on her fist st james joined her he touched his fingers to the ridge that she was creating between her eyebrows im thinking she said im trying to remember so i noticed he put up the collar of his coat im merely wondering if its a requirement of the process that it be conducted in temperatures falling below ten degrees what a baby you are its not even that cold tell that to your lips theyre turning blue pooh im not shivering im not surprised youve gone far beyond that youre in the final stages of hypothermia and you dont even know it lets go back to that pub theres smoke coming from the chimney too many distractions deborah its cold doesnt brandy sound comforting im thinking st james shoved his hands into his overcoat pockets and gloomily gave his refrigerated attention to the ducks they seemed oblivious of the cold but then theyd had a whole summer and autumn to fatten themselves up in preparation for it besides they were naturally insulated with down werent they lucky little devils st joseph deborah fi nally announced thats what i remember simon he was devoted to st joseph st james raised a doubtful eyebrow and hunched further into his coat its a start i suppose he tried to sound encouraging no really its important it must be deborah went on to explain her meeting with the vicar in room of the national gallery i was admiring the da vinci simon why is it that youve never taken me to see it before because you hate museums i tried when you were nine dont you recall you preferred to go rowing on the serpentine and became quite unruly when i took you to the british museum instead but those were mummies simon you wanted me to look at the mummies i had nightmares for weeks so did i well you shouldnt have let a little bit of temper defeat you so easily ill keep that in mind for the future back to sage she used the sleeves of her coat as a muff tucking her hands inside he pointed out that the da vinci cartoon didnt have st joseph in it he said that st joseph hardly ever was in a painting with the virgin and wasnt that sad or something like that well joseph was just the breadwinner after all the good old bloke the righthand man but he seemed soso sad about it he seemed to take it personally st james nodded its the mealticket syndrome men like to think theyre more important than that in the general scheme of their womens lives what else do you recall she sank her chin to her chest he didnt want to be there in london in the gallery hed been heading somewhere else was it hyde park when it started to rain he liked nature he liked the country he said it helped him think about what st joseph now theres a subject for ample consideration i told you i wasnt any good at this i dont have a memory for conversation ask me what he wore what he looked like the colour of his hair the shape of his mouth but dont ask me to tell you what he said even if i could remember every word id never be able to delve for hidden meanings im no good at verbal delving im no good at any delving i meet someone we talk i like him or i dont i think this is someone who might be a friend and thats the end of it i dont expect him to turn up dead when i come to call so i dont remember every detail of our first encounter do you would you only if im conversing with a beautiful woman and even then i find im distracted by details having nothing to do with what she has to say she eyed him what sort of details he cocked his head thoughtfully and examined her face the mouth the mouth i find womens mouths a study ive been readying myself for the last several years to posit a scientific theory on them he settled back against the bench and regarded the ducks he could feel her bristling he contained a smile well i wont even ask what the theory is you want me to i can tell by your expression so i wont just as well good she wriggled next to him duplicating his position on the bench she held out her feet and scrutinised the tops of her boots she clicked her heels together she did the same with her toes she said oh all right damn it tell me tell me is there a correlation between size and significance of utterance he asked solemnly youre joking not at all have you never noticed that women with small mouths invariably have little of importance to say what sexist rubbish take virginia woolf as an example now there was a woman with a generous mouth simon look at antonia fraser margaret drabble jane goodall margaret thatcher well there are always exceptions but the general rule and i argue that the facts will uphold it absolutely is that the correlation exists i intend to research it how personally in fact i thought id begin with you size shape dimension pliability sensuality he kissed her why is it ive a feeling youre the best of the lot she smiled i dont think your mother beat you enough when you were a child were even then i know for a fact that your father never laid a hand upon you he got to his feet and extended his hand to her she slipped hers into the crook of his arm how does a brandy sound she declared it sounded fine and they began to retrace their steps up the lane much like winslough just beyond the village the open land rose and fell in gentle hills parcelled out in farms where the farms ended the moors began sheep grazed here among them the occasional border collie moved the occasional farmer worked deborah paused on the threshold of the pub st james holding the door for her turned back to find her staring at the moors and tapping the knuckle of her index fi nger contemplatively against her chin what is it walking simon he said he liked to walk on the moors he liked to be outside when he had to make a decision thats why he wanted to go to the park st jamess park hed planned to feed the sparrows from the bridge and he knew about the bridge simon he must have been there before st james smiled and drew her into the doorway of the pub dyou think its important she asked i dont know dyou think perhaps he had a reason for talking about the hebrews wanting to stone that woman because we know he was married we know his wife met with an accidentsimon now youre delving he said chapter seventeen for spence didnt you hear the headmistress sent for her and see his car it was about her mum maggie hesitated on the school steps when she realised that more than one speculative glance was being directed her way shed always liked the time between the last lesson and the departure of the school bus it presented the best opportunity to gossip with the pupils who lived in other villages and in the town but shed never considered that the giggles and whispers that accompanied the afternoon chitchat might one day be about her everything had seemed outwardly normal at first pupils were gathered on the tarmac in front of the school in their usual fashion some were lingering by the school bus others were lounging against cars girls were combing their hair and comparing shades of contraband lipstick boys were sparring with each other or trying to look cool when maggie came through the doors threaded her way down the steps and searched the assembly for josie or nick her mind was engaged with the questions the london detective had asked her she didnt even stop to wonder about it when a ripple of whispers slid through the crowd shed been feeling rather dirty ever since the conversation in mrs crones study and she couldnt exactly understand why so her mind was taken up with turning over every possible reason as if each were a stone and she was mostly conscious of waiting to see if a slug of previously unconscious guilt would slither away from exposure to the light she was used to feeling guilty she kept on sinning she tried to convince herself she wasnt sinning she even excused the worst of her behaviour by telling herself it was mummys fault nick loves me mummy even if you dont see how he loves me see see in reply her mother had never used lookateverythingivedoneforyoumargaret in the sort of play upon conscience that pam rices mother tried with no effect she never talked in terms of deep disappointment as josie reported her mother had done on more than one occasion nonetheless prior to this very day her mother had been the consistent major source of maggies guilt she was disappointing mummy she was causing mummys anger she was adding torture to mummys pain maggie knew all this without having to hear it she had always been extremely adept at reading reactions on her mothers face which was why maggie had come to realise last night precisely how much power she had in this war with her mother she had power to punish to hurt to warn to avengethe list stretched on to forever she wanted to feel triumphant in the knowledge that shed wrested the ships wheel of her life away from her mothers controlling hands but the truth was she felt troubled about it so when she arrived home late the previous night outwardly proud of the purple love bruises which nick had sucked to the surface of her neck the flames of pleasure maggie had expected to warm her at mummys frantic worry were instantly extinguished at the sight of her face she made no reproach she just came to the door of the darkened sitting room and she gazed upon her as if from a place where she couldnt be reached she looked a hundred years old maggie had said mummy mummy had placed her fingers on maggies chin had turned it gently to expose the bruises had then released her and climbed the stairs maggie heard her door click shut softly behind her it was a sound that hurt more than the slap she deserved she was bad she knew it even when she felt warmest and closest to nick even when he loved her with his hands and his mouth when he was pressing it to her holding her opening her saying maggie mag mag she was black and she was bad she was fi lled with blame she was becoming every day more used to the shame of her behaviour except that she had never expected to be made to feel it over her friendship with mr sage what she felt was like the prickles from nettle leaves but they scratched at her spirit instead of her skin she kept hearing the detective ask about secrets and that made her feel dry and itchy inside mr sage had said youre a good girl maggie dont ever forget that believe it completely he said we get confused we lose our way but we can always fi nd our way back to god through our prayers god listens he said god forgives everything whatever we do maggie god will forgive he was comfort itself was mr sage he was understanding he was goodness and love maggie had never betrayed the confi dence of their times together she had held them precious and now she was faced with the london detectives suspicions that what was most special about her friendship with the vicar was also what had led to his death this was the slug that writhed beneath the last stone of implication she turned over in her mind the fault was hers and if that was the case then mummy had known all along what she was doing when she fed the vicar dinner that night no maggie argued the point with herself mummy couldnt have known she was feeding him hemlock she took care of people she didnt hurt them she made unguents and poultices she mixed special teas she brewed decoctions infusions and tinctures everything she did was to help not to harm then the whispers of her schoolmates rising round her made delicate fissures in the shell of her thoughts she poisoned the bloke didnt get away with it after all the police came from london devilworshippers i heard and maggie was startled into sudden comprehension dozens of eyes were on her faces were bright with speculation she clutched her rucksack of schoolbooks to her chest and looked about for a friend her head felt weightless oddly and suddenly divorced from her body all at once it was the most important thing in the world to pretend she didnt realise what they were talking about seen nick she asked her lips felt chapped seen josie a foxfaced girl with a large pimple on the side of her nose became the group spokesman they dont want to hang about with you maggie theyre not so dim they cant see the risk a murmur of approval lapped round the girl like a small wave then receded in kind the faces seemed to move closer to maggie she held her rucksack tighter a books sharp corner dug into her hand she knew they were teasing didnt ones mates always like to tease whenever they could and she drew herself taller to meet the challenge right she said with a smile as if she herself approved of whatever joke they were trying to make quite come on wheres josie wheres nick theyve gone off already foxface said but the bus it was sitting where it always sat waiting for departure just a few yards away inside the gate there were faces at the windows but from the steps of the school maggie couldnt tell if her friends were among them they made their own arrangements during lunch when they knew knew what who you were with i wasnt with anyone oh right whatever you say you lie about as good as your mum maggie tried to swallow but her tongue got stuck on the roof of her mouth she took a step towards the bus the group let her go but closed ranks right behind her she could hear them talking as if to each other but all of it intended for her they went off in a car did you know nick and josie and that girl whos been after him you know who i mean teasing they were teasing maggie walked faster but the schoolbus seemed farther and farther away there was a shimmer of light dancing in front of it it started as a beam and turned into bright speckles hell stay clear of her now if hes got any brains who wouldnt its true if her mum doesnt take a fancy to her mates she just invites them for dinner like that fairy story have an apple dearie itll help you sleep laughter only you wont wake up real soon laughter laughter the bus was too far here eat this i cooked it up special just for you now dont be shy about second helpings i can see youre just dying for more maggie felt a hot ember at the back of her throat the bus glimmered got small became the size of her shoe the air closed round it and swallowed it up only the wrought iron gates of the school were left its my own recipe parsnip pie i call it people say its dead good beyond the gates lay the street they call me crippen but dont let that put you off your dinner and escape maggie began to run she was pounding towards the centre of town when she heard him calling her she kept going dashing up to the high street and then across it tearing towards the car park at the base of the hill what she was planning to do there she couldnt have said it was only important to get away her heart was slamming into her chest she had a folding and pulling pain in her side she skidded on a patch of slick pavement and wobbled but she caught herself against a lamppost and ran on watch yourself luv warned a farmer who was getting out of his escort next to the kerb maggie shouted someone else she heard herself sob she saw the street blur she kept rushing forwards she passed the bank the post offi ce some shops a tea room she dodged a young woman pushing a pram she heard the thud of footsteps behind her and then another shout of her name she gulped away tears and plunged on fear pumped energy and speed through her body they were following her she thought they were laughing and pointing they were only waiting for the opportunity to encircle her and begin the whispers all over again what her mum diddo you know do you knowmaggie and the vicara vicarthat blokecor he was old enough to be no drop the thought trample it bury it shove it away maggie hurtled down the pavement she didnt stop until a blue sign hanging from a squat brick building brought her up short she wouldnt have seen it at all had she not lifted her head to make her eyes stop watering and even then the word swam but she could still make it out police she stumbled to a halt against a rubbish bin the sign seemed to grow larger the word glittered and throbbed she shrank away from it half crouched on the pavement trying to breathe and trying not to cry her hands were numb her fingers were tangled in the straps of her rucksack her ears felt so cold that steel spikes of pain were shooting down her neck it was the end of the day the temperature was dropping and never in her life had she felt so alone she didnt she didnt she didnt maggie thought but somewhere shouted a chorus she did maggie she cried out she tried to make herself small like a mouse she hid her face in her arms and slid down the side of the rubbish bin until she was sitting on the pavement balling herself up as if reducing her size somehow served as a form of protection maggie whats going on whyd you run off didnt you hear me calling a body joined her on the pavement an arm went round her she smelled the old leather of his jacket before she processed the fact that the voice was nicks she thought in nonsensical but nonetheless rapid succession how he always kept the jacket crumpled up in his rucksack during school hours when he had to be in uniform how he always took it out during lunch to give it a breather how he always wore it the minute he was able before and after school it was odd to think she would know the smell of him before shed recognise the sound of his voice she gripped his knee you went off you and josie went off where they said youd gone you were withyou and josie they said we were on the bus like always we saw you run off you looked dead cut up about something so i came after you she lifted her head shed lost her barrette somewhere in the flight from the school so her hair hung round her face and partially screened him from her he smiled you look done in mag he thrust his hand inside his jacket and brought out his cigarettes you look like a ghost was chasing you i wont go back she said he bent his head to shelter cigarette and flame and he flipped the used match into the street no point to that he inhaled with the deep satisfaction of someone for whom a change in circumstances has allowed a smoke sooner rather than later bus is gone anyway i mean back to school tomorrow to lessons i wont go ever he eyed her brushing his hair back from his cheeks this about that bloke from london mag the one with the big motor that got all the chappies in a fuss today youll say forget it youll say ignore them but they wont let up im never going back why whats it to you what those twits think she twisted the strap of her rucksack round her fingers until she saw that her nails were turning blue who cares what they say he asked you know whats what thats all that matters she squeezed her eyes shut against the truth and pressed her lips together to keep from saying it she felt more tears leak out from beneath her eyelids and she hated herself for the sob which she tried to disguise with a cough mag he said you know the truth right so what those loobies say in the schoolyard dont amount to nothing but twaddle right what they says not important what you know is i dont know the admission burst from her like a sickness she could no longer contain the truth what shei dont know i dont know even more tears spilled out she hid her face on her knees nick whistled low between his teeth you never said before now we always move every two years only this time i wanted to stay i said id be good id make her proud id do good in school if we could just stay this once just stay and she said yes and then i met the vicar after you and iafter what we did and how hateful mummy was and how bad i felt and he made me feel better andshe was in a rage about that she sobbed nick flung his cigarette into the street and held her with the other arm as well he found me thats what it is nick he finally found me she didnt want that its why we always ran but this time we didnt and he had enough time he came he came like i always knew he would nick was silent for a moment she could hear him draw a breath maggie youre thinking the vicar was your dad she didnt want me to see him and i saw him anyway she raised her head and grabbed onto his jacket and now she doesnt want me to see you so i wont go back there i wont you cant make me no one can if you try is there a problem here kids they both drew back from the sound of a voice they turned to see the speaker a railthin policewoman stood above them heavily cloaked for the weather and wearing her hat at a rakish angle she carried a notebook in one hand and a plastic cup of something steaming in the other she sipped from this as she waited for response a blowup at school nick said its nothing much needing some help nah its girl stuff shell be okay the policewoman studied maggie with what looked more like curiosity than empathy she shifted her attention to nick she made a show out of watching them over the rim of her cup its lazy catstail of steam fogging up her spectacles as she took another sip of whatever was in it then she nodded and said youd best be off home then and held her ground yeah right nick said he urged maggie to her feet cmon then were off live round here the policewoman asked just a ways from the high ive not seen you before no ive seen you lots you have a dog right a corgi yes see i knew seen you out for your walk nick tapped his index finger out from his temple in a form of salute afternoon he said arm round maggie he shepherded her back in the direction of the high street neither of them looked to see if the policewoman was watching at the first corner they ducked right a short distance down the street and another right led through a walkway that lay between the back of the public buildings and the overgrown rear gardens of a line of council cottages then they were heading down the slope once more they emerged in less than five minutes into clitheroes car park it was largely empty of vehicles at this time of day howd you know about her dog maggie asked i just went with the odds a lucky break for us youre clever and good i love you nick you take care of me they stopped in the shelter of the public lavatory nick blew on his hands and tucked them underneath his arms going to be cold tonight he said he looked in the direction of the town where smoke feathered up from chimneys becoming lost against the sky you hungry mag maggie read the desire beneath the words you cn go on home i wont not less you im not going then neither am i they were at an impasse the evening wind was starting to blow and it had an easy time of finding them it gusted across the car park unimpeded and scattered bits of trash about their feet a moments bag glittered greenly against maggies leg she used her foot to brush it away leaving a streak of brown against the navy of her tights nick brought out a handful of coins from his pocket he counted two pounds sixtyseven he said what about you she dropped her eyes said nothing then raised them in a hurry she tried to make her voice sound proud so you dont have to stay go on i can manage i already said if she finds me with you itll go that much worse on us both go home wont happen im staying i said no i dont want to be at fault im already because of mr sage she wiped her face on her coat sleeve she was tired to the bone and longing for sleep she wondered about trying the lavatory door she did so it was locked she sighed go on she said again you know what cn happen if you dont nick joined her in the doorway of the ladies it was recessed about six inches so they gained some ground against the cold you believe that mag she hung her head she felt the misery of the knowledge lie across her shoulders heavy and cumbersome like sacks of sand you think she killed him because he came for you because he was your dad she never talked about my dad she wouldnt ever say nicks hand touched her head his fi ngers made an attempt at caressing but they were thwarted by the snarls in her hair i dont think he was mag your dad that is sure because no listen he took a step closer he put his arms round her he spoke into her hair his eyes were brown mag sos your mums so so he cant be your dad can he because of the odds she stirred to speak but he continued look its like sheep my dad explained it theyre all white right well sort of white but every once in a while out pops a black one didnt you ever wonder how its a recessive gene see its something inherited the lambs mum and dad both had a black gene somewhere inside them and when they mated out came a black lamb instead of a white one even though they were white themselves but the odds are against it happening which is why most sheep are white i dont youre like the black sheep because your eyes are blue mag what dyou think the odds are of two browneyed people having a kid with blue eyes what must be a million to one maybe more maybe a billion to one you think i know the vicar wasnt your dad and if he wasnt your dad then your mum didnt kill him and if she didnt kill him she wont be trying to kill anyone else there was a thats that quality to his voice that urged her to accept his words maggie wanted to believe him it would make everything so much easier to live with if she knew that his theory comprised the truth she would be able to go home she would be able to face mummy she wouldnt think about the shape of her nose and her hands were they like the vicars were they nor would she wonder about why he had held her out at arms length and studied her so it would be a relief to know something for certain even if it didnt answer her prayers so she wanted to believe and she would have believed if nicks stomach hadnt rumbled noisily if he hadnt shivered if she hadnt seen in her minds eye his fathers enormous flock of sheep drifting like slightly soiled clouds against a green lancashire hillside sky she pushed him away what he said theres moren one black sheep born in a fl ock nick ware so so those arent any billion to one odds it isnt like sheep not exactly were people you want to go home go on go home youre lying to me and i dont want to see you mag im not im trying to explain you dont love me i do you just want your tea i was only saying and your scones and your jam well go ahead get them i can take care of myself with no money i dont need money ill get a job tonight ill do something see if i wont but im not going home and im not going back to school and you cant talk about sheep like i was so dim i couldnt figure it out because if two white sheep could have a black one then two browneyed people could have me and you know it isnt that right well isnt that right he drove his fingers through his hair i didnt say it wasnt possible i just said the odds i dont care about the odds this isnt like some horse race this is me were talking about my mum and dad and she killed him you know it youre just lording it over me and trying to make me go back im not you are i said i wouldnt leave you and i wont okay he looked about he squinted against the cold he stamped his feet to warm them look we need something to eat you wait here wherere you going we dont have even three pounds what kind of we can get some crisps some biscuits and stuff youre not hungry now but you will be later and we wont be near any shop by then we she made him look at her you dont have to go she said a last time do you want me to go and other stuff yes do you love me trust me she tried to read his face he was anxious to be off but perhaps he was only hungry after all and once they started walking he would be warm enough they could even run mag he said yes he smiled brushed his mouth against hers his lips were dry it didnt feel like a kiss then wait here he said ill be right back if were gonna bunk off its best that no one see us together in town and remember for when your mum phones the police mummy wont she wont dare i wouldnt take odds on that he turned up the collar of his jacket he looked at her earnestly you okay here then she felt her heart warm okay dont mind sleeping rough tonight not so long as im sleeping with you chapter eighteen colin ate his tea at the kitchen sink sardines on toast with the oil slipping through his fi ngers and splatting onto the potscarred porcelain he didnt feel hungry in the least but hed been lightheaded and weak in the limbs for the past thirty minutes food seemed the obvious solution hed made his walk back to the village along the clitheroe road which was closer to the lodge than was the cotes fell footpath his pace was brisk he told himself that a need to avenge was what drove him so rapidly onwards he kept repeating her name in his head as he walked annie annie annie my girl it was a way to avoid hearing the words love and death three times pulse with the blood in his skull by the time he reached his house he was hot in the chest but ice to the bone in his hands and feet he could hear his hearts erratic thumping inside his eardrums and his lungs couldnt seem to get enough air he ignored the symptoms for a good three hours but when there was no improvement he decided to eat teatime he thought in irrational response to his bodys behaviour thatll take care of it must have a bite to eat he washed down the fish with three bottles of watneys drinking the first one while the bread was toasting he pitched the bottle into the rubbish and opened another as he rooted in the cupboard for the sardines the tin gave him trouble curling the metal lid round the key required a steadiness that he wasnt able to muster he got it halfway unrolled when his fingers slipped and the sharp edge of the top sliced into his hand blood spurted out it mixed with the fish oil started to sink then formed perfect small beads that fl oated like scarlet lures for the fish he felt no pain he wrapped his hand in a tea towel used the end of it to sop the blood off the surface of the oil and tilted the beer bottle up to his mouth with the hand that was free when the toast was ready he dug the fi sh from the tin with his fingers he lined them up on the bread he added salt and pepper and a thick slice of onion he began to eat there was no particular taste or smell to it which he found rather odd because he could distinctly remember how his wife once complained about the scent of sardines makes my eyes water she would say that fish smell in the air col it makes my stomach go peculiar her cat clock ticked on the wall above the aga wagging its tail and moving its eyes it seemed to be repeating her name with the sound of its clicking wheels and gears no longer ticktock but annie annie annie it said colin concentrated intently on this just like the rhythm of his earlier footsteps the repetition of her name drove other thoughts away he used the third beer to clear his mouth of the fish that he couldnt taste then he poured a small whisky and drank that down in two swallows to try to bring back feeling to his limbs but still he couldnt quite vanquish the cold this caused him confusion because the furnace was on he still wore his heavy jacket and by all rights he should have been soaking in sweat which he was in a manner of speaking his face was so fiery that his skin was throbbing but the rest of him trembled like a birch in the wind he drank another whisky he moved from the sink to the kitchen window he looked across to the vicars house and then he heard it again as distinctly as if rita were standing directly behind him love and death three times the words were so clear that he swung round with a cry which he strangled the instant he saw that he was alone he cursed aloud the sodding words meant nothing they were merely a stimulus of the sort used by every palmreader in the world giving you a small piece of a nonexistent life jigsaw and whetting your incipient desire to have more love and death three times needed no elucidation from anyone as far as colin was concerned it translated to pounds and pence each week hardearned coins pressed into the palm of the palmist by driedup spinsters naive housewives and lonely widows all seeking meaningless reassurance that their lives werent as futile as they appeared to be he turned back to the window across his drive across the vicars the other house watched him in return polly was within as she had continued to be in the weeks since robin sages death she was no doubt doing what she always did scrubbing polishing dusting and waxing in a fervent display of her utility but that wasnt all as he fi nally understood for polly was also biding her time patiently waiting for the moment when juliet spences blind need to take blame resulted in her incarceration while juliet in gaol wasnt quite the same as juliet dead it was better than nothing and polly was too clever in her ways to make another attempt on juliets life colin wasnt a religious man hed given up on god during the second year of annies dying still he had to acknowledge that the hand of a greater power than his own had been active in the cotes hall cottage on that night in december when the vicar had died by all rights it should have been juliet eating alone in the vicars place and if it had been the coroner would have affixed the label accidental poisoningselfadministered to her dying with no one wise to the manner in which that convenient accident had been brought about she would have rushed in to minister to his grief would have polly more than anyone he knew she excelled at sympathy and fellowfeeling roughly he rubbed his hands clean of sardine oil and used two plasters to cover the cut he paused to pour himself one more swallow of whisky which he gulped down before heading out the door bitch he thought love and death three times she didnt come to the door when he knocked so he pressed his finger to the bell and held it he took some satisfaction from the shrill jangle it made the sound grated on the nerves the inner door opened he could see her form behind the opaque glass topheavy and inflated by too many garments she looked like a miniature of her mother he heard her say glory get off the bell will you and she yanked the door open ready to speak she didnt when she saw him instead she looked beyond him to his house and he wondered if shed been watching as usual if shed stepped away from the window for a moment and thus missed his approach shed missed little else in the past few years he didnt wait for her to ask him in he squeezed past her she shut both the outer and the inner doors behind him he followed the narrow corridor to the right and walked straight along to the sitting room shed been working in here the furniture gleamed a tin of beeswax a bottle of lemon oil and a box of rags sat in front of an empty bookshelf there wasnt a trace of dust anywhere the carpet was vacuumed the lace window curtains hung crisp and clean he turned to face her unzipping his jacket she stood awkwardly in the doorway the sole of one sockclad foot pressed to the others ankle the toes moving in an unconscious scratch and she followed his movements with her eyes he threw his jacket on the sofa it fell just short and slid to the fl oor she moved towards it eager to put everything in its rightful place just doing her job was polly leave it be she stopped her fingers gripped the ribbing on the bottom edge of her bulky brown pullover it hung loose and misshapen to her hips her lips parted when he began to unbutton his shirt he saw her catch her tongue between her teeth he knew well enough what she was thinking and wanting and he took a distinctly gutwarming pleasure from the knowledge that he was about to disappoint her he drew out the book from against his stomach and flipped it to the floor between them she didnt look at it immediately instead her fingers moved from her pullover to grasp the folds of the insubstantial gypsy skirt hanging unevenly beneath it its colours bright red gold and green caught the light of a floor lamp standing next to the sofa yours he said alchemical magic herbs spices and plants he saw her lips form the first two words she said glory whered you get that ol thing sounding all the world full of curious confusion and nothing more where you left it where i her gaze moved from the book to him col whatre you about col he felt his hand tremble with the need to strike her show of guilelessness seemed less of an outrage than did the familiarity implied by her saying that name is it yours was i mean i spose it still is except i havent seen it for ages id expect that he said it was well enough out of sight whats that supposed to mean behind the cistern the light flickered in the lamp a bulb going bad it made a tiny hissing sound and went out inviting the days exterior gloom to seep past the lace curtains polly didnt react didnt seem to notice she appeared to be mulling over his words he said you would have been wiser to throw it away like the tools tools or did you use hers whose tools whatre you about here colin her voice was wary she inched away from him so subtly that he might not have noticed had he not been anticipating every sign of her guilt her fingers even stopped themselves in the midst of flexing he found that of interest she knew better than to allow them to fi st or perhaps you didnt use any tools at all perhaps you loosened the plant gently you know how i mean you know how to do it and then lifted it from the soil root and all is that what you did because youd know the plant wouldnt you youd recognise it just as well as shed do this is about missus spence she spoke slowly as if to herself and she didnt appear to be seeing him although she was looking in his direction how often do you use the footpath which one dont play games with me you know why im here you didnt expect it and juliets taking the blame made it unlikely that anyone would ever come looking for you but ive smoked you out and i want the truth how often do you use the footpath youre mad she managed to put another inch between them her back was to the door and she was clever enough to know that a glance over her shoulder would announce her intentions and give him the advantage which she currently seemed to believe was hers once a month at least i should guess he said is that right doesnt the ritual have more power if its performed when the moon is full and isnt the power more potent if the ritual takes place in the direct light of that moon and isnt it true that communication with the goddess is more profound if you perform the ritual on a holy site like the top of cotes fell you know i worship on the top of cotes fell i make no secret of that but youve other secrets havent you here in this book i havent her voice was weak she seemed to realise what weakness implied because she roused herself to say and youre frightening me you are colin shepherd with an edge of defi ance i was up there today where cotes fell the summit i hadnt been in years not since before annie id forgotten how well you can see from there polly and what you can see i go there to worship thats all and you know it she put another inch between them saying more quickly i burned the laurel for annie i let the candle melt down i used cloves i prayed and she died that very night how convenient no during the harvest moon while you prayed on cotes fell and before you prayed you brought her soup to drink do you remember that you called it your special soup you said to make sure she ate every bit it was only vegetables for both of you whatre you thinking i had some myself it wasnt did you know that plants are most potent when the moon is full the book says that you must harvest them then no matter what part you want even the root i dont use plants that way no one does in the craft its not about evil you know that prhaps we find herbs for incense yes but thats all incense for part of the ritual its all in the book what to use for revenge what will alter the mind what to use for poison ive read it no and the book was behind the cistern where youve kept it hiddenhow long has it been it wasnt hidden if it was there it just fell there was lots of things on the cistern wasnt there a whole stack of books and magazines i didnt hide this she touched it with her toe and withdrew gaining yet another inch of distance from him i didnt hide a thing what about capricorn polly that stopped her cold she repeated the word without making a sound he could see the panic beginning to take hold of her as he forced her closer and closer to the truth she was like a rogue dog when at last its cornered he could feel her spine stiffening and her legs wanting to splay hemlocks strength is in capricorn he said her tongue whisked across her lower lip fear was a scent on her sour and strong the twentysecond of december he said what about it you know i dont colin i dont the first day of capricorn the night the vicar died this is and one thing more the moon was full that night and the night before so it all fi ts together you had the instructions your howto for murder printed in the book dig the root out when the plant is dormant know its strength is in capricorn know its deadly poison know its most potent when the moon is full shall i read it all for you or would you prefer to read it yourself look under h in the index for hemlock no she put you up to this didnt she missus spence i cn see it on your face as big as cn be she said go see that polly go ask her what she knows go ask her where shes been and she left it to you to think up the rest thats how it is isnt it isnt it colin dont even say her name oh ill say it all right ill say it and more she stooped and snatched the book from the floor yes its mine yes i bought it i used it as well and she knows that damn her because i was fool enough once moren two years back when she first came to winslough to ask her about making a tincture from bryony and more the fool i was i even told her why she shook the book at him love colin shepherd bryonys for love sos apple in a charm here want to see she fl ipped a silver chain from beneath her pullover a small globe hung from it its surface fi ligree she yanked it from her neck and threw it to the floor where it bounced against his foot he could see the dried bits of the fruit inside and aloe for sachets and benzoins for perfume and cinquefoil for a potion that you wouldnt ever drink its all in the book with everything else but you only see what you want to see dont you thats the way it is now thats the way its always been even with annie i wont talk about annie with you oh wont you annieannieannie with a halo on her head ill talk about her just as much as i want because i know what it was like i was there just like you and she wasnt a saint she wasnt a noble patient suffering in silence with you sitting at the bedside putting flannels on her brow that wasnt how it was he took a step towards her she held her ground annie said go ahead col you take care of yourself my precious love and she never let you forget it when you did she never said she didnt need to say why wont you see it she lay in her bed with all the lights off she said i was too ill to reach for the lamp she said i thought i would die today col but its all right now because youre home and youre not to worry a jot about me she said i understand why you need a woman my love you do what you must do and dont think about me in this house in this room in this bed without you thats not how it was and when the pain was bad she didnt lie there like a martyr dont you remember she screamed she cursed you she cursed the doctors she threw things at the wall and when it was worst she said you did this to me you made me rot and im dying and i hate you i hate you i wish you were dying instead he made no response it felt as if a siren were sounding in his head polly was there mere inches away but she seemed to be speaking from behind a red veil so i prayed on the top of cotes fell i did at first for her health and then forand then for you alone after she died hoping that you would seewould knowyes i got this bookshe shook it againbut it was because i loved you and i wanted you to love me back and i was willing to try anything to make you whole because you werent whole with annie you hadnt been for years she bled you in her dying but you dont want to face it because then you might have to face what living with annie was like as well and it wasnt perfect because nothing is you dont know the first thing about annies dying that you emptied her bedpans and hated the thought of it dont i know that that you wiped her bum with your stomach at the boil dont i know that that just when you needed most to get out of the house for a breath of air she knew and would cry and take a bad turn and you always felt guilty because you werent ill were you you didnt have the cancer you werent going to die she was my life i loved her at the end dont make me laugh in your face at the end was bitterness and a rage of anger because no one lives without joy for that long and feels anything else at the end of it you bloody bitch yes all right that and more if you like but i face the truth colin i dont tart it up with hearts and fl owers like you then lets take the truth another step all right he reduced the distance between them another few inches when he kicked the amulet to one side it clattered against the wall and broke open spilling its contents onto the carpet the bits of apple looked like shrivelled skin human skin even and he wouldnt put its collection past her hed put nothing past polly yarkin you prayed for her to die not to live when it didnt come quick you helped it along and when her dying didnt get you what you wanted the moment you wanted it and when was that polly was i supposed to fuck you the day of the funeral you decided to try potions and charms instead then juliet came she threw your plans awry you tried to use her and it was bloody clever to let her know i wasnt truly available just in case she was interested and got in your way but we found each other anyway juliet and i and you couldnt bear that annie was gone the final barrier to your happiness was buried in the churchyard and here was another you saw what was happening between us didnt you the only solution was to bury her as well no you knew where to fi nd the hemlock you walk by the pond each time you hike cotes fell you dug it up you put it in the root cellar and you waited for juliet to eat it and die and if maggie died as well that would have been a shame but shes expendable isnt she everyone is you just didnt count on the vicars presence that was the misfortune i imagine you had a few uneasy days once he was poisoned while you waited for juliet to take the blame so what did i gain if thats how it happened coroner said it was an accident colin shes free so are you and youve been stuffing her like some randy farmboy eyeing his daddys ewes ever since so what did i gain what youve waited and hoped for ever since the vicar died by mistake the london police the case reopened with every bit of circumstantial evidence pointing to juliet he snatched the book from her fi ngers except this polly you forgot about this she made a lunge for it he threw the book to the corner of the room and caught her arm and when juliets safely put away for good youll have what you want what you tried to get while annie was alive what you prayed for when you prayed for her death what you mixed your potions and wore your amulets for what youve been after for years he took a step closer he felt her trying to pull away he experienced a distinct tingling of pleasure at the thought of her fear it shot down his legs it began to work unexpected magic in his groin youre hurting m arm this isnt about love this was never about love colin love has no part in what youve been after since that day no you remember it then dont you dont you polly let me go she twisted beneath him she was breathing in tiny baby gasps no more than a child so easy to subdue squirming and writhing tears in her eyes she knew what was coming he liked her knowing on the floor of the barn where the animals do it you remember that she wrenched her arm away and spun around to run he caught her skirt as it fl ared with her movement he jerked her towards him the material ripped he twirled it round his hand and pulled harder she stumbled but didnt fall with my cock inside and you grunting like a sow you remember that please no she was starting to cry and he found that the sight of her tears infl amed him more than had the thought of her fear she was penitent sinner he was avenging god and her punishment would be a godly justice he grabbed more of the skirt pulled on it savagely and heard the satisfactory sound of it giving way another pull then another and every time polly struggled to escape him the skirt ripped more just like that day in the barn he said just what you want no i dont not like this col please the name the name his hands shot out and tore the rest of the skirt from her body but she seized the moment of release and ran she made it to the corridor she was close to the door another three feet and she would escape he leapt and tackled her as her hand grasped the knob of the inner door they crashed to the fl oor she began to flail at him wildly she didnt speak her arms and legs thrashed her body convulsed he struggled to pin down her arms grunting fuckyousohard she screamed no colin but he cut her off with his mouth he drove his tongue inside her with one hand on her neck pressing and pressing while the other ripped at her underwear he used his knee to force her legs apart her hands tore at his face she found his spectacles flung them off she sought his eyes but he was close on her powering his face into hers filling her mouth with his tongue and then spitting spitting and every moment fi red more and more with the need to show to master to punish she would crawl and beg she would pray for mercy she would call upon her goddess but he was her god cunt he grunted into her mouth bitchcow he fumbled with his trousers while she rolled and struggled kicking against him her every breath a shriek she drove her knee upwards missing his testicles by less than an inch he slapped her he liked the feel of the slap how it brought life and power back to his hand he hit her again harder this time he used his knuckles and admired the red bruising they brought to her skin she was weeping and ugly her mouth hung open her eyes squeezed shut mucous dripped from her nose he liked her that way he wanted her weeping her terror was a drug he shoved her legs apart and he fell upon her he celebrated her punishment like the god he was she thought this is what its like to die she lay as he had left her one leg crooked and the other extended her pullover shoved up beneath her armpits her bra jerked down to bare one breast where his bite still throbbed like a brand a sheer piece of nylon edged with lacegot yerself some fancies i see rita had chuckled looking for a bloke who likes it wrapped up prettylooped round her left ankle a shredded ribbon of skirt draped across her neck she stared upwards and followed the threading of a crack that began above the door and spread out like veins against the skin of the ceiling somewhere in the house a metallic crankrattle sounded followed by a whirring that was steady and low the boiler she thought she wondered why it was heating water since she couldnt recall having used any that day she pondered everything she had done in the vicarage taking each project one step at a time because it seemed so important to know why the boiler was heating water right now it couldnt realise after all how filthy she was it was just a machine machines didnt anticipate a bodys needs she made a list newspapers first shed bound them up like shed promised herself and discarded them all in the rubbish bin shed phoned and cancelled the subscription as well potted plants next there were only four of them but they were looking poorly and one had lost nearly all of its leaves shed been giving them water religiously every day so she couldnt understand why they were turning all yellow shed taken them to the rear garden and set them on the porch thinking the poor little things might like some sun if it ever came out which it hadnt bedding after that shed changed the sheets on all three beds two singles one double just like shed been doing every week since shed first come to work didnt make any difference that no one used the beds one had to change the linen to keep it fresh but she hadnt done any laundry so the boiler shouldnt be at work over that what was it then she tried to picture each of her movements that day she tried to make them appear among the cracks in the ceiling newspapers telephone plants on the porch and after thatit was too much effort to think beyond the plants why was it water was she frightened of water had something happened with water no how silly think of rooms with water she remembered she smiled but it hurt because her skin felt stiff like glue had dried upon it so she hurried in her mind from the bedrooms to the kitchen because that was it shed washed all the dishes the glassware the pots and the pans shed scrubbed the cupboards as well which is why the boiler was working now and anyway didnt a boiler always work didnt it fire itself up when it felt the water inside start to cool no one switched it on it just worked like magic magic the book no she must have no thoughts like that they painted nightmare pictures in the back of her head she didnt want to see the kitchen the kitchen she thought washing dishes and cupboards and then on to the sitting room which was already clean and tidy as could be but she polished the furniture because she couldnt seem to make herself leave this place let go find another way to live and then he was with her and his face wasnt right his back seemed too stiff his arms didnt hang they just waited polly rolled to her side drew her legs up and tried to cradle herself hurts she thought her legs felt torn away from her body a hammer pounded down low where hed slammed and slammed her and inside acid burned at her flesh she felt throbbing and scraped she was nothing slowly she became aware of the cold a thin current of air that fl owed insistently against her bare skin she shivered she realised hed left the inner door open upon his leaving and the outer door was not completely latched her fingers plucked aimlessly at the pullover and she tried to work it down as a cover but she got it no farther than beneath her breasts before giving up it didnt feel right the wool abraded her skin from where she lay she could see the stairway and she began to inch towards it with no thought in mind but to get out of the draught to find somewhere safe that was dark but once she rested her head on the bottom stair she looked up and the light seemed brighter at the top she thought bright means warm better than dark it was getting late but the sun must have come out one final time it would be a winter sun milky and distant but if it fell on the carpet in one of the bedrooms she could curl within its golden boundaries and let her dying continue there she began to climb she found she couldnt manage her legs so she pulled herself up hand over hand on the banister her knees bumped on the stairs when she lolled to one side her hip thudded against the wall which is how she saw the blood she interrupted her progress to look at it curiously to touch a fi nger to its crimson smear marvelling at how quickly it was able to dry and how it turned to mahogany when mixed with air she saw that it was oozing from between her legs and that it had been oozing quite long enough to create palmate patterns on her inner thighs and crooked rivulets down one leg dirty she thought she would have to bathe the idea of washing inflated in her mind driving the nightmare pictures away holding on to the thought of water and its warmth she made it to the top of the stairs and crawled to the bath she shut the door and sat on the cold white tile with her head against the wall her knees drawn up and the blood seeping out against the fist she pressed between her legs after a moment she rolled her shoulders against the wall flipped herself two feet and thus gained the tub she lowered her head to its side and reached one hand to the tap her fingers grappled with it failed to make it turn and slipped off altogether she knew somehow shed be whole again if she could only wash if she could wash off the scent of him and scrub away the touch of his hands if the soap could cleanse the inside of her mouth and as long as she could think about washing what it would feel like how the water would rise to her breasts how long she would lie in the tub and just dream she wouldnt have to think about anything else if she could only make the water run she reached again for the tap again she failed she was doing it by feel because she didnt want to open her eyes and have to see herself in the mirror that she knew was hanging on the back of the bathroom door if she saw the mirror she would have to think and she was determined not to think again except about washing shed get into the tub and never come out just letting the water rise and fall shed watch its bubbles shed listen to its flow shed feel it glide between her fi ngers and toes shed love it hold it be good to it thats what shed do only nothing was forever not even the washing and when it was over she would have to feel which is the one thing she didnt want to do didnt want to face didnt want to live through because this was dying no matter what she pretended this was the real ending of things how funny to think shed always expected it to come in old age with her lying in a bed all snowy with linens and her grandchildren there and someone who loved her holding her hand so she wouldnt do her leaving all alone she saw now that it was all about being alone in the first place living was and if living was all about being alone dying wouldnt be anything different she could deal with that dying alone but only if it was here and now because then it would be over she wouldnt have to get up get into the water wash him away and walk out the door shed never have to make her way home oh goddess the long walk and face her mother more she would never have to see him never have to look in his eyes and never remember over and over like a fi lm running back and forth in her brain the moment when she knew he was going to hurt her i dont know what it means to love anyone she realised i thought it was goodness a wanting to share i thought it meant like you hold out your hand and someone takes it holds it hard and pulls you safe from the river you talk you tell him bits of yourself you say heres where i hurt and you give it to him and he holds it and gives you where he hurts in return and you hold it and thats how you learn to love you lean where hes strong he leans where youre strong and theres a joining somewhere but its not like this not like it was today here in this house its not like this that was the worst of it the filth of loving him that no amount of washing could cleanse even through the terror even in the instant when she knew exactly what he meant to do even when she begged him not to and he did it anyway ramming her tearing her fl esh from her flesh and leaving her lying like used rags on the floor the worst was that he was the man she loved and if the man she loved could know that she loved him and still do this to her and grunt with the pleasure of showing her who would dominate and who would submit then what she had thought was love was nothing because it seemed to her that if you loved someone and if he knew you loved him hed take care not to hurt you even if he didnt love you full in return hed cherish your feelings hold them to his heart and feel a fondness of some kind because that was what one did for people only if that wasnt the truth of living then she didnt want to live any more shed get into the bath and let the water take her let it cleanse her and kill her and carry her off chapter nineteen take a look at these lynley passed the folder of photo graphs across the coffee table to st james he picked up his pint of guinness and thought about straightening the potato eaters or cleaning the dust from both the frame and the glass of rouen cathedral in order to see if it was actually in full sunlight as it appeared to be deborah seemed to read his mind at least partially she muttered oh bother this is driving me crazy and dealt with the van gogh print before plopping back down on the sofa next to her husband lynley said bless you my child and waited for st james reaction to the crimescene material which lynley had brought back with him from clitheroe dora wragg had been good enough to see to their needs in the residents lounge while the pub was already closed for the latter part of the afternoon two elderly women in heavy tweeds and hiking boots had still been sitting by what remained of the fire when lynley returned from his visits with maggie the police and the medical examiner although the two women had been engaged in a sombre but enthusiastic discussion about hildas sciaticaand isnt the poor dear a martyr to it luvvie and seemed unlikely to eavesdrop on any conversation unconnected to hildas hips lynley had taken one look at their eager sharp faces and decided that discretion was the better part of conversing openly about anyones death so he waited until dora placed a guinness a harp and an orange juice on the coffee table in the residents lounge and took herself off to the nether regions of the inn before he handed over the folder to his friend st james studied the photographs first deborah gave them a glance suffered a frisson of aversion and quickly looked away lynley couldnt blame her the photographs of this particular death seemed more disquieting than many others he had seen and at first he couldnt understand why he was after all no stranger to the myriad ways in which an unexpected death occurs he was used to the result of strangulations the cyanosed face the bulging eyes the bloodfroth at the mouth he had seen his share of blows to the head hed examined a variety of knife wounds from cut throats to one virtual disembowelment not unlike the whitechapel murder of mary kelly hed seen victims of bombings and victims of shootings their limbs torn off and their bodies mutilated but there was something personally horrifying about this death and he couldnt put his finger on what it was deborah did it for him it went on and on she murmured it took some time didnt it poor man and that was it death hadnt come in an instant for robin sage a moments violent visitation via gun knife or garrotte with oblivion following hard on its heels it had taken him slowly enough for him to realise what was happening and for his physical suffering to be acute the crimescene pictures illustrated that theyd been taken in colour by the clitheroe police but what they captured was predominantly black and white the latter constituted a good six inches of newly fallen snow covering the ground and powdering the wall next to which the body lay the former constituted the body itself dressed in black clerical garb beneath a black overcoat that was bunched round the waist and hips as if the vicar had tried to slither out of it but even here the black did not achieve complete ascendancy over the white for the body itself like the wall its hand reached towards wore a thin but thorough membrane of snow this had been documented in seven photographs before the crimescene team had brushed the snow from the body into the collection jars that would later be deemed nonevidential considering the circumstances of the death and once the body was brushed free of snow the photographer had gone to work once again the rest of the pictures spelled out the nature of robin sages death agony dozens of deep arcing gouges in the ground thick mud on his heels earth and fl akes of grass beneath his nails testified to the manner in which he had tried to escape the convulsions blood on his left temple three slits on his cheek one shattered eyeball and a heavily ensanguined stone beneath his head suggested the strength of those same convulsions and how little he was able to do to master them once he understood there was no escape the position of his head and neck thrown back so far that it seemed inconceivable no vertebrae were broken indicated a frantic battle for air and the tongue a swollen mass chewed nearly in half protruded from the mouth in an eloquent statement about the mans fi nal moments st james went through the pictures twice he set two aside a closeup of the face and a second of one of the hands he said its heart failure if youre lucky asphyxia if youre not poor bastard he was unlucky as the devil lynley didnt need to examine the photographs st james had chosen to support his point hed seen the bluish colour of the lips and ears hed noted the same of the fi ngernails the undamaged eye was prominent lividity was welldeveloped all were indications of respiratory failure how long do you suppose it took him to die deborah asked too long by half st james glanced at lynley over the autopsy report you spoke with the pathologist everything was consistent with hemlock poisoning no specific lesions of the stomachs mucous membrane gastric irritation and oedema of the lungs time of death between ten that night and two the next morning what did sergeant hawkins have to say why did clitheroe cid buy the accidentalpoisoning conclusion so quickly and back off from an investigation why did they let shepherd handle it on his own cid had been at the site while sages body was still there it was clear that the external injuries hed done to his face aside his death was caused by some sort of seizure they didnt know what sort the detective constable on the scene actually thought it was epilepsy when he saw the tongue good god st james muttered lynley nodded agreement so after they took the photographs they left it up to shepherd to gather the details leading up to sages death essentially it was his call at the time they didnt even know sage had been out in the snow all night as no one had even reported him missing until he failed to show up to perform the townleyyoung wedding but once they knew hed been to dinner at the cottage why didnt they step in according to hawkins who frankly was a bit more forthcoming when i was standing before him warrant card in hand than when i had him on the phone three factors infl uenced the decision the involvement of shepherds father in the constables investigation what hawkins honestly assumed to be the pure coincidence of shepherds visit to the cottage on the night sage died and some additional input from forensic the visit wasnt a coincidence st james asked shepherd wasnt making rounds mrs spence phoned him to come to her lynley replied she told me she wanted to testify as much for the coroners jury at the inquest but shepherd insisted on claiming hed just dropped by on his rounds she said he lied because he wanted to protect her from local gossip and unfriendly speculation after the verdict was in that doesnt seem to have worked if the other night in the pub is any indication quite but heres what i fi nd intriguing st james she was perfectly willing to admit to the truth of phoning shepherd when i spoke to her this morning why bother to do that why didnt she stick with the story theyd agreed on one that was generally accepted and believed even if the villagers arent particularly in love with it perhaps she never agreed to shepherds story in the first place st james offered if he testified before she did at the inquest i doubt she would have wanted to perjure him by telling the truth but why not agree to the story her daughter wasnt home if only the two of them she and shepherd knew that shed phoned him what possible reason could she have now for telling me a different story even if its the truth shes damning herself by the admission you wont think im guilty if i admit im guilty deborah murmured christ but thats a dangerous game to play it worked on shepherd st james said why not on you she fixed in his mind the image of her vomiting he believed her and he took her part that was the third factor that infl uenced hawkins decision to call off the cid the sickness according to forensic lynley set down his glass put on his spectacles and picked up the report he scanned the first page the second and found what he was looking for on the third saying ah here it is prognosis for recovering from hemlock poisoning is good if vomition can be obtained so the fact that she was sick supports shepherds contention that she ate some of the hemlock accidentally purposely or whats more likely not at all st james took up his pint of harp obtained is the operative word tommy it indicates that vomition isnt a natural byproduct of ingestion it must be induced so shed have had to take a purgative of some sort which means she would have had to know that shed ingested poison in the fi rst place and if thats the case why didnt she phone sage to warn him or send someone out looking for him could she have known something was wrong with her but not that it was hemlock could she have assumed it was something else some milk gone bad a bad piece of meat she could have assumed anything if shes innocent we cant get away from that lynley sailed the report back to the coffee table removed his spectacles ran his hand through his hair then were nowhere essentially its a case of yesyoudid noididnt unless theres a motive somewhere can i hope the bishop gave you one in bradford robin sage was married st james said he wanted to talk to his fellow priests about the woman taken in adultery deborah added lynley leaned forward in his chair no ones said which seems to mean no one knew what happened to the wife was sage divorced that would be an odd thing for a priest surely she died some ten or fifteen years ago a boating accident in cornwall what sort glennaven hes bradfords bishop didnt know i phoned truro but couldnt get through to the bishop there and his secretary wasnt forthcoming with anything other than the basic fact a boating accident he wasnt free to give out information on the telephone he said what sort of boat it was what the circumstances were where the accident occurred what the weather was like if sage was with her when it happenednothing protecting one of their own he didnt know who i was after all and even if he did i hardly have the right to the information im not cid and what were engaged in here is hardly an offi cial endeavour even if i were but what do you think about the idea that theyre protecting sage and through him the reputation of the church its a possibility the connection to the woman taken in adultery is hard to ignore isnt it if he killed her lynley mused someone else might have waited for an opportunity for revenge two people alone on a sailboat a rough day a sudden squall the boom shifts in the wind cracks the woman on the head and shes overboard in an instant could that sort of death be faked st james asked a murder posing as an accident you mean no boom at all but a blow to the head of course what poetic justice deborah said a second murder posing as an accident its symmetrical isnt it its a perfect sort of vengeance lynley said theres truth to that but then who is mrs spence deborah asked st james listed possibilities a former housekeeper who knew the truth a neighbour an old friend of the wife the wifes sister deborah said his own sister even being urged back to the church here in winslough and finding him a hypocrite she couldnt endure perhaps a cousin simon or someone who worked for the bishop of truro as well why not someone who was involved with sage adultery cuts both ways doesnt it he killed his wife to be with mrs spence but once she discovered the truth she wouldnt have him she ran off the possibilities are endless her backgrounds the key lynley turned his pint glass thoughtfully on the table concentric rings of moisture marked its every position hed been listening but felt disinclined to dismiss all his previous conjectures he said nothing else peculiar in his background st james alcohol drugs an unseemly interest in something disreputable immoral or illegal he had a passion for scripture but that doesnt seem out of character in a priest what are you looking for something about children paedophilia when lynley nodded st james went on not a hint of that but would there be a hint if the church was protecting him and saving its own reputation to boot can you see the bishop admitting to the fact that robin sage had a penchant for choirboys that he had to be moved and he moved continually according to the bishop of bradford deborah noted because he couldnt keep his hands to himself theyd get him help theyd insist upon that but would they ever admit to the truth in public i suppose its as likely as anything else but it seems the least plausible of the explanations who are the choirboys here perhaps it wasnt boys youre thinking of maggie and mrs spence killing him to put an end towhat molestation seduction if thats the case why wouldnt she say its still murder st james shes the girls only parent could she depend upon a jury seeing it her way acquitting and leaving her free to care for the child who depends upon her would she take that risk would anyone would you why not report him to the police to the church its her word against his but the daughters word what if maggie chose to protect the man what if she wanted the involvement in the first place what if she fancied herself in love with him or fancied he loved her st james rubbed the back of his neck deborah sank her chin into the palm of her hand both of them sighed deborah said i feel like the red queen in alice we need to run twice as fast and im already out of breath its not looking good st james agreed we need to know more and all they need to do is hold their tongues to keep us permanently in the dark not necessarily lynley said theres still truro to consider weve plenty of room to manoeuvre there weve got the wifes death to dig into as well as robin sages background god thats a hike will you go there tommy i wont then who lynley smiled someone on holiday just like the rest of us in acton detective sergeant barbara havers turned on the radio that sat on the top of the refrigerator and interrupted sting in the midst of warbling about his fathers hands she said yeah baby sing it you hunk and chuckled at herself she liked listening to sting lynley claimed her interest was rooted solely in the fact that sting appeared to shave only once a fortnight in a display of putative virility that was geared to attract a largely feminine following barbara poohpoohed this she argued that for his part lynley was a musical snob saying that if a piece had been composed within the last eighty years he wouldnt offend his aristocratic ears by exposing them to it she herself had no real predilection for rock and roll but given her preference she always chose it over classical jazz blues or what constable nkata referred to as honky grandma tunes which usually featured something from the forties inoffensively rendered by a full orchestra with a heavy emphasis on the strings nkata himself was devoted to blues although havers knew hed sell his soul in an instant not to mention his growing collection of cds for just fi ve minutes alone with tina turner never you mind shes old enough to be my mum hed say to his colleagues my mum look like that ida never left home barbara turned up the volume and opened the refrigerator she was hoping that the sight of something inside would stimulate her appetite instead the odour of fi vedayold plaice made her retreat to the other side of the kitchen saying jesus bloody hell with some considerable reverence while she considered how best to be rid of the leaking package of fi sh without having to touch it she wondered what other malodorous surprises were waiting for discovery wrapped in foil stored in plastic cases or brought home in cartons for a hasty meal and long since forgotten from her position of safety she spied something green climbing the edges of one container she wanted to believe it was leftover mushy peas the colour seemed right but the fi brous consistency suggested mould next to it a new lifeform seemed to be evolving from what once had been a plate of spaghetti in fact the entire refrigerator looked like an unsavoury experimentinprogress conducted by alexander fleming with another trip to stockholm in mind with her eyes fastened suspiciously on this mess and the back of one index fi nger pressed beneath her nose to breathe against shallowly barbara edged over to the kitchen sink she rustled through cleansers scrubbing pads brushes and a few stiffened lumps that had once been dishcloths she unearthed a carton of rubbish bags armed with one of these and a spatula she advanced to do battle the plaice went into the sack fi rst splatting against the floor and sending up a death howl in the form of an odour that made barbara shudder the mushy peascumantibiotic went next followed by the spaghetti a wedge of double gloucester that appeared to have grown some sort of interesting beard a plate of petrifi ed bangers and mash and a carton of pizza which she could not get up the nerve to open leftover chow mein joined the mess as did the spongy remains of half a tomato three grapefruit halves and a carton of milk she distinctly remembered having purchased last june once barbara developed a rhythm to this catharsis of comestibles she decided to carry it to its logical conclusion anything that wasnt sealed in a jar permanently and professionally pickled or posing as a condiment unaffected by the passage of time out with the mayonnaise in with the ketchup joined the plaice and its companionsindecomposition by the time she was done the refrigerator shelves were bare of anything that made even the smallest promise of a meal but she wasnt a mourner for the edible loss whatever appetite she may have been trying to stimulate with her sentimental journey through the territory of ptomaine had long since disappeared she slammed the door home and tied up the rubbish bag with its length of wire she opened the back door shoved the bag outside and waited for a moment to see if it would develop legs and slither off to join the rest of the household rubbish on its own when it didnt she made a mental note to handle it later she lit a cigarette the scent of the match and of the burning tobacco did much to mask the residual foul odour of food gone bad she lit a second match and then a third while all the time she inhaled the smoke from the cigarette as deeply as she could not a total loss she thought nothing for tea or supper but look at it this way another jobs done all she had to do was scrub down the shelves and wash out the single drawer and the refrigerator would be ready to sell a little old a bit unreliable but priced accordingly she couldnt take it with her when she moved to chalk farm the studio was far too tiny to accommodate anything larger than munchkin size so she was going to have to clean it out eventually sooner or laterwhen she was ready to move she went to the table and sat her chair noisily scraping one bare metal foot against the sticky linoleum floor she twirled the end of her cigarette between thumb and index fi nger and idly watched the progress of the paper burning as the tobacco it held continued to smoulder the occasion of having to deal with this refrigerated putrefaction had she realised informed against her one more job done meant one more item ticked off the list which put her one step closer to shutting the house selling it and taking herself off to an unknown new life by alternate days she felt ready for the move and unaccountably terrified of the change it implied shed been to chalk farm half a dozen times already shed paid her deposit on the little studio shed talked to the landlord about different curtains and about the installation of the telephone shed even got a brief glimpse of one of her fellow tenants sitting in a pleasant square of sun at the window of his lower groundlevel flat yet even while that part of her life marked future drew her steadily onwards the larger part marked past kept her standing in place she knew that there was no turning back once this house in acton was sold one of the last ties to her mother would be severed barbara had spent the morning with her theyd walked to the hawthornlined common in greenford and sat on one of the benches that surrounded the play area watching a young mother twirling a laughing toddler on a roundabout it had been one of her mothers good days she recognised barbara and although she slipped three times and called her doris she didnt argue the point when barbara gently reminded her that auntie doris had been dead and gone for nearly fifty years she merely said with a wispy smile i forget barbie but im good today shall i come home soon dont you like it here barbara asked mrs flo likes you and you get on well with mrs pendlebury and mrs salkild dont you her mother scrabbled at the ground beneath her feet then held her legs out straight like a child she said like my new shoes barbie i thought you might they were hightop trainers lavender with silver stripes on the side barbara had found them in a rainbow selection in camden lock market shed bought a pair for herself in red and gold snickering at the thought of inspector lynleys horrified face when he saw them on her feet and although they hadnt had any in her mothers size shed bought the lavender ones anyway because they were the most outrageous and consequently the most likely to please shed thrown in two pairs of purpleandblack argyle socks to fill up the space between her mothers feet and the shoes and shed smiled at the pleasure mrs havers had taken at unwrapping the package and fi shing through the tissue for her supprise barbara had got into the habit of bringing a little something with her on these biweekly visits to hawthorn lodge where for the past two months her mother had been living with two other elderly women and mrs florence magentry mrs flo who cared for them barbara told herself that she did it for the joy of seeing her mothers face brighten at the sight of a gift but she knew each package served as coin to purchase her freedom from guilt she said again you like it here with mrs flo dont you mum mrs havers was watching the toddler in the roundabout she was swaying to some interior tune mrs salkild messed her pants last night she said confi dentially but mrs flo didnt even get crossed barbie she said these things happen dearie as we get older so you mustnt worry yourself to bits i didnt mess my pants thats good mum i helped as well i got the washing fl annel and the plastic basin and i held it just so so mrs flo could clean her mrs salkild cried she said im sorry i couldnt tell i didnt know i felt bad for her i gave her some of my chocolates after i didnt mess my pants barbie youre a big help to mrs flo mum she probably couldnt get along without you she does say that doesnt she shell be sad when i leave am i coming home today not today mum soon though but not today barbara sometimes wondered if it would be better to leave her mother in mrs flos morethancapable hands if she should simply pay her expenses disappear and hope that her mother would forget in time that she had a daughter not far away she did continual fl ipflops on the efficacy of these visits to greenford she went from believing they did nothing more than put momentary plasters on the sores of her own guilt at the expense of disrupting mrs havers routine to convincing herself that her steady presence in her mothers life would keep her from complete mental disintegration there was no literature available on either position as far as barbara knew and even if she had tried to find it which she couldnt bring herself to do what difference would some conveniently removed social scientists theories make this was her mother after all she couldnt abandon her barbara stabbed her cigarette into the ashtray on the kitchen table and counted the stubs that lay crushed there already eighteen cigarettes shed smoked since this morning she had to quit it was unclean unhealthy and disgusting she lit another from her chair she could see down the corridor all the way to the front door she could see the stairway to the right the sitting room to the left it was impossible to avoid noticing how far along the renovation of the house had moved the interior was painted new carpet was laid fixtures were repaired or replaced in the bathroom and the kitchen the stove and oven were cleaner than they had been in twenty years the linoleum fl oor still needed to be stripped completely and then rewaxed and wallpaper still waited to be hung but once those two jobs were taken care of along with washing or replacing the curtains which hadnt been touched as far as barbara knew since her familys move to the house in her childhood she could turn her efforts to the exterior the back garden was a nightmare the front garden was nonexistent and the house itself needed massive effort there were gutters to replace woodwork to paint windows to wash a front door to refi nish and while her savings were rapidly dwindling and her own time was limited because of her job things were still moving slowly forward according to her original plan if she didnt do something to slow down the wheels of this entire project initially taken on to guarantee she would have sufficient funds to keep her mother at hawthorn lodge indefi nitely the time for being on her own would be fast upon her barbara wanted that independence or so she kept telling herself she was thirtythree years old shed never established a life of her own unattached to her family and their infi nite needs that she could do so now ought to have been a cause for jubilation at a release from bondage but somehow it wasnt and it hadnt been since the morning shed driven her mother to greenford and settled her into a crisp new life with mrs flo mrs flo had prepared for their arrival in a way that should have set every worry to rest a welcome sign draped over the narrow stairways banister and there were flowers in the entry upstairs in her mothers room a porcelain carousel spun round slowly playing the entertainer in light chiming notes oh barbie barbie look her mother had breathed and she rested her chin on the chest of drawers and watched the tiny horses rise and fall there were flowers in the bedroom as well irises in a tall white vase i thought she might need a special moment mrs flo said smoothing her hands against the bodice of her pinstriped shirtwaister ease her in gentle so she knows we mean to make her welcome ive coffee and poppy seed cakes down below bit early for elevenses isnt it but i thought you might have to be off fairly quick barbara nodded im working on a case in cambridge she looked round the room it was so clean crisp and warm with the sunlight falling across the daisy carpet thank you she said she wasnt referring to the coffee and cakes mrs flo patted her hand dont you worry about mum well do right by her barbie may i call you barbie barbara wanted to tell her that no one but her parents had ever used that name that it made her feel childlike and in need of care she was about to correct her saying its barbara please when she realised that to do so would be to break the illusion that somehow this was home and these women her mother mrs flo mrs salkild and mrs pendlebury one of whom was blind and the other another victim of dementia constituted a family into which she herself was being offered membership if she cared to accept it and she did so it wasnt so much the prospect of permanently abandoning her mother that caused barbara to drag her feet from time to time as it became more apparent that her dream of being on her own was about to become reality it was the prospect of her own abandonment for two months now she had been coming home to an empty house something she had longed for during the years of her fathers lingering illness something she had deemed completely indispensable when she found herself left to deal with her mother after his death for what seemed like ages she had sought a solution to caring for her mother and now that she had one apparently designed by heaven god was there another mrs flo anywhere else on earth the focus of her plans had shifted from dealing with an ageing parent to dealing with the house and when the house offered her nothing more to deal with shed be face to face with dealing with herself alone she would have to start thinking about her isolation and when the kings arms emptied of her colleagues in the evening when macpherson went home to his wife and five children when hale went to do increasingly dubious battle with the solicitor who was handling his divorce when lynley dashed off to have dinner with helen and nkata drifted off to take one of his six squabbling girlfriends to bed shed meander slowly to st jamess park station kicking at rubbish that blew in her path shed ride to waterloo change to the northern line and hunch on a seat with a copy of the times feigning interest in national and world events to disguise her growing panic at being alone its no crime to feel this way she kept telling herself youve been under someones thumb for thirtythree years what else would you expect to feel when the pressures gone what do prisoners feel when theyre let out of gaol how about liberated she answered herself how about like dancing in the street like having their hair worked over by one of those posh hairdressers in knightsbridge who have their windows all draped in black to show off blowup snaps of gorgeous women with geometric haircuts that never grow out scraggly or get blown by the wind anyone else in her position she decided would probably be brimming with plans working feverishly to get this house in shape to sell so that she could start a new life which no doubt would begin with a wardrobe change a body makeover courtesy of a personal trainer who looked like arnold schwarzenegger with better teeth a sudden interest in makeup and a telephone answering machine to keep track of the messages from a score of admirers all waiting to entwine their lives with hers but barbara had always been a bit more practical than that she knew change came slowly if it came at all so right now the move to chalk farm represented nothing more than unknown shops to get used to unknown streets to navigate unknown neighbours to meet all of it would be done on her own with no voice to hear in the morning save her own no friendly noise of someone puttering about and especially no sympathetic companion both ready and eager to listen to her assessment of how things had gone on a given day of course shed never had a sympathetic companion involved in her life in the past only her parents who awaited her nightly arrival not to engage her in avid conversation but to wolf down supper and get back to the telly where they watched a succession of american melodramas still her parents had been a human presence in her life for thirtythree long and unbroken years while they hadnt exactly filled her life with joy and a sense that the future was an unwritten slate they had been there needing her and now no one did she realised that she wasnt so much afraid of being alone as she was of becoming one of the nations invisibles a woman whose presence in anyones life had no particular importance this house in acton especially if she brought her mother back to it would eliminate the chance of her discovering that she was an unnecessary fixture in the world eating sleeping bathing and eliminating like the rest of mankind but otherwise expendable locking the door handing over the key to the estate agent and going on her way meant risking the revelation of her own unimportance she wanted to avoid that as long as she could she crushed out her cigarette got to her feet and stretched eating greek food sounded better than did stripping and waxing the kitchen floor lamb souvlakia on rice dolmades and a halfbottle of aristides marginally drinkable wine but first the rubbish bag it was where she had left it outside the back door barbara was grateful to see that its contents hadnt managed to climb the evolutionary scale from mould and algae to anything with legs she hoisted it up and trudged along the weedsprung path to the rubbish bins she lowered the bag inside just as the telephone began to ring what dyou know my date for next new years she muttered and then all right im coming as if the caller were telegraphing impatience she caught it on the eighth double ring picking it up to hear a man say ah good youre there i thought i might have missed you you mean you dont miss me barbara asked and here i was worried youd be incapable of sleeping with the two of us so many miles apart lynley chuckled how goes the holiday sergeant in fi ts and starts you need a change of scenery to take your mind off things could be but why do i think this is heading in a direction i might learn to regret if the directions cornwall that doesnt sound half bad whos buying i am youre on inspector when do i leave chapter twenty it was a quarter to five when lynley and st james walked up the short drive to the vicarage no car was parked there but a light burned in what appeared to be the kitchen another shone behind the curtains from a fi rstfl oor room making a tawny glow against which they could see a figure moving in silhouette distorted quasimodolike from the way the material hung behind the glass next to the front door a collection of rubbish waited to be carted away it seemed to consist mostly of newspapers empty containers for household cleaning agents and dirty rags these last gave off the distinct and eyewatering smell of ammonia as if testifying to the victory of antisepsis in whatever war of cleanliness had been waged inside the house lynley rang the bell st james looked across the street and frowned thoughtfully at the church he said my guess is that shell probably have to dig through the local newspapers to get some sort of account of the death tommy i cant think the bishop of truro will tell barbara anything more than his secretary told me and thats counting on her ability to get in to see him in the first place he could put her off for days especially if there is something to hide and if glennaven reported our visit haversll deal with it in one fashion or another i certainly wouldnt put strongarming a bishop past her that sort of thing is her stock in trade lynley rang the bell again but as to truros admitting to any nasty proclivities on the part of sage thats a problem but nasty proclivities are only one possibility weve already seen there are dozens of others some applying to sage some to mrs spence if havers uncovers anything questionable no matter what it is at least well have more to work with than we have at the moment lynley peered through the kitchen window the light that was on came from a small bulb above the cooker the room was empty ben wragg said there was a housekeeper at work here didnt he he rang the bell a third time a voice finally responded from behind the door hesitant and low whos there please scotland yard cid lynley replied ive identification if youd like to see it the door cracked open then closed quickly once lynley had passed the warrant card through nearly a minute passed a tractor rumbled by in the street a school bus disgorged six uniformed pupils at the edge of the car park in front of st john the baptist church before trundling up the incline with its indicator flashing for the trough of bowland the door opened again a woman stood in the entry she was holding the warrant card mostly enclosed in one fist while her other hand grabbed at the crew neck of her pullover and bunched it up as if she were concerned that it might not be covering her suffi ciently her hair a long crinkly mass that looked electrically charged hid more than half of her face the shadows hid the rest vicars dead you know she said in not much more than a mumble died last month constable found him on the footpath he ate something bad it was an accident she was stating what she must have known theyd already been told as if she had no idea at all that new scotland yard had been prowling round the village for the last twentyfour hours on the trail of this death it was diffi cult to believe that she wouldnt have heard of their presence before this especially lynley realised as he studied her since she certainly had been sitting in the pub with a male companion on the previous night when st john townleyyoung had paid his call townleyyoung had accosted the man with her in fact she didnt move away from the doorway to let them in but she shivered from the cold and lynley looked down to see that her feet were bare he also saw that she was wearing trousers fine grey herring bone may we come in it was an accident she said everyone knows that we wont stay long and you ought to get out of the cold she gripped her pullovers neck more tightly she looked from him to st james and back to him before she stepped away from the door and admitted them into the house youre the housekeeper lynley asked polly yarkin she said lynley introduced st james and went on to say may we talk to you he felt the curious need to be gentle with her and he couldnt determine exactly why there was something both frightened and defeated in her air like a horse thats been broken by an illtempered hand she seemed ready to bolt in an instant she led them into the sitting room where she turned the switch on a floor lamp to no effect she said bulbs gone isnt it and left them alone in the diminishing light of dusk they could see that whatever personal possessions the vicar had owned they were gone what was left was a sofa an ottoman and two chairs arranged round a coffee table across from them a bookshelf reached from floor to ceiling empty of books something glittered on the floor next to this and lynley went to investigate st james strolled to the window and pushed the curtains to one side saying nothing much out there the shrubs look bad therere plants on the step mostly to himself lynley picked up a small globe of silver that lay unhinged and open on the carpet scattered round it were the desiccated remains of triangular fleshy bits that appeared to be fruit he picked up one of these as well it had no scent its texture was like a dried sponge the globe was connected to a matching silver chain its clasp was broken thats mine polly yarkin had returned lightbulb in hand i wondered where it got itself off to what is it amulet for health mum likes me to wear it silly like garlic but you cant tell mum that shes ever one to believe in charms lynley handed it to her she returned his warrant card her fingers felt feverish she went to the floor lamp changed the bulb switched it on and retreated to one of the chairs which she stood behind her hands curved round its back lynley went to the sofa st james joined him she nodded at them to sit although it seemed clear that she had no intention of sitting herself lynley gestured to the chair said this wont take long and waited for her to move she did so reluctantly one hand holding on to the back of the chair as if she would pull herself behind it again sitting she was more fully in the light and it appeared that light and not their company was what she wished to avoid he saw for the first time that the trousers she wore belonged to a mans suit they were far too long shed rolled the bottoms into bulky cuffs vicars she said in hesitant explanation i dont think anyone will mind do you i tripped on the back step just a bit ago ripped my skirt up proper clumsy as an old cow i am he raised his eyes to her face an angry red welt curved from under the protective curtain of her hair marking a path that ended at the corner of her mouth clumsy she said again and she gave a little laugh im always running into things mum shouldve gave me an amulet to keep me steady on my feet she pushed her hair forward a bit more lynley wondered what else she was trying to hide on her face her skin was shiny across what he could see of her forehead perspiration either from nerves or from illness it wasnt warm enough in the house for the sheen of sweat to be realistically from anything else he said are you quite all right may we phone a doctor for you she rolled the trouser cuffs down to cover her feet and tucked the extra material round them i never seen a doctor these past ten years i just fell im all right but if youve hit your head just banged up my face on that silly door didnt i she backed herself cautiously into the chair and put one hand on each arm her movement was slow and it looked deliberate as if she were digging out of her memory the appropriate way to sit and behave when someone came to call but something about her manner perhaps it was the way her arms moved like mechanical extensions of her body or the way her fingers uncurled with an effort and lay flat against the chairs upholstery suggested that she really wanted nothing so much as to cradle herself doubled over until some interior pain went away when neither lynley nor st james spoke at once she said church wardens asked me to keep the place up and get it ready for another vicar ive been cleaning sometimes i work too hard and get a bit sore you know youve been working on the house since the vicar died it seemed unlikely the place wasnt that large it takes time doesnt it to get things sorted out proper and to make them tidy when someone passes on youve done a good job its just that they always look the vicarage over dont they the new ones it helps them make a decision if they get offered the job is that how it worked with mr sage did he come to look the vicarage over before he took the position he didnt mind what it was like i spose it was because he didnt have a family so it didnt much matter about the house there was only him in it did he ever speak of a wife st james asked polly reached for the amulet which lay in her lap wife was he thinking of getting married hed been married he was a widower he never said i thoughtwell he didnt seem much interested in women did he lynley and st james exchanged a glance lynley said how do you mean polly picked up the amulet and closed her fingers round it returning her hand to the arm of the chair he never acted any different with the churchcleaning ladies than he did with the blokes that ring the bells i always thoughti thought well maybe the vicars too holy maybe he doesnt think about ladies and such he read the bible lots after all he prayed he wanted me to pray with him hed always say lets start the day with a prayer dear polly what sort of prayer god help us to know your will and to find the way that was the prayer mostly but it was longern that i always wondered what way i was sposed to find her lips curved briefly find the way to cook the meat proper i guess except he never complained about my cooking the vicar he said you cook like saint somebodyorother dear polly i forget who st michael did he cook i think he fought the devil oh well im not religious i mean the kind of religion with churches and such vicar didnt know that which is just as well if he admired your cooking he must have told you hed not be home for dinner the night he died he only said that he wouldnt be wanting any dinner i didnt know he was going out i just thought maybe he wasnt feeling right why hed been holed up in his bedroom all day hadnt he and he didnt eat his lunch he came out once round tea time to use the phone in the study but he went right back to his room when he was done what time was this round three i guess did you hear his conversation she opened her palm and looked at the amulet she rolled her fingers against it i was a tad worried about him it wasnt like mr sage not to eat so you heard his conversation just a tad is all and only because i was worried it wasnt like i was listening to hear i mean he wasnt sleeping well the vicar his bed was always thrashed up in the morning like he was wrestling with the sheets and he lynley leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees he said its all right polly you had good intentions no ones about to judge you for listening at a door she didnt look convinced distrust fl ickered behind the skittish movement of her eyes from lynley to st james back to lynley what did he say lynley asked who was he talking to you cant judge what happened then you cant know whats right now thats in gods hands not yours we arent here to judge thats up to no polly said thats what i heard thats what the vicar said you cant judge what happened then you cant know whats right now thats in gods hands not yours was that the only phone call he made that day fars i know was he angry was he shouting raising his voice he sounded tired mostly you didnt see him afterwards she shook her head afterwards she said she took tea to the study only to fi nd that hed gone back up to his bedroom she followed him there and knocked on the door offering him the food which he refused i said you havent had a bite all day vicar and you must eat something and im not leaving this spot until you have a bite of these nice toast fingers ive got here so he fi nally opened the door he was dressed and the bed was made but i knew what hed been doing what praying he had this little prayer place in a corner of the room with a bible on it and a place to kneel thats where hed been how do you know she rubbed her fingers against her knee in explanation trousers the crease was gone from right here there were wrinkle places as well where his leg bent to kneel what did he say to you that i was a good soul but i mustnt worry i asked him was he ill he said no did you believe him i said youre wearing yourself out vicar with these trips to london hed just got back the day before see and every time he went to london he looked a bit worse than the last time he went and every time he went he came home and prayed sometimes i wonderedwell what was he up to in london that he came back so tired and peaky looking but then he went on the train didnt he so i thought maybe it was just the aggravation of travel and such getting to the station buying all the tickets switching trains here and there that sort of thing makes you tired a trip like that where did he go in london polly didnt know nor could she say what hed been doing whether it was church business whether it was personal the vicar kept the information to himself the only thing polly was able to tell them for sure was that he stayed in a hotel not far from euston station it was the same hotel each time she remembered that did they want the name yes if she had it she started to rise then caught her breath with something like surprise when the movement didnt come easily to her she disguised a small cry by coughing it did little enough to hide her pain sorry she said im silly to fall got myself real banged up clumsy old cow she inched her way forward in the chair and pushed herself up when she got to the edge lynley watched her frowning noting the odd manner in which she held her pullover bunched in front of her with both hands she didnt stand up straight when she walked she favoured her right leg he said abruptly whos been to see you today polly just as abruptly she stopped no one least no one that i recall she made a show of thinking the question over creasing her brow and concentrating on the carpet as if she would see the answer there nope no one at all i dont believe you you didnt fall did you i did out back who was it has mr townleyyoung been to see you did he want to talk to you about the pranks at cotes hall she seemed genuinely surprised the hall no about last night in the pub then about the man you were with that was his soninlaw wasnt it no i mean it was it was brendan true but mr townleyyoung hasnt been here then who i fell i got banged up itll teach me to be more careful she left the room lynley pushed himself to his feet and walked to the window from there he paced to the bookcase then back to the window a wall radiator was hissing beneath it insistent and irritating he tried to turn the knob it seemed permanently stuck he clenched it fought with it burnt his hand and cursed tommy he swung round to st james who hadnt moved from the sofa who he asked perhaps more importantly why why for gods sake st james voice was low and perfectly calm consider the situation scotland yard arrives and begins asking questions everyones meant to toe the already established line perhaps polly doesnt want to perhaps someone knows that christ thats not even the point st james someone beat her up someone out there someone your hands are full and she doesnt want to talk she could be afraid she could be merely protective we dont know the larger issue at the moment is whether what happened to her is connected to what happened to robin sage you sound like barbara havers someone has to polly returned a slip of paper in her hand hamilton house she said heres the phone as well lynley put the slip of paper into his pocket how many times did mr sage go to london four perhaps five i can look in his diary if you want to know for certain his diarys still here all his thingss here his will said to give all his belongings to charity but it didnt say which the church council said to pack everything up until they decide where to send them would you like to look through it if we may in the study she led them back along the corridor past the stairway shed apparently been cleaning spots in the carpet sometime that day because lynley noticed patches of damp that he hadnt seen when they first entered the house near the door and in an uneven trail to the stairs where one of the walls had been washed as well beneath a bare urn stand opposite the stairway a strip of multicoloured material curled as polly walked on oblivious lynley picked it up it was flimsy he discovered similar to gauze with threads of metallic gold running through it it reminded him of the indian dresses and skirts hed often seen for sale in outdoor markets thoughtfully he twisted it round his finger felt an unusual stiffness to it and held it up to the ceiling light which polly had turned on in their progress towards the front of the house the material was heavily blotched with a rusty stain it was frayed on the edges ripped from a larger piece not cut with scissors lynley examined it with little surprise he put it into his pocket and followed st james into the vicars study polly stood next to the desk shed lit the lamp on it but positioned herself so that her hair cast an oblique shadow across her face the room was crowded with cartons all of them labelled one of them open this contained clothes obviously the source of pollys trousers lynley said he had a lot of possessions not a lot of important stuff its just that he was a bit of a hoarder when i wanted to throw something away i had to put it in his work tray on the desk and let him decide mostly he kept things especially london things tickets to museums a day pass for the underground like they were souvenirs he just collected odd bits did the vicar some people are like that arent they lynley wandered among the cartons reading the labels just books loo parish business sitting room vestments shoes study desk bedroom sermons magazines odd bits whats in this he asked of the last things from his pockets scraps theatre programmes that sort of thing and the diary where would we fi nd it she pointed to the cartons marked study desk and books there were at least a dozen lynley began moving them for easier access he said whos been through the vicars belongings besides yourself no one she said the church council told me to pack everything up and seal it and mark it but they havent looked things over yet i expect theyll want to keep the parish business carton wont they and they might want to offer his sermons to the new vicar as well the clothes can go to and prior to your packing things into cartons lynley asked who went through his things then she hesitated she was standing near him he could smell the odour of her perspiration soaking into the wool of her pullover after the vicar died lynley clarified during the investigation did anyone look through his belongings constable she said did he go through the vicars things alone were you with him was his father her tongue darted out to dampen her upper lip i brought him tea every day i was in and out so he worked alone when she nodded he said i see and unsealed the fi rst carton as st james did the same to another he said maggie spence was a frequent visitor to the vicarage as i understand she was a great favourite of the vicar i suppose did they meet alone alone polly picked at a rough spot on the side of her thumb the vicar and maggie did they meet alone in here in the sitting room somewhere else upstairs polly surveyed the room as if looking for the memory in here mostly id say alone yes was the door open or shut she began to unseal one of the cartons shut mostly before lynley could ask another question she went on they liked to talk bible stuff they loved the bible id bring them their tea hed be sitting in that chairshe pointed to an overstuffed chair on which three more cartons were piledand maggied be on the stool there in front of the desk a discreet four feet away lynley noted he wondered who placed it there sage maggie or polly herself he said did the vicar meet with other young people from the parish no just maggie did you think that unusual after all there was a social club for the teenagers as i understand he never met with any of them when he first got here there was a meeting in the church for the young people to form the club i made them scones i remember that but only maggie came here what about her mother missus spence polly shuffl ed through the material in the carton she made a show of examining it it seemed to consist mostly of loose papers filled with typescript she never was here missus spence did she phone polly considered the question across from her st james was going through a sheaf of papers and a stack of pamphlets once near supper maggie was still here she wanted her at home was she angry we didnt speak very long so i couldnt say she just asked was maggie here sort of snippy i guess i said yes and fetched her maggie talked on the phone mostly yes mummy no mummy and please listen mummy then she went on home upset a bit grey in the face and dragging her feet like she was caught doing something she wasnt supposed to she was fond of the vicar maggie was he was fond of her but her mum didnt want that so maggie came to see him on the sly and her mother found out how people see things they talk theres no secrets in a village like winslough it seemed a wildly facile statement to lynley as far as he had been able to ascertain there were secrets layered upon secrets in winslough and nearly all of them had to do with the vicar maggie the constable and juliet spence st james said is this what were looking for and lynley saw that he was holding a small engagement diary with a black plastic cover and a spiral spine st james handed it over and went on rooting through the carton that he had opened polly said ill leave you to it then and left them in a moment they could hear water running in the kitchen lynley put on his spectacles and flipped through the diary from december backwards noting first that although the twentythird was marked with the townleyyoung wedding and the morning of the twentysecond had power townleyyoung scrawled at half past ten there was no reference on that same day to having dinner with juliet spence the day before had a notation however the name yanapapoulis made a diagonal across the lines for appointments when did deborah meet him lynley asked when you and i were in cambridge november a thursday was it round the twentieth lynley flipped the pages forward they were filled with notations about the vicars life meetings of the altar society visitations to the sick the assembling of his fl edgling teen club baptisms three funerals two weddings sessions that looked like marital counseling presentations before the church council two clerical gatherings in bradford he found what he was looking for on thursday the sixteenth ss next to one oclock but at that point the trail went cold there were names listed next to times further back all the way to the vicars arrival in winslough some were christian names some were surnames but it was impossible to tell if they belonged to parishioners or if they indicated sages business in london he looked up ss he said to st james does that suggest anything to you someones initials possibly except that hes not used initials any place else its always names except this once what does that suggest an organisation st james looked refl ective nazis come to mind robin sage neonazi a closet skinhead secret service perhaps robin sage winsloughs budding james bond no it would have been mi or then wouldnt it or sis st james began replacing items in the carton nothing much in here aside from the diary stationery business cards his own tommy part of a sermon on the lilies of the field ink pens pencils farming guides two packets of seeds for tomatoes a file of correspondence fi lled with letters of dismissal letters of application letters of acceptance an application for st james frowned what cambridge partially filled out doctor of theology and it isnt that its the application any application partially filled out it reminded me of what deborah and i have beennever mind that it brings to mind ss what about social services lynley saw the leap his friend had made from his own life he wanted to adopt a child or to place a child christ maggie perhaps he saw juliet spence as an unfi t mother that might push her to violence its certainly a thought but there hasnt been the slightest whisper of that from any quarter there usually isnt if the situations abusive you know how it goes the childs afraid to speak trusting no one when she fi nally finds someone she can trust st james refolded the cartons flaps and pressed the tape back down to seal them we may have been looking at robin sage through the wrong sort of window lynley said all those meetings with maggie alone instead of seduction he might have been trying to get to the truth lynley sat in the desk chair and set the diary down but this is pointless speculation we dont know enough we dont even know when he went to london because you cant tell from the diary where he was it has names and times listed scores of appointments but aside from bradford theres no place mentioned he kept the receipts polly yarkin spoke from the doorway she was carrying a tray on which shed assembled a teapot two cups and saucers and a halfcrushed package of chocolate digestives she put the tray on the desk and said hotel receipts he kept them you can match up the dates they found the file of robin sages hotel receipts in the third box they tried these documented five visits to london beginning in october and ending just two days before he died december when yanapapoulis was written lynley matched the receipt dates to the diary but he came up with only three more pieces of information that looked even marginally promising the name kate next to noon on sages first london visit of october a telephone number on his second ss again on his third lynley tried the number it was a london exchange an exhausted endoftheworkingday voice said social services and lynley smiled and gave st james a thumbsup his conversation was unprofitable however there was no way to ascertain the purpose of any telephone call robin sage may have made to social services there was no one there by the name of yanapapoulis and it was otherwise impossible to track down the social worker to whom sage had spoken when and if he had made the call additionally if he had paid anyone a visit at social services on one of his trips to london he took that secret with him to his grave but at least they had something to work with however little it was lynley said did mr sage mention social services to you polly did social services ever phone him here social services you mean about taking care of old folks or something for any reason really when she shook her head lynley asked did he speak about visiting social services in london did he ever bring anything back with him documents paperwork there might be something with the odd bits she said what if he brought anything back and left it round the study itll be in the odd bits carton when he opened it lynley found that the odd bits carton appeared to be a hotchpotch display of robin sages life it contained everything from prejubileeline maps of the london underground to a yellowing collection of the sort of historical pamphlets one can purchase for ten pence in country churches a stack of book reviews clipped from the times looked fragile enough to suggest theyd been gathered over a period of years and going through them revealed that the vicars taste tended towards biography philosophy and whatever had been nominated for the booker prize in a given year lynley handed a stack of papers to st james and sank back in the desk chair to peruse another polly moved gingerly round them realigning some cartons checking the seals on others lynley felt her glance repeatedly resting upon him then fl itting away he looked through his stack explanations of museum exhibits a guide to the turner gallery at the tate receipts for lunches dinners and teas manuals explaining the use of an electric saw the assembly of a bicycles basket the cleaning of a steam iron advertisements extolling the benefits of joining an exercise club and handouts one collects when strolling along a london street these consisted of offers for hairstyling the hair apparent clapham high street ask for sheelah grainy photographs of automobiles drive the new metro from lambeth ford political announcements labour speaks tonight camden town hall along with assorted advertisements and solicitations for charities from the rspca to homeless relief a brochure from the hare krishnas played the roll of a bookmark inside a copy of the book of common prayer lynley flipped it open and read the prayer marked from ezekiel when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive he read it again aloud and looked up at st james what was it glennaven said that the vicar liked to discuss the difference between that which is moral prescribed by law and that which is right yet according to this the church seems to feel theyre one in the same thats the wonderful way of churches isnt it st james unfolded a piece of paper read it set it to one side picked it up again lynley said was it logic chopping on his part talking about moral versus right was it a form of avoidance in which he engaged his fellow clerics in meaningless discussion thats certainly what glennavens secretary thought or was he himself on the horns of a dilemma lynley gave the prayer a second look he shall save his soul alive heres something st james said theres a date on the top it says only the eleventh but the paper looks at least relatively fresh so it might match up to one of the london visits he handed it over lynley read the scrawled words charing cross to sevenoaks high street left towards these appear to be a set of directions st james does the date match up with one of the london visits lynley went back to the diary the fi rst the eleventh of october where the name kate is listed he could have gone to see her perhaps that visit set in motion the rest of the trips to social services even towhat was that name in december yanapapoulis st james cast a quick look at polly yarkin and finished obliquely with and any of those visits could have served as instigation it was all conjecture based upon air and lynley knew it each interview fact conversation or step in the investigation was taking their thoughts in a new direction they had no hard evidence and from what he could tell unless someone had removed it there had never been hard evidence in the fi rst place no weapon left at the scene of the crime no incriminating fingerprint no wisp of hair there was nothing in fact to connect the alleged killer and her victim at all save a telephone call overheard by maggie and inadvertently corroborated by polly and a dinner after which both parties became ill lynley knew that he and st james were engaged in piecing together a tapestry of guilt from the thinnest of threads he didnt like it nor did he like the indications of interest and curiosity that polly yarkin was attempting to hide shuffling a carton here moving a second one there rubbing her sleeve across the base of the lamp to remove spots of dust that didnt exist did you go to the inquest he asked her she withdrew her arm from the vicinity of the lamp as if caught in an act of misbehaviour me yes everyone went why did you have evidence to give no then justi wanted to know what happened i wanted to hear what she lifted her shoulders slightly allowed them to drop what she had to say once i knew the vicar had been with her that night everyone went she repeated because it was the vicar and a woman or this particular woman juliet spence cant say she said about everyone else or about yourself she dropped her eyes the simple action was enough to tell him why shed brought them the tea and why after seeing to its pouring shed remained in the study shifting cartons and watching them sift through the vicars possessions long after it was necessary for her to do so chapter twentyone when polly had shut the door behind them st james and lynley got as far as the end of the drive before lynley stopped and gave his concentration to the silhouette of st john the baptist church complete darkness had fallen street lamps were lit along the incline that led through the village they beamed ochreous rays through an evening mist and cast their shadows within the elongated pools of their own light on the damp street below here by the church however outside the boundary of the village proper a full moon rising past the summit of cotes fell and its companion stars provided the sole illumination i could use a cigarette lynley said absently when do you expect ill stop feeling the need to light up probably never thats certainly a comforting reassurance st james its merely statistical probability combined with scientifi c and medical likelihood tobaccos a drug one never completely recovers from addiction how did you escape it there we all were sneaking a smoke after games lighting up the very instant we crossed the bridge into windsor impressing ourselves and trying like the devil to impress everyone else with our individual nicotinic adulthood what happened to you exposure to an early allergic reaction i suppose when lynley glanced his way st james continued my mother caught david with a packet of dunhills when he was twelve she shut him up in the lavatory and made him smoke them all she shut the rest of us in there with him to smoke to watch mothers always been a strong believer in the power of an object lesson it worked with me yes with andrew as well sid and david however always found the thrill of displeasing mother more than equal to whatever discomfort they themselves might incur as a result sid smoked like a chimney until she was twentythree david still does but your mother was right about the tobacco of course but im not sure her methods of educating her offspring were particularly sound she could be a real termagant when pushed to the edge sid always claimed it was her name what else can you expect from someone called hortense sidneyd demand after wed suffered a whipping for one infraction or another i on the other hand tended to believe she was saddled rather than blessed by motherhood my father kept late hours after all she was on her own despite the presence of whatever nanny david and sid hadnt managed to terrorise into leaving yet did you feel yourself abused st james buttoned his topcoat against the chill there was little breeze here the church acted as a break against the wind that otherwise funnelled through the dale but the falling mist was frost in the making and it lay upon his skin in a clammy webbing that seemed to seep through muscle and blood to the bone he stifled a shiver and thought about the question his mothers anger had always been terrifying to behold she was medea incarnate when crossed she was quick to strike quicker to shout and generally unapproachable for hours sometimes days after a transgression had been committed she never acted without cause she never punished without explanation yet in some eyes he knew and especially in modern eyes she would have been seen as extremely wanting no he said and felt it to be the truth we tended to be an unruly lot given half a chance i think she was doing the best she could lynley nodded and went back to his study of the church as far as st james could tell there wasnt much to see moonlight glinted off the crenellated roofline and sketched in silver the contour of a tree in the graveyard the rest was one variation or another of darkness and shadow the clock in the belltower the peaked roof of the lychgate the small north porch it would be growing close to the time for evensong but no one was readying the church for prayers st james waited watching his friend theyd brought away from the study the odd bits carton which st james was carrying under his arm he set it on the ground and blew on his hands to warm them the action roused lynley who looked his way and said sorry we should be off deborah will be wondering whats happened to us still he didnt move i was thinking about abusive mothers in part but more about how it all fits if it all fits if theres the slightest possibility that anything fi ts the girl didnt say anything to suggest abuse when she spoke to you today maggie no but she wouldnt would she if the truth is that she revealed something to sage something he felt he had to act upon and something that cost him his life at her mothers hands she wouldnt be likely to reveal it a second time to anyone else shed be feeling responsible as hell for what happened you dont sound as if youre keen on that idea despite the phone call to social services lynley nodded the mist made a penumbra of the moonlight in which his expression was moody with shadows drawn beneath his eyes when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive did sage intend the prayer to refer to juliet spence or to himself perhaps neither you may be making too much of nothing it may have merely been a chance marking in the book or it may have referred to someone else entirely it could be a piece of scripture that sage was using to comfort someone who had come to him to confess for that matter since we know he was trying to woo people back to the church he could have been using the prayer for that doeth that which is lawful and right worship god on sundays confessions something i hadnt thought of lynley admitted i keep the worst of my sins to myself and i cant imagine anyone else doing otherwise but what if someone did confess to sage and then regretted having done so st james mulled the idea over the possibilities are so narrow that i think it unlikely tommy according to what youre attempting to set up the regretful penitent would have to be someone who knew sage was going to juliet spences that night for dinner who knew he began to list we have mrs spence herself we have maggie a door slammed with an echo that bounded across the street they turned at the sound of hurried footsteps colin shepherd was opening the door to his land rover but he hesitated when he caught sight of them and the constable of course lynley murmured and moved to intercept shepherd before he left at first st james remained where he was at the end of the drive a few yards away he saw lynley pause fractionally at the edge of the cone of light cast by the interior of the rover he saw him remove his hands from his pockets and he noted with some uneasy confusion that his right hand was balled st james knew his friend well enough to realise that it might be wise to join them lynley was saying in a chillingly pleasant tone youve apparently had an accident constable no shepherd said your face st james reached the edge of the light the constables face was abraded on both the forehead and the cheeks shepherds fingers touched one of the scratches this roughhousing with the dog up on cotes fell you were there yourself today i on cotes fell at the hall you can see it from the fell anyone up there can see anything in fact the hall the cottage the garden anything do you know that inspector anyone who chooses can see anything below i prefer less indirection in my conversations constable are you trying to tell me something aside from what happened to your face of course you can see anyones movements the comings and goings whether the cottage is locked whos working at the hall and no doubt lynley finished for him when the cottage is vacant and where the key to the root cellar is kept which is i take it the point youre trying to make however obliquely have you an accusation youd like to share shepherd was carrying a torch he threw it into the front seat of the rover why dont you start asking what the summit is used for why dont you ask who goes hiking up the fell you do yourself by your own admission and its a rather damning one wouldnt you say the constable made a sound of disdain and began to climb into the car lynley stopped him by noting you seem to have eschewed the accident theory you were espousing yesterday might i know why has something caused you to decide your initial investigation was incomplete those are your words not mine youre here at your own desire no one elses ill thank you to remember that he put his hand on the steering wheel a prefatory movement to entering the car did you look into his trip to london lynley asked shepherd hesitated his expression guarded whose mr sage went to london in the days before he died did you know that no polly yarkin didnt tell you did you interview polly she was his housekeeper after all shed know more about the vicar than anyone else shed be the one who i spoke to polly but i didnt interview her not offi cially then unofficially and recently perhaps today the questions hung between them in the silence shepherd removed his spectacles the mist that was falling had sheened them lightly he rubbed them against the front of his jacket youve broken your glasses as well lynley noted they were st james saw held together across the bridge by a small piece of tape thats quite a bit of roughhousing with the dog up on cotes fell shepherd replaced them he dug in his pocket and brought out a set of keys he faced lynley squarely maggie spence has run off he said so if theres nothing else youd care to remark on inspector juliets expecting me shes a bit upset evidently you didnt tell her youd be going by the school to talk to maggie headmistress thought otherwise as i understand and you spoke with the girl alone is that how the yard operates these days touché st james thought the constable wasnt about to be intimidated he had weapons of his own and the nerve to use them did you look for a connection between them mr shepherd did you ever dig for a less salubrious truth than the one you came up with my investigation stood firm on its own he said clitheroe saw it that way coroner saw it that way whatever connection i may have failed to see ill put money on its linking someone else to his death not juliet spence now if youll excuse me he swung himself into the car and jammed the key into the ignition the engine roared the headlamps flared he ground the gears as he shifted to reverse lynley leaned into the car for another few words which st james couldnt hear beyond this with you as he pressed something into shepherds hand then the car slid down the driveway to the street the gears ground another time and the constable soared off lynley watched him go st james watched lynley his face was grim im not enough like my father lynley said he would have dragged him bodily into the street stepped on his face and probably broken six or eight of his fingers he did that once you know outside a pub in st just he was twentytwo someone had made fast and loose with augustas affections and he took care of the situation no one breaks my sisters heart he said that doesnt solve much no lynley sighed but ive always thought it would feel so damn good anything atavistic generally does for the moment its what follows that causes complications they went back down the drive where lynley picked up the odd bits carton perhaps a quarter of a mile down the road they could see the tail lights of the land rover gleaming shepherd had pulled to the verge for some reason his headlamps illuminated the gnarled form of a hedgerow they watched for a moment to see if he would drive on when he didnt they began their walk back to the inn what next st james asked london lynley said its the only direction i can think of at the moment as strongarming suspects doesnt appear to be something thats going to have any appreciable effect will you use havers speaking of strongarming lynley chuckled no ill have to see to it myself since ive sent her to truro on my credit cards i dont imagine shell be hellbent on getting down there and back in the customary twentyfour police hours id say three days with firstclass accommodations all the way no doubt so ill handle london what can we do to help enjoy your holiday take deborah on a drive cumbria perhaps the lakes thats a thought but i understand aspatrias quite nice in january st james smiled thats going to be one hell of a day trip well have to be up by fi ve youll owe me for this and if theres nothing to be uncovered about the spence woman there youll owe me in spades as always ahead of them a black cat slinked out from between two buildings something grey and limp between its jaws this the animal deposited on the pavement and began tapping gently in the mindlessly cruel way of all cats hoping for more tormenting play before a fi nal pounce ended the captives fruitless hope for survival as they approached the animal froze hunched over its prize fur bristling waiting st james glanced down to see a small rat blinking hopelessly from between the cats paws he thought about frightening the cat away the game of death it played was unnecessarily heartless but rats he knew were breeders of disease it was best if not most merciful to let the cat continue what would you have done had polly named shepherd st james asked arrested the bastard turned him over to clitheroe cid had his job and since she didnt name him ill have to come at it from another direction to step on his face metaphorically im my fathers own son in wish if not in deed its nothing im proud of but there it is so what did you give shepherd just before he drove off lynley adjusted the carton beneath his arm i gave him something to think about colin remembered with perfect clarity the final time his father had struck him he was sixteen years old foolish too hotheaded to think of the consequences of defi ance he had risen angrily and bodily to his mothers defence shoving his chair back from the dinner table he could still recall the sound it made as it scraped across the floor and slammed into the wall hed shouted just leave her alone pa and grabbed his fathers arms to keep him from slapping her face another time pas rage always took root in something inconsequential and because they never knew when to expect his anger to fl are into violence he was that much more terrifying anything could set him off the condition of a beef joint at dinner a button missing from his shirt a request for money to pay the gas bill a comment about the hour at which he had arrived home the previous night this particular evening it was a telephone call from colins biology master another exam failed lessons incomplete was there a problem at home mr tranville wondered his mother had revealed that much over the dinner table tentatively as if attempting to telegraph her husband a message she was unwilling to say in front of their child colins teacher asked if there were problems ken here at home he said counselling might which was as far as shed got pa said counselling did i hear you right counselling in a tone that should have told her that shed have been wiser to eat quietly and keep the telephone call to herself but instead she said he cant study ken if things are in chaos you see that dont you in a voice that pleaded for reason but only succeeded in betraying her fear pa thrived on fear he loved to feed twigs of intimidation into its fire he set down his knife first then his fork he pushed back his chair from the table he said tell me about all this chaos clare when she read his intentions and said she supposed it was nothing really his father said no tell me i want to hear when she didnt cooperate he got up he said answer me clare and when she said nothing do eat your meal ken he was on her hed only managed to strike her three times one hand twisted in her hair and the other smacking harder each time she cried out when colin grabbed him his fathers response was the same as it had been from colins childhood womens faces were meant to be abused with the open hand on boy children a real man used his fi sts the difference this time was that colin was bigger and while he was as afraid of his father as hed always been he was also angry anger and fear washed his body with adrenaline when pa struck him for the first time in his life colin struck back it had taken more than five minutes for his father to beat him into submission he did it with his fists his belt and his feet but when it was over the delicate balance of power had shifted and when colin said ill kill you next time you fi lthy bastard just see if i wont he saw for an instant reflected on his fathers face that he too was capable of inspiring fear it had been a source of pride to colin that his father had never struck his mother again that his mother had filed for divorce a month later and most of all that they were rid of the bastard because of him hed sworn hed never be like his father hed never again struck a living soul until polly on the side of the road leading out of winslough colin sat in the land rover and rolled between his palms the piece of material from pollys skirt which the inspector had pressed into his hand all of it had been such a pleasure feeling the sting of her flesh against his palm tearing the material so easily from her body tasting the salty sweat of her terror hearing her cries her pleas and especially her choked sob of pain no moan of sexual arousal now polly is this what you wanted is this how you hoped it would happen between us and finally accepting the triumph of her numb defeat he slammed into her he ploughed her he mastered her all the time saying cow bitch sow cunt in his fathers voice hed done it all in a storm of blind rage and desperation frantic to keep the memory and the truth of annie at bay colin pressed the piece of material to his closed eyes and tried not to think about either of them polly or his wife with annies dying hed crossed every line violated every code wandered in the dark and lost himself entirely somewhere between the valley of his worst depression and the desert of his blackest despair hed spent the years since her death caught between trying to rewrite the history of her torturous illness and trying to recall reinvent and resurrect the image of a marriage that was utterly perfect the resulting lie had been so much easier to face than the reality that when polly tried to obliterate it forever in the vicarage colin struck out in an effort to preserve it as much as in an attempt to hurt her hed always felt he could continue to cope and move forward in life as long as he had the falsehood it comprised what he called the sweetness of their relationship the sure knowledge that with annie hed had warmth and tenderness complete understanding compassion and love it also comprised an account of her illness one filled with the details of her noble suffering replete with illustrations of his efforts to save her and his eventual calm acceptance of the fact he could not the falsehood depicted him at her bedside holding her hand and trying to memorise the colour of her eyes before she closed them forever the falsehood declared that as life was taken from her in vicious bits and pieces her optimism never faltered and her spirit stayed whole youll forget all this people had said at the funeral given time youll remember only the beauty of what you had and you had two wonderful years with her colin so let time work its magic and watch what happens youll heal and look back and still have those two years it hadnt happened that way he hadnt healed hed simply rearranged his recollection of what the end had been like and how theyd got there in his revised version of their history annie had accepted her fate with grace and dignity while he had been unfailing in his support of her gone from memory were her descents into bitterness excised from existence was his implacable rage in the place of these was a new reality that masked everything he couldnt face how he hated her in moments as much as he loved her how he despised his marriage vows how he embraced her death as his only possible escape from a life that he could not bear and how in the end all they had to share in a marriage that had once been joyful was the fact of her illness and the daytoday horror of having to cope with it make it different he had thought after she had died make me better than i was and he had used the past six years to do so seeking oblivion instead of forgiveness he rubbed the gauzy material against his face feeling it snag on the scratches that pollys nails had left it was stiff in places with pollys blood and musty with the scent of her bodys secrets im sorry he whispered polly hed been steadfast in his unwillingness to face polly yarkin because of what she represented she knew the facts she also forgave them but her knowledge alone made her the single contagion he had to avoid if he was to continue to live with himself she couldnt see this fact she was incapable of grasping the importance of their leading completely separate lives she saw only her love for him and her longing to make him whole once again if shed only been able to understand that theyd shared too much of annie ever to be able to share each other she would have learned to accept the limitations hed imposed upon their relationship after his wifes death accepting these she would have allowed him to go his own way without her ultimately she would have rejoiced in his love for juliet and thus robin sage would still be alive colin knew what had happened and how she had done it he understood why if keeping the knowledge to himself was the only way he could make amends to polly he would do that scotland yard would unravel the skein of events in good time once they looked into her access to cotes fell he would not betray her while he himself bore so much responsibility for what she had done he drove on unlike the previous night all the lights were on in the cottage when he pulled to a stop in the courtyard of cotes hall juliet ran out as he opened the car door she was struggling into her pea jacket a redandgreen scarf dangled from her arm like a banner thank god she said i thought id go mad with the waiting sorry he got out of the land rover those blokes from scotland yard stopped me as i was leaving she hesitated you why theyd been to the vicarage she buttoned the coat wrapped the scarf round her neck she fished gloves from her pocket and began drawing them on yes well ive them to thank for this dont i theyll be off soon i expect the inspectors got the wind up about the vicar going to london the day before heyou know the day before he died hell no doubt be on the trail of that next and then on the trail of something else afterwards thats how it goes with these types so he wont be bothering maggie again oh god juliet was looking at her hands taking too much time about adjusting the gloves she was smoothing the leather against each finger in an uneven motion that betrayed her anxiety ive phoned the police in clitheroe but they couldnt be bothered to take me seriously shes thirteen years old they said shes only been gone for three hours madam shell turn up by nine kids always do but they dont colin you know it they dont always turn up and not in this case maggie wont i dont even know where to begin looking for her josie said she ran off from the schoolyard nick went after her i must fi nd her he took her arm ill find her for you

youll want to be able to fetch her wont you i cant just wait here youve no choice and you dont understand youre trying to be kind i know that but listen she isnt going to phone the inspectors been

find her i promise you now go back inside no please its the only way juliet he led her towards the house he could feel her resistance he opened the door stay by the phone he filled her head with lies she said colin wheres she gone she has no money no food shes got only her school coat to keep her warm its not heavy enough its cold and god knows she cant have got far and remember shes with nick hell watch out for her but if they hitchhikedif someone picked them up my god they could be in manchester by now or liverpool he ran his fingers against her temples her great dark eyes were tearfi lled and frightened sssh he whispered let the panic go love i said ill find her and i will you can trust me on that you can trust me on anything gentle now rest he loosened her scarf and unbuttoned her coat he caressed the line of her jaw with his knuckles you make her some dinner and keep it warm on the cooker shell be eating it sooner than you can know i promise he touched her lips and her cheeks promise she swallowed colin promise you can trust me i know that youre so good to us as i mean to be forever he kissed her gently will you be all right now love iyes ill wait i wont leave she lifted his hand pressed it against her lips then her forehead creased she drew him into the light of the entry youve hurt yourself she said colin what have you done to your face nothing that you need to worry about he said ever and he kissed her again when shed watched him drive off when the sound of the rovers engine faded and was replaced by the night wind creaking in the trees juliet let the pea jacket fall from her shoulders and left it in a heap by the front cottage door she dropped her scarf on top of it she kept on her gloves these she examined they were made of old leather lined with rabbit fur the skin feathersmooth with the years she had worn them a thread unravelling along the inner right wrist she pressed them against her cheeks the leather was cool but she could feel nothing of her faces temperature through the gloves so it was much like being touched by someone else like having her face cupped with tenderness with love with amusement or with anything else that hinted remotely at romantic attachment thats what had started all this in the fi rst place her need for a man shed managed to avoid the need for years by keeping herself and her daughter isolated just mummy and maggie taking on the human race in one part of the country or another shed diverted both the interior longing and the dull pain of desire by throwing her energies into maggie because maggie was what her life was all about juliet knew she had bought and paid for this nights anguish in coin she had minted from a part of her makeup that had never failed to give her grief wanting a man hungering to touch the hard fierce angles of his body longing to lie beneath him to straddle or to kneel and to feel that moments delight in their bodies joiningthese were the voids that had started her on this current path to disaster so it was utterly fitting that physical desire which she had never been able to eradicate completely no matter how many years she refused to acknowledge it should be what had brought her to losing maggie tonight there were dozens of if onlys barking in her head but she fastened on one of them because although she wanted to do so she couldnt lie to herself about its importance she had to accept her involvement with colin as the prime mover behind everything that had happened with maggie shed heard about him from polly long before shed ever seen him and shed thought herself secure in the belief that since polly was herself in love with the man since he was so many years her own junior since she rarely saw him indeed since she rarely saw anyone now that theyd found what shed come to believe was an ideal location to get on with their lives at last she stood little chance of involvement or attachment even when he came to the cottage that day on his offi cial business and she saw him parked by the lavender on the lane and read the bleak despair on his face and recalled pollys story about his wife even when she felt the ice of her detached composure receive its first rift in the face of his sorrow and for the first time in years she recognised a strangers pain shed not considered the danger he presented to the weakness in herself that she believed she had mastered it was only when he was inside the cottage and she saw him looking round at the frivolous fittings of the kitchen with such illdisguised yearning that she felt her heart stir at first getting ready to pour them each a glass of her homemade wine shed looked round herself to try to understand what was moving him she knew it couldnt be the superficials cooker table chairs cupboards and she wondered at the fact that the rest might be touching him in some way could a man be moved by a rack of spices african violets in the window jars on the work top two loaves of bread left to cool a rack of washed dishes a tea towel hanging from a drawer to dry or was it the fi ngerpainted and oftmoved picture affixed with blutack to the wall above the cooker two skirtwearing stick figures one with breasts that looked like lumps of coal surrounded by fl owers as tall as themselves and surmounted by the words i love you mummy in a fi veyearolds hand hed looked at it looked at her looked away and finally didnt seem to know where to look at all poor man she had thought and that had been her downfall she knew about his wife she began to speak and shed not been able to turn back from that moment sometime during their conversation shed thought just this once oh god to have a man that way just this once one more time hes so hurting and if i control it if im the one if its only his pleasure with no thought of my own can it be such a wrong and as he asked her about the shotgun and why she had used it and how she had watched his eyes she answered keeping everything brief and to the point and when he would have left all information having been gathered and thank you madam for your time she decided to show him the pistol to keep him from going she shot it and waited for him to react to take it from her to touch her hand as he removed it from her grip but he wouldnt he kept the distance between them and she realised with a sudden dawning of wonder that he was thinking those very same words just this once oh god just this once it wouldnt be love she decided because she was those ugly gaping ten years older than he because they didnt even know each other and had not spoken before this day because the religion shed long ago forsaken declared that love didnt grow from allowing the needs of the flesh to dominate the needs of the soul she held on to those thoughts as that fi rst afternoon together wore on believing herself safe from loving this would just be for pleasure she decided and then it would be forgotten she should have recognised the extent of the danger he represented when she looked at the clock on her bedside table and realised that more than four hours had passed and shed not even thought about maggie she should have ended it there the moment guilt rushed in to replace the sleepy peace that accompanied her orgasms she should have closed her heart and cut him out of her life with something abrupt and potentially hurtful like youre almost a decent fuck for a copper but instead shed said oh my god and hed known hed said ive been selfish youre worried about your daughter let me clear out ive kept you far too long ive when he stopped speaking she didnt look his way but she felt his hand graze her arm i dont know how to name what i felt he said or what i feel except that being with you like thatit wasnt enough its not even enough now i dont know what that means she should have said drily it means you were randy constable we both were we still are in fact but she didnt she listened to him dressing and tried to work up something curt and unmistakably final with which to dismiss him when he sat on the edge of the bed and turned her to him with his face caught somewhere between wonder and fear she had the opportunity to draw the line but she didnt instead she listened to him say can i love you this quickly juliet spence just like that in an afternoon can my life change like that and because she knew more than anything else that life can change irrevocably in the instant one is forced to realise its malicious caprice she said yes but dont what love me or let your life change he didnt understand he couldnt really he thought perhaps she was being coy he said no one has control over that and when his hand moved slowly down her body and her body rose eagerly to meet it against her will she knew he was right he phoned her that night long after midnight saying i dont know what this is i dont know what to call it i thought if i heard your voicebecause ive never feltbut thats what men say isnt it ive never felt like this before so let me get into your knickers and test the feeling out another time or two and its that i wont lie but it goes beyond and i dont know why she had played the fool in the biggest way because she loved being loved by a man even maggie couldnt stop her not with her whitefaced knowledge unspoken when she entered the cottage not five minutes after colins initial departure with her cat in her arms and her cheeks freshscrubbed from where shed been brushing tears away not with her silent appraisal of colin when he came to dinner or took them for hikes with his dog on the moors not with her shrill pleas not to be left alone when juliet went for an hour or two to be with colin in his house maggie couldnt stop her and she didnt really need to do so because juliet knew there was no hope of permanency she understood from the first that each minute was a memory stored against a future in which he and the love of him had no place she merely forgot that while she had lived for the moment for so many years on the edge of a tomorrow that always promised to bring the worst upon them shed made sure to create a life for maggie that appeared normal so maggies fears of colins permanent intrusion were real to explain to her that they were also groundless would be to tell her things that would destroy her world and while juliet couldnt bring herself to do that she couldnt bring herself to let colin go either another week she would think please god just give me another week with him and ill end it between us i promise i will so she had bought this evening how well she knew it like mother like daughter in the end juliet thought maggies sex with nick ware was more than just an adolescents way of striking back at her mother it was more than just a search for a man she could call daddy in the darkest part of her mind it was the blood in her veins declaring itself at last yet juliet knew that she might have been able to forestall the inevitable had she herself not taken up with colin and given her daughter an example to follow juliet drew off the leather gloves a fi nger at a time and dropped them onto the pea jacket and scarf that lay heaped on the fl oor she went not to the kitchen to prepare a dinner that her daughter wouldnt eat but to the stairs she paused at the bottom with one hand on the banister trying to gather the energy to climb this stairway was a duplication of so many others over the years worn carpeting on the flooring nothing on the walls she had always thought of pictures on the walls as one more thing to have to remove when they left a cottage so there never seemed to be a point to hanging any up in the fi rst place keep it plain keep it simple keep it functional following that credo she had always refused to decorate in a way that might encourage affection for a set of rooms in which they lived she wanted there to be no sense of loss when they moved on another adventure shed called each move lets see whats what in northumberland shed tried to make a game out of running it was only when shed stopped running that shed lost she mounted the stairs a perfect sphere of dread seemed to be growing beneath her heart why did she run juliet wondered what did they tell her what does she know the door to maggies room was partially closed and she swung it open moonlight shone through the branches of the lime tree outside the window and fell in a wavy pattern across the bed on this maggies cat was curled head buried deeply between his paws feigning sleep so that juliet would take pity and not displace him punkin had been the first compromise juliet had made with maggie please please cn i have a kitten mummy had been such a simple request to grant what she had not understood at the time was that seeing the joy of one small wish granted led inexorably to the longing to grant others theyd been little nothings at fi rst a dossround with her girlfriends a trip to lancaster with josie and her mum but theyd led to a budding sense of belonging that maggie had never experienced before in the end they had led to the request to stay which along with everything else led to nick to the vicar and to this night juliet sat on the edge of the bed and switched on the light punkin buried his head deeper in his paws although the tip of his tail twitched once to betray him juliet ran her hand over his head and along the mobile curve of his spine he wasnt as clean as he ought to be he spent too much time prowling about the wood another six months and hed no doubt be more feral than tame instinct after all was instinct on the floor next to maggies bed lay her thick scrapbook its cover worn and cracked and its pages so dogeared that their edges were crumbling to flakes in places juliet picked it up and rested it on her lap a gift for her sixth birthday it had maggies important events printed in large block letters in her own hand on the first page juliet could tell by the feel of the book that most of the pages were full shed never looked through it before it had seemed too like an invasion of maggies small private world but she looked through it now driven not so much by curiosity as by a need to feel her daughters presence and to understand the first part comprised childhood mementos a tracing of a large hand with a smaller one traced inside it and the words mumy and me scrawled below a fanciful composition about my doggie fred upon which a teacher had written and what a lovely pet he must be margaret across the top a programme for a christmas music recital at which she had been part of a chorus of children who sang very badly but ambitiously the alleluia chorus from handels messiah a secondplace ribbon from a science project on plants and scores of pictures and postcards of their camping holidays together on the hebrides on holy island far from the crowds in the lake district juliet flipped through the pages she touched her fingertips to the drawing traced the edge of the ribbon and studied each picture of her daughters face this was a real history of their lives a collection that spoke of what she and her daughter had managed to build upon a foundation of sand the second part of the scrapbook however spoke of the cost of having lived that same history it comprised a collection of newspaper clippings and magazine articles about automobile racing interspersed among these were photographs of men for the first time juliet saw that he died in a car crash darling had assumed heroic proportions in maggies imagination and from juliets reticence on the subject had sprung a father whom maggie could love her fathers were the winners at indianapolis at monte carlo at le mans they spun out in flames on a track in italy but they walked away with their heads held high they lost wheels they crashed they broke open champagne and waved trophies in the air they all shared the single quality of being alive juliet closed the book and rested her hands on its cover it was all about protection she said inside her head to a maggie who wasnt there when youre a mother maggie the last thing you can bear of all the things that you have to bear anyway is losing your child you can bear just about anything else and you usually have to at one time or another losing your possessions your home your job your lover your husband even your way of life but losing a child is what will break you so you dont take risks that might lead to the loss because youre always aware that the one risk you take might be the one that will cause all the horrors in the world to sweep into your life you dont know this yet darling because you havent experienced that moment when the twisting squeezing crush of your muscles and the urge to expel and to scream at once results in this small mass of humanity that squalls and breathes and comes to rest against your stomach naked to your nakedness dependent upon you blind at that moment hands instinctively trying to clutch and once you close those fingers round one of your ownno not even thenonce you look at this life that youve created you know youll do anything suffer anything to protect it mostly for its own sake you protect of course because all it is really is living breathing need but partly you protect it for your own and that is the greatest of my sins darling maggie i reversed the process and i lied in doing it because i couldnt face the immensity of loss but ill tell the truth now here and to you what i did i did partly for you my daughter but what i did all those years ago i did mostly for myself chapter twentytwo i dont think we should stop yet nick maggie said as stoutly as she could manage her jaw hurt awfully from locking her teeth together to keep them from chattering and the tips of her fingers were numb despite the fact that shed kept her hands balled into her pockets for most of the journey she was tired of walking and muscleweary from leaping behind hedges over walls or into ditches whenever they heard the sound of a car but it was still relatively early although it was dark and she knew that in darkness lay their best hope of escape theyd kept off the road whenever possible heading southwest towards blackpool the going was rough on both farmland and moors but nick wouldnt hear of setting foot to pavement until theyd put clitheroe a good fi ve miles behind them even then he wouldnt hear of taking the main road to longridge where the plan was they would get a ride in a lorry to blackpool instead he said they would stick to the twisty turny back lanes skirting by farms through hamlets and over fields when necessary the route he was taking made longridge miles and miles farther away but it was safer this way and shed be glad theyd taken it in longridge he said no one would look at them twice but until then they had to keep off the road she didnt have a watch but she knew it couldnt be much more than eight or half past it seemed later but that was because they were tired it was cold and the food nick had managed to bring back to the car park from the town had long since been consumed there had been little enough of it in the fi rst place what could one reasonably be expected to purchase with less than three pounds and while theyd divided it evenly between them and talked about making it last until morning theyd eaten the crisps fi rst moved on to the apples to quench their thirst and devoured the small package of biscuits to answer their craving for a sweet nick had been smoking steadily since that time to take the edge off his hunger maggie had tried to ignore her own which had been easy enough to do since it was more than convenient to concentrate on the bitter cold instead her ears ached with it nick was clambering over a drystone wall when maggie said again its too early to stop nick we havent gone nearly far enough wherere you going anyway he pointed to three squares of yellow light some distance across the field in which he stood on the other side of the wall farm he said theyll have a barn we can doss there in a barn he brushed back his hair whatd you think mag we dont have any money we cant exactly get a room somewhere can we but i thought she hesitated squinting at the lights what had she thought get away run off never again see anyone but nick stop thinking stop wondering find a place to hide he was waiting he dug inside his jacket and brought out his marlboros he shook the pack against his hand the last cigarette popped into his palm he began to crumple the pack and maggie said prhaps you ought to save the last one for later you know nah he crushed the pack and dropped it he lit up as she picked her way up the loose stones and over the wall she rescued the pack from the weeds and carefully smoothed it folded it and put it into her pocket trail she said in explanation if theyre looking for us we dont want to leave a trail do we if theyre looking he nodded right come on then he grabbed her hand and headed in the direction of the lights but whyre we stopping now she asked once again its too early dont you think he looked at the night sky at the position of the moon perhaps he said and smoked thoughtfully for a moment look well rest up here a while and doss somewhere else later arent you feeling clapped out dont you want to have a sit she did only she was also feeling that if she sat anywhere she might not be able to get back up her school shoes werent the best for walking and she thought that once her head sent her feet the false message that their evenings walk was at an end her feet mightnt cooperate in setting off again in an hour or so i dont know she shivered and you need to warm up he said decisively and began to lead her towards the lights the field they walked across was pasture the ground uneven it was littered with sheep droppings that looked like shadows against the frost maggie stepped into a pile of these felt her shoe slither among them and nearly went down nick righted her with a mag you got to watch for the muck and then he added with a laugh lucky they dont have cows here he clasped her arm and offered her a share of his cigarette she took it politely sucked in on it and blew the smoke through her nose you cn have the rest she said he seemed glad to do so he picked up their pace to cross the pasture but slowed abruptly as they neared the other side a large fl ock of sheep were huddled together against the pastures far wall like mounds of dirty snow in the darkness nick said in a low voice something that seemed to be hey ah ishhhh as they slowly closed in on the fl ocks perimeter he extended his hand before him as if in response the animals jostled one another to allow nick and maggie passage but they neither panicked bleated nor began to move off you know what to do maggie said and felt a tingle behind her eyes nick why dyou always know just what to do its only sheep mag but you know i love that about you nick you know the right thing he looked towards the farmhouse it stood beyond a paddock and another set of walls i know with sheep he said not only sheep she said truly he crouched next to the wall easing a ewe to one side maggie crouched next to him he rolled his cigarette between his fi ngers and after a moment drew a long breath as if to speak she waited for his words then said herself what he shook his head his hair fell forward across his forehead and cheek and he concentrated solely on fi nishing his cigarette maggie clasped his arm and leaned against him it was pleasant here with the wool and the breath of the animals to warm them she could almost think of staying the night in this very spot she raised her head stars she said i always wished i could name them but all i ever could fi nd was the north star because its brightest its she twisted round it should be she frowned if longridge was to the west of clitheroe with just the smallest jog to the south the north star should bewhere was its bright shining nick she said slowly i cant find the north star are we lost lost i think were going in the wrong direction because the north star isnt where we cant go by the stars mag we have to go by the land what dyou mean how dyou know what direction youre heading in if you go by the land because i know because ive lived here forever we cant go climbing up and down fells in the middle of the night which is what wed be doing if we headed direct west we have to go round them but he crushed his cigarette against the sole of his shoe he stood come on he climbed the wall and reached back over to hold her hand as she did the same he said weve got to be quiet now therell be dogs they slipped across the paddock in near silence the only noise coming from their shoe soles crackling against the frostcovered ground at the last wall nick hunched over raised his head slowly and examined the area maggie watched him from below hunkered against the wall gripping her knees barns on the far side of the yard he said looks like solid muck though its going to be messy hold on to me tight any dogs i cant see but theyll be about but nick if they bark or chase us whatll dont worry come on he climbed over she followed scraping her knee across the very top stone and feeling the corresponding rip in her tights she gave a little mewl when she felt the quick heat of abrasion against her skin but to feel a scratch was baby business at this point she allowed herself neither a wince nor a hobble as she dropped to the ground it was thick with bracken along the edge of the wall but rutted and muckfilled as it gave onto the farmyard itself once they left the protective cushion of the bracken each step they took smicksmacked loudly with suction maggie felt her feet sinking into the muck felt the muck seeping over the sides of her shoes she shuddered she was whispering nick my feet keep getting stuck when the dogs appeared they announced themselves by yapping first then three border collies tore across the farmyard from the outbuildings barking wildly and baring their teeth nick shoved maggie behind him the dogs slithered to a stop less than six feet away snapping snarling and ready to spring nick held out his hand maggie whispered nick no and watched the farmhouse fearfully waiting for the door to crash open and the farmer himself to come storming out hed be shouting and red in the face and angry hed phone the police they were trespassing after all the dogs began to howl nick nick squatted he said heyo come on you funny blokes you cant scare me and he whistled to them softly it was just like magic the dogs quieted stepped forward sniffed his hand and within an instant became old friends nick petted them in turn laughing quietly tugging at their ears you wont hurt us will you funny old blokes in answer they wagged their tails and one of them licked nicks face when nick stood they surrounded him happily and acted as escort into the yard maggie looked round at the dogs in wonder as she carefully sloshed through the mud howd you do that nick he took her hand its only dogs mag the old stone barn was a section of one elongated building and it stood across the yard from the house it directly abutted a narrow cottage on whose fi rst floor a curtained window was lit this had probably been the original farm building a granary with a cartshed beneath it the granary had been converted sometime in the past to house a worker and his family and its living quarters were gained by means of a stairway that led up to a cracked red door above which a sole bulb was now glowing beneath lay the cartshed with its single unglazed window and its gaping arch of a door nick looked from the cartshed to the barn the latter was enormous an ancient cowhouse that was falling into disuse moonlight illumined its sagging roofline its uneven row of pitching eyes on the upper storey and its large wooden doors with their gaps and their warping as the dogs sniffed round their shoes and as maggie hugged herself against the cold and waited for him to lead her onward nick appeared to evaluate the possibilities and finally slogged through a heavier patch of muck towards the cartshed arent there people up there maggie whispered pointing to the quarters above it i spose well just have to be real quiet itll be warmer in here the barns too big and its facing the wind come on he led her beneath the stairway where the arched door gave entrance into the cartshed inside the light from above the labourers front door at the top of the stairs provided a meagre matchstrength illumination through the cartsheds single window the dogs followed them milling about what was apparently their sleeping quarters for several chewedup blankets lay in a corner on the stone fl oor and the dogs went there eventually where they sniffed pawed and sank into the pungent wool the cold outside seemed to magnify in the stone walls and floor of the shed maggie tried to comfort herself with the thought that it was just like where the baby jesus was born except there hadnt been any dogs there as far as she could recall from her limited knowledge of christmas stories but odd squeakings and rustlings from the deep pockets of darkness in the corners of the shed made her uneasy she could see that the shed was used for storage there were big burlap sacks piled along one wall dirty buckets tools she couldnt have named a bicycle a wooden rocking chair with its wicker seat missing and a toilet lying on its side against the far wall stood a dusty chest of drawers and nick went to this he shimmied open the top drawer and said with some excitement in his voice hey look at this mag weve had ourselves some luck she picked her way through the debris on the floor out of the drawer he was taking a blanket and then another they were both large and fluffy they seemed perfectly clean nick shoved the drawer partially closed the wood howled the dogs lifted their heads maggie held her breath and listened for a betraying movement in the labourers quarters above them dimly she could hear someone talking a man then a woman followed by dramatic music and the sound of gunfi re but no one came in search of them the telly nick said were safe he cleared a space on the floor spread the first blanket down doubling it up to serve as both cushion against the stones and insulation against the cold and beckoned her to join him the second he wrapped round them saying thisll work for now feel warmer mag and drew her close she did feel warmer at once although she fingered the blanket and smelled the fresh lavender scent of it with a twinge of doubt she said why do they keep their blankets out here theyll get messed up wont they wont they get rotten or something who cares its our luck and their loss isnt it here lie down nice that isnt it warmer mag the rustlings along the wall seemed louder now that she was at the level of the fl oor they also seemed accompanied by an occasional squeak she burrowed closer to nick and said whats that noise then i said the telly i mean the otherthatthere did you hear it oh that barn rats i expect she flew up rats nick no i cant pleaseim afraid ofnick shh they wont bother you come on lie down but rats if they bite you you die and i were bigger than they are theyre lots more scared they wont even come out but my hairi read once where they like to collect hair to make up their nests ill keep them away from you he urged her down next to him and lay on his side use my arm for a pillow he said they wont climb up my arm to get you jeez mag youre shaking here get close youll be okay we wont stay here long just for a rest promise yeah promise come on its cold he unzipped his bomber jacket and held it open here double warmth with a fearful glance in the direction of the deepest pool of darkness where the barn rats skittered among the burlap sacks she lowered herself onto the blanket into the confi nes of nicks bomber jacket she felt stiff with both the cold and her fear uneasy with their proximity to people the dogs hadnt roused anyone that was true but if the farmer made a final round of the yard prior to going to bed theyd likely be found nick kissed her head okay he said its just for a while just for a rest okay she slipped her arms round him and let her body warm from his and from the blanket that covered them she kept her thoughts away from the rats and instead pretended that they were in their very fi rst flat together she and nick it was their offi cial first night like a honeymoon the room was small but the moonlight gleamed against the walls pretty rosebud paper there were prints hanging on them watercolours of frolicking dogs and cats and punkin lay at the foot of the bed she moved closer to nick she was wearing a beautiful fulllength gown of pale pink satin with lace on the straps and along the bodice her hair flowed round her and perfume rose from the hollow of her throat and behind her ears and between her breasts he was wearing dark blue pyjamas of silk and she could feel his bones his muscles and the strength of him along the length of her body he would want to do it of course he would always want to do it and she would always want to do it as well because it was so close and so nice mag nick said lie still dont im not doing anything you are im just getting closer its cold you said we cant not here okay she pressed against him she could feel it in his trousers despite his words it was already hard she slithered her hand between their bodies mag its nothing but warmness she whispered and rubbed it just the way hed taught her mag i said no his answering whisper was fi erce but you like it dont you she squeezed it released it mag get off she ran her hand its length no damn mag leave it be she recoiled when he knocked her hand away and felt quick tears come in answer i only she ached when she breathed it was nice wasnt it i wanted to be nice in the dim light he looked like something was hurting inside him he said it is nice youre nice but that makes me want to and we cant right now we cant okay here lie down i wanted to be close we are close mag come on let me hold you he urged her back down it feels good just like this lying here you and me i only wanted shh its okay its nothing he opened her coat and slipped his arm round her its nice just like this he whispered against her hair he moved his hand to her back and began caressing the length of her spine but i only wanted shh see its just as nice like this isnt it just holding like this his fi ngers pressed in long slow circles stopping at the small of her back where they remained a tender pressure that relaxed and relaxed and relaxed her completely she finally slipped protected and loved into sleep it was the dogs movement that awakened her they were up about and dashing outside at the sound of a vehicle coming into the farmyard by the time they were barking she was sitting up fully awake aware that she was alone on the blanket she clutched it to her and whispered nick frantically he materialised from the darkness by the window the light from above was no longer shining she had no idea how long she had slept someones here he said unnecessarily police no he glanced back at the window i think its my dad your dad but how i dont know come here be quiet they gathered up the blankets and crept to one side of the window the dogs were sending up enough noise to announce the second coming and lights were snapping on outside hey there enough someone shouted roughly a few more barks and the dogs were silent what is it whos there footsteps sloshed across the yard conversation ensued maggie strained to hear it but the voices were low a woman said quietly is it frank at a distance and a childs voice cried mummy i want to see maggie pulled the blanket closer round her she clutched on to nick where cn we go nick can we run just be quiet he ought todamn what but she heard it herself you dont mind if i have a look round do you not at all two of them you said it was a boy and a girl theyd be wearing school uniforms the boy might have had a bomber jacket on never saw a hair of anything like that but go on and have a look let me get my boots on and ill join you need a torch got one thanks footsteps went in the direction of the barn maggie grabbed nicks jacket lets go nick now we can run to the wall we can hide in the pasture we can what about the dogs what theyll follow and give us away besides the other bloke said he was going to help in the search nick turned from the window and looked around the shed our best hope is to hide out in here hide out how where move the sacks get behind them but the rats no choice come on youve got to help the farmer began to tromp across the yard in the direction of nicks father as they dropped their blankets and started pulling the sacks away from the wall they heard nicks father call out nothing in the barn and the other man say have a go with the shed here and the sound of their approach spurred maggie into a fury of pulling sacks far enough from the wall to create a burrow of safety she had retreated within it nick had as well when the light from a torch beamed in through the window doesnt look like nothing nicks father said a second light joined the first the shed became brighter the dogs sleep in here cant say as id want to join them even if i was on the run his torch clicked off maggie let out her breath she heard footsteps in the muck then best to have a closer look though and the light reappeared stronger and shining from the doorway a dogs whine accompanied the sound of wet boots slapping on the floor of the shed nails ticked against the stones and approached the sacks maggie said no in despair without making any sound and felt nick move a step closer heres something the farmer said someones messed with that chest those blankets belong there on the fl oor cant say they do the light darted round the room corners to ceiling it glinted off the discarded toilet and shone on the dust on the rocking chair it came to rest on the top of the sacking and illuminated the wall above maggies head ah the farmer said here weve got it step out here in the open youngsters step out now or ill send the dogs in to help you make up your minds nick his father said that you lad have you got the girl with you come out of there now maggie rose first trembling blinking into the torchlight trying to say please dont be angry with nick mr ware he only wanted to help me but beginning to weep instead thinking dont send me home i dont want to go home mr ware said what in gods name were you thinking of nick get out here with you jesus christ i ought to beat you silly you know how worried your mums been lad nick was turning his head eyes narrowed against the light that his father was shining into his face sorry he said mr ware harumphed sorry wont go far to mend your fences with me you know youre trespassing here you know these people couldve had the police after you whatre you thinking of havent you no better sense than that and what were you planning to do with this girl nick shifted his weight silent youre filthy mr ware shone the light up and down god almighty just look at the sight of you you look like a tramp no please maggie cried rubbing her wet nose against the sleeve of her coat it isnt nick its me he was only helping me mr ware harumphed again and clicked off his torch the farmer did likewise hed been standing to one side holding the light in their direction but otherwise looking out the window when mr ware said out to the car with both of you then the farmer scooped up the two blankets from the fl oor and followed them out the dogs were milling round mr wares old nova snuffling at the tyres and the ground alike the exterior lights were shining from the house and in their glow maggie could see the condition of her clothes for the fi rst time they were crusted with mud and streaked with dirt in places the lichen from the walls shed climbed over had deposited patches of greygreen slime her shoes were clotted with muck out of which sprouted bracken and straw the sight was a stimulus for a new onslaught of tears what had she been thinking where were they supposed to go looking like this with no money no clothing and no plan to guide them what had she been thinking she clutched nicks arm as they slogged to the car she sobbed im sorry nick its my fault ill tell your mummy you didnt mean harm ill explain i will get in the car the both of you mr ware said gruffly well do our deciding about whos at fault later he opened the drivers door and said to the farmer its frank ware im at skelshaw farm up winslough direction im in the book if you discover this lot did any damage to your place the farmer nodded but said nothing he shuffled his feet in the muck and looked as if he wished theyd be off he was saying funny blokes out of the way to the dogs when the farmhouse door opened a child of perhaps six years old stood framed in the light in her nightgown and slippers she giggled and waved calling uncle frank lo wont you let nickie stay the night with us please her mother dashed into the doorway and pulled her back casting a frantic and apologetic look towards the car maggie slowed then stopped she turned to nick she looked from him to his father to the farmer she saw the resemblance fi rst how their hair grew the same although the colour was different how their noses each had a bump on the bridge how they held their heads and then she saw the rest the dogs the blankets the direction theyd been walking nicks insistence that they rest at this particular farm his form at the window standing and waiting when she had awakened her insides went so calm that at fi rst she thought her heart had stopped beating her face was still wet but her tears disappeared she stumbled once in the muck grabbed the novas door handle and felt nick take her arm from somewhere that sounded like a thousand miles away she heard him say her name she heard him say please mag listen i didnt know what else but then fog filled her head and she didnt hear the rest she climbed into the rear seat of the car directly in her line of vision a pile of old roof slates lay beneath a tree and she focussed on them they were large much bigger than shed imagined they would be and they looked like tombstones she counted them slowly one two three and was up to a dozen when she felt the car dip as mr ware got into it and as nick climbed in and sat next to her on the rear seat she could tell he was looking at her but it didnt matter she continued counting thirteen fourteen fi fteen why did nicks uncle have so many slates and why did he keep them under the tree sixteen seventeen eighteen nicks father was unrolling his window ta kev he said quietly dont give it a thought all right the other man came to the car and leaned against it he spoke to nick sorry lad he said we couldnt get the lass to go to bed once she heard you were on your way shes that fond of you she is sokay nick said his uncle slapped his two hands down on the door in farewell nodded sharply and stepped back from the car funny blokes he called to the dogs away with you the car lurched round in the farmyard made a slippery turn and set off towards the road mr ware turned on the radio he said kindly what dyou fancy youngsters but maggie shook her head and looked out the side window nick said anything dad it doesnt matter and maggie felt the truth of those words pierce through her calm and drip like cold bits of lead into her stomach nicks hand touched her tentatively she fl inched im sorry he said softly i didnt know what else to do we didnt have any money we didnt have any place to go i couldnt think what to do to take care of you proper you said you would she said dully last night you said you would but i didnt think it would be she saw his hand close round his knee mag listen i cant take care of you proper if i dont go to school i want to be a vet i got to get through school and then well be together but i got to you lied i didnt you phoned your dad from clitheroe when you went to buy the food you told him where wed be didnt you he said nothing which was affirmation enough the nighttime scenery slipped by the window stone walls gave way to the bony frames of hedges farmland gave way to open country across the moors the fells rose like lancashires black guardians against the sky mr ware had turned the cars heater on along with the radio but maggie had never felt so cold she felt colder than she had when they were walking in the fields colder than she had on the floor of the cartshed she felt colder than she had on the previous night in josies lair with her clothes half off and nick inside her and the meaningless promises hed made creating fi re between them the end was where the beginning had been with her mother when mr ware pulled into the courtyard of cotes hall the front door opened and juliet spence came out maggie heard nick whisper urgently mag wait but she pushed the car door open her head felt so heavy that she couldnt lift it nor could she walk she heard mummy approach her good boots clicking against the cobbles she waited for what she didnt know the anger the lecture the punishment it didnt really matter whatever it was it couldnt touch her nothing would ever touch her now juliet said in a curiously hushed voice maggie mr ware explained maggie heard phrases like took her to his unclesbit of a walk hungry id guesstired as the dickens kids dont know what to make of them sometimes juliet cleared her throat said thank you i dont quite know what i would have done ifthank you frank i dont think they meant real harm mr ware said no juliet said no im sure they didnt the car reversed turned and headed down the lane still maggies head drooped with its own weight three more clicks sounded on the cobbles and she could see the tops of her mothers boots maggie she couldnt look up she was fi lled with lead she felt a whispery touch on her hair and she withdrew from it fearfully taking a gasping indrawn breath what is it her mother sounded puzzled more than puzzled she sounded afraid maggie couldnt understand how that could be for the power had shifted once again and the worst had happened she was alone with her mother with no escape her eyes got blurry and a sob was building down deep inside her she fought against letting it out juliet stepped away come inside maggie she said its cold youre shivering she began to walk towards the cottage maggie raised her head she was fl oating in nowhere nick was gone and mummy was walking away there was nothing to grab on to any longer there was no safe harbour in which she could rest the sob built and burst her mother stopped talk to me juliet said her voice was desperate and uneven sounding youve got to talk to me youve got to tell me what happened youve got to say why you ran we cant go any further with each other until you do and if you dont were lost they stood apart her mother on the doorstep maggie in the courtyard to maggie it seemed that they were separated by miles she wanted to move closer but she didnt know how she couldnt see her mothers face clearly enough to know if it was safe she couldnt tell whether her voices quiver meant sorrow or rage maggie darling please and juliets voice broke talk to me im begging you her mothers anguish it seemed so real tore a little hole in maggies heart she said on a sob nick promised he would take care of me mummy he said he loved me he said i was special he said we were special but he lied and he had his dad come get us and he didnt tell me and all the time i thought she wept she wasnt quite sure what the source of her grief really was any longer except that she had nowhere to go and no one to trust and she needed something someone an anchor a home im so sorry darling what a kindness sounded in those four words it was easier to continue in their echo he pretended to tame the dogs and to fi nd some blankets and the rest of the story came tumbling out the london policeman the afterschool talk the whispers and rumbles and gossip and finally so i was afraid of what maggie couldnt put the rest into words she stood in the courtyard with the night wind whistling through her filthy clothes and she couldnt move forward and she couldnt go back because there was no back as she knew quite well and going forward meant devastation but apparently she would not need to go anywhere for juliet said oh my god maggie and seemed to know it all she said how could you ever think youre my life youre everything i have youre she leaned against the doorjamb with her fi sts on her eyes and her head raised up to the sky she began to cry it was a horrible sound like someone was pulling her insides out it was low and ugly it caught in her breath it sounded like dying maggie had never before seen her mother cry the weeping frightened her she watched and waited and clutched at her coat because mummy was the strong one mummy stood tall mummy was the one who knew what to do only now maggie saw that mummy was not so very much different from her when it came to hurting she went to her mother mummy juliet shook her head i cant make it right i cant change things not now i cant do it dont ask me she swung from the doorway and went into the house numbly maggie followed her into the kitchen and watched her sit at the table with her face in her hands maggie didnt know what to do so she put on the kettle and crept round the kitchen assembling tea by the time she had it ready juliets tears had stopped but under the harsh overhead light she looked old and ill wrinkles reached out in long zigzags from her eyes her skin was blotched with red marks where it wasnt pasty her hair hung limply round her face she reached for a paper napkin from its metal holder and blew her nose on it she took another and blotted her face the telephone began to ring maggie didnt move which way to head was mystery now and she waited for a sign her mother pushed back from the table and picked up the receiver her conversation was emotionless and brief yes shes herefrank ware found them nonoi donti dont think so colin no not tonight slowly she replaced the receiver and kept her fingers on it as if she were gentling an animals fears after a moment in which she did nothing but look at the telephone in which maggie did nothing but look at her she went back to the table and sat once again maggie brought her the tea chamomile she said here mummy maggie poured some sloshed into the saucer and she reached hastily for a napkin to soak it up her mothers hand closed over her wrist sit down she said dont you want sit down maggie sat juliet took the teacup out of its saucer and cradled the cup between her palms she looked into the tea and swirled it slowly round and round her hands looked strong steady and sure something big was about to happen maggie knew she could feel it in the air and in the silence between them the kettle was still hissing gently on the cooker and the cooker itself snapped and popped as it cooled she heard this as background to the sight of her mothers head lifting as she made her decision im going to tell you about your father she said chapter twentythree polly settled into the tub and let the water rise round her she tried to concentrate on the warm wash of it between her legs and the gush of it across her thighs as she sank but instead she caught herself in the midst of a cry and she squeezed her eyes shut she saw the negative image of her body fading slowly against her eyelids tiny pits of red replaced it then black swept in thats what she wanted the black she needed it behind her eyelids but she wanted it in her mind as well she hurt more now than she had this afternoon at the vicarage she felt as if shed been stretched on the rack with her groin ligaments torn from their proper housings her pubic and pelvic bones seemed beaten and raw her back and her neck were throbbing but this was a pain that would recede given time it was the other pain that she feared would never leave her if she saw only the black she wouldnt have to see his face any longer the way his lips curled back the sight of his teeth and his eyes like slits if she only saw the black she wouldnt have to see him stagger to his feet afterwards with his chest heaving and the back of one wrist scouring his mouth of the taste of her she wouldnt have to watch him lean against the wall while he stuffed himself back into his trousers she would still have to bear the rest of it of course that endless guttural voice and the knowledge it provided of the fi lth she was to him the invasion of his tongue his teeth biting his hands tearing and then the last when he scourged her she would have to live with that there was no memory pill she could take to wipe it away no matter how much she liked to hope there might be the worst of it was that she knew she deserved what colin had done to her her life was governed after all by the laws of the craft and she had violated the most important eight words the wiccan rede fulfi l an it harm none do what ye will all those years ago she had convinced herself that she cast the magic circle for annies own good but all the while in her most secret heart she had thought and hoped that annie would die and that her passing would bring colin closer to herself in a grief he would want to share with someone who had known his wife and this she had believed would lead them to loving each other and lead him to an eventual forgetting towards this end which she called noble unselfish and right she began to cast the circle and perform the rite of venus it was no matter that she had not changed to this rite until nearly a year after annies death the goddess was not and had never been a fool she always read the soul of the petitionerthe goddess heard the chant god and goddess up above bring me colin in full love and she remembered how three months before annie shepherds death her friend polly yarkin with sublime powers that came only from being a child conceived of a witch conceived within the magic circle itself when the moon was full in libra and its light cast a radiance on the altar stone at the top of cotes fell had stopped performing the rite of the sun and had switched to saturn burning oak wearing black breathing hyacinth incense polly had prayed for annies death she had told herself that death wasnt to be feared that the ending of a life could come as a blessing when the suffering endured had been profound and that is how she had justified the evil all the time knowing that the goddess would not let evil go unpunished everything until today had been a prelude to the descent of her wrath and she had exacted her retribution in a form that exactly matched the evil committed delivering colin to polly not in love but in lust and violence turning the magic threefold against its maker how stupid ever ever to think that juliet spence not to mention the knowledge of colins attentions to her was the punishment that the goddess intended the sight of them together and the realisation of what they were to each other had merely acted to lay the foundation for the real mortification to come it was over now nothing worse could happen except her own death and since she was more than half dead now even that didnt seem so terrible polly luvdoll whatre you doin polly opened her eyes and rose in the water so quickly that it sloshed over the side of the tub she watched the bathroom door behind it she could hear her mothers wheezing rita generally climbed the stairs only once a day to go to bed and since she never made that climb until after midnight polly had assumed she would be safe when shed fi rst called out that shed be wanting no dinner as she entered the lodge hurried up to the bathroom and shut herself in she didnt reply she reached for a towel the water sloshed again polly you still taking a bath girl didnt i hear the water running long before dinner i just started rita just started i heard the water running directly you got home moren two hours back so whats up luvdoll rita scratched her nails against the door polly nothing polly wrapped herself in the towel as she stepped from the tub she grimaced with the effort of lifting each leg nothing my eye cleanliness is next to whatever i know but this is taking it to extremes whas the story you fancying yourself up for some toy boy to climb through your window tonight you meetin someone you want a spray of my giorgio im just tired im going to bed you go on back down to the telly all right all wrong she tapped again whas going on you feeling queer polly tucked the towel round her to make a wrap water ran in rivulets down her legs to the stained green bath rug on the fl oor fine rita she tried to say it as normally as possible sifting through her memories of how she and her mother interacted to come up with an appropriate tone of voice would she be irritated with rita by now should her voice reflect impatience she couldnt remember she settled for friendly you go on back down isnt your police programme on about now why dont you cut yourself a piece of that cake cut me one as well and leave it on the work top she waited for the answer the lumber and huff of ritas departure but no sound came from the other side of the door polly watched it warily she felt chilled where her skin was wet and exposed but she couldnt face unwrapping the towel uncovering her body for drying and having to look at it again just yet cake rita said i might have a piece the door knob rattled ritas voice was sharp open up girl you ant had a piece of cake in fifteen years somethins wrong and i mean to know what rita we ant playing here luvdoll and unless you intend to climb out the window you may as well open this door straightaway cause i mean to be here whenever you get round to it please its nothing the door knob rattled louder the door itself thumped am i going to need the help of our local constabulary her mother asked i cn phone him you know why is it i expect youd rather i didnt polly reached for the bathrobe on its hook and slid the lock back she draped the bathrobe round her and was in the act of tying its belt when her mother swung the door open hastily polly turned away unfastening her hair from its elastic binding to let it fall forward he was here today was mr c shepherd rita said he cooked up some story bout looking for tools to fix our shed door what an agreeable bloke our local policeman you know anything about that luvdoll polly shook her head and fumbled with the knot shed made in the belt of the robe she watched her fingers pick at it and waited for her mother to give up the effort at communication and leave rita wasnt going anywhere however youd best tell me bout it girl what what happened she lumbered into the bathroom and seemed to fill it with her size her scent and above all her power polly tried to summon her own as a defence but her will was weak she heard the clankjangle of bracelets as ritas arm raised behind her she didnt cringe she knew her mother had no intention of striking her but she waited in dread for rita to respond to what she didnt feel emanating like a palpable wave from pollys body you got no aura rita said and you got no heat turn round here rita come on im just tired ive been working all day and i want to go to bed dont you mess me about i said turn i mean turn polly made the belts knot double she shook her head to gain further protection from her hair she pivoted slowly saying im only tired a bit sore i slipped on the vicarage drive this morning and banged up my face it hurts i pulled a muscle or something in my back as well i thought a hot soak would raise your head now she could feel the power behind the command it overcame whatever feeble resistance she might have been able to muster she lifted her chin although she kept her eyes lowered she was inches from the goats head that served as pendant on her mothers necklace she bent her thoughts to the goat his head and how it resembled the naked witch standing in the pentagram position from which the rites began and petitions were made move your hair off your face pollys hand did her mothers bidding look at me her eyes did the same ritas breath whistled between her teeth as she sucked in air face to face with her daughter her pupils expanded rapidly across the surface of her irises and then retracted to pinpricks of black she raised her hand and moved her fingers along the welt that scythecut its path of angry skin from pollys eye to her mouth she didnt make actual contact but polly could feel the touch of her fi ngers as if she did they hovered above the eye that was swollen they tapped their way from her cheek to her mouth finally they slid into her hair both hands on either side of her head this time an actual touch that seemed to vibrate through her skull what else is there rita asked polly felt the fingers tighten and catch at her hair but still she said nothing i fell a bit sore although her voice sounded faint and lacking in conviction open that robe rita ritas hands pressed in not a punishing grip but one that spread warmth outward like circles in a pond when a pebble hits its surface open the robe polly untied the first knot but found she couldnt manage the second her mother did it picking at the tie with her long blue fi ngernails and with hands that were as unsteady as her breath she pushed the robe from her daughters body and took a step back as it fell to the fl oor great mother she said and reached for the goats head pendant her chest rapidly rose and fell under her kaftan polly dropped her head it was him rita said wasnt it him did this to you polly after he was here let it be polly said let it ritas voice was incredulous i didnt do right by him i wasnt pure in my wanting i lied to the goddess she heard and she punished it wasnt him he was in her hands rita took her arm and swung her towards the mirror above the basin it was still opaque from steam and rita vigorously ran her hand up and down it and wiped her palm on the side of her kaftan you look here polly she said you look at this right and you look at it good do it now polly saw reflected what she had already seen the vicious impression of his teeth on her breast the bruises the oblong marks of the blows she closed her eyes but felt tears still trying to seep past her lashes you think this is how she punishes girl you think she sends some bastard with rape on his mind the wish comes back threefold on the wisher whatever it is you know that i didnt wish pure i wanted colin but he belonged to annie no one belongs to no one rita said and she doesnt use sex the very power of creation to punish her priestess your thinkings gone off youre looking at yourself like those sodding christian saints would have you do the food of wormsa vile dunghill she is the gate by which the devil entersshe is what the sting of the scorpion is thats how youre seeing yourself now isnt it something to be trampled something no good i did wrong by colin i cast the circle rita turned her and grabbed her arms firmly and youll cast it again right now with me to mars like i said you shouldve been doing all along i cast to mars like you said the other night i gave the ashes to annie i put the ring stone with them but i wasnt pure polly rita shook her you didnt do wrong i wanted her to die i cant take back that wanting an you think she didnt want to die as well her insides were eaten with cancer luv it went from her ovaries to her stomach and her liver you couldnt have saved her no one could have saved her the goddess could if id asked right but i didnt so she punished dont be simpleminded this isnt punishment what happened to you this is evil his evil and we got to see that he pays for doing it polly loosened her mothers hands from her arms you cant use magic against colin i wont let you believe me girl i dont mean to use magic rita said i mean to use the police she lurched round and headed for the door no polly shuddered against the pain as she bent and retrieved the robe from the fl oor youll be bringing them out on a fools errand i wont talk to them i wont say a word rita swung back you listen to me no you listen mum it doesnt matter what he did doesntthats like saying you dont matter polly tied the robe firmly until it and her answer were both in place yes i know that she said so the social services connection made tommy feel even more certain that whatever her reasons might have been for being rid of the vicar theyre probably connected to maggie and what do you think st james opened the door of their room and locked it behind them i dont know something still niggles deborah kicked off her shoes and sank onto the bed drawing her legs up indian fashion and rubbing her feet she sighed my feet feel twenty years older than i do i think womens shoes are designed by sadists they ought to be shot the shoes those too she pulled a tortoiseshell comb from her hair and pitched it onto the chest of drawers she was wearing a green wool dress the same colour as her eyes and it billowed round her like a mantle your feet may feel fortyfive st james noted but you look fi fteen its the lighting simon nicely subdued get used to it wont you youll be seeing it more and more at home in the coming years he chuckled shedding his jacket he removed his watch and placed it on the bedside table beneath a lamp whose tasselled shade was going decidedly frizzy on the ends he joined her on the bed shifting his bad leg to accommodate his position of halfsit and halfslouch resting on his elbows im glad of it he said why youve developed a fancy for subdued lighting no but ive a definite fancy for the coming years that well be having them i mean you thought we might not i never know quite what to think with you frankly she raised her knees and rested her chin on them pulling her dress close round her legs her gaze was on the bathroom door she said please dont ever think that my love dont let who i am or what i do make you think well drift apart im diffi cult i know you were ever that but the together of us is the most important thing in my life when he didnt respond at once she turned her head to him still resting it against her knees do you believe that i want to but he coiled a lock of her hair round his fi nger and examined how it caught the light it was in colour somewhere on the scale between red chestnut and blonde he couldnt have named it sometimes the business of life and its general messiness get in the way of together he settled on saying when that happens its easy to lose sight of where you began where you were heading and why you took up with each other in the fi rst place ive never had a single problem with any of that she said you were always in my life and i always loved you but she smiled and sidestepped with greater skill than he would have thought she possessed the night you first kissed me you ceased being my childhood hero mr st james and became the man i meant to marry it was simple for me its never simple deborah i think it can be if two minds are one she kissed him on the forehead the bridge of his nose his mouth he shifted his hand from her hair to the back of her neck but she hopped off the bed and unzipped her dress yawning did we waste our time going to bradford then she wandered to the clothes cupboard and fished for a hanger he watched her nonplussed trying to make the connection bradford robin sage did you find nothing in the vicarage about his marriage the woman taken in adultery and what about st joseph he accepted her change in conversation for the moment it kept things easier after all nothing but his things were packed away in cartons and there were dozens of those so there may be something still to be uncovered tommy seems to think it unlikely however he thinks the truths in london and he thinks it has to do with the relationship between maggie and her mother deborah pulled her dress over her head saying in a voice muffled from within its folds still i dont see why youve rejected the past it seemed so compelling a mysterious wifes even more mysterious boating accident and all of that he may have been phoning social services for reasons having nothing to do with the girl in the fi rst place true but phoning social services in london why wouldnt he have phoned a local branch if it was in reference to a local problem for that matter even if his phoning had to do with maggie why would he phone london about her he wouldnt want her mother to know i expect he could have phoned manchester or liverpool then couldnt he and if he didnt why didnt he thats the question one way or the other we need to find the answer suppose he was telephoning with regard to something that maggie had confi ded in him if he was invading what juliet spence saw as her own patch the upbringing of her daughter and if he was invading it in a way that threatened her and if he revealed this invasion to her perhaps to force her hand in some way dont you suppose she may have reacted to that yes deborah said i tend to think she would have done she hung up her dress and straightened it on the hanger she sounded thoughtful but youre not convinced its not that she reached for her dressing gown donned it and rejoined him on the bed she sat on the edge studying her feet its just that she frowned i meani think it more likely that if juliet spence murdered him and if maggies at the bottom of why she murdered him she did it not because she herself was threatened but because maggie was this is her child after all you cant forget that you cant forget what it means st james felt trepidation send its current of warning through the shorter hairs on the back of his neck her final statement he knew could lead to treacherous ground between them he said nothing and waited for her to continue she did so dropping her hand to trace a pattern between them on the counterpane heres this creature that grew inside her for nine months listening to her heartbeat sharing the flow of her blood kicking and moving in those final months to make her presence known maggie came from her body she sucked milk from her breasts within weeks she knew her face and her voice i think her fingers paused in their tracing her tone tried and ultimately failed to become practical a mother would do anything to safeguard her child i meanwouldnt she do anything to protect the life she created and dont you honestly think thats what this killings all about somewhere below them in the inn dora wraggs voice called josephine eugenia whereve you got yourself to how many times do i have to tell you a slamming door cut off the rest of the words st james said not everyone is like you my love not everyone sees a child that way but if its her only child born under what circumstances having what kind of impact on her life trying her patience in what sort of ways who knows whats gone on between them you cant look at mrs spence and her daughter through the filter of your own desires you cant stand in her shoes deborah gave a bitter laugh i do know that he saw how she had grasped his words and turned them round on herself to wound dont he said you cant know what the future has in mind for you when the past is its prologue she shook her head he couldnt see her face just a sliver of her cheek like a small quarter moon nearly covered by her hair sometimes the past is prologue to the future sometimes it isnt holding on to that sort of belief is a damned easy way to avoid responsibility simon it can be indeed but it can also be a way of getting on with things cant it you always look backwards for your auguries my love but that doesnt seem to give you anything but pain while you dont look for auguries at all thats the worst of it he admitted i dont not for us at least and for others for tommy and helen for your brothers for your sister not for them either theyll go their own way in the end despite my brooding over what led up to their eventual decisions then who he made no reply the truth of the matter was that her words had jogged a fragment of conversation loose in his memory giving rise to thought but he was wary of a change in topic that she might misinterpret as further indication of his detachment from her tell me she was starting to bristle he could see it in the way her fi ngers spread out then clutched the counterpane somethings on your mind and i dont much like to be cut out when were talking about he squeezed her hand it has nothing to do with us deborah or with this then she was quick to read him juliet spence your instincts are generally good about people and situations mine arent i always look for bald facts youre more comfortable with conjectures and it was what you said about the past being prologue to the future he loosed his tie and pulled it over his head throwing it in the direction of the chest of drawers it fell short and draped against one of the pulls polly yarkin overheard sage having a conversation on the telephone the day he died he was talking about the past to mrs spence we think so he said something about judging st james paused in the act of unbuttoning his shirt he sought the words as polly yarkin had recited them you cant judge what happened then the boating accident i think thats whats been niggling at me since we left the vicarage that declaration doesnt fit in with his interest in social services as far as i can see but something tells me it needs to fi t somewhere hed been praying all that day polly said he wouldnt take any food fasting yes but why perhaps he wasnt hungry st james considered other options selfdenial penance for a sin what was it he finished with his unbuttoning and sailed the shirt the way of the tie it too missed its mark and fell to the floor i dont know he said but im willing to lay whatever odds youd like that mrs spence does where pas t is prologue chapter twentyfour an early start initiated long before the sun rose above the slopes of cotes fell got lynley to the outskirts of london by noon the citys traffic which daily seemed to become ever more like a gordian knot on wheels added another hour to his travel time it was just after one when he pulled into onslow square and claimed a parking space that was being vacated by a mercedesbenz with its drivers door crumpled like a defeated accordion and a scowling driver harnessed into a neck brace he hadnt phoned her either from winslough or from the bentley hed told himself at first that it was far too early when after all had helen ever risen before nine in the morning if she wasnt compelled to do so but as the hour grew later he changed his reasoning to the fact that he didnt want her to rearrange her schedule just to accommodate him she wasnt a woman who liked being at any mans beck and call and he wasnt about to foist that role upon her her flat wasnt that far from his own home after all if shed gone out for the afternoon he could simply toddle onwards to eaton terrace and have lunch there he flattered himself with thinking how liberated all these considerations were it was far easier than admitting the more obvious truth he wanted to see her but he didnt want to be disappointed by helens having an engagement that excluded him he rang the bell and waited observing a sky the approximate colour of a tenpence coin and wondering how long the rain would hold off and if rain in london meant snow in lancashire he rang a second time and heard her voice crackle with static from the speaker youre home he said tommy she said and rang him in she met him at the door to her fl at without makeup with her hair pulled back from her face and held in place with an ingenious combination of elastic and satin ribbon she looked like a teenager her choice of conversation emphasised the similarity ive had the most tremendous row with daddy this morning she said as he kissed her i was supposed to meet sidney and hortense for lunch sids discovered an armenian restaurant in chiswick that she swears is absolutely heaven on earth if the combination of armenian food chiswick and heaven is even possible but daddy came to town yesterday on business spent the night here and we sank to new depths in our mutual loathing of each other this morning lynley removed his overcoat shed been consoling herself with the rare luxury of a midday fire he saw on a coffee table in front of it were spread out the mornings paper two cups and saucers and the remains of a breakfast that appeared to consist mostly of overboiled and halfeaten eggs and deeply charcoaled toast i didnt know you and your father loathed each other he said is this something new id always got the impression you were rather his favourite oh we dont and i am how true she said which is why its so utterly disagreeable of him to have such expectations of me now dont misunderstand me darling your mother and i dont for a moment begrudge you the use of this flat he says in that sonorous way he has of talking you know what i mean baritone yes does he want you out of the fl at your grandmother intended it for the family and as youre part of the family we cant accuse you or ourselves of ignoring her wishes nonetheless when your mother and i reflect upon the manner in which you spend your time and all the etceteras at which he so excels i hate it when he blackmails me about the fl at you mean tell me how uselessly youve been spending your days helen darling lynley asked thats just exactly it she went to the coffee table and began folding the newspaper and stacking the dishes and it all came about because caroline wasnt here to cook his breakfast shes back in cornwall shes defi nitely decided to return and isnt that the decades best news the blame for which frankly i lay directly on dentons doorstep tommy and because cybele is such a model of connubial bliss and because iris is as happy as a pig in the muck with montana cattle and her cowboy but mostly it was because his egg wasnt boiled the way he wanted it and i burnt his toast well heavens how was i supposed to know one had to hang over the toaster like a woman in love and that set him off hes always been as prickly as a hedgehog in the morning anyway lynley weeded through the information for the one point on which he had at least a degree of expertise he couldnt comment on the marital choices that two of helens sisters had made cybele to an italian industrialist and iris to a rancher in the united states but he felt conversant with at least one area of her life for the past several years caroline had acted the role of maid companion housekeeper cook dresser and general angel of mercy for helen but she was cornwall born and cornwall bred and hed known london would wear uneasily upon her in the long run you couldnt have hoped to hold on to caroline forever he noted her familys at howenstow after all i could have done if denton hadnt seen fi t to break her heart every month or so i dont understand why you cant do something about your own valet hes simply unconscionable when it comes to women lynley followed her into the kitchen they set the dishes on the work top and helen went to the refrigerator she brought out a carton of lemon yogurt and prised it open with the end of a spoon i was going to ask you to lunch he said hastily as she dipped into it and leaned against the work top were you thank you darling i couldnt possibly im afraid im too occupied with trying to decide how to make something of my life in a fashion both daddy and i can live with she knelt and rooted through the refrigerator a second time bringing forth three more cartons strawberry banana another lemon she said which would you like none of them actually i had visions of smoked salmon followed by veal champagne cocktails fore claret with brandy aft banana then helen decided for him and handed him the carton and a spoon its just the very thing quite refreshing youll see ill make some fresh coffee lynley examined the yogurt with a grimace can i actually eat this without feeling like little miss muffet he wandered to a circular table of birch and glass that fitted neatly into an alcove in the kitchen at least three days of post lay unopened upon it along with two fashion magazines with corners turned down to mark pages of interest he fl ipped through these as helen poured coffee beans into a grinder and set it to roar her choice of reading material was intriguing shed been investigating bridal gowns and weddings satin versus silk versus linen versus cotton flowers in the hair versus hats versus veils receptions and breakfasts the registry offi ce versus the church he glanced up to see that she was watching him she spun away and dealt with the ground coffee intently but he had seen the momentary confusion in her eyes when on earth had helen ever been nonplussed about anything and he wondered how much if any of her current interest in weddings had to do with him and how much of it had to do with her fathers criticism she seemed to read his mind he always goes on about cybele she said which puts him into a state about me there she is mother of four wife of one the grande dame of milano patroness of the arts on the board of the opera the head of the museum of modern art chairwoman of every committee known to mankind and she speaks italian like a native what a wretched sort of oldest sister she is she could at least have had the decency to be miserable or to be married to a lout but no carlo adores her worships her calls her his fragile little english rose helen slammed the glass carafe under the spout of the coffee maker cybeles as fragile as a horse and he knows it she opened a cupboard and began pulling out an assortment of tins jars and cartons which she carried to the table cheese biscuits took up position on a plate with a wedge of brie olives and sweet pickles went into a bowl to these she added a splash of cocktail onions she finished off the array with a hunk of salami and a cutting board lunch she said and sat down opposite him as the coffee brewed eclectic gastronomy he noted what could i have been thinking of suggesting smoked salmon and veal lady helen cut herself some brie and smoothed it onto a biscuit he sees no need for me to have a career honestly what a victorian daddy is but he thinks i ought to be doing something useful you are lynley tucked into his banana yogurt and tried to think of it as something one could chew rather than simply gum and swallow what about everything you do for simon when he gets swamped thats a particularly sore spot with daddy what on earth is one of his daughters doing dusting and photographing latent fi ngerprints placing hairs on microscope slides typing up reports about decomposing flesh my god is this the sort of life he expected the fruit of his loins to be living is this what he sent me to finishing school for to spend the rest of my days intermittently of course i dont pretend to be doing anything far removed from frivolity on a regular basis in a laboratory if i were a man at least i could fritter away my time at the club hed approve of that its what he spent most of his youth doing after all lynley raised an eyebrow i seem to recall your father chairing three or four rather successful investment corporations i seem to recall that he still chairs one oh dont remind me he spent the morning doing so when he wasnt listing the charitable organisations to which i ought to be giving my time really tommy sometimes i think he and his attitudes stepped right out of a jane austen novel lynley fingered the magazine hed been looking through there are of course other ways to appease him aside from giving your time to charity not that he needs to be appeased of course but supposing you wish to you might for instance give your time to something else he considered worthwhile naturally theres fund raising for medical research home visits to the elderly working on one hot line or another i know i ought to do something with myself and i keep intending to but things just get in the way i wasnt talking about becoming a volunteer she paused in the act of slicing herself a piece of salami she placed the knife down wiped her fingers on a peach linen napkin and didnt respond think how many birds the single stone of marriage would kill helen this flat could go back to the use of your whole family they can come here any time as it is they know that you could declare yourself too busy with your husbands egocentric interests to be able to live a life of social and cultural responsibility as cybele does i need to start being more involved in things anyway daddys right about that although i hate to admit it and once you had children you could use their needs as a shield against whatever judgement your father might cast upon you for inactivity not that hed cast any judgements at that point hed be too pleased about what about having yousettled i suppose settled lady helen speared a sweet pickle and chewed it thoughtfully watching him my god dont tell me youre really that pro vincial i didnt intend you cant honestly believe that a womans place is to be settled tommy or she asked shrewdly is it just my place no sorry it was a poor choice of words choose again then he placed his yogurt carton on the table its contents had tasted fairly good for the first few spoonfuls but they didnt wear well on the palate after that were dancing round the issue and we may as well stop your father knows that i want to marry you helen yes what of it he crossed his legs uncrossed them he lifted his hand to loosen the knot of his tie only to discover and recall that he wasnt wearing one he sighed damn it all nothing of it it merely seems to me that marriage between us wouldnt be such a miserable thing and god knows that it would please daddy well enough he felt stung by her sarcasm and answered in kind i have no idea about pleasing your father but there are you used the word pleased less than a minute ago or have you conveniently forgotten but there are moments and frankly this isnt turning out to be one of them when im actually blind enough to think that it might please me she looked stung in turn she sat back in her chair they stared at each other the telephone mercifully began to ring let it go he said we need to thrash this out and we need to do it now i dont think so she got up the phone was on the work top next to the coffee maker she poured them each a cup as she spoke to her caller saying what a good guess hes sitting right here in my kitchen eating salami and yogurt she laughed truro well i hope youre running his credit cards to the limitno here he isreally barbara dont give it a thought we werent discussing anything more earthshaking than the merits of sweet pickles over dill she had a way of knowing when he felt most betrayed by her levity so lynley wasnt surprised when helen didnt meet his eyes as she handed him the phone and said unnecessarily its sergeant havers for you he caught her fingers under his when he took the receiver he didnt release her until she looked at him and even then he said nothing because damn it all she was at fault and he wasnt going to apologise for lashing out when she drove him to it when he said hello to his sergeant he realised that havers must have heard more in his voice than he intended to convey for she launched into her report without prefatory remarks of any kind saying youll be chuffed to know that the c of e take police work dead to heart down here in truro the bishops secretary kindly gave me an appointment to see him a week from tomorrow thank you very much busy as a bee in the roses the bishop if his secretarys to be believed she blew out a long loud breath shed be smoking as usual and you should see the digs these two blokes live in sodding bloody hell remind me to hold on to my money the next time the collection plate is passed round in church they should be supporting me not vice versa so its been a waste lynley watched helen return to the table where she sat and began unfolding the corners of the magazine pages shed previously folded down she was pressing each one deliberately flat and smoothing it with her fingers she wanted him to see the activity he knew that as well as he knew her realising this he felt the momentary grip of an anger so irrationally powerful that he wanted to kick the table through the wall havers was saying so evidently the term boating accident was a euphemism lynley tore his eyes from helen what havent you been listening havers asked never mind dont answer when did you tune in with the boating accident right she began again once she had realised that the bishop of truro wasnt going to be of help shed gone to the newspaper office where shed spent the morning reading back issues there she discovered that the boating accident that had claimed the life of robin sages wife her name was susanna by the way hadnt occurred on a boat in the first place and hadnt been deemed an accident in the second it was the ferry that runs from plymouth to roscoff havers said and it was suicide according to the newspaper havers sketched in the story with the details shed gathered from her perusal of the newspaper accounts the sages had been making a crossing in bad weather on their way to begin a twoweek holiday in france after a meal midway through the crossing its a sixhour ride you know susanna had gone off to the ladies while her husband returned to the lounge with his book it was more than an hour before he realised that she ought to have turned up but as shed been feeling a bit low he assumed she wanted some time alone he said he had a tendency to hover when she was in a mood havers explained and he wanted to give her some space my words not his according to the information havers had been able to gather robin sage had left the lounge two or three times during the remainder of the crossing to stretch his legs to get a drink to purchase a chocolate bar but not to look for his wife about whose continued absence it seemed he did not appear to be worried when they docked in france he went below to the car assuming that she would be there waiting when she failed to show up as the passengers began to leave he set about looking for her he didnt raise the alarm until he noticed that her handbag was on the front passenger seat of the car havers said there was a note inside here let me lynley heard the noise of pages turning it said robin im sorry i cant find the light there was no name but the writing was hers not much of a suicide note lynley remarked youre not the only one who thought that havers said the crossing had been made in bad weather after all it was dark for the latter half of it it was cold as well so no one had been on deck to see a woman throw herself from the railing or be thrown lynley asked havers agreed obliquely the truth is that it could have been suicide but it could have been something else as well which is apparently what the rozzers on both sides of the channel thought sage was put through the wringer twice he came up clean or as clean as he could because no one witnessed anything at all including sages trip to the bar or his saunters to stretch his legs and the wife couldnt simply have slipped off the boat when it docked lynley asked an international crossing inspector her passport was in her handbag along with her money her driving licence credit cards and the whole bloody bit she couldnt have got off the boat at either end and they searched every inch of it in france and in england what about the body where was she found who identifi ed her i dont know yet but im working that angle dyou want to place any bets sage liked to talk about the woman taken in adultery lynley said more to himself than to her and since there were no stones handy on the boat he gave her the old heaveho as her just deserts perhaps well whatever happened theyre sleeping in the bosom of jesus right now in the graveyard in tresillian they all are in fact i went to check they all are susanna sage and the kid all of them lying in a tidy little row the kid yeah the kid joseph their son lynley frowned listening to his sergeant and watching helen the former was supplying the rest of the details the latter was playing a knife across the wedge of brie in an aimless pattern her magazines closed and set to one side he was three months old when he died havers said and then her deathlet me seehere it is she died six months later that supports the suicide theory doesnt it shed have been depressed as hell id guess to have her baby die and how did she put it she couldnt find the light what was his cause of death dont know find out right she rustled some papers jotting down instructions in her notebook probably she said suddenly hell inspector he was three months old dyou think this bloke sage mightveor even the wife i dont know sergeant on the other end of the line he heard the brief distinct snap of a match being struck she was lighting up again he longed to do so himself he said dig a little deeper on susanna as well see if you can find anything at all about her relationship to juliet spence spencegot it more paper crinkled ive made copies of the newspaper articles for you theyre not much but shall i fax them to the yard for what theyre worth i suppose so it seemed little enough right well he could hear her drawing on the cigarette inspector the word was not so much spoken as drawled what soldier on up there you know helen easy to say he thought as he replaced the phone he returned to the table saw that helen had crosshatched the entire top of the brie shed given up eating her yogurt and the salami was still only partially cut at the moment she was using a fork to roll a black olive round her plate her expression was disconsolate he felt oddly moved to compassion i expect your father wouldnt approve of your playing with your food either he said quietly no cybele never plays with her food and iris never eats as far as i know he sat and looked without hunger at the brie hed spread on a biscuit he picked it up put it down reached for the pickle bowl pushed it away he finally said right ill be off i must go out to just as she said quickly im so sorry tommy i dont mean to keep hurting you i dont know what comes over me or why i do it he said i push you we push each other she took the ribboned elastic from her hair and played the elastic round her hand she said i think im looking for evidence and when it isnt there i create it from nothing this is a relationship helen not a court of law what are you trying to prove unworthiness i see mine he tried to sound objective but knew he didnt manage it she looked up her eyes were dry but her skin was blotched yours yes because god knows i already feel my own he reached for the ribbon shed twisted in her hands shed bound them loosely together and he unwove the binding if youre waiting for me to end things between us its not going to happen so youll have to do the ending yourself i can if you ask me i dont intend to it would be so much easier yes it would but only at first he stood i must go out to kent for the afternoon will you have dinner with me he smiled will you have breakfast as well lovemaking isnt what im avoiding tommy no he agreed making love is easy enough its living with it thats the devil lynley pulled into the car park of the train station in sevenoaks just as the fi rst raindrops hit the windscreen of the bentley he fumbled in his overcoat pocket for the directions theyd found among the vicars belongings in lancashire they were simple enough taking him to the high street for a brief jaunt before heading out of the town altogether a few turns past the point where the prehurricane eponymous oaks of the town had once stood and he was in the country down two more lanes and up a slight rise and he found himself following a short drive labelled wealdon oast this led to a house with white tile cladding above and brick below decorated by the distinctive bentchimneyed oast roundel attached to the building at its north end the house had a view of sevenoaks to the west and a mixture of farmland and woodland to the south the land and the trees were winterdrab now but the rest of the year they would provide an everchanging palette of colour as he parked between a sierra and a metro lynley wondered if robin sage had walked this distance out from the town he wouldnt have driven all the way from lancashire and the set of directions seemed to indicate two facts he had arrived by train with no intention of taking a taxi from the station and no one had met him or intended to meet him either at the station or somewhere in the town a wooden sign neatly lettered in yellow and affixed to the left of the front door identifi ed the oast house not as a home but as a place of business gitterman temps it read and beneath that in smaller letters of yellow katherine gitterman prop kate lynley thought another answer was emerging to the questions that had arisen from sages engagement diary and the odd bits carton a young woman looked up from a reception desk as lynley entered the house what had once been the sitting room was now an offi ce with ivory walls green carpeting and modern oak furniture that smelled faintly of lemon oil the girl nodded at him as she said into the thin wire headpiece of a telephone receiver i can let you have sandy again mr coatsworth she got on well with your staff and her skillswell yes shes the one with the braces on her teeth she rolled her eyes at lynley they were he noted skilfully shaded with an aquamarine shadow that exactly matched the jumper she wore yes of course mr coatsworth let me see on her desk which was otherwise free of clutter lay six manila folders she opened the first its no trouble mr coatsworth really please dont give it a thought she riffled through the second youve not tried joy have youno she doesnt wear braces and she typeslet me see lynley glanced to his left through the door that opened into the roundel into its circular wall a halfdozen neat cubicles had been built at two of them girls were pecking at electric typewriters while a timer ticked to one side in a third a young man worked upon a word processor shaking his head at the screen and saying jesus this is screwed for sure ill bet a hundred quid it was another power surge he leaned towards the floor and rattled through a repair case filled with circuit boards and arcane equipment disk crash city he murmured i sure as hell hope she was backing up may i help you sir lynley swung back to the reception desk aquamarine held a pencil poised as if to take notes shed cleared the desk of the folders and replaced them with a yellow legal pad behind her from a vase on a glistening credenza a single petal fell from a spray of hothouse roses lynley expected a harried custodian with dustpan in hand to appear from nowhere and whisk the offending bit of fl oribunda from sight im looking for katherine gitterman he said and produced his warrant card scotland yard cid you want kate the young womans incredulity apparently prevented her from giving his warrant card any attention at all kate is she available eyes still on him she nodded lifted a finger to keep him in place and punched in three numbers on the telephone after a brief and muffled conversation which she conducted with her chair swivelled in the direction of the credenza she led him past a second desk on which a maroon leather blotter held the days post arranged artfully into a fan with a letter opener acting the part of its handle she opened the door beyond the desk and gestured towards a stairway up there she said and added with a smile youve put a spanner in her day she doesnt much like surprises kate gitterman met him at the top of the stairs a tall woman dressed in a tailored plaid flannel dressing gown whose belt was tied in a perfectly symmetrical bow the predominant colour of the garment was the same green as the carpeting and she wore beneath it pyjamas of an identical shade flu she said im battling the last of it i hope you dont mind she didnt give him the opportunity to respond ill see you in here she led him down a narrow corridor that gave way to the sitting room of a modern wellappointed flat a kettle was whistling as they entered and with a just a moment please she left him the soles of her slim leather slippers clattered against the linoleum as she moved about the kitchen lynley glanced round the sitting room like the offices below it was compulsively neat with shelves racks and holders in which every possession appeared to have its designated place the pillows on the sofa and on the armchairs were poised at identical angles a small persian rug before the fireplace lay centred perfectly the fireplace itself burned neither wood nor coal but a pyramid of artifi cial nuggets that were glowing in a semblance of embers he was reading the titles of her videotapes lined up like guardsmen beneath a television when she returned i like to stay fit she said in apparent explanation of the fact that beyond a copy of oliviers wuthering heights the cassettes all contained exercise tapes featuring one fi lm actress or another he could see that fitness was approximately as important to her as neatness for aside from the fact that she was herself slender solid and athletic looking the rooms only photograph was a framed postersized enlargement of her running in a race with the number on her chest she was wearing a red headband and sweating profusely but shed managed a dazzling smile for the camera my first marathon she said everyones first is rather special id imagine that to be the case yes well she brushed her thumb and middle finger through her hair light brown carefully streaked with blonde it was cut quite short and blown back from her face in a fashionable style that suggested frequent trips to a hairdresser who wielded scissors and colour with equal skill from the lining round her eyes and in the rooms daylight despite the rain that was beginning to streak the fl ats casement windows lynley would have placed her in mid to late forties but he imagined that dressed for business or pleasure made up and seen in the forgiving artificial light of one restaurant or another she looked at least ten years younger she was holding a mug from which steam rose aromatically chicken broth she said i suppose i should offer you something but im not well versed in how one behaves when the police come to call and you are the police he offered her his warrant card unlike the receptionist below she studied it before handing it back i hope this isnt about one of my girls she walked to the sofa and sat on the edge with her mug of chicken broth balanced on her left knee she had he saw the shoulders of a swimmer and the unbending posture of a victorian woman cinched into a corset i check into their backgrounds thoroughly when they first apply no one gets into my fi les without at least three references if they get a bad report from more than two of their employers i let them go so i never have trouble never lynley joined her sitting in one of the armchairs he said ive come about a man called robin sage he had the directions to this oast house among his belongings and a reference to kate in his engagement diary do you know him did he come to see you robin yes when she drew her eyebrows together i dont recall exactly it was sometime in the autumn perhaps late september the eleventh of october it could have been shall i check that for you did he have an appointment one could call it that why has he got into trouble hes dead she adjusted her grip on the mug slightly but that was the only reaction that lynley could read this an investigation the circumstances were rather irregular he waited for her to do the normal thing to ask what the circumstances were when she didnt he said sage lived in lancashire may i take it that he didnt come to see you about hiring a temporary employee she sipped her chicken bouillon he came to talk about susanna his wife my sister she pulled a square of white linen from her pocket dabbed it against the corners of her mouth and replaced it neatly i hadnt seen or heard a word from him since the day of her funeral he wasnt exactly welcome here not after everything that had happened between him and his wife and the baby that dreadful business about joseph he was an infant when he died as i understand just three months it was a cot death susanna went to get him up one morning thinking that hed actually slept through the night for the first time hed been dead for hours he was stiff with rigor she broke three of his ribs between the kiss of life and trying to give him cpr there was an investigation of course and there were questions of abuse when the word got out about his ribs police questions lynley asked in some surprise if the bones were broken after death they would have known im aware of that it wasnt the police naturally they questioned her but once they had the pathologists report they were satisfied still there were whispers in the community and susanna was in an exposed position kate got up and walked to the window where she pushed back the curtains the rain was pattering against the glass she said contemplatively but without much ferocity i blamed him i still do but susanna only blamed herself id think thats a fairly normal reaction normal kate laughed softly there was nothing normal about her situation lynley waited without reply or question the rain snaked in rivulets against the windowpanes a telephone rang in the office below joseph slept in their bedroom the fi rst two months hardly abnormal she seemed not to hear then robin insisted he be given a room of his own susanna wanted him near her but she cooperated with robin that was her way and he was very convincing about what he kept insisting that a child could be irrevocably damaged by witnessing at any age even in infancy what robin in his infi nite wisdom called the primal scene between his parents kate turned from the window and sipped more broth robin refused to have sex as long as the baby was in the room when susanna wanted to resume relations she had to go along with robins wishes but i suppose you can imagine what little josephs death did to any future primal scenes between them the marriage quickly fell apart she said robin flung himself into his work as a means of distraction susanna drifted into depression i was living and working in london at the time kate said so i had her come to stay with me i had her go to galleries i gave her books to identify the birds in the parks i mapped out city walks and had her take one each day someone had to do something after all i tried to to get her back into life what do you think she was wallowing in grief she was luxuriating in guilt and selfloathing it wasnt healthy and robin wasnt helping matters at all hed have been feeling his own grief i dare say she wouldnt put it behind her every day id come home and there she would be sitting on the bed holding the babys picture against her breast wanting to talk and relive it all day after day as if talking about it would have done any good kate returned to the sofa and placed her mug on a round of mosaic that served as a mat on the side table she was torturing herself she wouldnt let it go i told her she had to she was young shed have another baby after all joseph was dead he was gone he was buried and if she didnt snap out of it and take care of herself shed be buried with him which she eventually was i blame him for that with his primal scenes and his miserable belief in gods judgement in our lives thats what he told her you know that josephs death was the hand of god at work what a beastly man susanna didnt need to hear that sort of rubbish she didnt need to believe she was being punished and for what for what kate pulled out her handkerchief a second time she pressed it against her forehead although she didnt appear to be perspiring sorry she said there are some things in life that dont bear remembering is that why robin sage came to see you to share memories he was suddenly interested in her she said he hadnt been the least involved in her life in the six months that led up to her death but suddenly he cared what did she do while she was with you he wanted to know where did she go what did she talk about how did she act whom did she meet she chuckled bitterly after all these years i wanted to smack his mournful little face hed been eager enough to see her buried what do you mean he kept identifying bodies washed up on the coast there were two or three of them he said were susanna the wrong height the wrong hair colour when there was hair left on them at all the wrong weight it didnt matter he was in such a nasty rush about it all why i dont know i thought at first he had some woman lined up to marry and he needed to have susanna declared officially dead in order to get on with it but he didnt marry he didnt i assume the woman gave him the brushoff whoever she was does the name juliet spence mean anything to you did he mention a woman called juliet spence when he was here did susanna ever mention juliet spence she shook her head why she poisoned robin sage last month in lancashire kate raised a hand as if to touch it to her perfectly brushed hair she dropped it however before it made contact her eyes grew momentarily distant how odd i fi nd im glad of the fact lynley wasnt surprised did your sister ever mention any other men when she was staying with you did she see other men once things began to go wrong in her marriage could her husband have discovered that she didnt talk about men she talked only about babies there is of course an unavoidable connection between the two ive always found that a rather unfortunate quirk in our species everyone pants towards orgasm without pausing to realise that its merely a biological trap designed for the purpose of reproduction what utter nonsense people get involved with one another they pursue intimacy along with love more fools they kate said lynley got to his feet kate moved behind him and made an adjustment to the position of the pillow on his chair she brushed her fi ngers across the chairs back he watched her wondering what it had been like for her sister grief calls for acceptance and understanding no doubt shed felt herself cut off from mankind he said have you any idea why robin sage might have telephoned social services in london kate picked a hair from the lapel of her dressing gown hed have been looking for me no doubt you supply them with temps no ive had this business only eight years before that i worked for social services hed have phoned there fi rst but your name was in his diary before his calls or visits to social services why would that be i couldnt say perhaps he wanted to go through susannas paperwork in the trip down memory lane hed been taking social services in truro would have been involved when the baby died perhaps he was tracking her paperwork to london why to read it to set the record straight to discover if social services knew what someone else claimed to know about josephs death is it a possibility she folded her arms beneath her breasts i cant see how if there had been something suspicious about his death it would have been acted upon inspector perhaps it was something borderline something that could have been interpreted either way but why would he take a sudden interest in that now from the moment joseph died robin showed no interest in anything other than his ministry well get through this by the grace of god he told susanna kates lips pressed into a line of distaste frankly i wouldnt have blamed her in the least if shed had the luck to find someone else just to forget about robin for a few hours would have been heaven could she have done did you get a sense of that not from her conversation when she wasnt talking about joseph she was trying to get me to talk about my cases it was just another way to punish herself you were a social worker then id thought he gestured in the general direction of the stairway that i was a secretary no i had much larger aspirations i once believed i could actually help people change lives make things better what an amusing laugh ten years in social services took care of that what sort of work did you do mothers and infants she said home visits and the more i did it the more i understood what a myth our culture has created about childbirth depicting it as womans highest purpose fulfilled what contemptible rot all of it generated by men most of the women i saw were utterly miserable when they werent too uneducated or too impossibly ignorant to be able to recognise the extent of their plight but your sister believed in the myth she did and it killed her inspector chapter twentyfive its the nasty little fact that he kept misidentifying bodies lynley said he nodded to the offi cer on duty at the kiosk flashed his identification and descended the ramp into the underground car park of new scotland yard why keep saying defi nitively that each one was his wife why not say he wasnt certain it didnt matter after all a postmortem would have been performed on the bodies in any case and he must have known that it sounds like shades of max de winter to me helen replied lynley pulled into a space conveniently close to the lift now that the day was long over and the vast clerical staff was gone he thought about the idea were meant to believe she deserved to die he mused susanna sage he got out of the car and opened her door rebecca he said she was evil lewd lubricious lascivious just the sort of person one longs to have at a dinner party to liven things up and she pushed him into killing her by telling him a lie did she i cant remember the whole story lynley took her arm and led her towards the lift he rang for it they waited as the machinery creaked and groaned she had cancer she wanted to commit suicide but she lacked the courage to kill herself so because she hated him she pushed him into doing it for her destroying him and herself at the same time and when the deed was done and hed sunk her boat in the manderley cove he had to wait until a female body washed ashore somewhere along the coast so that he could identify it as rebecca gone missing in a storm poor thing which one lady helen tapped her cheek thats the problem isnt it were meant to feel compassion for someone but it does leave one a bit tarnished doesnt it to be siding with the murderer rebecca was wanton entirely without conscience were meant to think it was justifi able homicide and was it is it ever thats the question he said they took the lift in silence the rain had begun falling in earnest on his drive back into the city a snarl of traffic in blackheath had made him despair of ever getting back across the thames but hed managed to reach onslow square by seven theyd made it to greens for dinner by a quarter past eight and now at twenty minutes before eleven they were heading up to his office for a look at whatever sergeant havers had managed to fax from truro they were operating under an undeclared ceasefire theyd discussed the weather his sisters decision to sell her land and her sheep in west yorkshire and return to the south to be near his mother a curious revival of heartbreak house that shavians were denouncing and critics were beatifying and a winslow homer exhibition that was coming to london he could sense her need to hold him at a distance and he cooperated without much liking it helens timeline for opening her heart to him wasnt what he would like it to be but he knew that he stood a better chance of winning her confidence through patience rather than confrontation the lift doors slid open even in cid the night staff was significantly smaller than the day so the floor seemed deserted but two of lynleys fellow dis were standing in the doorway to one of their offices drinking from plastic cups smoking and talking about the latest government minister to get caught with his trousers down behind kings cross station there he was poking some tart while the country goes to hell phillip hale was remarking blackly what is it with these blokes i ask you john stewart flicked cigarette ash onto the fl oor stuffing some dolly in a leather skirts more immediately gratifying than solving a fiscal crisis id guess but this wasnt a call girl this was a tenquid whore good christ you saw her ive also seen his wife the two men laughed lynley glanced at helen her face was unreadable he guided her past his colleagues with a nod arent you on holiday hale called after them were in greece lynley said in his office he waited for her reaction as he took off his coat and hung it on the back of the door but she said nothing about the brief exchange theyd heard instead she went back to their previous topic although when he evaluated it he realised that she wasnt digressing too far thematically from her central concern do you think robin sage killed her tommy it was night a rough crossing there were no witnesses who saw his wife throw herself from the ferry nor was there anyone who came forward to support his claim of going to the bar for a drink when he left the lounge but a priest not only to do it in the fi rst place but then to manage carrying on with his ministry afterwards he didnt carry on exactly he left his position in truro directly she died he took up a different sort of ministry as well and he took it up in places where he wasnt known to the congregation so if he had something to hide from them they wouldnt necessarily recognise that fact from a changed behaviour since they didnt know him in the fi rst place possibly but why kill her what would have been his motive jealousy anger revenge an inheritance lynley reached for the telephone there seem to be three possibilities theyd lost their only child six months before but you said it was a cot death he may have held her responsible or he may have been involved with another woman and knew as a priest he couldnt divorce and expect his career to go anywhere or she may have been involved with another man and he found out about it and acted in rage or the final alternative the truth is what it appears to be a suicide combined with an honest mistake made by a grieving widower in misidentifying bodies but no conjecture satisfactorily explains why he went to see susannas sister in october and where in the maze does juliet spence fit he picked up the phone you know where the fax is dont you helen would you see if havers sent the newspaper articles she left to do so and he phoned crofters inn i left a message with denton st james told him when dora wragg rang through to their room he said he hadnt seen a hair of you all day and hadnt expected to i imagine about now hes phoning every hospital between london and manchester thinking youve had a crash somewhere ill check in how was aspatria st james gave him the facts theyd managed to gather during their day in cumbria where he informed lynley the snow had begun falling at noon and followed them all the way back to lancashire prior to moving to winslough juliet spence had been employed as a caretaker at sewart house a large estate some four miles outside of aspatria like cotes hall it was in an isolated location and at the time inhabited only during august when the son of the owner came up from london with his family for an extended holiday was she sacked for some reason lynley asked not at all st james told him the house was deeded over to the national trust when the owner died the trust asked juliet spence to stay on once theyd opened the grounds and the buildings for public viewing she moved on to winslough instead any problems while she was in aspatria none i spoke to the owners son and he had nothing but unqualified praise for her and great affection for maggie so theres nothing lynley mused not quite deborah and i have been working the phones for you most of the day before aspatria st james said shed worked in northumberland outside the small village of holystone there shed been a combination of housekeeper and companion to an elderly invalid called mrs soameswest who lived alone in a small georgian mansion to the north of the village mrs soameswest had no family in england st james said and she didnt sound as if shed had a visitor in years but she thought a great deal of juliet spence hated to lose her and wanted to be remembered to her why did the spence woman leave she gave no reason just that shed found another job and she thought it was time how long had she been there two years there two years in aspatria and before that lynley glanced up as helen returned with at least a metres worth of fax hanging over her arm she handed it to him he laid it on the desk two years on tiree the hebrides yes and before that benbecula youre seeing the pattern i take it he was each location was more remote than the last at this rate he expected her fi rst place of employment to be iceland thats where the trail went cold st james said she worked in a small guesthouse on benbecula but no one there could tell me where shed been employed before that curious considering how long ago it was i cant say theres great cause for suspicion in the fact on the other hand her lifestyle itself sounds rather suspect to me but i suppose im more tied to home and hearth than most helen sat down in the chair facing lynleys desk hed turned on the desk lamp rather than the fluorescent lights overhead so she was partially in shadow with a streak of brightness falling mostly across her hands she was wearing he noted a pearl ring hed given her for her twentieth birthday odd that hed not noticed before now st james was saying so despite their wanderlust at least they wont be going anywhere for the moment who juliet spence and maggie she wasnt at school today according to josie which made us think at first that theyd heard youd gone to london and done a bunk as a result youre sure theyre still in winslough theyre here josie told us at considerable length over dinner that shed spoken with maggie for nearly an hour on the phone round five oclock maggie claims to have fl u which may or may not be the case since she also appears to have had a falling out with her boyfriend and according to josie she may have been skipping out on school for that reason but even if she isnt ill and theyre getting ready to run the snows been coming down for more than six hours and the roads are hell theyre not going anywhere unless they plan to do it on skis deborah said something quietly in the background after which st james added right deborah says you might want to hire a range rover rather than drive the bentley back up here if the snow keeps up you wont be able to get in any more than anyone else will be able to get out lynley rang off with a promise to think about it anything helen asked as he picked up the fax and spread it across the desk its curiouser and curiouser he replied he pulled out his spectacles and began to read the amalgamation of facts were out of order the first article was about the funeral and he realised that with an inattention to detail unusual in her his sergeant had fed the copies of the newspaper articles into the facsimile machine haphazardly irritated he took a pair of scissors cut the articles and was reassembling them by date when the telephone rang denton thinks youre dead sergeant havers said havers why in gods name did you fax me this mess out of order did i i must have got distracted by the bloke using the copy machine next to me he looked just like ken branagh although what ken branagh would be doing making copies of a handout for an antiques fair is well beyond me he says you drive too fast by the way kenneth branagh denton inspector and since you havent phoned him he assumes youre squashed buglike somewhere on the m or m if youd move in with helen or shed move in with you youd be making things a hell of a lot easier on all of us im working on it sergeant good give the poor bloke a call will you i told him you were alive at one oclock but he wasnt buying that since i hadnt actually seen your face whats a voice on the phone after all someone could have been impersonating you ill check in lynley said what do you have i know josephs was a cot death youve been a busy bloke havent you make that a double and youll have put your finger on juliet spence as well what cot death she had a child die of cot death no she died of it herself havers for gods sake this is the woman in winslough that may be the case but the juliet spence connected to the sages in cornwall is buried in the same graveyard as they are inspector she died fortyfour years ago make that fortyfour years three months and sixteen days lynley pulled the stack of clipped and sorted faxes towards him as helen said what is it and havers continued to speak the connection you wanted wasnt between juliet spence and susanna it was between susanna and juliets mother gladys shes still in tresillian as a matter of fact i had late tea with her this afternoon he scanned the information in the fi rst article at the same time as he prolonged the moment when he would have to examine the dark grainy photograph that accompanied it and make a decision she knew the entire family robin grew up in tresillian by the by and she used to keep house for his parents and she still does the flowers for the church here she looks about seventy and my guess is she could take us both on in tennis and rout us in a minute anyway she got close to susanna for a time when joseph died since shed been through the same thing herself she wanted to help her as much as susanna would let her which obviously wasnt a great deal he reached in the drawer for a magnifying glass played it over the faxed photograph and wished uselessly that he had the original the woman in the photograph was fuller of face than was juliet spence with darker hair that curled loosely round her head to her shoulders and below but more than a decade had passed since it had been taken this womans youth might have given way to anothers middleage thinning the face and greying the hair the shape of the mouth looked right the eyes seemed similar havers was continuing she said she and susanna spent some time together after they buried him she said its something a woman never gets over losing a child and particularly losing an infant that way she said she still thinks of her juliet every day and never forgets her birthday she always wonders what she might have turned out like she said she still has dreams about the afternoon when the baby never woke up from her nap it was a possibility as indistinct as the photograph itself but still undeniably real she had two more children after juliet did gladys she tried to use that fact to help susanna see that the worst of her grief would pass when other babies came but gladysd had one other before juliet as well and that one lived so she could never break through to her completely because susannad always remind her of that he set down the magnifying glass and the photograph there was only one fact he needed to confirm before he moved forward havers he said what about susannas body who found it where according to gladys she was fi sh bait no one ever found her they had a funeral service but theres sod all in the grave not even a coffi n he replaced the telephone receiver in its cradle and removed his spectacles carefully he polished them on a handkerchief before returning them to his nose he looked at his notes aspatria holystone tiree benbecula and saw what she had attempted to do the why of it all he was certain remained where it always had been with maggie theyre the same person arent they helen left her chair and came to stand behind his where she could look over his shoulder at the material spread out before him she put her hand on his shoulder he reached for it i think they are he said what does it mean he spoke contemplatively she would have needed a birth certificate for a different passport so that she could slip off the ferry when it docked in france she could have got a copy of the spence childs certificate at st catherines house no it would have been somerset house then or she could have pinched the original from gladys without her knowledge shed been visiting her sister in london before her suicide she would have had time to set everything up but why helen asked why did she do it because she may have been the woman taken in adultery after all a stealthy movement of the bed awakened helen the next morning and she cracked open one eye a grey light was sifting through the curtains and falling upon her favourite armchair across whose back an overcoat was fl ung the clock on the bedside table said just before eight she murmured god and plumped her pillow she closed her eyes with some deliberation the bed moved again tommy she said fumbling for the clock and turning it to face the wall i dont think its even dawn yet truly darling you need to get more sleep what time did we fi nally get to bed was it two damn he said quietly i know it i know it good then lie down the rest of the answers right here helen somewhere she frowned and rolled over to see that he was sitting against the headboard with his spectacles perched on the end of his nose letting his eyes travel over piles of paper scraps handouts tickets programmes and other miscellanea that hed spread across her bed she yawned and simultaneously recognised the piles theyd pawed through robin sages odd bits carton three times before giving it up and going to bed last night but tommy wasnt done with it it seemed he leaned forward riffl ed through one of the piles and rested against the headboard once more as if awaiting inspiration to strike the answers here he said i know it helen stretched out an arm beneath the covers and rested her hand on his thigh sherlock holmes would have solved it by now she noted please dont remind me hmmm youre warm helen im making an attempt at deductive thought am i getting in the way what do you think she chuckled reached for her dressing gown draped it round her shoulders and joined him against the headboard she picked up one of the piles at random and leafed through it i thought you had the answer last night if susanna knew she was pregnant and if the baby wasnt his and if there was no way she could pass it off as his because theyd stopped having sex which according to her sister appears to have been the casewhat more do you want i want a reason shed kill him what we have right now is a reason hed kill her perhaps he wanted her back and she didnt want to go he could hardly force her but if he decided to claim the child was his to force her hand through maggie a genetic test would take the wind out of that plan then perhaps maggie was his after all perhaps he was responsible for josephs death or perhaps susanna thought he was so when she discovered she was pregnant again she wasnt about to let him have a go with another child lynley made a noise of dismissal and reached for robin sages engagement diary helen noticed that while she slept hed also rummaged round the flat for the telephone directory which was lying open at the foot of the bed thenlet me see she fl ipped through her small stack of papers and wondered why on earth anyone would have kept these grimy handouts the sort that were continually thrust at pedestrians on the street she would have dropped them into the nearest dustbin she hated to refuse to take them altogether when the people passing them out always looked so earnest but to save them she yawned its rather like a reverse trail of bread crumbs isnt it he was flipping to the back of the telephone directory and running his finger down the page six he said thank god it wasnt smith he glanced at his pocket watch which lay open on the table next to his side of the bed and threw back the covers the odd bits went flying like debris in the wind was it hansel and gretel who left a trail of crumbs or little red riding hood helen asked he was rooting through his suitcase which gaped open on the fl oor and spilled out clothing in a fashion that denton would have found teethjarring what are you talking about helen these papers theyre like a trail of crumbs except he didnt drop them he picked them up tying the belt of his dressing gown lynley rejoined her at the bed sitting on her side of it and reading the handouts once again she read them along with him the first for a concert at st martininthefields the second for a car dealership in lambeth the third for a meeting at camden town hall the fourth for a hairdresser in clapham high street he came by train lynley said thoughtfully and began to rearrange the handouts he said give me that underground map helen with the map in one hand he continued to rearrange the handouts until he had the camden town hall meeting first the concert second the car dealership third and the hairdresser fourth he would have picked up the first at euston station he noted and if he was going to lambeth hed have got on the northern line and changed at charing cross helen said which is where hed have got the second for the concert but where does that leave clapham high street perhaps he went there last after lambeth does it say in his diary on his last day in london it says only yanapapoulis yanapapoulis she said with a sigh greek she felt a tugging of sadness with the saying of the name i spoiled this week for us we could have been there on corfu right this moment he put his arm round her and kissed the side of her head it doesnt matter wed be doing the same thing there as we are right now talking about clapham high street i doubt it he smiled and lay his spectacles on the table he brushed her hair back and kissed her neck not exactly he murmured well talk about clapham high street in a while which is what they did a little more than an hour later lynley agreed to helens making the coffee but after her presentation of lunch yesterday he wasnt willing to endure whatever she might bring forth from cupboards and refrigerator to serve as their breakfast he scrambled the six eggs he found in the refrigerator and threw in cream cheese stoned black olives and mushrooms for good measure he opened a tin of grapefruit wedges dished them out topped them with a maraschino cherry and set about making toast in the meantime helen manned the telephone by the time he had the breakfast ready shed gone through five of the six entries for the name yanapapoulis made a list of four greek restaurants shed not yet tried received one recipe for a poppyseed cake soaked in ouzogoodness that sounds rather terrifyingly inflammable my dearpromised to pass along to her superiors a complaint about police mishandling of a burglary near notting hill gate and defended her honour against the accusations of a shrieking woman who assumed she was the mistress of her errant husband lynley was setting their plates on the table and pouring coffee and orange juice when helen struck gold with her final call she had asked to speak to mummy or daddy the reply went on at some length lynley was spooning orange marmalade onto his plate when helen said i am sorry to hear that my dear what about mummy is she therebut you arent home alone are you shouldnt you be in school oh well of course someone must see to linus headcold do you have meggezones they work awfully well for a sore throat helen what in gods name she held up a hand to stop him shes wherei see can you give me the name dear lynley saw her eyes widen saw the smile begin to curve her lips lovely she said thats wonderful philip youve been such a help thank you so muchyes dear you give him the chicken soup she hung up the phone and left the kitchen helen ive got breakfast just a moment darling he grumbled and forked up a portion of eggs they werent halfbad it wasnt a combination of flavours that denton would have either served or approved of but then denton had always possessed tunnel vision when it came to food here look with her dressing gown fl ying round in a whirl of burgundy silk helen clattered back into the kitchen she was the only woman lynley knew who actually wore highheeled slippers with snowball tufts dyed to match the rest of her nightly ensembles and presented him with one of the handouts theyd been looking at earlier what the hair apparent she said clapham high street lord what a ghastly name for a hairdresser i always hate these puns shear ecstasy the mane attraction who comes up with them he spread some marmalade on a wedge of toast as helen slid into her seat and spooned up three pieces of grapefruit with tommy darling you can actually cook i might think about keeping you that warms my heart he squinted at the paper in his hand unisex styling he read discount prices ask for sheelah yanapapoulis helen said whatve you put in these eggs theyre wonderful sheelah yanapapoulis the very same and she must be the yanapapoulis were looking for tommy its too much of a coincidence otherwise that robin sage would have gone to see one yanapapoulis and just happened to have in his possession a handout with the place of employment of an entirely different yanapapoulis printed upon it dont you agree she didnt wait merely went on saying that was her son i was speaking to on the phone by the way he said to ring her at work he said to ask for sheelah lynley smiled youre a marvel and youre a fine cook if youd only been here to do daddys breakfast yesterday morning he set the handout to one side and went back to his eggs that can always be remedied he said casually i suppose she added milk to her coffee and spooned in sugar do you vacuum carpets and wash windows as well if put to the test heavens i might actually be getting the better part of the bargain is it then what a bargain tommy youre absolutely ruthless chapter twentysix although the son of she elah yanapapoulis had recommended a telephone call to the hair apparent lynley decided upon a personal visit he found the hairdressers on the ground floor of a narrow sootstained victorian building that was shoehorned between an indian takeaway and an appliance repair shop on clapham high street hed driven across the river on albert bridge and skirted clapham common upon whose north side samuel pepys had come to be lovingly tended in his declining years the area had been referred to as paradisian clapham during pepys time but it had been a country village then with its buildings and cottages spread out in a curve from the northeast corner of the common and with fields and market gardens in place of the closely packed streets that had accompanied the arrival of the railway the common remained essentially inviolate but many of the pleasant villas that once looked upon it had long since been demolished and replaced by the smaller and less inspired buildings of the nineteenth century the rain that had begun on the previous day was continuing to fall as lynley drove along the high street it rendered the usual kerbside collection of wrappers sacks newspapers and assorted rubbish into sodden lumps that seemed bled of all colour it also had the effect of eliminating virtually all pedestrian traffic aside from an unshaven man in a threadbare tweed coat who shuffl ed along talking to himself and holding a newspaper spread over his head the only other creature on the pavement at the moment was a mongrel dog sniffing at a shoe that lay on top of an upended wooden crate lynley found a place to park on st lukes avenue grabbed his coat and umbrella and walked back to the hairdressers where he discovered that the rain had evidently put a damper on the hair business as well he opened the door was assailed by the eyesmarting odour that accompanies someone inflicting a perm upon anothers innocent head of hair and saw that this malodorous operation of beauty was being performed on the hairdressers single customer she was a plump woman perhaps fifty years old who clutched a copy of royalty monthly in her fi sts and said cor lookit this will you stace that dress she wore to the royal ballet must of cost four hundred quid gloriamus on toast was staces reply delivered somewhere between polite enthusiasm and heavy ennui she squirted a chemical onto one of the tiny pink rolls on her clients head and gazed at her own reflection in the mirror she smoothed her eyebrows which came to curious points on her forehead and exactly matched the colour of her ramrod coal hair doing this allowed her to catch sight of lynley who stood behind the glass counter dividing the tiny waiting area from the rest of the shop we dont do men luv she tossed her head in the direction of the next work station a movement that clicked her long jet earrings like small castanets i know it says unisex in all the adverts but thats mondays and wednesdays when our rog is here which he isnt as you can see today i mean its just me and sheel sorry actually im looking for sheelah yanapapoulis lynley said are you she doesnt do men either i meanwith a winkshe doesnt do them that way as for the otherwell shes always been lucky that girl hasnt she she called towards the rear of the shop sheelah get out here this is your lucky day stace i tol you i was heading out dint i linuss got a bad throat and i was up all night i got no one on the book coming in this afternoon so theres no point to me staying movement in a back room accompanied the voice which sounded plaintive and tired a handbag clicked closed with a metallic snick a garment snapped as it was shaken out galoshes slapped against the fl oor hes goodlooking sheel stace said with another wink you wouldnt want to miss him trust me luv is that my harold then having a bit of fun with you cause if it is she came out of the room drawing a black scarf across hair that was short artfully cut and coloured a white blonde that came only from bleaching or being born an albino she hesitated when she saw lynley her blue eyes fl icked over him taking in and evaluating the coat the umbrella and the cut of his hair her face became immediately wary the birdlike features of her nose and chin seemed to recede but only for a moment before she lifted her head sharply saying im sheelah yanapapoulis who is it exactly wants to make my acquaintance lynley produced his warrant card scotland yard cid shed been in the process of buttoning a green mackintosh and although she slowed when lynley identified himself she did not stop she said police then yes i got nothing to say to you lot about anything she adjusted her handbag on her arm it wont take long said lynley and im afraid its essential the other hairdresser had turned from her client she said with some alarm sheel want me to ring harold for you sheelah ignored her saying essential to what did one of my boys get up to something this morning ive kept them home today if thats supposed to be a crime the whole lot of them got colds did they get up to mischief not that i know theyre always playing with the phone that lot gino dialed and yelled fi re last month got thrashed for it he did but hes nothing so much as pigheaded like his dad i wouldnt put it by him to do it again for a giggle im not here about your children mrs yanapapoulis although philip did tell me where to fi nd you she was fastening the galoshes round her ankles she straightened with a grunt and drove her fists into the small of her back in that position lynley saw what he had not noticed before she was pregnant he said may we go somewhere to talk about what about a man called robin sage her hands flew to her stomach you do know him he said and what if i do sheel im ringing harold stace said he wont want you talking to the coppers and you know it lynley said to sheelah if youre going home anyway let me drive you there we can talk on the way you listen im a good mother mister no one says different you just ask anyone around you cn ask stace here shes a bleeding saint stace said how many times you gone without shoes so those kids of yours could have the trainers they wanted how many times sheel and when was the last time you had a meal out and who does the ironing if it isnt you and how many new frocks dyou buy last year stace drew a breath lynley seized the moment this is a murder investigation he said the shops sole client lowered her magazine stace drew her chemical bottle to her breast sheelah stared at lynley and seemed to weigh his words whose she asked his robin sage her features softened and bravado disappeared she took a long breath right then im in lambeth and my boys are waiting if you want to talk we got to do it there ive a car outside lynley said and as they left the shop stace shouted after them im still ringing harold a new cloudburst erupted as lynley shut the door behind them he opened his umbrella and although it was large enough for them both sheelah kept her distance from him by opening a small collapsible one that she took from the pocket of her mackintosh she didnt say a word until they were in the car and heading towards clapham road and lambeth and then it was only some motor mister i hope its got an alarm system on it else there wont be a bolt left when you leave my fl at she gave the leather seat a caress theyd like this my boys you have three children five she pulled up the collar of her mackintosh and looked out the window lynley gave her a glance her attitude was streetwise and her concerns were adult but she didnt look old enough to have borne fi ve children she couldnt yet have been thirty five he repeated they must keep you busy she said go left here you need to take the south lambeth road they drove in the direction of albert embankment and when they hit congestion near vauxhall station she directed him through a maze of back streets that finally took them to the tower block in which she and her family lived twenty floors high it was steel and concrete unadorned and surrounded by more steel and concrete its dominant colours were a rusting gun metal and a yellowing beige the lift they rode in smelled of wet nappies its rear wall was papered with announcements about community meetings crimestopping organisations and crisis hot lines covering every topic from rape to aids its side walls were cracked mirrors its doors comprised a snake nest of illegible graffi ti in the middle of which the words hector sucks cock were painted in brilliant and unavoidable red sheelah spent the ride shaking off her umbrella collapsing it putting it into her pocket removing her scarf and fl uffi ng up the top of her hair she did this by pulling it forward from the crown in defiance of gravity it formed a drooping cockscomb when the lift doors opened sheelah said its this way and led him towards the back of the building down a narrow corridor numbered doors lined each side behind them music played televisions chattered voices rose and fell a woman shrieked billy you let me go a baby wailed from sheelahs flat came the sound of a child shouting no i wont you cant make me and the rattle of a snare drum being beaten by someone with only moderate talent for the occupation sheelah unlocked the door and swung it open calling which o my blokes got a kiss for mummy she was instantly surrounded by three of her children all of them little boys eager to oblige each one shouting louder than the other their conversation consisted of philip says we have to mind and we dont mum do we he made linus eat chicken soup for breakfast hermes has my socks and he wont take them off and philip says where is he gino sheelah asked philip come give your mummy what for a slender mapleskinned boy perhaps twelve years old came to the kitchen door with a wooden spoon in one hand and a pot in the other making mash he said these lousy potatoes keep boiling over i got to keep watch you got to kiss your mum fi rst aw come on you come on sheelah pointed to her cheek philip trudged over and pecked at his duty she cuffed him lightly and grabbed on to his hair in which the pick he used to comb it stuck up like a plastic headdress she plucked it out stop acting like your dad makes me crazy that philip she shoved it into the rear pocket of his jeans and slapped his bottom thesere my boys she said to lynley these are my extraspecial blokes and this here is a policeman you lot so watch yourselfs hear the boys stared at lynley he did his best not to stare back at them they looked more like a miniature united nations than they did the members of a family and it was obvious that the words your dad had a different meaning for every one of the children sheelah was introducing them giving a pinch here a kiss there a nibble on the neck a noisy spluttering against a cheek philip gino hermes linus my lamb chop linus she said him with the throat that kept me up all night and peanut linus said patting his mothers stomach right and how many does that make luv linus held up his hand the fi ngers spread a grin on his face and his nose running freely and how many are those his mother asked him five lovely she tickled his stomach and how old are you five thas right she took off her mackintosh and handed it to gino saying lets move this confab into the kitchen if philips making mash i got to see to the bangers hermes put that drum away and help linus with his nose christ dont use your bleeding shirttail to do it the boys trailed her into the kitchen which was one of four rooms that opened off the sitting room along with two bedrooms and a bathroom jammed with plastic lorries balls two bicycles and a pile of dirty clothes the bedrooms lynley saw looked out on the companion tower block next door and furniture made movement impossible in either two sets of bunkbeds in one of the rooms a double bed and a baby cot in the other harold ring this am sheelah was asking philip when lynley entered the kitchen naw philip scrubbed at the kitchen table with a dish cloth that was decidedly grey you got to cut that bloke loose mum hes bad news he is she lit a cigarette and without inhaling set it in an ashtray and stood over its plume of smoke breathing deeply cant do that luv peanut needs her dad yeah well smokings not good for her is it im not smoking am i dyou see me smoking dyou see a fag hanging out of this mouth thats just as bad youre breathing it arent you breathing its bad we could all die from cancer you think you know everything just like my dad she pulled a frying pan from one of the cupboards and went to the refrigerator two lists hung upon it held in place with yellowing cello tape rules was printed at the top of one jobs at the top of the other diagonally across both someone had scrawled sod you mummy sheelah ripped the lists off and swung round on the boys philip was at the cooker seeing to his potatoes gino and hermes were scrambling round the legs of the table linus was dipping his hand into a carton of corn flakes that had been left on the fl oor which of you lot did this sheelah demanded come on i want to know which of you bloody did this silence fell the boys looked at lynley as if hed come to arrest them for the crime she crumpled the papers and threw them on the table whats rule number one whats always been rule number one gino he stuck his hands behind his back as if afraid theyd be smacked respecting property he said and whose property was that whose property did you decide to write all over i didnt you didnt dont give me that rubbish whoever causes trouble if it isnt you you take these lists to the bedroom and write them over ten times but mum and no bangers and mash till you do you got it i didnt she grabbed his arm and thrust him in the direction of the bedrooms i dont want to see you till the lists are done the other boys shot sly looks at one another when hed gone sheelah went to the work top and breathed in more smoke i couldnt go it cold turkey she said to lynley in reference to the cigarette i could do with other stuff but not with this i used to smoke myself he said yeah then you know she took the bangers from the refrigerator and slid them into the frying pan she turned on the burner looped her arm round philips neck and kissed him soundly on the temple jesus youre a handsome little bloke you know that five more years and the girlsll be mad for you youll be beating them off you like they was fl ies philip grinned and shrugged her arm off him mum yeah youll like that plenty when you get a bit older just like my dad she pinched his bottom little sod she turned to the table hermes watch these bangers bring your chair here linus set the table i got to talk to this gentleman i want cornflakes linus said not for lunch i want them and i said not for lunch she snatched the box away and threw it into a cupboard linus began to cry she said stow it and then to lynley its his dad those damn greeks theyll let their sons do anything theyre worse than italians lets talk out here she took her cigarette back into the sitting room pausing by an ironing board to wrap a frayed cord round the bottom of an iron she used her foot to shove to one side an enormous laundry basket spilling clothes onto the fl oor good to sit down she sighed as she sank into a sofa its cushions wore pink slipcovers burn holes in them showed the original green beneath behind her the wall was decorated with a large collage of photographs most of them were snapshots they grew out in a starburst pattern from a professional studio portrait in the centre although adults were featured in some of them all of them showed at least one of her children even photographs of sheelahs wedding she stood at the side of a swarthy man in wirerimmed spectacles with a noticeable gap between his front teeth also contained two of her children a much younger philip dressed as ring bearer and gino who could not have been more than two is that your work lynley asked nodding at the collage she craned her neck to look at it you mean did i make it yeah the boys helped but mostly it was me gino she leaned forward on the sofa get back to the kitchen eat your lunch but the lists do what i tell you help your brothers and shut up gino plodded back into the kitchen casting a chary look at his mother and hanging his head the cooking noises became subdued sheelah knocked ash from her cigarette and held it under her nose for a moment when she replaced it in the ashtray lynley said you saw robin sage in december didnt you just before christmas he came to the shop like you i thought he wanted a haircut he could of used a new style but he wanted to talk not there here like you did he tell you he was an anglican priest he was all done up in a priest uniform or whatever its called but i figured that was just a disguise itd be like social services wouldnt it to send someone snooping round dressed up like a priest on the prowl for sinners ive had my fill of that lot i can tell you theyre here at least twice a month waiting like vultures to see if ill knock about one of my boys so they can take em away and put em in what they thinks a proper home she laughed bitterly they can wait till theyre grey fucking old biddies what made you think he was from social services did he have some sort of referral from them did he show you a card it was the way he acted once he got here he said he wanted to talk about religious instructions like where was i sending my kids to learn about jesus and did we go to church and where but all the time he kept looking round the flat like he was measuring it up to see was it fit for peanut when she comes and he wanted to talk about being a mother and how if i loved my kids did i show them regular and how did i show them and how did i discipline the sort of rot social workers always talk about she leaned over and turned on a lamp its shade had been covered somewhat haphazardly with a purple scarf when the lightbulb glowed great splodges of glue looked like the americas beneath the material so i thought he was going to be my new social worker and this was his notsoclever way of getting to know me but he never told you that he just looked at me the way they always do with his face all wrinkled and his eyebrows squished she gave a fair imitation of factitious empathy lynley tried not to smile and failed she nodded ive had that lot coming round since i had my first kid mister they never help out and they never change a thing they dont believe youre trying to do your best and if something happens they blame you first i hate the lot of them theyre why i lost my tracey joan tracey jones tracey joan tracey joan cotton she shifted her position and pointed to the studio photograph at the centre of her collage in it a laughing baby in pink held a stuffed grey elephant sheelah touched her fingers to the babys face my little girl she said this is my tracey that was lynley felt hair rise on the back of his hands shed said five children because she was pregnant he had misunderstood he got up from his chair and took a closer look at the picture the baby didnt look more than four or fi ve months old what happened to her he asked she got snatched one night right outa my car when i dont know sheelah went hastily on when she saw his expression i went into the pub to meet her dad i left her sleeping in the car cause shed been feverish and shed fi nally stopped her squalling when i came out she was gone i meant how long ago did this happen lynley asked twelve years last november sheelah shifted again away from the photograph she brushed at her eyes she was six months old was my tracey joan and when she got snatched social bleeding services did nothing about it but hand me over to the local police lynley sat in the bentley he thought about taking up cigarettes again he remembered the prayer from ezekiel that had been marked off in robin sages book when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive he understood thats what it all came down to in the end he had wanted to save her soul but she had wanted to save the child lynley wondered what sort of moral dilemma the priest had faced when he fi nally traced down sheelah yanapapoulis for surely his wife would have told him the truth the truth was her only defence and her best chance of convincing him to turn a blind eye to the crime she had committed so many years in the past listen to me she would have said to him i saved her robin do you want to know what kates records said about her parents her background and what happened to her do you want to know everything or are you just going to condemn me without the facts he would have wanted to know he was at heart a decent man concerned with doing what was right not just what was prescribed by law so he would have listened to the facts and then he would have verified them himself in london first by going to see kate gitterman and trying to discover if his wife had indeed had access to her sisters case reports in that longago time when she worked for social services then by going to social services itself to track down the girl whose baby had had a fractured skull and a broken leg before she was even two months old and then had been kidnapped off a street in shoreditch it wouldnt have been a difficult project to gather the information her mother was fifteen years old susanna would have told him her father was thirteen she didnt stand a chance in a life with them cant you see that cant you yes i took her robin and id do it again he would have come to london he would have seen what lynley saw he would have met her perhaps as he sat talking with her in the crowded flat harold would have arrived as well saying hows my baby hows my sweet mama as he spread his dusky hand across her belly a hand on which the gold wedding band glittered perhaps he too would have heard harold whispering cant make it tonight babe now dont cause a scene sheel i just cant do it in the corridor as he left do you have any idea how many second chances social services give an abusive mother before they take a child she would have demanded do you know how difficult it is to prove abuse in the first place if the child cant talk and there appears to be a reasonable explanation behind the accident i never touched a hair of her head sheelah had said to lynley but they didnt believe me oh they let me keep her cause they couldnt prove nothing but they made me go to classes and i had to check with them every week and she smashed out her cigarette all the time it was jimmy her bleeding stupid dad she was crying and he didnt know how to get her to stop and id left her with him for only an hour and jimmy hurt my baby he lost his temperhe threw herthe walli never i wouldnt but no one believed me and he wouldnt say so when the baby vanished and young sheelah cottonnotyetyanapapoulis swore shed been kidnapped kate gitterman phoned the police and gave them her professional assessment of the situation theyd eyed the mother measured the level of her hysteria and searched for a corpse instead of looking for a potential trail left by the babys abductor and no one involved in the investigation ever connected the suicide of a young woman off the coast of france with a kidnapping in london nearly three weeks later but they couldnt find a body could they sheelah had said wiping at her cheeks because i never hurt her and i never would she was my baby i loved her i did the boys had come to the door of the kitchen as she wept and linus crept across the sitting room and crawled onto the sofa beside her she hugged him to her and rocked him her cheek pressed against the top of his head im a good mother i am i take care of my boys no one says i dont and no one bloody no one is goin to take my kids away sitting in the bentley with the windows steaming and the traffic hissing by on the lambeth street lynley remembered the end of the story of the woman taken in adultery it was about casting stones only the man without sin and interesting he thought that it was men and not women who would do the stoning could stand in judgement and administer punishment anyone whose soul was not unblemished had to move aside you go to london if you dont believe me she would have said to her husband you check on the story you see if shed be better off living with a woman who fractured her skull so he had come he had met her and then he had faced the decision he was not without sin he would have realised his inability to help his wife come to terms with her grief when their own child died had been part of what led her to commit this crime how could he now begin to lift a stone against her when he was responsible if only in part for what she had done how could he begin a process that would destroy her forever at the same time as it ran the risk of also harming the child was she in truth better for maggie than this whitehaired woman with her rainbow children and their absent fathers and if she was could he turn away from a crime by calling its retribution a greater injustice he had prayed to know the difference between that which is moral and that which is right his telephone conversation with his wife on that final day of his life had telegraphed what his decision would be you cant judge what happened then you cant know whats right now thats in gods hands not yours lynley glanced at his pocket watch it was half past one he would fly to manchester and hire a range rover that would get him to winslough sometime in the evening he picked up the car phone and punched in helens number she heard it all when he said her name shall i come with you she asked no im not fit company now i wont be later that doesnt matter tommy it does to me i want to help in some way then be here for me when i get back how i want to come home and have home mean you her hesitation was prolonged he thought he could hear her breathing but knew it was impossible considering the connection he was probably only listening to himself what will we do she asked well love each other marry have children hope for the best god i dont know any longer helen you sound horrible her own voice was bereft what are you going to do im going to love you i dont mean here i mean winslough what are you going to do im going to wish to be solomon and be nemesis instead oh tommy say it youve got to say it sometime it might as well be now ill be here always when its over you know that slowly with great care he replaced the phone the wor k of nemesis chapter twentyseven was he looking for her tommy deborah asked dyou think he never believed she drowned in the first place is that why he moved from parish to parish is that why he came to winslough st james stirred another spoonful of sugar into his cup and regarded his wife thoughtfully she had poured their coffee but added nothing to her own she was playing the small cream jug between her hands she didnt look up as she waited for lynleys answer it was the first time she had spoken i think it was pure chance lynley forked up a portion of his veal hed arrived at crofters inn as st james and deborah were finishing dinner although they hadnt had the dining room to themselves this night the two other couples who had been enjoying beef wellington and rack of lamb had moved to the residents lounge for their coffee so between josie wraggs appearances in the dining room to serve one portion of lynleys late meal or another he had told them the story of sheelah cotton yanapapoulis katherine gitterman and susanna sage consider the facts he went on she didnt go to church she lived in the north while he remained in the south she kept on the move she chose isolated locations when the locations promised to become less isolated she merely moved on except this last time st james noted lynley reached for his wineglass yes its odd that she didnt move at the end of her two years here perhaps maggies at the root of that st james said shes a teenager now her boyfriends here and according to what josie was disclosing last night with her usual passion for detail thats a fairly serious relationship she may have found it difficult as we all do to walk away from someone she loves perhaps she refused to go thats a reasonable possibility but isolation was still essential to her mother deborahs head darted up at that she began to speak but she appeared to stop herself lynley was continuing it seems odd that juliet or susanna if you will didnt do something to force the issue after all their isolation at cotes hall was due to end any time when the renovation was complete brendan power and his wife he paused in the act of spearing up a piece of new potato of course he said she was the mischiefmaker at the hall st james said she must have been once it was occupied she increased her chances of being seen not necessarily by people from the village who would have seen her occasionally already but by guests coming to call and with a new baby brendan power and his wife would have had guests family friends outoftown visitors not to mention the vicar she wouldnt have wanted to take the risk still she must have heard the name of the new vicar long before she saw him st james said its odd that she didnt invent some sort of crisis and run for it then perhaps she tried but it was autumn when the vicar arrived in winslough maggie was already in school if indeed her mother had rashly agreed to stay on in the village for maggies happiness shed be hardpressed to come up with an excuse to leave deborah released her hold on the cream jug and pushed it away tommy she said in a voice so carefully controlled that it sounded strung i dont see how you can be sure of all this when lynley looked at her she went on quickly perhaps she didnt even need to run what sort of proof do you actually have that maggie isnt her real daughter in the first place she could be hers couldnt she thats unlikely deborah but youre drawing conclusions without having all the facts what more facts do i need what if deborah grabbed her spoon and clutched it as if she would use it to strike the table while she made a point then she dropped it saying in a dispirited voice i suppose shei dont know my guess is that an xray of maggies leg will show it was once broken and that dna testing will tell the rest of the tale lynley told her she got to her feet in response shoving her hair away from her face yes well look imsorry but im a bit tired i think ill go up illno please stay simon no doubt you and tommy have lots to discuss ill just say good night she was out of the room before they could respond lynley stared after her saying to st james did i say something its nothing pensively st james watched the door thinking deborah might reconsider and return when she didnt after a moment he turned back to his friend their reasons for questioning lynley were disparate he knew but deborah had a point if not the one she was intending to make why didnt she brazen it out he asked why didnt she claim maggie was her own child the product of an affair i wondered about that myself initially it seemed the logical way to go but sage had met maggie first remember i imagine he knew how old she was the same age as their son joseph would have been so juliet had no choice she knew she couldnt pull the wool over his eyes she could only tell him the truth and hope for the best and did she tell him the truth that is i expect so the truth was bad enough after all unmarried teenagers with an infant whod already suffered a fractured skull and a broken leg ive no doubt she saw herself as maggies saviour she might have been i know thats the hell of it she might have been and i imagine robin sage knew that as well he had visited sheelah yanapapoulis the adult he couldnt have known what she would have been like as a fi fteenyearold girl in possession of an infant he could make surmises based upon her other children how they were turning out what she said about them and their upbringing how she acted round them but he couldnt know for certain what it would have been like for maggie had she grown up with sheelah instead of juliet spence for a mother lynley poured himself another glass of wine and smiled bleakly im only glad im not in the position sage was his decision was agonising mine is only devastating and even then its not going to be devastating to me youre not responsible st james pointed out a crimes been committed and i serve the cause of justice i know that simon but frankly it gives me no pleasure he drank deeply of the wine poured more drank again he placed the glass on the table the wine shimmered in the light he said ive been trying to keep my mind off maggie all day ive been trying to keep it focussed on the crime i keep thinking that if i continue to reexamine what juliet did all those years ago and this past december as well i might forget about why she did it because the why of it isnt important it cant be then let the rest of it go ive been saying it like a litany since half past one he phoned her and told her what his decision would be she protested she said she wouldnt give her up she asked him to come to the cottage that night to talk about the situation she went out to where she knew the water hemlock grew she dug up a root stock she fed it to him for dinner she sent him on his way she knew he would die she knew how he would die st james added the rest she took a purgative to make herself look ill then she phoned the constable and implicated him so why in gods name can i forgive her lynley asked she murdered a man why do i want to turn a blind eye to the fact that shes a killer because of maggie she was a victim once in her life and shes about to become a victim of a different sort again at your hands this time lynley said nothing in the pub next door a mans voice rose momentarily a babble of conversation ensued st james said whats next lynley crumpled his linen napkin on the table top i have a wpc driving out from clitheroe for maggie shell need to take the child when we take the mother he glanced at his pocket watch she wasnt on duty when i stopped by the station they were tracking her down shes to meet me at shepherds he doesnt know yet im heading there now shall i come with you when lynley glanced back at the door through which deborah had disappeared st james said its all right then ill be glad of your company the crowd in the pub was a large one this night it appeared to consist mostly of farmers who had come by foot by tractor and by land rover to outshout one another on the subject of the weather smoke from their cigarettes and pipes hung heavily on the air as they each recounted the effect that the continuing snowfall was having on their sheep the roads their wives and their work because of a respite from noon until six oclock that evening they hadnt yet been snowed in but flakes had begun to fall again steadily round half past six and the farmers seemed to be fortifying themselves against a long siege they werent the only ones the village teenagers were spread out at the far end of the pub playing the fruit machine and watching pam rice carry on with her boyfriend much as she had done on the night of the st jameses arrival in winslough brendan power was sitting near the fire looking up hopefully each time the door opened it did this with fair regularity as more villagers arrived stamping snow from their boots and shaking it from their clothes and their hair were in for it ben a man called over the din pulling the taps behind the bar ben wragg couldnt have looked more delighted custom in winter was hard enough to come by if the weather turned rough enough half of these blokes would be looking for beds st james left lynley long enough to go upstairs for his overcoat and gloves deborah was sitting on the bed with all the pillows piled up behind her her head was back her eyes were closed and her hands were balled in her lap she was still fully dressed she said as he closed the door i lied but you knew that didnt you i knew you werent tired if thats what you mean you arent angry should i be im not a good wife because you didnt want to hear anything more about juliet spence im not sure thats an accurate measurement of your loyalties he took his coat from the cupboard and put it on fishing in the pockets for his gloves youre going with him then to finish things ill rest easier if he doesnt have to do it alone i brought him into this after all youre a good friend to him simon as he is to me youre a good friend to me as well he went to the bed and sat down on the edge he closed his hand over the fi st hers made the fist turned the fingers opened he felt something pressed between his palm and hers it was a stone he saw with two rings painted on it in bright pink enamel she said i found it sitting on annie shepherds grave it reminded me of marriage the rings and how theyre painted ive been carrying it round ever since ive thought it might help me be better for you than i have been i have no complaints deborah he closed her fingers round the stone and kissed her forehead youve wanted to talk i havent im sorry ive wanted to preach he said which is different from talking you cant be blamed for displaying an unwillingness to listen to my sermons he stood pulling on his gloves he took his scarf from the chest of drawers i dont know how long this will take it doesnt matter ill wait she was placing the stone on the bedside table as he left the room he found lynley waiting for him outside the pub sheltered within the porch and watching the snow continue to come down in silent undulations lit by the street lamps and by the lights from the terrace houses lining the clitheroe road he said shed only been married once simon just to yanapapoulis they headed towards the car park where hed left the range rover hed hired in manchester ive been trying to understand the process robin sage went through to make his decision and it comes down to that shes not a bad person after all she loves her children and shes only been married once despite her lifestyle prior to and following that marriage what happened to him yanapapoulis he gave her linus the fourth son and then evidently took up with a twentyyearold boy fresh in london from delphi bearing a message from the oracle lynley smiled i dare say thats better than gifts did she tell you about the rest obliquely she said she had a weakness for dark foreign men greeks italians iranians pakistanis nigerians she said they just crook their fingers and i come up pregnant i cant think how only maggies father was english she said and look what sort of bloke he was mister inspector person do you believe her story about how maggie came to have the injuries what difference does it make what i believe at this point robin sage believed her thats why hes dead they climbed inside the range rover and the engine caught lynley reversed it they inched past a tractor and threaded through the maze of cars to the street hed decided on that which is moral st james noted he threw himself behind the lawful position what would you have done tommy id have checked into the story just as he did and when you found out the truth lynley sighed and turned south down the clitheroe road god help me simon i just dont know i dont have the kind of moral certitude sage seems to have garnered theres no black or white for me in what happened grey stretches forever despite the law and my professional obligations to it but if you had to decide then i suppose it would all come down to crime and punishment juliet spences crime against sheelah cotton no sheelahs crime against the baby leaving her alone with the father so that he had the opportunity to injure her in the fi rst place leaving her alone in the car at night only four months later so that someone could take her i suppose id ask myself if the punishment of losing her for thirteen years or forever fi t or exceeded the crimes committed against her and then what lynley glanced his way then id be in gethsemane praying for someone else to drink from the cup which is i imagine what sage himself did colin shepherd had seen her at noon but she wouldnt let him into the cottage maggie wasnt well she told him a persistent fever chills a bad stomach running off with nick ware and dossing down in a farm building even if only for part of the night had taken its toll shed had a second bad night but she was sleeping now juliet didnt want anything to waken her she came outside to tell him shutting the door behind her and shivering in the cold the first seemed a deliberate effort to keep him out of the cottage the second seemed designed to send him on his way if he loved her her quaking body declared he wouldnt want her standing out in the cold having a chat with him her body language was clear enough arms crossed tightly fingers digging into the sleeves of her flannel shirt posture rigid but he told himself it was merely the cold and he tried to read beneath her words for an underlying message he gazed at her face and looked into her eyes courtesy and distance were what he read her daughter needed her and wasnt he being rather selfish to expect her either to want or accept a distraction from that need he said juliet when will we have a chance to talk but she looked up at maggies bedroom window and answered with i need to sit with her shes been having bad dreams ill phone you later all right and she slipped back into the cottage and shut the door soundlessly he heard the key turning in its lock he wanted to shout youve forgotten havent you ive my own key i can still get in i can make you talk i can make you listen but instead he stared long and hard at the door counting its bolts waiting for his heart to stop pounding so angrily hed gone back to work making his rounds seeing to three cars that had misjudged the icy roads herding fi ve sheep back over a disintegrating wall near skelshaw farm replacing its stones rounding up a rogue dog that had finally been cornered in a barn just outside the village it was routine business nothing to occupy his mind and as the hours passed he found himself more and more needing something to keep his thoughts in order later had come and she did not phone he moved about his house restlessly as he waited he looked out the window at the snow that lay unblemished in the graveyard of st john the baptist church and beyond it upon the pasture land and the slopes of cotes fell he built a fire and let leo bask in front of it as day drew towards evening he cleaned three of his shotguns he made a cup of tea added whisky to it forgot about drinking it he picked the phone up twice to make certain it was still in working order the snow after all could have downed some lines but he listened to the dialling tones heartless buzz telling him something was very wrong he tried not to believe it she was concerned about maggie he told himself she was rightfully concerned it was no more than that at four oclock he could stand the waiting no longer so he did the phoning her line was engaged and engaged at a quarter past and engaged at half past and every quarter hour after that until half past five when he understood that she had taken the phone off the hook so that its ringing would not disturb her daughter he willed her to phone from half past fi ve to six after six he began to pace he went over every brief conversation theyd had in the two days since maggie had returned from her shortlived experience of running away he heard juliets tone as she had sounded on the phone resigned somehow to something he did not want to understand and he felt a growing desperation when the phone rang at eight he leapt to answer it hearing a terse voice ask where the hell have you been all day boyo colin felt his teeth set and made an effort to relax ive been working pa thats what i usually do dont get a mouth with me hes asked for a wopsie and shes on her way do you know that boyo are you up on the news the telephone was on a lengthy cord colin cradled the receiver against his ear and walked to the kitchen window he could see the light from the vicarage porch but everything else was shape and shadow curtained off by the snow that was falling as if disgorged in an explosion from the clouds whos asked for a wopsie whatre you talking about that blighter from the yard colin turned from the window he looked at the clock the cats eyes moved rhythmically its tail ticked and tocked he said how do you know some of us maintain our ties boyo some of us have mates thatre loyal to the death some of us do favours so that when we need one we can call it in ive been telling you that from day one havent i but you dont want to learn youve been so bloody stupid so fl aming sure colin heard a glass clink against the receiver at his fathers end he heard the rattle of ice what is it he asked you having gin or whisky tonight the glass crashed against something the wall a piece of furniture the cooker the sink god damn you ignorant piece of fi lth im trying to help you i dont need your help bugger that for a lark youre in so deep you cant smell the shit that ponce was locked up with hawkins boyo for nearly an hour he called in forensic and the dc who came up there when you first found the body i dont know what he told them but the end result was that they phoned for a wopsie and whatever that bloke from the yard has up his sleeve to do next its with clitheroes blessing you got that boyo and hawkins didnt phone and put you in the picture did he did he colin didnt reply he saw that hed left a pot on the aga at lunchtime luckily it had held only salted water which had long since boiled away the bottom of the pot however was crusted with sediment what dyou think that means his father was demanding can you put it together or do i have to spell it out colin forced himself to sound indifferent bringing in a wopsies fine with me pa youre in a state over nothing what the hell is that supposed to mean it means i missed some things the case needs to be reopened you damn fool dont you know what it means to botch a murder investigation colin could picture the veins in his fathers arms standing out he said im not making history this wont be the first time a case has been reopened simpleton ass his father hissed you gave evidence for her you took the oath youve been playing in her knickers no ones likely to forget that when it comes time to ive some new information and its nothing to do with juliet im ready to hand it over to that bloke from the yard its just as well hes going to have a female pc with him because hell be wanting her whatre you saying that ive found the killer silence in it he could hear the fi re crackling in the sitting room leo was chewing industriously on a ham bone he had it locked in his paws against the floor and the sound resembled someone planing wood youre sure his fathers voice was wary youve evidence yes because if you cock this up any further youre done for boyo and when that happens its not going to happen i dont want you crying to me for help im through covering your arse with huttonprestons cc you got that ive got it pa thanks for having confi dence dont you give me your bloody colin hung up the phone it began ringing again within ten seconds he let it ring it jangled for a full three minutes while he watched it and pictured his father at the other end hed be cursing steadily hed be aching to batter someone into pulp but unless one of his pieces of sweet female flesh was there to oblige him he was going to have to face his furies alone when the phone stopped ringing colin poured himself a tumbler of whisky returned to the kitchen and punched juliets number the line was still engaged he carried his drink to the second bedroom that served as his study and sat down at the desk from its bottom drawer he took the slim volume alchemical magic herbs spices and plants he set it next to a yellow legal pad and began to write his report it flowed easily enough line after line piecing fact and conjecture into an overall pattern of guilt he had no choice he told himself if lynley was asking for a female pc he meant to start trouble for juliet there was only one way to stop him he had just completed his writing revised it and typed it when he heard the car doors slam leo began to bark he got up from the desk and went to the door before they had a chance to ring the bell they would fi nd him neither unprepared nor unaware im glad youve come he said to them he sounded a mixture of sure and expansive and he felt good about the sound he swung the door home behind them and led them into the sitting room the blond lynley took off his coat his scarf and his gloves and brushed the snow from his hair as if he intended to stay for a while the other st james loosened his scarf and a few buttons of his coat but the only things he removed were his gloves these he held and played through his fi ngers while the snowflakes melted into his hair ive a wpc coming up from clitheroe lynley said colin poured them both a whisky and handed the glasses over uncaring of whether they chose to drink or not not was the case st james nodded and set his on the side table next to the sofa lynley said thank you and placed his on the floor when he sat unbidden in one of the armchairs he beckoned colin to do likewise his face was grave yes i know shes on her way colin answered easily youve got second sight among your other gifts inspector i was twelve hours away from phoning sergeant hawkins for one myself he handed over the slender book first youll be wanting this i expect lynley took it and turned it over in his hands putting on his spectacles to read the cover first and then the descriptive copy on the back he opened the book and ran his glance over the table of contents pages were folded down at the corners the result of colins own perusal of the book and he read these next on the floor by the fire leo returned to gnawing his ham bone his tail thumped happily lynley fi nally looked up without comment colin said the confusion and the false starts in the case are my fault i wasnt on to polly at first but i think this clears things up he passed the stapled report to lynley who handed the book over to st james and began to read he went through the pages colin watched him waiting for a fl icker of emotion recognition or dawning acceptance to move his mouth raise his eyebrows light his eyes he said once juliet took the blame and said it was an accident thats what i focussed on i couldnt see that anyone had a motive to murder sage and when juliet insisted that no one could have had access to the root cellar without her knowledge i believed her i didnt realise then that he was never the target in the fi rst place i was worried about her about the inquest i wasnt seeing things clearly i should have realised earlier that this murder had nothing to do with the vicar at all he was the victim by mistake lynley had two pages left to read but he closed the report and removed his spectacles he replaced them in his jacket pocket and handed the report to colin when colins fi ngers were on it he said you should have realised earlieran interesting choice of words would this be before or after you assaulted her constable and why was that by the way to get a confession or merely for pleasure the paper felt weightless beneath his fi ngers colin saw that it had slipped to the fl oor he picked it up saying were here to talk about a murder if pollys turning the facts so that im under suspicion that should tell you something about her shouldnt it what tells me something is that she hasnt said a word about being assaulted about you about juliet spence she doesnt act much like a woman whos trying to hide her culpability why should she the person she was after is still alive she can tot the other up as a simple mistake with a motive of thwarted love i take it you must think a great deal of yourself mr shepherd colin felt his features hardening he said i suggest you listen to the facts no you listen and you hear me well because when im done youll resign from policework and thank god thats all your superiors expect from you and then the inspector began to talk he listed names that had no meaning to colin susanna sage and joseph sheila cotton and tracey gladys spence kate gitterman he talked about cot death a longago suicide and an empty grave in a family plot he sketched the vicars route through london and he laid out the story that robin sage and he himself had pieced together in the end he unfolded a poor copy of a newspaper article and said look at the picture mr shepherd but colin kept his eyes where hed placed them the moment the man had started speaking on the gun cabinet and the shotguns hed cleaned they were primed and ready and he wanted to use them he heard lynley say st james and then his companion began to speak colin thought no i wont and i cant and he conjured up her face to hold the truth at bay occasional words and phrases pierced through most poisonous plant in the western hemisphereroot stockwould have knownoily juice upon cutting an indication ofcouldnt possibly have ingested he said in a voice that came from so far within him he couldnt quite hear it himself she was sick shed eaten it i was there im afraid thats not the case shed taken a purgative the fever she was burning burning i expect shed taken something to elevate her temperature as well cayenne probably that would have done it he felt cleaved in half look at the picture mr shepherd lynley said polly wanted to kill her she wanted to clear the way polly yarkin had nothing to do with any of this lynley said you were a form of alibi at the inquest youd be the one to testify to juliets illness the night robin sage died she used you constable she murdered her husband look at the picture did it look like her was that her face were those her eyes it was more than ten years old the copy was bad it was dark it was blurry this doesnt prove a thing its not even clear but the other two men were relentless a simple confrontation between kate gitterman and her sister would tell the tale of identifi cation and if it didnt the body of joseph sage could be exhumed and genetic testing could be done upon it to match him to the woman who called herself juliet spence because if she was indeed juliet spence why would she refuse to be tested to have maggie tested to produce the documents attendant to maggies birth to do anything possible to clear her name he was left with nothing nothing to say no argument to propose and nothing to reveal he got to his feet and carried the copied photograph and its accompanying article to the fireplace he threw them in and watched the fl ames take them curling the paper at the edges first then lapping eagerly then consuming entirely leo watched him looking up from his bone whining low in his throat god to have everything simple like a dog food and shelter warmth against the cold loyalty and love that never wavered he said im ready then lynley said we wont be needing you constable colin looked up to protest even as he knew he had no right the doorbell rang the dog barked quieted colin said bitterly would you like to answer that yourself then to lynley itll be your wopsie it was but it was more the female pc had come in uniform bundled against the cold her spectacles flecked with moisture she said pc garrity clitheroe cid sergeant hawkinss already put me in the picture while behind her on the porch listened a man in heavy tweeds and boots with a cap pulled low on his head frank ware nicks father both of them were backlit by the headlamps of one of their two vehicles which blazed a blinding white light into the steady fall of the snow colin looked at frank ware ware looked uneasily from the pc to colin he stomped the snow off his boots and pulled at his nose he said sorry to disturb but theres a car gone into a ditch out next the reservoir colin i thought i best stop by and tell you it looks to me like juliets opel chapter twentyeight there was no choice but to take shepherd with them hed grown up in the area he knew the lay of the land lynley wasnt willing to give him the freedom of his own vehicle however he directed him to the front seat of the hired range rover and with constable garrity and st james following in the other they set out for the reservoir the snow flew into the windscreen in constant banners of white dazzling in the headlamps and blown by the wind other vehicles had beaten it down into ruts on the road but ice ridged the bottom of these and made the going perilous even their range rovers fourwheel drive was not suffi cient to negotiate the worst of the curves and acclivities they slipped and slid moving at a crawl they eased past winsloughs monument to world war i the soldiers bowed head and his rifle now glittering white they passed the common where the snow blew in a spectral whirlwind that dusted the trees they crossed the bridge that arched over a tumbling beck visibility worsened as the windscreen wipers began to leave a curved trail of ice when they moved on the glass blast lynley muttered he made an adjustment to the defroster it was ineffectual since the problem was external next to him shepherd said nothing beyond giving twoword directions whenever they approached what went for an intersection this deep in the country lynley glanced his way when he said left here as the headlamps illuminated a sign for fork reservoir he thought about taking a few minutes pleasure from mixing obloquy with castigation god knew that shepherd was getting off far too lightly with a request for resignation from his superiors and not a full public hearing but the blank mask that was the other mans face dried up the wellspring of lynleys need to censure colin shepherd would be reliving the events of the last few days for the rest of his life and ultimately when he closed his eyes lynley could only hope that it would be polly yarkins face that haunted him most behind them constable garrity drove her rover aggressively even with the wind blowing and the windows rolled up they could hear her grinding her way through the gears the engine of her vehicle roared and complained but she never dropped more than six yards behind them once they left the outskirts of the village there were no lights other than those from their vehicles and those that shone from the occasional farmhouse it was like driving blind for the falling snow reflected their headlamps creating a permeable milky wall that was ever shifting ever changing ever blowing their way she knew youd gone to london shepherd finally said i told her put that into the account if youd like you just pray we can find her constable lynley changed down gears as they rounded a curve the tyres slid spun helplessly then caught again behind them constable garrity sounded her horn in congratulations they lumbered on some four miles from the village the entrance to fork reservoir loomed to their left offset by a stand of pines their branches hung heavily with a weight of wet snow caught in the web of the trees stubby needles the pines lined the road for perhaps a quarter of a mile opposite them a hedge gave way to the open moor there shepherd said as they came to the end of the trees lynley saw it as shepherd spoke the shape of a car its windows along with its roof bonnet and boot hidden beneath a crust of snow the car teetered at a drunken angle just at the point where the road sloped upward it sat on the verge neither coming nor going but rather diagonally with its chassis oddly balanced on the ground they parked shepherd offered his torch constable garrity joined them and beamed hers on the car its rear wheels had spun themselves a grave in the snow they lay deeply imbedded in the side of the ditch my nitwit sister tried this once constable garrity said flinging her hand in the upward direction the road was taking tried to make it up a slope and slid backwards nearly broke her neck little fool lynley brushed the snow from the drivers door and tried the handle the car was unlocked he opened the door shone the light inside and said mr shepherd shepherd came to join him st james opened the other door constable garrity handed him her torch shepherd looked inside at the cases and cartons as st james went through the glove box which was gaping open well lynley said is this her car constable it was an opel like a hundred thousand other opels but different in that its rear seat was crammed to the roof with belongings shepherd pulled one of the cartons towards him pulled out a pair of gardening gloves lynley saw his hand close over them tightly it was affi rmation enough st james said nothing much in here and snapped the glove box closed he picked a piece of dirty towelling off the floor and wrapped round his hand a short length of twine that lay with it thoughtfully he looked out across the moors lynley followed his gaze the landscape was a study in white and black it was falling snow and night unredeemed by the moon or stars there was nothing to break the force of the wind here neither woodland nor fell disrupted the fl ow of the land so the frigid air cut keenly and quickly bringing tears to the eyes whats ahead lynley asked no one responded to the question constable garrity was beating her hands against her arms and stomping her feet saying must be ten below st james was frowning and making moody knots in the twine hed found shepherd was still holding the gardening gloves in his fist and his fist was at his chest he was watching st james he looked shellshocked caught between dazed and mesmerised constable lynley said sharply i asked you whats ahead shepherd roused himself he removed his spectacles and wiped them on his sleeve it was a useless activity the moment he replaced them the lenses were respeckled with snow moors he said the closest towns high bentham to the northwest on this road no this cuts over to the a leading to kirby lonsdale lynley thought and beyond it the m the lakes and scotland or south to lancaster manchester liverpool the possibilities were endless had she been able to make it that far she would have bought herself time and perhaps an escape route to the irish republic as it was she played the part of fox in a winter landscape where either the police or the unforgiving weather ultimately was going to run her to ground is high bentham closer than the a on this road no but off the road cutting across country for christs sake man they wont be walking along the verge waiting for us to come by and give them a lift shepherds eyes darted inside the car and then with what seemed like an effort to constable garrity as if he were anxious to make sure they all heard his words and knew at this point that hed made the decision to cooperate fully he said if theyre headed due east across the moors from here the as about four and a half miles high benthams double that theyd be able to get a ride on the a sir constable garrity pointed out it might not be closed yet god knows theyd never be able to make a ninemile hike northwest in this weather st james said but theyve got the wind directly in their faces going east theres no bet they could even make the four and a half lynley turned from his examination of the darkness he shone his torchlight beyond the car constable garrity followed his lead and did the same heading a few yards in the opposite direction but snow obscured whatever footprints juliet spence and maggie might have left behind them lynley said to shepherd does she know the land has she been out here before is there shelter anywhere he saw the fl icker cross shepherds face he said where its too far where even if she started before dark before the snowfall got bad damn it all i dont want your analysis shepherd where shepherds arm extended more west than north he said back end barn its four miles south of high bentham and from here directly across the moors perhaps three miles would she know that trapped here in the car would she know lynley saw shepherd swallow he saw the betrayal bleed out of his features and settle them into the mask of a man without hope or future we hiked it from the reservoir four or five times she knows he said and thats the only shelter thats it shed have to find the track that led from fork reservoir to knottend well he told them a spring that was the midway point between the reservoir and back end barn it was marked well enough when the ground was clear but a wrong turn in the dark and the snow could take them in circles still if she found the track they could follow it to ravens castle a fivestone marker that joined the tracks to the cross of greet and the east cat stones wheres the barn from there lynley asked it was a mile and a half north from the cross of greet it sat not far off the road that ran north and south between high bentham and winslough i cant think why she didnt head there in the car in the first place shepherd said in conclusion instead of coming out this way why because theres a train station in high bentham st james got out of the car and slammed the door home it could be a blind tommy in this weather lynley asked i doubt it shed have needed an accomplice another vehicle drive this far fake an accident drive on with someone else st james said its not that far removed from the suicide game is it whod have helped her all of them looked at shepherd he said i last saw her at noon she said maggie was ill that was it as god is my witness inspector youve lied before im not lying now she didnt expect this to happen he flicked his thumb at the car she didnt plan an accident she didnt plan anything but getting away look at it straight she knows where youve been if sage discovered the truth in london you did as well shes running shes panicked shes not being as careful as she ought to be the car skids on the ice and puts her in a ditch she tries to get out she cant she stands here on the road just where we are she knows she could try for the a across the moors but its snowing and shes afraid shell get lost because shes never made the hike before and she cant risk it in the cold she looks the other direction and remembers the barn she cant make it to high bentham but she thinks she and maggie can make it there shes been there before she sets off all of which could be what were intended to think no bloody christ its what happened lynley its the only reason why he stopped he looked over the moors the reason why lynley prompted shepherds answer was nearly taken by the wind why she took the gun with her it was the open glove box he said it was the towelling and the twine on the fl oor how did he know hed seen the gun hed seen her use it shed taken it from a drawer in the sitting room one day shed unwrapped it shed shot at a chimney pot on the hall shed god damn it shepherd you knew she had a pistol whats she doing with a pistol is she a collector is it licenced it wasnt jesus christ he didnt thinkit didnt seem at the timehe knew he should have taken it from her but he didnt that was all shepherds voice was low he was identifying one more crook to the rules and procedures hed bent for juliet spence from the fi rst and he knew what the outcome of the revelation would be lynley jammed his hand against the gear shift and cursed again they shot forward north they had virtually no choice in the matter of pursuit providing she had found the track from the reservoir she had the advantage of darkness and snow if she was still on the moors and they tried to follow her across by torchlight she could pick them off when they got within range by simply aiming at the torches beams their only hope was to drive on to high bentham and then head south down the road that led to back end barn if she hadnt reached it they couldnt risk waiting for her and taking the chance shed got lost in the storm theyd have to set across the moors back towards the reservoir theyd have to make an attempt to fi nd her and hope for the best lynley tried not to think about maggie confused and frightened travelling in juliet spences furious wake he had no way of knowing what time theyd left the cottage he had no idea of the clothes they wore when st james said something about having to take hypothermia into consideration lynley shoved his way into the range rover and slammed his fist against the horn not like that he thought god damn it to hell however it ended it wouldnt be like that they got no moments relief from either the wind or the snow it was falling so heavily that it seemed as though all of the northwest would be five feet under drifts by the morning the landscape was changed entirely the muted greens and russets of winter were moonscape heather and gorse were hidden an endless camoufl age of white upon white made grassland bracken and heath a uniform sheet upon which the only markers were the boulders whose tops were powdered but still visible dark specks like blemishes on the skin around them they crawled along prayed their way up inclines rode the declivities on brakes and ice the lights from constable garritys range rover slithered and wavered behind them but came steadily on they wont make it shepherd said gazing out at the flurries that gusted against the car no one could not in this lynley changed down to first gear the engine howled shes desperate he said that might keep her going add the rest inspector he hunched into his coat his face looked greygreen in the lights from the dash im at fault if they die he turned to the window he fi ddled with his spectacles it wont be the only thing on your conscience mr shepherd but i expect you know that already dont you they rounded a curve a sign pointing west was printed with the single word keasden shepherd said turn here they veered to the left into a lane that was reduced to two ruts the width of a car it ran through a hamlet that appeared to consist of a telephone box a small church and half a dozen signs for public footpaths they experienced an alltoobrief respite from the storm when they entered a small wood just west of the hamlet there the trees were bearing most of the snow in their branches and keeping it relatively clear of the ground but another curve took them into open land again and the car was instantly buffeted by a gust of wind lynley felt it in the steering wheel he felt the tyres slide he cursed with some reverence and moved his foot off the gas he restrained himself from hitting the brakes the tyres found purchase the car moved on if theyre not in the barn shepherd asked then well look on the moor how you dont know what its like you could die out there searching are you willing to risk it for a murderess its not only a murderess im looking for they approached the road that connected high bentham and winslough the distance from keasden to this crossroads was a little over three miles it had taken them nearly half an hour to drive it they turned left heading south in the direction of winslough for the next half mile they saw the occasional lights from other houses most of them set some considerable distance off the road the land was walled here the wall itself fast becoming just another white eruption from which individual stones like staggered peaks still managed to break through the snow then they were out on the moor again no wall or fence served as demarcation between the land and the road only the tracks left by a heavy tractor showed them the way in another half hour they too would probably be obliterated the wind was whipping the snow into small crystal cyclones they built from the ground as well as from the air they whirled in front of the car like ghostly dervishes and spun into the darkness again snows letting up shepherd remarked lynley gave him a quick glance in which the other man obviously read the incredulity because he went on with its just the wind now blowing it about thats bad enough but when he studied the view lynley could see that shepherd was not merely acting the role of optimist the snowfall was indeed diminishing much of what the wipers were sweeping away came from what was blowing off the moors not falling from the sky it gave little relief other than to make the promise that things werent going to get much worse they crept along for another ten minutes with the wind whining like a dog outside when their headlamps struck a gate that acted as a fence across the road shepherd spoke again here the barns to the right just beyond the wall lynley peered through the windscreen he saw nothing but eddies of snowflakes and darkness thirty yards from the road shepherd said he shouldered open his door ill have a look youll do what i tell you lynley said stay where you are a muscle worked angrily in shepherds jaw shes got a gun inspector if shes in there in the first place she isnt likely to shoot at me i can talk to her you can do many things none of which youre going to do right now have some sense let me youve done enough lynley got out of the car constable garrity and st james joined him they directed their torches beams across the snow and saw the stone wall rising in a perpendicular line from the road they ran their beams along it and found the spot where its fl ow was interrupted by the red iron bars of a gate beyond the gate stood back end barn it was stone and slate with a large door to admit vehicles a smaller door for their drivers it looked due east so the wind had blown the snow in large drifts against the barns face the drifts were smooth mounds against the larger barn door against the smaller however a single drift was partially trampled a vshaped dent ran through it fresh snow dusted its edges by god she made it st james said quietly someone did lynley replied he looked over his shoulder shepherd he saw was out of the range rover although he was maintaining his position next to its door lynley considered the options they had the element of surprise but she had the weapon he had little doubt that she would use it the moment he moved against her sending in shepherd was in truth the only reasonable way to proceed but he wasnt willing to risk anyones life when there was a chance of getting her out without gunfi re she was after all an intelligent woman she had run in the first place because she knew that the truth was a moment away from discovery she couldnt hope to escape with maggie and go unapprehended a second time in her life the weather her history and every one of the odds were dead set against her inspector something was pressed into his hand you might want to use this he looked down saw that constable garrity had given him a loud hailer part of the kit in the car she said she looked embarrassed as she tipped her head towards her vehicle and buttoned the neck of her coat against the wind sergeant hawkins says a dcs always got to know what might be needed at a crime scene or in an emergency shows initiative he says ive a rope as well life vests the lot her eyes blinked solemnly behind the wetstreaked lenses of her spectacles youre a godsend constable lynley said thank you he raised the loud hailer he looked at the barn not a sliver of light showed round either of the doors there were no windows if she was inside she was sealed off completely what to say to her he wondered which cinematic inanity would serve their purpose and bring her out youre surrounded you cant hope to escape throw out the gun come out with your hands up we know youre inside mrs spence he called you have a weapon with you i dont were at an impasse id like to get you and maggie out of here without harm being done to anyone he waited there was no sound from the barn the wind hissed as it slid along three graduated tiers of stone projections that ran the length of the barns north side youre still nearly five miles from high bentham mrs spence even if you managed to survive the night in the barn neither you nor maggie would be in any condition to walk farther in the morning you must know that nothing but he could feel her thinking if she shot him she could get to his vehicle a better vehicle than her own after all and be on her way it would be hours before anyone would notice he was missing and if she hurt him badly enough he wouldnt have the strength to crawl back towards high bentham and fi nd assistance dont make it worse than it already is he said i know you dont want to do that to maggie shes cold shes frightened shes probably hungry id like to get her back to the village now silence her eyes would be quite used to the darkness if he burst in on her and had the luck to shine the torchlight directly in her face on the first go even if she pulled the trigger it wouldnt be likely that shed be able to hit him it might work if he could find her the instant he crashed through the door maggies never seen anyone shot he said she doesnt know what its like she hasnt seen the blood dont make that part of her memory of this night not if you love her he wanted to say more that he knew her husband and her sister had failed her when she needed them most that there would have been an end to her mourning the death of her son had she only had someone to help her through it that he knew she had acted in what shed believed were maggies interests when shed snatched her from the car that longago night but he also wanted to say that in the end shed not had the right to determine the fate of a baby belonging to a fi fteenyearold girl that while she may have indeed done better by maggie as a result of taking her they couldnt know that for sure and it was because of that simple not knowing that robin sage had decided a crueltyasjustice had to be done he found he wanted to blame what was going to happen this night on the man she had poisoned on his sententious perspective and his bumbling attempt to set things straight for in the end she was his victim as much as he was hers mrs spence he said you know were at the end of it here dont make it worse for maggie please you know ive been to london ive seen your sister ive met maggies mother ive a keening rose suddenly above the wind eerie inhuman it cut to the heart and then took on substance round a single word mummy mrs spence and then the keening again it sounded high with terror it locked round the unmistakable tone of a plea mummy im afraid mummy mummy lynley shoved the loud hailer into constable garritys hands he pushed through the gate and then he saw it a shape was moving just to his left beyond the wall as he himself was now shepherd he shouted mummy maggie cried the constable came rapidly onward through the snow he charged straight for the barn shepherd lynley shouted god damn it stay out mummy please im afraid mummy shepherd reached the barn door as the gun went off he was inside when she shot again it was long past midnight when st james finally climbed the stairs to their room he thought shed be asleep but she was waiting for him as shed said she would be sitting in bed with the covers drawn up to her chest and an old copy of elle spread across her lap she said you found her when she saw his face and then simon what happened when he nodded and said nothing except we did he was tired to the point of weakness his dead leg felt like a hundredweight hanging from his hip he dropped his coat and scarf to the floor tossed his gloves upon them and left them where they lay simon he told her he began with colin shepherds attempt to implicate polly yarkin he ended with the gunshots at back end barn it was a rat he said she was shooting at a rat theyd been huddled into a corner when lynley found them juliet spence maggie and a mangy orange cat called punkin that the girl had refused to leave behind in the car when the torchlight fell on them the cat hissed spit and scurried into the darkness but neither juliet nor maggie moved the girl cowered into the womans arms her face hidden the woman encircled her as much as possible perhaps to warm perhaps to protect we thought they were dead at fi rst st james said a murder and a suicide but there wasnt any blood then juliet spoke as if the others werent there saying its all right darling if i havent hit him ive frightened him to death he wont get you maggie hush its all right they were filthy he said their clothes were soaked i cant think they would have lasted the night deborah extended her hand to him please she said he sat on the bed she smoothed her fi ngers beneath his eyes and across his forehead she brushed back his hair there was no fight in her st james said and no intention to run any farther or it seemed to use the gun again shed dropped it onto the stone floor of the barn and she was holding maggies head to her shoulder she began to rock her shed taken off her coat and thrown it round the girl st james said i dont think she actually knew we were there shepherd got to her first he stripped his own heavy jacket off he wrapped it round her and then flung his arms round them both because maggie wouldnt release her hold on her mothers waist he said her name but she didnt respond other than to say that shed shot at it darling she always hit her mark didnt she it was probably dead there was nothing to fear constable garrity ran for blankets shed brought a thermos from home and she poured it saying poor lambs poor dears in a fashion that was far more maternal than professional she tried to get shepherd to put his jacket back on but he refused wrapping himself in a blanket instead and watching everything his eyes riveted with a kind of dying on juliets face when they were on their feet maggie began to cry for the cat calling punkin mummy wheres punkin hes run off its snowing and hell freeze he wont know what to do they found the cat behind the door his fur on end and his ears at the alert st james grabbed him the cat climbed his back in a panic but he settled well enough when he was returned to the girl she said punkin kept us warm didnt he mummy it was good to bring punkin like i wanted wasnt it but hell be happy to get home juliet put her arm round the girl and pressed her face to the top of her head she said you take good care of punkin darling and then maggie seemed to realise she said no mummy please im afraid i dont want to go back i dont want them to hurt me mummy please tommy made the decision to separate them at once st james said constable garrity took maggie you bring the cat dear she said while lynley took her mother he intended to push all the way through to clitheroe if it took him the rest of the night he wanted it to be over he wanted to be clear of it i cant blame him st james said i wont soon forget the sound of her screaming when she saw he meant to separate them then and there mrs spence maggie calling for her mother we could hear her even after the car drove off and mrs spence there was nothing from juliet spence at first without expression or reaction shed watched constable garrity drive away shed stood with her hands in the pockets of shepherds jacket and the wind blowing her hair across her face and she watched the tail lights of the receding car bob and weave as it lurched across the moor in the direction of winslough when they began to follow it she sat in the rear seat next to shepherd and never looked away from those lights for a moment she said what else could i do he said he was going to return her to london and that was the real hell behind the murder st james said deborah looked perplexed what real hell what do you mean st james got to his feet and walked to the clothes cupboard he began to undress sage never intended to turn his wife over to the authorities for snatching the baby he said that last night of his life hed brought her enough money to get out of the country he was perfectly willing to go to prison rather than tell anyone in london where hed found the girl once he turned her over to social services of course the police would have known eventually but by that time his wife would have been long gone that cant be right deborah said she must be lying about what happened he turned from the clothes cupboard he said why the offer of money only makes the case against her blacker why would she lie because deborah plucked at the bedcovers as if she would find the answer there she said deliberately laying out her facts like cards hed found her hed discovered who maggie was if he meant to return her to her real mother anyway why wouldnt she have taken the money and saved herself from gaol why did she kill him why didnt she just run she knew the game was up st james unbuttoned his shirt with great care he examined each button as his fi ngers touched it he said i expect it was because juliet felt she was maggies real mother all along my love he looked up then she was rolling a bit of the sheet between her thumb and forefi nger and watching herself do so he left her alone in the bathroom he took his time about washing his face brushing his teeth and running a brush through his hair he removed his leg brace and let it thump to the fl oor he kicked it to lie by the wall it was metal and plastic strips of velcro and polyester it was simple in design but essential in function when legs didnt work the way they were supposed to one strapped on a brace or took to a wheelchair or eased along on crutches but one kept going that had always been his basic philosophy he wanted that precept to be deborahs as well but he knew she would have to be the one to choose it shed switched off the lamp next to the bed but when he came out of the bathroom the light behind him fell across the room in the shadows he could see that she was still sitting up in bed but this time with her head on her knees and her arms round her legs her face was hidden he flicked off the bathroom light and made his way to the bed tapping carefully in a darkness that was more complete this night because the skylights were covered with snow he lowered himself into the covers and lay his crutches soundlessly on the fl oor he reached out and ran his hand along her back youre going to get cold he said lie down in a moment he waited he thought about how much of life comprised that very act and how waiting always involved either another individual or a force outside oneself he had mastered the art of waiting long ago it had been a gift imposed upon him with too much alcohol oncoming headlamps and the cormorant scream of skidding tyres through sheer necessity waitandsee along with giveittime had become his armorial motto sometimes the maxims led him into inaction sometimes they allowed him peace of mind deborah stirred beneath his touch she said of course you were right the other night i wanted it for myself but i also wanted it for you perhaps even more i dont know she turned her head to face him he couldnt see her features in the darkness just the shape of her as retribution he asked he felt her shake her head we were estranged in those days werent we i loved you but you wouldnt let yourself love me in return so i tried to love someone else and i did you know love him yes does it hurt you to think about it i dont think about it do you sometimes it creeps up on me im never prepared all of a sudden there it is then i feel torn inside i think how much ive hurt you and i want things to be different the past no the past cant be changed can it it can just be forgiven its the present that concerns me he could tell that she was leading him towards something she had thought carefully through perhaps that night perhaps in the days that had preceded it he wanted to help her say whatever it was she felt needed to be said but he couldnt see the direction clearly he could only sense that she believed the unspoken would hurt him in some undefi nable way and while he wasnt afraid of discussion indeed hed been determined to provoke it ever since theyd left london he found at the moment that he wanted discussion only if he was able to control its content that she intended to do so to an end he couldnt clearly anticipate caused him to feel the coldhot mantle of wariness cloak him he tried to shed it couldnt do so completely youre everything to me she said softly thats what i wanted to be to you everything you are no this baby thing deborah adoption the whole business of children he didnt complete the sentence because he didnt know where to go with it any longer yes she said thats it this baby thing the whole business of children being whole in and of itself thats what i wanted for you that would be my gift he saw the truth then it was between them the single dried bone of reality that they picked at and worried like two mongrel dogs hed grabbed it and chewed it for the years theyd been apart deborah had been worrying it ever since even now he saw when there was no need she was grappling with it he said nothing further shed gone this far and he was confident she would say the rest she was too close now to back away from saying it and backing away was not in fact her style shed been doing so for months to protect him he realised when he needed no protection either from her or from this i wanted to make it up to you she said say the rest he thought it doesnt hurt me it wont hurt you you can say the rest i wanted to give you something special its all right he thought it doesnt change anything because youre crippled he pulled her down to him she resisted at first but came to him when he said her name then the rest of it was spilling out whispered into his ear much of it didnt make sense an oddly combined jumble of memories and the experience and understanding of the last few days he merely held her and listened she remembered when they brought him home from his convalescence in switzerland she told him hed been gone four months she was thirteen years old and she remembered that rainy afternoon how shed observed it all from the top floor of the house how her father and his mother had followed him slowly up the stairs watching as he gripped the banister their hands flying out to keep him from losing his balance but not touching him never touching him because they knew without seeing the expression on his face which she herself could see from the top of the house that he wasnt to be touched not that way not any longer and a week later when the two of them were alone she in the study and this angry stranger called mr st james a floor above in his bedroom from which he had not emerged in days she heard the crash the heavy thud of weight and she knew hed fallen shed run up the stairs and stood by his door in her thirteenyearolds agony of indecision then shed heard him weeping shed heard the sound of him pulling himself along the floor shed crept away shed left him to face his devils alone because she didnt know what to do to help i promised myself she whispered in the darkness id do anything for you to make it better but juliet spence had seen no difference between the baby shed borne and the one shed stolen deborah told him each was her child she was the mother there was no difference to her mothering wasnt the initial act and the nine months that followed it but robin sage hadnt seen that had he he offered her money to escape but he should have known she was maggies mother she wouldnt leave her child it didnt matter what price she had to pay to stay with her she would pay it she loved her she was her mother thats how it was for her wasnt it deborah whispered st james kissed her forehead and settled the blankets more closely round her yes he said thats how it was chapter twentynine brendan power crunched along the verge heading into the village he would have sunk up to his knees in the snow but someone had been out earlier than he and a path was already trodden it was speckled every thirty yards or so with charred tobacco whoever it was out for a walk was smoking a pipe that didnt draw much better than brendans he himself wasnt smoking this morning he had his pipe with him in case he found himself in the position of needing to do something with his hands but so far he hadnt brought it out of its leather pouch although he could feel the weight of it tapping securely against his hip the day after any storm was generally glorious and brendan found this one as splendid as the previous night had been frightful the air was still the early sun laid down great blazes of crystal incandescence across the land frost rimed the tops of the drystone walls slate roofs wore a thick coating of snow as he passed the first terraced house on his way into the village he saw that someone had remembered the birds three sparrows were picking at a handful of toast crumbs outside a doorway and while they eyed him warily as he passed by hunger kept them from scattering into the trees he wished hed thought to bring something with him toast a slice of stale bread an apple it didnt matter anything edible to offer the birds would have served as a marginally credible excuse for being out in the fi rst place and hed be needing an excuse when he returned home in fact it might be wise to start concocting one now as he walked he hadnt thought of that earlier standing at the diningroom window looking out beyond the garden to the vast white pasture that was part of the townleyyoung estate hed thought only of getting out of tramping holes in the snow and driving his feet forward into a forever he could bear to live with his fatherinlaw had come to their bedroom at eight oclock brendan had heard his military footsteps in the passage and had slid out of bed freeing himself of the anchoring heaviness of his wifes arm in sleep shed thrown it diagonally across him so that her fingers rested in his groin under other circumstances he might have found this somnolent implication of intimacy quite erotic as it was he lay flaccid and mildly repelled and at the same time grateful that she was asleep her fingers wouldnt be drifting coyly another inch to the left in the expectation of encountering what she deemed appropriate male morning arousal she wouldnt be demanding what he couldnt give pumping him furiously and waiting agitated anxious then angry for his body to respond tinvoiced accusations wouldnt follow neither would the tearless weeping that screwed up her face and resounded through the corridors as long as she slept his body was his own and his spirit was free so he slipped to the door at the sound of his fatherinlaws approach and he cracked it open before townleyyoung could knock and awaken her his fatherinlaw was fully dressed as usual brendan had never seen him otherwise his tweeds his shirt his shoes and his tie all made a careful statement about good breeding that brendan knew he was supposed to understand and emulate everything he wore was just old enough to indicate the appropriate lack of interest in clothing that was inherent to the landed gentry more than once brendan had looked at his fatherinlaw and wondered idly how he managed the feat of maintaining an entire wardrobe that from shirt to shoes always looked at least ten years old even when new townleyyoung gave a glance to brendans woollen dressing gown and pursed his lips in silent disapproval at the messy bow brendan had made when tying the belt manly men use square knots to keep their dressing gowns closed his expression said and the two tails falling from the waist are always perfectly even you twit brendan stepped into the corridor and shut the door behind him still asleep he explained townleyyoung peered at the doors panels as if he could see through them and make an evaluation of his daughters frame of mind another rough night he asked that was certainly one way to put it brendan thought hed got home after eleven with the hope shed be asleep only to end up tussling with her beneath the covers in what went for marital relations between them hed been able to perform thank god because the room was dark and during their biweekly nighttime encounters shed taken to whispering certain anglosaxon pleasantries which he found allowed him to fantasize more freely he wasnt in bed with becky on those nights he chose his mate freely he moaned and writhed beneath her and said oh god oh yes i love it i love it to the image of polly yarkin last night however becky had been more aggressive than usual her ministrations possessed an aura of anger shed not accused or wept when he came into their bedroom smelling of gin and looking he knew because he could not hide it dejected and decidedly lovelorn instead shed wordlessly demanded retribution in the form she knew he wished least to make so it had indeed been a rough night although not in the manner his fatherinlaw thought he said a little discomfort and hoped townleyyoung would apply the description to his daughter right townleyyoung had said well at least well be able to set her mind at rest that should go far to making her more comfortable hed gone on to explain that the work at cotes hall would proceed without interruption at last he gave the reasons why but brendan merely nodded and tried to look filled with anticipation while his life drained away like an ebbing tide now as he approached crofters inn along the lancaster road he wondered why he had depended so much upon the halls remaining unavailable to them he was married to becky after all hed mucked up his life why did it seem a more permanent disaster if they had their own home he couldnt have said it was just that with the announcement of the halls pending completion hed heard a door slam somewhere on his dreams of the future as meaningless as those dreams had been and with the doors slamming he felt claustrophobic he needed out if he couldnt make an escape from the marriage at least he could from the house so out he went into the frosty morning where you off to bren josie wragg was perched on top of one of the two stone pillars that gave way to the crofters inn car park she had brushed it clear of snow and she was dangling her legs and looking as forlorn as brendan felt she was the word droop personified in her spine her arms her legs and her feet even her face looked heavy with the skin pulled down round her mouth and eyes just a walk he said and then he added because she looked so downtrodden and he knew exactly how that feeling throws ones life into shadow would you like to come along cant these dont work in the snow these were the wellingtons that she bounced upwards in his direction they were enormous they looked nearly twice the size of her feet over their tops at least three pairs of kneesocks were folded dont you have some proper boots she shook her head and pulled her knitted cap down to her eyebrows mineve been too small since november see and if i tell mum i need new ones shell have a conniption when are you going to stop growing josephine eugenia you know thesere mr wraggs he doesnt mind much she bounced her legs back against the frosty stones why do you call him mr wragg she was fumbling with a fresh packet of cigarettes trying to rip off its cellophane wrapper with mittened fingers brendan crossed the road took the packet from her and did the honours offering her a light she smoked without answer trying and failing to make a ring blowing out steam as much as smoke its pretend she finally said stupid i know you dont have to tell me it makes mum see red but mr wragg doesnt care if hes not my real dad i can pretend my mum had a big passion see and im the product of her fatal love i pretend this bloke came to winslough passing through on his way to wherever he met mum they were crazy for each other but they couldnt get married of course because mum wouldnt ever leave lancashire but he was the big love of her life and he set her on fire the way men are supposed to set women on fire and im how she remembers him now josie flicked ash in brendans direction thats why i call him mr wragg its dumb i dont know why i told you i dont know why i ever say anything to anyone its always my fault isnt it and everyones going to know it eventually i natter too much her lip trembled she rubbed her fi nger beneath her nose and threw her cigarette down it hissed gently in the snow natterings no crime josie maggie spence was my best mate see and now shes gone mr wragg says she wont probably be back and she was in love with nick did you know that true love it was now they wont see each other again i dont think its fair brendan nodded lifes that way isnt it and pams been gated for forever because her mum caught her last night in the sitting room with todd doing it right there her mum put on the lights and started screaming it was just like a fi lm pam said so theres no one no one special it feels sort of hollow here she pointed to her stomach mum says its just because i need to eat but im not hungry you know he did he knew all about hollow he sometimes felt he was hollow incarnate and i cant think about the vicar she said mostly i cant think about anything she squinted at the road at least we have the snow its something to look at for now it is he nodded tapped her knee and continued on his way turning down the clitheroe road concentrating on the walking putting his energy into that effort rather than into thought the going was easier on the clitheroe road than it had been on the way into the village more than one person had forged through the snow making the walk out to the church it seemed he passed two of them the londoners a short distance from the primary school they walked slowly heads together in conversation they looked up only briefl y as he passed he felt a quick stab of sadness at the sight of them men and women together talking and touching promised to cause him unending grief in the coming years the object was not to care any longer he wasnt quite sure if hed be able to manage it without seeking relief which is why he was out walking in the fi rst place pushing steadily forward and telling himself that he was merely going to check on the hall the exercise was good the sun was out he needed the air but the snow was deep beyond the church so when he fi nally reached the lodge he hung about for five minutes just catching his breath bit of a rest he assured himself and he scrutinised the windows one after the other looking for movement behind the curtains she hadnt been to the pub for the last two nights hed sat and waited until the last possible moment when ben wragg called time and dora bustled through picking up glasses he knew that once half past nine arrived it wasnt very likely that shed pop in but still he waited and dreamed his dreams he was dreaming them still when the front door opened and polly walked out she started when she saw him he took an eager step her way she had a basket over her arm and she was wrapped head to toe in wool and scarves heading to the village he asked ive just been to the hall shall i walk with you polly she came to join him and looked up the lane where the snow lay pristine and betraying fly there did you she asked he fished in his jacket for his leather pouch i was going there actually not coming back out for a walk beautiful day some of the tobacco spilled onto the snow she watched it fall and appeared to be studying it he saw that she had bruised her face somehow a crescent of purple on the cream of her skin was going yellow at the edges as it began to heal youve not been at the pub busy she nodded still examining the speckled snow ive missed you chatting with you and the like but of course youve got things to do people to see i understand that a girl like you still i wondered where you were silly but there it is she adjusted the basket on her arm i heard its resolved cotes hall what happened to the vicar did you know youre in the clear and thats good news isnt it all things considered she made no reply she wore black gloves with a hole at the wrist he wished shed remove them so he could look at her hands warm them even warm her as well he said in a burst i think about you polly all the time day and night youre what keeps me going you know that dont you im not good at hiding things i cant hide this you see what im feeling you do see it dont you youve seen it from the fi rst shed wound a purple scarf round her head and she pulled it closer to her face as if to hide it she kept her head bent she reminded him of someone in prayer he said were both lonely arent we we both need someone i want you polly i know it cant be perfect not with the way things are in my life but it can be something it can be special i swear i can make it good for you if youll let me she raised her head and looked at him curiously he felt his armpits sweating he said im saying it wrong arent i thats why its a muddle im saying it backwards im in love with you polly its not a muddle she said youre not saying it backwards his heart opened with joy then youre just not saying it all what more is there to say i love you i want you ill make it good if youll only ignore the fact that you have a wife she shook her head go home with you brendan take care of miss becky lie in your own bed stop sniffing round mine she nodded sharply dismissal good morning whatever he wanted to take it for and set off towards the village polly she turned back her face was stony she wouldnt be touched but he would reach her he would fi nd her heart he would beg for it plead for it he didnt care what it took i love you he said polly i need you dont we all need something she walked away colin saw her pass she was a whimsical vision of colour against a backdrop of white purple scarf navy coat red trousers brown boots she was carrying a basket and ploughing steadily along the far side of the road she didnt look his way she would have at one time she would have ventured a surreptitious glance at his house and if by chance he was working in the front garden or tinkering with the car she would have crossed the road with an excuse to talk hear about the dog trials in lancaster colin hows your dad feeling whatd the vet have to say about leos eyes now she made a project out of looking straight ahead the other side of the road the houses that lined it and particularly his simply didnt exist it was just as well she was saving them both had she turned her head and caught him watching her from the kitchen window he might have felt something and so far hed managed to keep himself from feeling anything at all hed gone through the motions of the morning making coffee shaving feeding the dog pouring himself a bowl of cornflakes slicing a banana raining sugar on top and dousing the mixture thoroughly with milk hed even sat at the table with the bowl in front of him hed even gone so far as to dip the spoon into it hed even lifted the spoon to his lips twice but he was unable to eat hed held her hand but it was dead weight in his hed said her name he was unsure what to call her this julietsusanna that the london detective claimed she was but he needed all the same to call her something in an effort to bring her back to him again she wasnt really there he discovered the shell of her was the body he had worshipped with his own but the interior substance of her rode up ahead in the other range rover trying to calm her daughters fears and looking for the courage to say goodbye he strengthened his grip on her she said in a voice without depth or timbre the elephant he struggled to understand the elephant why why here why now what was she telling him what was it that he should know about elephants that they never forget that she never would that she still reached out to him for rescue from the quicksand of her despair the elephant and then oddly as if they communicated in an english that meant something only to them inspector lynley answered her is it in the opel she said i told her punkin or the elephant you must decide darling he said ill see that she gets it mrs spence and that was all colin willed her to respond to the pressure of his fingers her hand never moved she never grasped his she simply took herself to a place of dying he understood that now he was there himself at first it seemed hed begun the process when lynley had laid the facts before him at first it seemed hed continued to decay throughout the interminable passing of the night he stopped hearing their voices he drifted out of his body altogether and observed from on high the ending of things he watched it all curiously filed it all away and thought perhaps he might wonder at it later how lynley spoke not as an official of the police but as if to comfort or to reassure her how he helped her to the car how he steadied her with his arm round her shoulders and pressed her head against his chest the final time they heard maggie cry it was odd to think he never once seemed triumphant at having his speculations proven true instead he looked torn the crippled man said something about the workings of justice but lynley laughed bitterly i hate all of this he said the living the dying the whole bloody mess and although colin listened from the faraway place to which the self of him had retreated he found that he hated nothing at all one cannot hate while one is engaged in the process of dying later he saw that hed really begun that process the moment he raised a hand against polly now standing at the window and watching her pass by he wondered if he hadnt been dying for years behind him the clock ticked the day onwards its cats eyes shifting along with the movement of its pendulum tail how shed laughed when she saw it shed said col its precious i must have it i must and hed bought it for her birthday wrapped it in newspaper because hed forgotten the fancy paper and ribbon left it on the front porch and rung the bell how shed laughed clapped her hands said hang it up right now right now you must he took it from the wall above the aga and carried it to the work top he turned it face down the tail still wagged he could sense that the eyes were still moving as well he could still hear the passing of its time he tried to prise open the compartment that held its workings but couldnt manage the job with his fingers he tried three times gave it up and opened a drawer beneath the work top he fumbled for a knife the clock ticked and tocked the cats tail moved he slid the knife between the backing and the body and pulled back sharply and then a second time the plastic gave with a snap part of the backing broke away it fl ew up and out and landed on the floor he fl ipped the clock over and slammed it hard a single time against the work top a gear fell out the tail and eyes stopped the gentle ticking ceased he broke the tail off he used the wooden handle of the knife to shatter the eyes he flung the clock in the rubbish where a soup tin shifted with the weight of its fall and began to drip diluted tomato against its face what shall we name it col shed asked slipping her arm through his it needs a name i fancy tiger myself listen what it sounds like tiger tells the time am i a poet col perhaps you were he said he put on his jacket leo dashed from the sitting room ready for a run colin heard his anxious whine and ran his knuckles across the top of the dogs head but when he left the house he left it alone the steam from his breath said the air was frigid but he couldnt feel anything either warmth or cold he crossed the road and went through the lychgate he saw that others had been in the graveyard before him because someone had laid a spray of juniper on one of the graves the rest were bare frozen under the snow with their markers rising like smokestacks through clouds he walked towards the wall and the chestnut tree where annie lay these six years dead he made a deliberate fresh trail through the snow feeling the drifts give way against his shins the way ocean water breaks when you walk against it the sky was as blue as the fl ax shed planted one year by the door against it the leafl ess branches of the chestnut tree wore a diamond cobweb of ice and snow the branches cast a net of shadows on the ground beneath them they dipped skinless fi ngers towards annies grave he should have brought something with him he thought a spray of ivy and holly a fresh pine wreath he should have at least come prepared to clean the stone to make sure lichen had no chance to grow he needed to keep the words from fading at the moment he needed to read her name the gravestone was partially buried in the snow and he began to use his hands against it first brushing off the top and then down the sides and then preparing to use his fi ngers on the carving but then he saw it the colour caught his eye first bright pink on pure white the shapes caught his eye second two interlocking ovals it was a small flat stone worn smooth by a thousand years of river and it was lying at the head of the grave tangent to the marker he put his hand out then drew it back he knelt in the snow i burnt cedar for you colin i put the ashes on her grave i put the ring stone with them i gave annie the ring stone he reached out with an arm that did its own bidding his hand picked up the stone his fingers closed round it annie he whispered oh god annie he felt the cold air sweeping over him from the moor he felt the frigid unforgiving embrace of the snow he felt the small stone settle into his palm he felt it hard and smooth about the author elizabeth george is the author of awardwinning and internationally bestselling novels including a great deliverance payment in blood and a traitor to memory
