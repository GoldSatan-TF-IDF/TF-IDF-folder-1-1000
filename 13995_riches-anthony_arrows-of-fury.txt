arrows of fury anthony riches september ad the tungrian centurions gathered round their leader in the warm afternoon sunshine sharing a last moment of quiet before the fight to come marcus tribulus corvus winked at his friend and former chosen man dubnus now centurion of the th century which marcus had previously commanded then nudged the older man standing next to him his attention fixed on the ranks of soldiers arrayed on the hillside behind them stop mooning after these legionaries rufius youre a tungrian now whether you like it or not rufius caught his sly smile and tip of the head to julius the detachments senior centurion and picked up the thread i cant help it marcus just seeing all those professional soldiers standing waiting for battle takes me back to the days when i stood in front of them with a vine stick and thats my old cohort too julius turned from his scrutiny of their objective and scowled at the two men with an exasperation that was only partly feigned rufius nudged marcus back shaking his head solemnly now brother lets be fair to our colleague and give him some peace its not his fault that its taken all morning and half the afternoon to get two thousand men and a few bolt throwers into position even if my guts are growling like a shithouse dog and theres enough sweat running down my legs to make my boots squelch for a week dubnus leaned over and tapped the veteran centurion on the shoulder i think youll find we call that wet stuff piss in this cohort grandfather the older man smiled tolerantly very good dubnus just you concentrate on taking your lads into action as their centurion for the first time and ill worry about whether ill be able to hold my bladder in a fight for the fiftieth time youth eh julius julius having turned back to his study of the defences looming before them replied in a tired tone of voice that betrayed his growing frustration with their prolonged wait in front of the tribal hill fort they would shortly be attempting to storm might i suggest that you all shut the fuck up given that it looks like well actually be attacking soon just as soon as those idiots have been cleared from the top of their wall thatll be us on the march and ready for our starring role in tribune antoniuss great victory over the carvetii tribe when i send you back to your centuries you get your men ready to advance you repeat our orders to them all one last time and remember to keep your bloody heads down once were on the move julius cast a disparaging glance at the batteries of bolt throwers ranged alongside his four centuries their sweating crews toiling at the weapons hand winches as they ratcheted the heavy bowstrings back ready to fire he tugged at the strap of his helmet the crosswise crest that marked him as a centurion ruffled by the breeze as he turned back to stare at the wooden walled fort to their front i dont trust those lazy bastards not to underwind and drop the occasional bolt short and when we do attack let me remind you one last time that our objective is to break in and take the first rampart just that and only that tribune antonius has been crystal clear on the subject marcus managed to keep a straight face despite rufiuss knowing smile it was an open secret among the officers of the th legions expedition against the rebellious carvetii tribe that the legions senatorial tribune the legatuss secondincommand was desperate to prove his readiness to command a legion of his own before his short tenure in the position ended to make way for another aspiring general once the ways clear to the second gate we let the legionaries through to take their turn got it so clear any resistance behind the first wall and then hold your men in place no battle rage and no trying to win the fortification crown not that any of us would ever be so favoured with two cohorts of regulars all vying for the honour once weve done our bit ill call the bloody road menders forward and they can do the rest the officers clustered around him turned to watch as the boltthrower battery to the right of their soldiers loosed a volley of three missiles at the hill forts outer wooden palisade barely two hundred paces from the ranks of their soldiers at such close range the weapons crews were taking full advantage of their weapons accuracy and another of the barbarian warriors lining the forts wooden walls was plucked away by the bolts savage power most likely dead before he hit the ground behind the palisade after a moment the remaining defenders ducked into the cover of the forts thick wooden beams and the artillery crews grinned their satisfaction as their officer shouted at them to get back on their weapons hand winches and prepare to shoot again julius nodded thatll be it their heads are down get back to your centuries the four centurions saluted him and turned away heading for their places in the two columns of auxiliary infantry waiting to either side of the heavy wooden ram that was key to their assigned task of breaking into the hill fort dubnus the leader of the century that led the righthand column a tall and broadshouldered young centurion with the frame of an athlete and a heavy black beard spoke quickly to his chosen man who in turn set the centurys watch officers to one last check that every man was ready to fight while they fussed over armour and weapons for the final time dubnus shouted the centurys orders across their ranks repeating juliuss command to take the first rampart and then hold to allow the legions through with their assigned task complete that done he drew his gladius and picked up a shield hed left on the ground in front of his men smiling wryly at marcus who stood at ease beside him in front of the century with his helmet hanging from one hand when i got my vine stick last month i assumed id never have to carry a shield again in all my days his friends eyes were alive with the prospect of the impending action he was as tall as dubnus and if his body was less massive in its build it was still impressively muscled from the months of incessant conditioning since he had joined the cohort in the spring his hair was as black as a crows wing and his brown eyes were set in a darkerskinned face than was usual in the locally recruited auxiliary cohorts a long cavalry sword was sheathed on his left hip while the shorter infantry gladius which usually hung on his right hip was in his right hand its ornate eagleshead pommel gleamed in the afternoon sunlight the intricately worked silver and gold polished to a dazzling brilliance and yet here you are hefting a painted piece of board again as if you were still in the ranks perhaps youd rather go forward with just your vine stick for protection eh dubnus no ill put up with the burden this once thank you marcus those bluenosed idiots arent going to keep their heads down for long and theyll throw everything but the water troughs at us once were through the gate if we get through the gate now youre sure you dont want to lead the ninth century forward one last time his friend shook his head gesturing to the front rank of the century arrayed behind him no thank you these are your men now im only along for the ride after you centurion a sudden bray of trumpets stiffened their backs calling the waiting centuries to readiness for the inevitable command marcus pulled on his helmet his features suddenly rendered anonymous by the cheek guards brutal lines then took up his own shield infantry advance julius turned back to face his men from the head of the lefthand column drawing his sword and pointing it at the fort tungrians advance at his command the detachments two columns marched steadily forward down the gentle slope that ran down to the hill forts perch high above the valley below three sides of the forts position were utterly unassailable owing to the heavily forested and precipitously steep slopes that fell away from the pinnacle to the north south and east the only possible approach to the hill fort was from the west where a flat and treeless ridge angled up to meet the hill on which two legion cohorts and their supporting artillery were gathered ready to follow up on the advance of their tungrian auxiliaries bordered on both sides by the wild forest of oak and birch that made the hill forts steep approaches so difficult the space beneath the trees thick with holly alder and hazel that made it practically impassable the ridges wide path led arrow straight down to the forts massive outer gates only here was there any realistic prospect of an attackers advance meeting with anything but disastrous rebuff but in anticipation of such an obvious approach the forts occupiers had long since constructed an elaborate series of defences across the forts western face three successive palisades of thick wooden beams defended the innermost point of the fort the hills flat summit the tungrians hunched behind their shields as the forts wooden rampart loomed in front of them casting nervous glances at the thirty massively built barbarians striding purposefully between them an irontipped battering ram fashioned from a tree trunk hacked from the surrounding forest hung between the two ranks of prisoners and swung to and fro as they marched down the ridges slope each pair of men on either side of the ram was shackled together at the wrist their chains wrapped around the tree trunk to remove any chance of flight and every man was naked from the waist up while a legion centurion and a dozen hardfaced soldiers marched alongside them in grim silence with drawn swords the legion officer barked a command into the oppressive silence that greeted their advance when we reach the gate you barbarian bastards will swing that ram as if your lives depend on it which they do he waited a moment to allow the men among them that spoke some latin to translate his words for the others when the gates breached you will be released from your chains and you will then go forward into the fort and take on the defenders with any weapon that you can get your hands on any man that runs will be put down by the soldiers alongside you or behind you without a second thought so if you think thats a better choice than going through the gates you can think again those of you that survive the attack will be freed to return to your villages with your second brand some of the men glanced down at the mark crudely burned into their right forearms c for captivus let me remind you that if you decide to run and in the unlikely event that you actually get away with it the lack of that second brand to cancel out the first one will get you crucified when youre recaptured and that my lads is not a pleasant way to leave this life far better to die cleanly here in the sunlight than choking out your last miserable breaths in agony and with your back opened up like a side of bad meat dubnus nudged his friend keep your eyes open for them once were inside im pretty sure that half of them fought us at lost eagle i even recognise a couple of them and theyll probably be only too happy to take one or two of us with them especially men wearing crests on their piss buckets like you and me marcus nodded grimly as the attacking force came to a halt in front of the massive wooden gates archers ready he glanced back seeing the century of syrian archers arrayed behind their small force taking up positions from which to shower the ramparts with arrows if the defenders were sufficiently unwise to show themselves the legion centurion commanding the rams conscripted bearers pointed at the gates bellowing the command for them to start their assault with a collective grunt of effort the rambearers swung the tree trunk backwards then heaved it forward with a collective lunge the iron heads arc ending against the gates timbers with a rending crash sending a shower of dust cascading down on to the leading tungrian soldiers waiting alongside them a tribesman popped up from behind the wall and lifted his arms to hurl a rock down on to the rams bearers but fell back with an arrow in his neck and a dozen more studding the palisades wooden wall before the missile even left his hands twice more the ram swung back and hammered into the gates creaking timbers and with the fourth blow the lefthand gate sagged tiredly on to the ground ready to fall julius barked an order back into the expectant silence tungrians wait for my command the rams fifth collision with the forts defences ripped away the lefthand door its shattered remnants fell back into the gap between the forts first and second palisades in a cloud of dust and splinters without the strength of its support the righthand gate surrendered after another two blows of the rams massive iron head leaving the gateway open and empty the waiting legionary guards tossed keys to the barbarians chains to the shackled men waiting behind their shields with drawn swords as the prisoners freed themselves from the ram some of the barbarians gathered their chains to use as crude weapons while others simply looked about them at the roman troops gathered to all sides in a combination of hatred and simple terror with the last of them freed the centurion pointed his sword at the gateway go go and earn your freedom for a moment longer the prisoners hesitated until a shaggyhaired giant who had hefted the rams heavy nose with straining muscles bellowed his defiance and loped forward into the fort triggering a collective howl of anger and a sudden mad charge from the men behind him as the last of the barbarians vanished through the gateway julius flashed his sword down advance the four centuries trotted quickly towards the smashed gates opening flinching involuntarily as the bolt throwers on the hill behind them spat their heavy missiles over their heads in a salvo of shrieking iron as marcus rounded the gateway and stepped over the fallen gates shattered timbers a falling man rebounded from the palisade in front of him and hit the ground with a wet crunch of shattered bones a bolt buried deeply in his chest he stepped forward and hacked reflexively at the dying mans head to make sure of the kill then stared up and down the curved face of the inner wall there seemed to be no other target for his sudden urgent need to take his blade to another enemy only the halfnaked barbarian prisoners milling about between the walls to either side of them and a few scattered corpses of the bolt throwers earlier targets he started as a scream sounded from the rampart to his rear suddenly feeling horridly vulnerable to whatever was happening above and behind him instinctively raising his shield as he spun to face the outer wall he felt a clanging thud as a spear intended for his back found only the iron boss in the shields centre the spearman howled his frustration at the miss then staggered forward off the wall and turned a neat halfsomersault to the ground with an arrow buried in his neck the price of standing to make the throw a flicker of movement caught marcuss eye a mob of a hundred or more barbarians streaming round the forts inner wall from his right waving swords and axes in the air as they charged towards their attackers with berserk howls they ripped through the barbarian prisoners without mercy clearly aware of their former allies need for redemption through victory and taking no chances with their loyalties for whatever reason and whether it made sense or not the defenders had committed most of their strength to meeting the tungrian attack head on any chance that the legion cohorts would be bearing the brunt of the battle once the auxiliaries had broken the forts first line of defence was clearly no longer a reality dubnus had seen the barbarian charge and stepped forward with a bellowed command that cut through the moments confusion form a line a good part of the th century was through the gate already and in seconds they had an unbroken wall of shields raised across the gap between the first and second palisades the other centuries clustering to their rear in the thin space between the walls the wave of attackers crashed into them hammering at the shield wall with swords and axes while the tungrians held them at bay and stabbed back at them with practised skill aiming killing blows at their throats bellies and thighs stuck behind the line marcus craned his neck to see what was happening behind the forts enraged defenders as he watched the massively built prisoner who had headed the first wave of attackers through the gateway got back to his feet a dozen paces behind the rearmost enemy warrior a red smear across his forehead indicated that one of the defenders had clubbed him to the ground without taking the precaution of checking that the blow had been sufficient to put him out of the combat he was pointing to something that was out of sight to marcus around the inner walls curve bellowing words that were inaudible over the battles cacophony of screams and curses with a sudden flash of insight marcus realised what he must be pointing at the next gate he turned to dubnus pointing urgently past the seething mob of barbarians on the other side of their shield wall the second gates open give me ten men quickly he sheathed his spatha and tossed the shield aside climbing nimbly up the rough wooden ladder that led on to the walls wooden fighting platform with a sudden burst of energy born of his realisation that the way to the heart of the fort had been left open behind the mass of warriors throwing themselves on to the tungrians shields climbing on to the narrow platform he looked out for a moment across the ridge back to the legion cohorts waiting in the afternoons sunshine their standards gleaming prettily in the sunlight he waved down at the syrian archers with the agreed crossedfists gesture to indicate that the wall was taken the signal to stop shooting at anything that moved along the walls length the archers centurion waved back barking to his men to stand down and another man joined marcus on the rampart his face dimly remembered from his time commanding the th century earlier that summer their eyes met and as marcus raised a hand to beckon him on down the wall in his wake a hot spray of the soldiers blood stung his eyes a heavy bolt had opened his throat with the precision of a surgeons scalpel the mans blood fountaining across marcuss mail armour as the soldier toppled choking back into space and fell on to the men fighting below them another bolt slammed into the timber an inch below the top of the wall directly in line with marcuss stomach and the third screamed past his head with a handspan to spare and no more burying itself in the rough timber of the second palisade another man climbed on to the wall and marcus recognised scarface a th century soldier with little respect for the cohorts officers best keep you fuckin head down centurion or those legion tosspotsll put a dart clean through it marcus nodded ducking below the rampart and beckoning the other man on follow me he scuttled off down the line of the rampart bent almost double slipping and almost falling on a patch of stillwet blood and looked back to make sure that the men who had climbed up after him were following thirty paces around the outer palisades curve from the point he had climbed up he dropped from the platforms eightfoot elevation to land beside the massively muscled prisoner drawing both swords as the man spoke in rough latin his voice a bass rumble gate open we close they trap marcus nodded beckoning his men to jump down whats your name the briton spoke without taking his eyes from the open gate lugos come with me lugos i may need someone that speaks the language and youll be safer with us than staying here if this works youll be a free man by the end of this fight the big barbarian nodded curtly and marcus led his small party along the curve of the inner palisade to the gate still open despite the obvious risk to the forts security marcus peeped round its timber frame seeing a cluster of a dozen warriors standing next to the much smaller opening in the forts third and last wall he pulled his head back speaking quickly to his men theres only one more gate its still open and theyve only left a few men to guard it weve already captured this one and if we can stop them closing that one weve got the fort at our mercy are you with me the three th century men who had followed him nodded readily scarface glaring round at his comrades in a way they knew only too well while the three others from other centuries and therefore less used to his way of doing things stared back with a mixture of uncertainty and apprehension it would have to do the barbarian had acquired a spear from somewhere and stared down at him without any visible expression very well gentlemen lets go and win ourselves a fort he threw himself round the gates wooden frame and shouted a challenge at the warriors guarding the last gate wanting them to see the small number of men charging along the wall at them with a single officer at their head they dithered for a moment caught between the need to deny the romans the gate they were entrusted to guard and the opportunity to kill their enemy and in that time his sprinting pace halved the distance between them glancing back he saw that only the barbarian his three former soldiers and one other man had joined him but it was too late to do anything but face the enemy warriors suddenly confident as they realised that they outnumbered their roman attackers by two to one and came forward with their swords drawn jinking to right and left marcus batted aside the leading warriors swordthrust with the long blade of his spatha and hit the man hard with his right shoulder punching him back into the men behind him and gaining a moments confusion in which his small group could gather their strength spinning away from the tangled knot of barbarians he readied himself to take on another warrior only to see lugos leap at his intended victim with a bloodcurdling howl spitting him through the guts with a downward lunge of the spear he had found and leaving it buried deep in the man taking the sword from his nerveless fingers he raised the weapon over his head and hacked it down into another warriors unprotected head his eyes bulging wide with the bloodlust marcus dragged his gaze from the spectacle in time to parry a swordblow from his left with the gladius short blade spinning to his right and chopping the spathas heavy blade through his attackers spine severing the mans head in a shower of gore the headless corpse toppled stiffly backwards to the turf the other tungrian soldiers were in the fight now crowding in behind scarfaces lead and the gate guards were abruptly on the defensive as they found their strength almost halved marcus looked beyond them to the last gate knowing that their unexpected run of luck could still end in stalemate if the men remaining inside managed to get it closed the eightfoot timbers of the forts innermost palisade were more than stout enough to hold off the attackers for long enough for the remaining occupants to have time to make their escape over the walls on the forts far side and down the steep slopes into the surrounding wild forest whose secret paths only they knew scarface hold them you he pointed at the panting lugos hooking a thumb at the last gate with me the other man nodded understanding the roman officers purpose if not his words and the pair burst past the knot of fighting men and ran hard for the gate a single man hurried through the gap just as they reached it drawn by the sounds of battle and died on the barbarians sword without ever quite comprehending how badly the forts defence was undone the slippery rope of his guts falling through his torn stomach wall as lugos pushed him back against the timber rampart and lunged at him again shoving the swords blade up into his chest to skewer his heart marcus burst through the gate and stopped his swords held ready to fight as he took in the scene before him a wideopen space crowned the hills crest perhaps fifty paces in diameter and surrounded on all sides by the final wooden palisade a single timberbuilt hall stood against the enclosures far wall and the open space between gate and building was studded with smoking cooking pits and the scattered remnants of their last meal a single warrior stood outside the hall and as marcus stood breathing heavily in the gateway he shouted something through the door behind him a massively built warrior stalked through the doorway a fighting axe held in one hand and a round shield in the other the thick gold torc around his bull neck marking him as the tribes king he stood for a moment taking in the sudden reality of his defeat before setting off towards marcus at a lumbering trot with his bodyguard running alongside him the centurion looked back at the gateway behind him seeing that the prisoner was still the only man to have reached as far into the enemys defences he stabbed his spathas long blade into the grass at his feet pointing to the gate and chopping at the air with a bladed hand destroy the gate even if he lost this last fight there would be troops following up soon enough once the battle between the first and second walls was resolved and the forts last gate had to be kept open if that were to mean anything the barbarian nodded taking the swords heavy blade to the uppermost of the gates wooden hinges in a flurry of blows and marcus pulled his spatha from the turf and turned back to find the forts chieftain and his companion less then ten paces distant pointing to the barbarian prisoner the big man growled a command locking his eyes on marcus as his bodyguard trotted warily round the roman officer and ran at the prisoner with his sword held high with a growl of anger the chieftain stepped in to attack the young centurion hacking down at him with his axe and the savage attack left marcus with no option but to step back beyond the blades humming arc out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse as the mans bodyguard and the barbarian prisoner fought in a whirl of blades the two men almost perfectly matched in their skill and strength the chieftain stepped forward and struck again slashing the axe horizontally at marcuss belly in a backhanded blow that knocked aside his sword and connected solidly with his mail armour sending him staggering backwards winded by the blows force even though his mail had stopped the blade from penetrating as he struggled for breath the big man whooped in triumph raising his weapon for the killing blow that would split the romans helmet and cleave his head apart only to stagger and fall as an impact of unimaginable force dumped him on his back the artillery bolt had missed marcus by inches before punching through the big mans mail shirt and burying fully twothirds of its length in his chest a chance hit by a shot fired at random into the figures struggling in the gates skylined opening by some frustrated artilleryman on the far slope the chieftain struggled to get back on his feet making it no farther than one knee he stared stupidly down at the bolt protruding from his body feeling the strength ebbing from him with the blood coursing down his chest then gave marcus a beseeching look as he dropped the axe and shield holding out his arms in readiness for a mercy stroke the roman looked into his eyes for a moment before nodding and then dropped his gladius and wielded the spatha twohanded to sever the grievously wounded tribal leaders head from his shoulders with an executioners stroke the dead mans bodyguard stopped fighting and stepped back from the exhausted prisoner dropping his sword and prostrating himself on the ground gathering his strength the barbarian lifted his sword looking to marcus for a decision the centurion shook his head tiredly pulling the big man out of the gates deadly opening before any more bolts could be sent their way and sat down heavily on the turf his body suddenly trembling as the relentless urge to fight burned out of his blood to leave him shivering in the afternoons warmth let me make sure that ive fully understood this once the forts first gate was open you took half a dozen soldiers and charged off like a man with his arse on fire ignoring your instructions to hold and let the legion cohorts come forward first spear sextus frontinius fixed marcus with a fierce stare from behind his desk raising an eyebrow in a silent invitation to comment yes first spear and as a consequence of disobeying your orders you proceeded to secure both of the gates that the regulars were supposed to capture once youd made the initial break in and cleared the way for them marcus kept his face stony only too well aware of the first spears swift temper he shifted his stare from the wall of the hills hospital visible through the offices open window to the heavy gold torc sitting on the first spears desk frontinius caught the quick glance and his face hardened never mind the jewellery centurion just answer the question yes first spear and to round things off nicely you also engaged the tribal leader of the carvetii in single combat yes first spear although i should point out that i cant take the credit for his death yes i read the dispatch that julius sent ahead of your return march so ive had a day to consider the implications of this latest feat of arms he stopped a bolt in the middle of the fight has anyone got anything to add to this tale of disobeyed orders and glorious victory rufius spoke quickly his tone light yes first spear you should have seen legion tribune antoniuss face he had a golden fortification crown all polished up and ready to hand over to whichever of his officers was first man over the forts last wall and he ended up having to put it away again or else hand it over to an auxiliary cohort centurion marcus shook his head ruefully at the memory of the legion tribunes amazement on hearing that the tungrians had taken the hill fort in less than ten minutes and with only a handful of casualties on the other side of the desk from the four centurions standing to attention in front of him still in their mail armour from the march back to the hill the first spear raised his eyes in amazement to the low ceiling of his office in the cohorts headquarters before turning his glare on the subject of their discussion marcus kept his eyes fixed firmly on the view through the open window and his face expressionless you may well shake your bloody head centurion once again you present me with the ultimate conundrum young man once again ive allowed you out into the countryside only to have you come back with your reputation enhanced and your profile raised youve drawn more attention to yourself than either you or this cohort can bear its a mystery to me that weve not all been nailed up months ago he rubbed reflexively at his bald scalp turning to julius i know tribune antonius isnt the sharpest officer youve ever served under but surely even he could see that theres something not quite right about a man so obviously roman serving in an auxiliary cohort his deputy shrugged in truth first spear i think he was somewhat preoccupied with the fact that a pack of auxiliaries had whipped whatever glory there was to be had from stamping the remnants of the carvetii flat out from under his nose the first spear mused on the comment for a moment yes with a bit of luck hell have been too busy working out how hes ever going to distinguish himself enough to get command of his own legion and not looking too closely at you centurion corvus very well id better go and report to the prefect you four can go and get ready to march to the coast tomorrow weve had word that our replacements have arrived from germania so youd best get over to arab town and get them before someone less deserving finds out theyve arrived and has them away and you corvus can reflect on whether theres any way that you could manage a simple march to the coast and back without taking on and defeating any more barbarian warbands dismissed the four men saluted and trooped out of the office heading for the officers mess the oldest of them a stocky veteran with irongrey hair put an arm around marcuss shoulders and ruffled his coalblack hair affectionately not to worry young marcus i was watching the wetnosed aristocrat like a hawk and ill swear he never made the connection lets go and get a drink eh you and i have new centuries to collect tomorrow eighty big strong tungrian boys apiece and an end to marching around alongside our old centuries while other men undo all our good work he ducked away from dubnuss playful slap current company excepted of course first spear frontinius made his way from the headquarters building to the prefects residence with a reflective look on his face the heavy torc carried in one hand the new prefect had been posted to take command of the cohort less than two weeks previously a post made vacant by the promotion of their previous commanding officer to lead the th legion earlier the same summer the two men had hardly begun the gradual process of getting to know one another so essential if they were to lead their cohort successfully once the fight with the rebels north of the wall was rejoined and yet there was already something about the man that made him feel uncomfortable unlike his previous prefect now the legatus of the imperial th legion and privy to the secrets behind centurion corvuss position with the cohort gaius rutilius scaurus had made no attempt to seek any sort of relationship with his first spear he nodded to the sentries standing guard on the residence and stepped into the buildings cool shade waiting while the prefects taciturn german bodyguard went to fetch his master after a moments delay his superior appeared at the door of his office a tall man in his early thirties with a thin almost ascetic face he was dressed in a simple white tunic with the thin purple stripe on his left shoulder denoting that he was a member of the equestrian class scauruss eyes were a watery grey their seemingly soft gaze set below black hair in a narrow face and with a chin that the first spear was unsure whether to characterise as aristocratic or simply weak but his bearing was confident and his voice was cultured almost urbane first spear wont you come and join me frontinius stepped into the prefects office accepting a beaker of water and taking a seat opposite the prefect the room was lit by a single lamp its shadows pressing in on the two men prefect scaurus took his seat on the other side of his desk his face half lit by the lamps soft glow and took a sip from his own beaker before speaking the detachment has returned i hear i presume that the job of dealing with the locals went well enough since we dont seem to be overrun with wounded yes sir we played our part as requested broke into the fort and dealt with the defenders easily enough three dead and half a dozen wounded none of them seriously enough to need transferring to noisy valley flesh wounds for the most part the officers also managed to retrieve this he put the heavy gold neck ring on the prefects desk watching as the other man picked it up and inspected the finely worked bulls heads that knobbed both ends of the torc a nice donation to the burial club the prefect put the torc back on the desk and nodded with satisfaction but his next words instantly put the older man on his guard and centurion corvus prefect i said and centurion corvus by which first spear i meant to ask you how your youngest officer performed during the defeat of the carvetii frontinius shifted uncomfortably centurion corvus played a full part in the action despite only having gone along for the experience eh my man arminius tells me that the rumour around the fort is that corvus did in five hundred heartbeats what the legion cohorts might have toiled to achieve in five thousand and with a good deal more losses if the natives had managed to get their palisade gates closed and that a certain legion tribune has had his nose put out of joint in a quite spectacular way by his inability to reward one of his own centurions for finishing off the campaign which would probably be just another war story for both of us except that ive been reading the cohorts war diary first spear frontinius he lapsed into silence for a moment fixing frontinius with a level gaze his grey eyes unblinking in their scrutiny of his subordinate and in the record of this cohorts war to date your man corvus seems to have played a full part in just about everything thats happened in the last six months he must be quite the man with his colleagues not to mention the troops an uncomfortable silence played out for several seconds before the prefect spoke again as i read the story of your cohorts actions early in the campaign i began to wonder two things first spear i began to wonder just how one man could cause so much disruption to the enemys plans he was commanding the scout century prefect and so he was always going to and more importantly first spear i found myself wondering just how on earth he managed to avoid the eye of the succession of senior officers who must have heard of his exploits and decided that they wanted to know more about this remarkable young centurion of yours im sure you can understand my pondering on these questions about this cohort of mine given that its my responsibility to ensure its complete loyalty to the emperor the first spear opened his mouth to reply but found himself forestalled by the prefects raised hand before you answer first spear frontinius ive got one more question that im pondering and i would be very careful with your answer if you value your place here just why is it im wondering that i find myself commanding a cohort which has an officer who as we speak is still being hunted by the emperors secret police as a traitor to the throne frontinius sat in stunned silence for a moment the prefects face darkening with his failure to reply come on man just how stupid do you think i am the mans obviously roman the name marcus tribulus corvus shouts alias and hes blessed with skill and speed with arms that probably cost him ten years training with the best teachers as it happens i hear that the son of senator appius valerius aquila a man of high position and reputation who was tortured and executed for treason earlier this year is known to have spent most of his young life having fighting skills drilled into him by his fathers tame gladiators in preparation for service with the praetorians he is known to have shipped out for britannia on faked orders only weeks before his fathers death at the hands of the emperors investigators and first spear he is known to have vanished into thin air after two attempts to kill him both of which ended with other mens blood spilt but not apparently that of their intended victim this man valerius aquila who was more or less the age that your tribulus corvus appears to be is believed to have benefited from the assistance of local troops and the finger of suspicion was pointing squarely at the sixth legions former legatus until he was careless enough to leave both his legions eagle and his own head on the battlefield last spring perhaps legatus sollemnis was fortunate that his death was both quick and honourable he paused raking the first spear with a long hard stare the man behind the throne first spear remains convinced that the aquila boy is sheltering with an army unit somewhere in northern britannia and if praetorian prefect perennis ever lacked motivation to have him found and killed the death of his own son in this province earlier this year coupled with extraordinary rumours of the younger perennis having been murdered while apparently executing an act of treason will only have stiffened that resolve the emperors corn officers will be out in force across the northern frontier with orders to kill not only the fugitive but the leaders of any military unit found sheltering him and to exercise their discretion in further punishing the men of that unit i think we both know that the dirtyjobs boys have never been backward when it comes to handing out summary justice and id imagine that you for one would end up choking out your last breath on a cross with every centurion in the cohort likely already dead in front of you your men would be decimated at the very least and as for your previous prefect now legatus equitius i believe well i wouldnt care to occupy his shoes either so first spear youd better explain to me just why my cohort is sheltering an enemy of the empire and why on earth i should tolerate the situation for a minute longer start talking the hills officers mess steward was contentedly dozing off in his quiet corner when the door opened and a centurion stepped into the messs lamplight and looked about him seeking out the steward the newcomer was a greyhaired man with a stocky build in late middle age to judge from his seamed face and at first glance more likely to be a trader than a soldier but the man behind the mess counter knew better steward wine four cups and make it something decent if youve any jars left fit for anything better than unstopping blocked arses no doubt our brother officers have been throwing the stuff down their necks like greek sailors while weve been away defending the cohorts reputation more officers were crowding the doorway behind him shift your backside rufius ive got a thirst that demands prompt service julius clapped a hand on rufiuss shoulder and manoeuvred past him into the mess dropping his cloak on to a table and stretching with genuine weariness he was a head taller than the older man his build both muscular and athletic while his greystreaked heavy black beard reinforced the slightly piratical look of his face dubnus came through the door behind him his physique if anything more magnificent even if he looked less comfortable than his colleagues still not quite at ease with his exalted status centurions the steward knew from experience were uncertain for their first few weeks with a vine stick in their hands but very quickly never to be proved wrong in all the days that followed come on dubnus stop lurking get in here and get your cloak off youre an officer now so theres no need to simper in the doorway like some bloody virgin invited to her first orgy dubnus favoured his brother officer with a dirty look and stepped inside turning back to beckon marcus in with a curiously deferential gesture as rufius stepped up to the counter and slapped down a coin of a decent if not exceptional value if your wine is worthy of the name well be drinking here all night and you steward will earn this for keeping us well supplied come on marcus lets have you at the bar with your right arm ready for action the steward nodded deferentially this was the kind of officer he could cope with over the older mans shoulder he watched the youngest man step into the lamplight gods what a collection he mused rufius legiontrained and a seasoned blend of piss and vinegar julius the supreme warrior in the prime of his fighting career all muscles scars and confidence dubnus the former chosen man newly promoted into a dead mans boots and still adapting to their fit and the roman leaner than the others lacking their obvious muscle but known to every man in the cohort by the respectful title two knives the other three were all good enough centurions respected and feared by their men in equal measure but the roman was the one officer in the fort that any man would follow into danger without ever needing an order rufius passed a cup each to julius and dubnus beckoning marcus to join them get a grip of one of these cups marcus fiddled for a moment with the pin holding his cloak together and rufius gave the heavy piece of jewellery a knowing look still wearing that pin eh dont say i didnt warn you if the bloody thing goes missing julius let him through to the counter julius turned to look at the young centurion as he twisted the ornate badge to open its pin he looked hard for a moment at the ornate replica of a round cavalry shield decorated with an intricate engraving of mars in full armour sword raised to strike so thats what the pair of you rode all that way to find very pretty rufius took the younger mans cloak and tossed it on to the piled table its just about all hes got to remind him of his father theres a personal inscription on the shields rear too which makes it even more precious to him that was all we could recover from the bundle we buried that morning dubnus and i pulled his nuts out of the fire outside yew grove the hulking young officer standing behind them laughed softly his discomfort with the novelty of his status suddenly forgotten dubnus and i i seem to recall that all you did was wave your sword about while i had to throw myself around like a fortress whore on payday rufius grinned poking his friend in the belly one wellfavoured axethrow from no more than spitting distance and the butchery of a defenceless horse and suddenly hes oneeyed horatius anyway the point is that when we dug up the bundle we buried back then that was all there was worth keeping that and the lads last message from his father marcus shivered at the memory of opening the watertight dispatch riders message cylinder and reading a few lines from his fathers message from the grave into the cold dawn air a few days before by the time you reach britannia i expect that commodus and his supporters will have laid formal charges of treason at our familys door i will have been tortured for information as to your whereabouts then killed without ceremony or hearing whatever the ugly detail of their ending our kindred will be taken and killed out of hand our honour publicly denounced and our line almost brought to an abrupt full stop you are almost certainly all that remains of our blood he shook himself free of the momentary introspection raising the cup of wine to his friends and enough of that theres wine waiting lets have a toast gentlemen tungrian comrades living and dead living and dead they raised their cups and drank heres a toast for you julius raised his cup and looked around the small group with a wry smile ill drink to that moment at lost eagle when uncle sextus started humping that chieftains severed head in front of twenty thousand wildeyed bluenoses that was the moment i was sure i was going to die they drank again rufius nudged dubnus with his elbow your turn centurion after a moments silent thought the young officer raised his cup to lucky wherever he is now julius drank and laughed sharply not so lucky after all all those years with never a scratch only to get his hair parted by a bluenose axe his loss your gain the four men nodded silently sharing a moment of memory marcus raised his cup to rufius a questioning look on his face and your toast grandfather my toast ill raise my cup to those we loved who are no longer with us the other men nodded lifting their cups in silent salute rufius draining his and hammering it down on the long wooden bar with a smack of his lips a refill steward well be sitting over there by the stove it might be late in the month of junius but its bloody cold for all that it began prefect back in the month of februarius one of my chosen men brought a young man in peasant clothing to the forts main gate frontinius told prefect scaurus the story of marcuss fight to gain a place with the cohort in swift and economical sentences taking care not to exaggerate his recollection in any way when his story was complete scaurus sat in silence for a moment before speaking first spear you present me with a dilemma greater than any puzzle requiring a solution during my years of learning a long silence hung in the air between them frontinius judged it best to keep his mouth shut as he waited for the prefect to resume what he expected to be a onesided conversation it occurs to me that while i know what you have done i do not yet understand why so first spear frontinius help me understand your decision with regard to this fugitive from imperial justice in your own time the prefect rose from his chair and paced across the room turning to look straight into his senior centurions eyes now his face was in shadow unreadable while the lamp behind him would show him any emotions crossing the first spears face the first spear pondered his response for a moment before abandoning any thought of attempting to put any particular shine on the story you want to know why i agreed to allow a man wanted for treason to take sanctuary with the cohort there is no one reason but ill try to make why i did what i did clear for you i suppose we can ignore the fact that both the man and his father were innocent of any of the charges laid against their family although im convinced that was the case scaurus shrugged without interest its immaterial first spear he could be as pure as a novice priestess and that would change nothing my question wasnt about his widely accepted guilt i want to know why hes here frontinius nodded very well in the first place it was my prefect septimius equitius who made the request of me and he is a man whose judgement i had learned to trust during his time in command here he owed a debt of honour to sollemnis the former legatus of sixth victorious the legatus was the boys real father and this was the way in which he was being asked to discharge that debt and dont mistake this for an attempt to shift the blame to legatus equitius if theres a hammer and nails in my future then ill do my own dying however protracted the agony might be i can only cross the river once all im trying to say is that there was a mans honour involved in the decision he paused for a moment picking his next line of attack there was benefit to the cohort too i exacted a price for corvuss acceptance from legatus sollemnis in addition to the large sum of money that he contributed to the burial fund corvus was accompanied here by a legion centurion not long retired a legion cohorts first spear in fact and i made his service here for a year part of the bargain he chuckled darkly unable to resist the humour in his memory of tiberius rufiuss smug smile once he had a vine stick back in his hand turns out the man would have killed with his bare hands for the chance to bellow his lungs out at a century one more time there was one more reason for my decision the most important of all i would have given prefect equitius the hard word if i hadnt seen something in the boy and neither his honour nor the gold and not even the bonus centurion that sweetened the deal would have swayed me im not stupid enough to go risking my life and those of the officers i serve with not without a good reason scaurus shifted staring hard into his eyes what reason frontinius stared back at him his eyes flint hard in the halflight hes a born soldier prefect simply that a born soldier ive spent most of my adult life chasing recruits round these hills teaching them how to take their iron to the barbarians that threaten their people ive seen thousands of them good bad and indifferent and ill tell you now without hesitation that hes the most able warrior ive ever met and the best leader to boot he knows what to do he does it without hesitation and hes faster and more skilled with a blade than any man ive met the men of his former century would cover his arse with their shields even if it put them at risk of catching a spear themselves given a different roll of the dice he would have risen to command a legion without breaking sweat he stopped unable to read the prefects expression in the shadows you werent at the battle of lost eagle prefect but if you had been you wouldnt be asking me to explain my decision when you get the chance to see him fight then youll know what i mean when i tell you that youll never see a man throw his iron around with so much grace or so much purpose the prefect laughed quietly very poetic frontinius shook his head dismissively fuck poetry that was simple fact and now prefect youve toyed with me for long enough youve made your decision now have the decency to tell me what it is if you want me on a cross then thats how ill depart this life but i warn you if you plan to nail him up then youd better have something good up your sleeve because theres at least one century of tungrians that will paint the floor black with their own blood and that of anyone that gets in their way before theyll stand still and watch that happen far to the north of the roman wall whose stones he had so recently trodden as conqueror in a forest clearing not unlike the one in which the war had been set in train a few short months before calgus lord of the northern tribes was arguing his corner against growing opposition while only one of the tribal leaders dared to speak out against him half a dozen other implacable faces were arrayed behind the old man mirroring his grim obduracy calgus shook his head and scowled at the old man raising his hands and eyes to the skies as if to seek guidance from their gods no brennus we have not lost this war in fact this war has barely begun and yet already we have two mighty prizes to parade in front of our people the king of the votadini tribe leaned back tiredly in his chair glaring back at calgus from beneath the hood of a heavy cloak as you keep saying my people are expected to be happy with the head of a dead roman officer and a meaningless metal bird on a stick when what they really need is their dead menfolk back that and an end to the killing can you magic forth either of those things from your bird on a stick calgus at least we had peace with the romans before this war unlike your troublesome selgovae there were no forts on our territory before this revolt whereas your lands were already studded with their outposts you argued for us to abandon our ties with the romans when you had already long since soured your relationship with them like a fox without a tail convincing its brothers to go without theirs the old man looked around to his fellows holding his hands out in apparent exasperation now they will litter our territory with their soldiers in the way that they already control your tribes land we will live under their control no longer trusted to run our own affairs but instead jealously watched and herded like the cattle we will become the old king was pushing harder than calgus had expected encouraged by the knowledge that he had more than enough supporters around the grove to give calguss bodyguards a decent fight and made bold by the combination of his anger and apparent security calgus took a deep breath and started again they used to control our land but not any more king brennus you may recall that we burned out every fort on selgovae ground in the first two days of our war with these usurpers the selgovae are newly freed from their oppressive presence on our land and we will not lightly fall back under their domination the prizes that we took in battle with the romans will draw the northern tribes back to us they are the symbols of an empire grown newly vulnerable they tell us that the legions can be defeated that we can be free again they tell us that the votadini king laughed at him in shockingly open defiance stiffening calguss posture with astonished anger they tell us that we got lucky calgus they tell us that you turned a roman against his own to lead a legion on to ground that made them helpless against our attack we cannot expect such fortune again if indeed i should call it fortune we may have defeated a legion but before the end of that day we were running like frightened children with two more legions on our heels and their bloody cavalry i lost a son to their spears a son i will never see again thanks to this adventure of yours a son whose head will have been taken by their soldiers to decorate some barrack or other his nephew martos a scarfaced warrior with a fearsome reputation in battle stared at calgus from behind his uncles chair with a look of thinly veiled anger a halfdozen of his men at his back brennus sat back in the chair his eyes locked on calguss and with a flash of insight the selgovae king knew that the challenge was coming he strolled easily across the ground between them looming over the old man and bending to speak quietly into his face martos and his men stiffened ready to air their blades if calgus as much as touched their leader got a new champion have you old man could it be your sisters boy thats stood behind you perhaps or will you do this the oldfashioned way and turn your men loose on mine see who prevails eh brennus looked him straight in the face no sign of fear in his eyes there will be no challenge if you agree to make peace with the romans they have two full legions on our soil even now they dominate the land around their destroyed forts on the north road as they start to rebuild them and yet you claim to have broken their grip on us for ever if we seek to offer them resistance those legions will roll over us and grind us into the ground we stand on he shook his head at calgus then turned to the men behind him this rebellion is over were back in the iron fist but this time therell be no roman tribute payment to soften the indignity of our lost sovereignty the best we can hope for is to trade those cursed spoils of battle and humble promises of peace and good behaviour for some measure of normality until we do their legions will trample our land and people under foot forever seeking revenge for their wounded pride calgus turned away affecting to consider the suggestion it was more than a suggestion of course more like an order from the leaders of the other tribes arrayed behind the old man and an assured death sentence for him if the tribes negotiated with rome he knew that nothing less than his own head alongside that of the roman legatus currently sat in a jar of cedar oil in his tent would satisfy their lust for revenge not unless they could take him alive of course for a lengthy humiliation and eventual ritual execution he turned back to face the implacable faces with a slow secret smile so its to be peace at the price of my head if thats how you all want it i suppose i have little choice and ill have the satisfaction of knowing that my sacrifice wont be the only one you have to make he stood and waited watching a glimmer of understanding dawn on the old mans face while the others around him frowned their incomprehension you have hostages calgus shook his head sadly brennus brennus what do you take me for of course ive taken hostages since youre all culpable for our defeat you can all pay the price for our surrender if you betray me you betray your closest family members he pointed at each man in turn your sons will never reach manhood your wife will never warm your bed again your daughters will never run to their fathers arms again and to be quite clear they will all leave this life in slow hard ways ive sent the right men to make sure of that he spread his arms wide encompassing the gathering with a feral grin so if you want to take my head for your wouldbe roman friends go ahead he waited ten long seconds for anyone to move i thought not he stepped close to the seated elder a grim scowl replacing the smile in that case lets get back to business as usual shall we and in case any of you are tempted to put a sword in my back ill warn you that if the men holding your family members dont receive messages from me as expected then youll be killing your loved ones just as if youd put the knife to them yourselves brennus stared up at him with a look of horrified distaste do you expect to rule us in this way for ever calgus for ever brennus of course not but i will keep you under control for long enough that we can finish the job we started the romans may have twenty thousand angry troops in the field but theyre on unfamiliar ground in a land filled with hostile tribes and the legions from the south and west cant stay up here for ever the first sniff of trouble in their own areas and the governor will have them away down the road to their fortresses leaving the sixth legion and the auxiliaries to hold the line ill have them bottled up behind their wall by the end of the summer and then well see if your people still want peace on roman terms ill chop our invaders up piece by piece ill make them rue their desire to expand into our lands and i will send them away with their tails between their legs and you brennus all of you fools you should worry less about for ever and more about the next few days marcus was still discussing the next days march to arab town with his friends when the prefects orderly delivered a polite request for the centurion to join prefect scaurus and the first spear in his residence he went back to his quarter changed into a clean tunic and hurried up the hill just as the evenings quiet gloom was finally surrendering to night and the torches were being lit along the forts streets inside the building he was conducted to the prefects private rooms where he was surprised to find scaurus sitting opposite frontinius a sword unsheathed in his lap at the rooms far end stood a foothigh statue surrounded by a ring of small candles it was a representation of a man in the act of stabbing a bull to death his left hand pulling back the animals head while the other wielded the knife buried in its throat the first spear nodded to the chair set facing the two men take a seat centurion he sat down with a questioning glance to both of the men already pretty much sure of the reason for the summons the prefect nodded a greeting tapping the swords blade forgive the impolite nature of this meeting marcus valerius aquila but given the circumstances i decided that not to take the precaution would be foolhardy marcus nodded his understanding keeping his eyes fixed on the prefects youll know why ive asked you to join us he nodded again youve uncovered my secret prefect and you want to talk to me before you decide what to do with me the senior officer raised an eyebrow youre assuming that i havent already made that decision yes sir i am if youd already decided to have me arrested i would have found myself at the point of a sword without warning my hands bound and then thrown into the punishment cells for safe keeping and if youd already decided to ignore my situation i probably wouldnt even be here youd be agreeing with the first spear the best way to keep me out of trouble as it is you have a sword ready to use which implies either mistrust of my potential actions or a lack of confidence in your own abilities or both scaurus laughed flashing a glance at frontinius confident even in the face of execution valerius aquila ive lived with the prospect of an unjust death like the one visited on my father my mother my brother my sisters my uncle and my cousins for several months now its hard to stay scared for that long prefect he closed his mouth and waited for the prefect to speak scaurus looked into his eyes for a moment then shrugged slightly and continued like you i was born and raised in rome unlike you although i am the son of an old and respected line i was not born to a wealthy family our clan fell on hard times during the year of the four emperors my ancestor was unlucky enough to back the wrong man a hundred years ago and the emperor vespasian made him pay for it with enough severity that for a while it was touch and go as to whether the family name would survive at all weve managed to rub along well enough since then but weve never been sufficiently well connected to amount to very much beyond the usual imperial service a rather shabby existence for a family that can trace its line almost seven hundred years back to the overthrow of the last king of the city my mother died in childbirth and my father was killed serving on the german frontier when i was young and so i found myself living with my uncles family essentially a burden to them and if not resented hardly welcomed with open arms it was inevitable that i would seek a means of escape from their charity and i found it in the patronage of a man of great power he paused a halfsmile playing on his lips as he surveyed the listening men and now youre wondering in just what way i prostituted myself to make that connection exactly what was it i had to offer an older man that would make him take me into his house and treat me like a son what did i give him in return for the status and favour that he bestowed on me he laughed harshly ive lived with the sideways glances and innuendos for half of my life now but in point of fact my benefactor simply took a chance on me he plucked me from a life destined to disappoint everyone involved not least me and he raised my face to see the heights to which i might climb he did this because he saw something in my wildness that he believed was worth his time and effort to bring to fruition he looked into the eyes of a disaffected youth and saw a warrior waiting to be released he stood raising the sword to point at the complex statue standing amid its ring of tiny bright flames he made one small change to my life almost insignificant compared to what youve been through valerius aquila but just as deep in its impact as the traumas youve endured he brought me to the worship of the god mithras the unconquered sun the soldiers true god and in doing so he gave me the purpose i was lacking i wont bore you with the changes that my service to mithras has wrought on my life but i will tell you this his decision to take the chance that i could be rehabilitated led me to the path i still follow a life of service to mithras and the warrior code followed by my sponsor and his brothers men who became through my service to the god my brothers too he stared at the statue for a long moment before continuing dont underestimate mithras either of you i have been in more than one tight situation with weaker men around me reduced to little better than panic including some that were appointed to lead their fellow men into battle and my faith in him has kept my sword hand steady and ready to exploit the opportunities that he always provides he turned pointing the swords long blade directly at marcus i can see in you the same restless purpose that i felt fifteen years ago and which my sponsor chose to harness in the service of our god you can do great things valerius aquila or you can continue with your current path and eventually be discovered and put to death alongside those you have come to regard as your brothers every day that you remain here is another toss of the coin another chance for the emperors head to land face down and destroy everything you hold dear i have a choice for you to make between service to a noble god in the pursuit of the soldiers ideal and hanging on here until the day that your hiding place is discovered he paused for a moment raising an eyebrow at the younger man you offer to protect me prefect the prefect smiled his teeth a white flash in the gloom i offer you rather more than that valerius aquila i offer you friendship a kind of kinship if you like i can never replace your family but i can give you something to which you can belong without forever endangering it simply by your presence and as the price for this bargain you will take me from this place and these people when the time is right you will leave here marcus frowned slightly there is a lady scaurus nodded i know first spear frontinius enlightened me on that subject and when the time is right she can accompany you to wherever you travel if she will mithras wants your service for you to live the life of a warrior not for you to cut yourself off from the world there is room in your life for both your god and your woman marcus nodded slowly his face creased in thought it is a generous offer prefect scaurus although i still wonder exactly how you can protect me from the empires hunters scaurus smiled tightly so do i given your apparent talent for drawing attention to yourself in time you will come to better understand both the forces hunting you and those arraigned behind me but for the time being it will be enough for you simply to trust me so your decision marcus thought for a long moment staring into the rooms shadows i will do as you bid prefect i will follow you as you command and i will serve your god to the best of my ability scaurus nodded decisively good perhaps in this way well be able to keep you from the thrones hunting dogs and avoid the danger of your friends and comrades being taken down alongside you quite how we are to keep you out of public scrutiny in the meantime is a different question altogether the first arrow missed its target by less than a foot hissing unheard past the heads of the rearmost ranks soldiers of the other four arrows fired a second later one flew cleanly past the astonished faces of four soldiers near the back of the centurys column another fell short owing to a weak bowstring and the last two found targets among the marching soldiers the first flicked off the metal boss of a shield slung over its owners shoulder in the marching position ricocheting into the throat of one of the soldiers in the following rank while the other hit a man three ranks farther up the marching column in the calf he stumbled out of the line of march hopping a couple of paces before falling to one knee the centurys chosen man marching in his usual place at the columns rear pointed at the treeline with his brassknobbed pole and shouted a warning to his centurion archers julius reacted immediately drawing his sword and pointing it at the trees buckets and boards get your bloody guard up he turned to the leading century gesturing urgently for dubnus to take his men around to the right through the trees that ran almost to the side of the road as the forests edge curved around from the barbarian archers position dubnus hook right get into the bastards another flight of missiles arced across the space between the forest and the road hammering into shields hurriedly swung from their carrying positions to face the unexpected threat julius bellowed again ignoring the arrows flicking past him fifth century face the threat get ready to attack the ninth will attack into the trees to our right at the march advance the troops obeyed the order without thought their obedience drummed into them over long years of drill and practice fighting and reinforced by the shouts and pushes of their chosen man and his watch officer the th century advanced to their left into the scrub between road and forest their shields raised against the continual harassing rain of arrows from the trees a hundred paces away while the th century to their right advanced briskly into the forest to their front in broken order hunting through the trees for the rebel archers marcus who had been marching alongside dubnus snatched a spear from the man closest to him and sprinted ahead of the advancing soldiers outpacing even the fastest of them as he weaved around the massive oaks at a dead run bursting through the scrubby bushes that dotted the gloomy forest floor the halfdozen brigantian archers took fright in the face of the th centurys advance across the open ground in front of them their attack only ever intended to harass the auxiliary soldiers rather than bring them to open battle turning in their retreat to loose one last volley at the advancing romans as they turned back to run for the shelter of the deeper forest marcus now a good twenty paces ahead of dubnus and his men and still running hard drew back his spear arm and fixed his gaze on the rearmost of the barbarians slowing his run to a trot and drawing back the spear until its razorsharp iron head was level with his ear he hurled the weapon with a power and artistry that made light of his sprint through the trees his arm extended to follow the missiles trajectory to its target caught in the act of turning to run from the vengeful soldiers the archer had only a split seconds realisation a fleeting glimpse of the weapons blurred flight before the spear arced down out of the trees and spitted him cleanly through the thigh he toppled to the forest floor his mouth gaping in a howl of agony as marcus covered the remaining distance to stand over him with his sword drawn watching the remaining tribesmen vanish into the forests gloom as he sheathed the weapon julius and dubnus joined him his hands on his hips as he stared down at the fallen barbarian apparently breathing normally in spite of his exertions nice throw marcus thats worth a few cups of wine once we get to arab town you didnt even hit the bone the younger man scowled stretching out his arm and spreading the fingers wide before bunching them into a fist and looking down at his knuckles crisscrossed with scar tissue from his long years of tuition at the hands of his fathers bodyguards i must be losing my touch julius i was aiming for the middle of his back his brother officer laughed mirthlessly and nevertheless tragic though it is that you missed your mark by a foot with a spear slung on the run between trees here we have that rarest of commodities he extended an arm to gesture to the tribesman still writhing with the pain of his wound a live barbarian captive a bit soiled ill give you that but in no real danger of dying any time soon and ripe for a few questions id say he reached out and rapped on the spears wooden shaft then took a hold of it and twisted it sharply rotating the wooden shaft inside the mans wound the tribesman screamed again louder than before his eyes bulging with the effort wrung from his painracked body the centurion smiled down at him i thought that might hurt anything you feel like telling us the barbarian snarled back at him spitting defiantly at his armoured chest julius smiled back even more broadly looking down at the spittle dribbling down the shining metal rings oh good a challenge hearing a voice behind him he stood up turning away from the fallen tribesman rufius had crossed the gap between the road and the forests edge and now stood staring into the shadows cast by the trees he had picked up a fallen arrow and was examining the barbed head closely talking in conversational tones to his comrades one of ours id say that puts paid to the story that they were all burned when we put the noisy valley stores to the torch just a shootandrun do you think or were they hoping to lure us into some nasty little ambush that was the way in my day julius shrugged his indifference your day rufius well my friend these days its just shootandrun these are simple village boys not tattooed tava valley head jobs i suppose it beats shooting at the squirrels casualties the older man nodded his face solemn youve lost one man he choked on his own blood before i could even get a bandage carrier to him and youve one man with another one of these stuck in his leg itll come out easily enough once we get him to arab town the centurion shook his head disgustedly and then squatted back down next to his captive batting away the mans hands from their ineffectual fretting at the spear wound and switching to the mans native language as he addressed the captive id leave that well alone if i were you its going to hurt a lot more when it comes out he took a firm grip of the spears shaft the fallen tribesmans eyes slitting in expectation of the pain to come and now my lad and without any further delay since were in a hurry to get off down the road to collect some more soldiers you can tell me which village youre from the wounded man closed his eyes and shook his head a tear trickling down his cheek julius slapped his face gently shaking his head with mock sadness come on sonny you know youre going to tell me sooner or later just cough it up now and save us both the unpleasantness the tribesman shook his head grimly youre going to kill me anyway just get it over with marcus squatted down alongside julius his expert eye appraising the tribesmans wound as he spoke hes got a point piss off two knives im going to get the name of this stupid bastards village and then and then youre going to do what exactly burn it to the ground kill every adult male the place will probably be deserted once his mates get back there and tell their story all well ever achieve if we seek to punish these people for the crimes of a very few is turn more of them against us than ever attacked us in the first place julius stood his face a picture of exasperation one hand gesturing back to their captive so what do we do then eh marcus just how do you propose to send these bastards the message that if they take us on theyll end up regretting it the younger man shrugged pointing down at the wounded tribesman kill him either that or get that spear out of his leg and get us back on the road just dont fool yourself that if you kill him youll achieve anything other than to turn another dozen men from neutrals to enemies the older man stared at him with a troubled expression and what about the fact that he was part of an ambush that killed one of our men marcus nodded extending a hand to indicate the tribesmans wound hes got a spear through his leg id say thats a decent down payment on what hell have to suffer for the rest of his life hell probably never run again hell most likely walk with a limp hell pay for his stupidity over the next thirty years but this way hes not a martyr for these fools to shout about just a constant reminder of what happens when you cross the wrong people bandage carrier he reached out and pulled the weapon smoothly up through the horrified tribesmans thigh easing its blade out of the wounds opening with delicate care and passing it to dubnus the wounded mans eyes rolled up as he lost consciousness sagging back on to the hard ground marcus turned to the medic summoned by his call get that leg tied off enough to stop the bleeding and keep him alive wiping his hands on a handful of grass the young officer turned back to his colleagues there you go hell live but hell be crippled for the rest of his days a burden on his tribe and every time he walks past itll send a powerful message to everyone around him if you want to roll the dice with the big boys youd better be sure you can afford the stakes come on lets put your casualties on a cart and get back on the road to arab town i suddenly find myself in need of a drink night was falling across the fortified port of arab town by the time the tungrian officers had their men bedded down for the night and were free to head for the officers mess the forts looming stable blocks and barracks were silent silhouettes against the sunsets red glow and only the ports pilot boat was anchored at the wooden pier that jutted out into the german sea in stark contrast to the barely organised chaos that had greeted their previous visits during the summer to collect supplies shipped in from across the empires northern provinces infantrymen and cavalrymen their mounts weapons armour boots shields supplies and more had flowed through the port over the previous few weeks drawn from legions and supply depots across the german frontier and beyond as the roman forces in britannia scrambled to make good the disastrous losses incurred by the imperial th legion at the battle of lost eagle for the first time in all those weeks the forts officers mess was quiet a relief from the hard drinking and inevitable boisterous behaviour of officers passing through to new roles with units in the field determined to get thoroughly drunk one last time before months of enforced abstinence the tungrian centurions had just settled down around the stove for the evening when the door opened to admit two officers the newcomers shrugging off their cloaks and luxuriating for a moment in the rooms warmth rufius turned to greet them frowning up from his chair you two look familiar arent you the older of the two newcomers nodded second tungrians im tertius this is appius rufius stood and offered his hand im rufius formerly sixth legion and now an adopted member of the first tungrian cohort these cheeky young bastards have taken to calling me grandfather this big arrogant specimen is julius or latrine to his men for reasons ill leave you to ponder he commands the lead century while this even bigger young lad is our newest centurion dubnus the quiet man in the corner wearing youll note two swords is two knives tertius narrowed his eyes two knives like the gladiators just like the gladiators only faster much faster tertius raised an eyebrow now that id like to see rufius laughed grimly youve missed the last performance at least for a while he only really waves them around at full speed when theres blood to be spilt and we havent seen much of that since lost eagle speaking of which steward wine for our friends here you lads saved our bacon on that shitspattered hillside and we havent forgotten it the two newcomers pulled up chairs and made themselves comfortable while the steward ferried cups of wine to the group a toast tertius raised his cup the lost eagle they drank and then tertius wiped his mouth on his sleeve and spoke again you know theres a hefty reward for the soldier that recovers the standard rufius nodded tertius took another mouthful of his wine aye and well be out looking for the bloody thing soon enough that and the head of the idiot that lost it once weve collected our new prefect and legged it back to join the rest of the cohort were slated for a tour up north to see whats going on along the main road to three mountains marcus tribulus corvus pulled a face and stared at the floor whats the matter with your mate rufius took a sidelong glance at his companion not everyone has a bad opinion of the late legatus sollemnis we were there when a nasty little shit by the name of perennis sent the sixth legion into that ambush by lying through his teeth that the ground for their approach march was safe he tried to kill our prefect too except dubnus here put his axe through the wouldbe executioners spine and then shot the traitor off his horse at thirty paces beautiful piece of work that shot he darted a warning glance at marcus an imperceptible shake of his head before turning back to the newcomers anyway a new prefect wheres he come from to be coming ashore here tertius took another mouthful of wine germania apparently supposed to be some kind of fireeater from what weve heard keen as black seed mustard apparently weve come down the wall with two centuries to escort him back to join up with the cohort at the rock before we go north and you lads are here for reinforcements julius spoke up his voice a deep rumble two centuries worth of real tungrians trained armed armoured and ready to march just enough to get us back to something like full strength after the losses we took in that goatfuck at lost eagle and the only troops left in the port if i dont count a couple of centuries of hamian fairies twanging their bows in the next barrack were lucky to be getting them with so much competition for replacements but our old prefects commanding the sixth legion now which counts for something grandfather and two knives have command of our two empty centuries broken up to provide replacements to bring the other eight up to strength and weve come to collect their replacement soldiers dubnus and i are along for the ride with our boys just to make sure they got here unmolested and just as well given the fun we had on the way tertius nodded grimly barbarian bowmen between fine view and white strength yes we lost one man and had another wounded you two wounded local boys showing off to each other most likely they know weve got better things to do than take the time required to catch them in the act one of these days though he tipped the rest of the wine down his neck my shout more wine steward and a beer for me make it a large one an hour and several drinks later the second tungrian officers got to their feet appius previously more or less silent inclined his head in salute his tongue clearly loosened by the wine youll have to excuse us brothers we have an appointment at the guest house with our new officer lets hope this ones a little more balanced than the previous idiot that way he might get to live a bit longer even with the wines effects rufius was instantly alert despite his apparent torpor he nudged marcuss foot beneath the table to warn him raising a curious eyebrow and smiling slyly up at the two men we did hear the rumours its true then prefect bassus really stopped a friendly spear tertius grimaced but his colleague appius kept talking without any apparent concern well now if you ask the question that way ive got no idea what happened but if you were to speculate that bassus had pissed off the wrong men one time too many id have to agree that theres a certain kind of officer who takes a risk when he turns his back on his own men in a battle anyway enough said good luck with your recruits and watch out for those bloody archers he scooped up his helmet and reached for his cloak dragging it across the pile of garments and pulling loose the pin from marcuss in the process he bent and picked up the gold shield from the floor giving its intricate workmanship an appreciative glance and turning it over and noting the words engraved on the obverse before he held it up with an apologetic face sorry ive pulled this loose from someones cloak marcus put a hand out with a tight smile and tucked the pin away in his pocket ignoring a pointed look from rufius outside the mess pulling his cloak tighter about him in the evenings cold as they headed for the guest house appius nudged his colleague did you see that quiet lads sword not the long cavalry blade the other one with the eagleshead pommel prettier than a whores makeup box proper flash ill bet you hes the one theyre saying got left a blade by the dead legatus and you have to wonder why that would be eh and that cloak pin thatd make big money from the right buyer and it had an interesting inscription too keep warm my son and an aquila carved beneath the words no way hes local thats for certain in fact ill bet hes the same one that was supposed to be putting it to bassuss wife before the lads in the third century perforated his back tertius shook his head his face thoughtful no idea not that id blame the boy if he was theres no denying shes a tasty little piece right here we are keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking they entered the towns official guest house and were shown into the back room a massively built man sat picking at the remains of a chicken in the light of several lamps his thick brown beard slick with the birds fat he reached for a towel and wiped his hands and face sit down gentlemen wine tertius took a chair motioning to his colleague to do the same thank you prefect a cup would be nice the senior officer waited until the wine was poured and the housekeeper had withdrawn before speaking again raising his cup in salute before drinking his voice was hard edged clearly accustomed to being heard without interruption second tungrians eh i was told youre a battletested cohort i was told that im lucky to be getting a cohort here at this time with the barbarians still in the field and plenty of glory left to be had and i was told lots of things about the second tungrians that should make for an interesting discussion once were north of the wall with some time to spare in the meanwhile there are a few things id like to know tertius put his cup down and sat up straight well do our best prefect furius gracilus furius first things first cohort strength seven hundred and twentyfour men fit for duty sir the prefect pursed his lips under strength then casualties yes sir all from the battle of lost eagle almost a century so its a good thing ive already found a century of prime replacements tungrians too tertius exchanged glances with appius thats good news sir id heard the only replacements left in town were already spoken for furius smirked at his circumspection no need to be coy with me centurion of course theyre supposed to go to our sister cohort i sought out the officer responsible for replacements and helped him to reconsider his priorities earlier this afternoon he hummed and hawed a bit but he soon changed his mind when he saw some coin tertius frowned unconsciously theres a bit of a relationship between us and the first cohort prefect im not sure i think youre more than not sure centurion you think that taking a century of replacements from under the firsts noses would be unfortunate dishonourable even the centurion sensing that a trap lay before him trod carefully not at all sir all i was thinking was that the first cohort is almost two hundred and fifty men down thats all their first spears going to be pretty unhappy if we have it away with half his replacements furiuss face took on a sly look you fought at the battle of the lost eagle centurion yes sir and that was where my cohort took the casualties for which we need these replacements yes sir and ive heard it was only the intervention of the second cohort that saved the first from being overrun by barbarians tertius realised where the prefect was taking the discussion absolutely true prefect we saved their skins all right one of their centurions said as much to me not an hour ago of course it was the first cohort that did most of the damage to the barb furius spread his hands and shrugged well there you are we take a centurys worth of damage saving our sister cohort from the mess theyd managed to get into and they get all the replacements that can hardly be right now can it eh centurion tertius knew which side to be on in this discussion of course not sir in which case we ought to be up and away no later than dawn or run the risk of an unpleasant argument on the subject ive met the officers whore here to collect those men and i wouldnt want to get on the wrong end of their unhappiness furius smiled knowingly yes i guessed as much the replacements centurion has promised to have our century paraded and ready to go at first light so lets get some sleep dismissed gentlemen ah one more question the officers paused expectantly another story ive heard a few times is that theres a fugitive believed to be sheltering with one of the wall cohorts apparently this fellow is the last living member of a family that the emperor chose to liquidate but his father sent him away to the northern frontier before the axe fell there would be great imperial favour for the man that turned him in perhaps a promotion so spread the word the man that identifies this traitor to me will be handsomely rewarded very handsomely the first tungrian officers rose early and made the short walk to the transit barracks just as the sun was inching clear of the horizon expecting to find the barrack office empty they were surprised to find the transit centurion already on duty rufius sized the man up with a swift glance looking around the whitewalled office with apparent indifference greetings centurion were here for two centuries of tungrian infantry reserved for collection by the first tungrian cohort by order of legatus equitius sixth imperial legion point us at them and well get them off your ration strength the transit officer was a sparsely haired man of about forty his uniform clearly legion issue he rose from his chair with an apologetic expression and crossed the small room with two limping paces im sorry gentlemen i have only the one century for you theres a lot of demand for replacements as im sure youll be aware he dried up under the stare of four suddenly very hostile men julius stepped in closer to him raising a finger to silence his apology we were here last night centurion probably long after youd gone to hide in your quarters and we saw two centuries of prime infantry ready for collection so how i wonder does that become one century overnight he raised an eyebrow and waited for a response the other man spread his hands helplessly another officer turned up an hour ago a prefect with two centurions in tow he gave me a direct order to sign him out a century of the tungrians to replace battle losses so i i did rufius nudged dubnus go on lad you know the routine the powerfully built young centurion stepped past the transit officer looking carefully at the wooden floorboards rufius spoke conversationally his attention apparently focused on the barrack dimly visible through the offices open window in the early morning light we know how it is centurion youre in possession of one of the most valuable resources for a hundred miles and more it must be quite a temptation when youre stuck here in this shitty little port with what five years left to serve so when a senior officer turns up and offers you a combination of stick and carrot to sign him out a few dozen men well you find yourself wondering why you should end up with a load of grief when theres money to be made dont you this officer had a name i presume the transit officer watched dubnuss progress round the office with increasing trepidation he ah he signed as he opened his record tablet with trembling fingers scanning the words inscribed into the wax with a speed borne of fear as prefect furius second tungrian cohort juliuss scowl deepened the bloody second cohort i should have known it this new prefect of theirs must be keen uncle sextus will shit a cow when he finds out found it they turned to see dubnus levering a loose floorboard away with his dagger throwing the wood to one side he fished inside the cavity between floor and ground pulling out a purse he tossed it to rufius who hefted the small leather bag in his hand nice and heavy must be a decent enough sum you know what they say though only take a bribe if the sum involved will compensate for the punishment youll get for taking it and in this case the punishments going to be quite severe but i julius stepped forward taking a handful of the wilting centurions tunic in one meaty fist no i dont think so but i isnt going to be enough to get you out of this one first off youve pissed us off we came here for two centuries to replace our losses from the battle of lost eagle you heard about that one you know how one cohort was sent to take on the whole barbarian army how that cohort held its line for an hour and more and kept the bluenoses in place until the rest of the army turned up well he prodded the centurion to get a response yes good and the bad news for you is that cohort was us we all had good friends killed that day and were not in much of a mood to be messed about ever noticed how the road officers tend not to take their usual liberties with men whove recently seen combat ever wondered why he slapped the centurion twice lazy blows that twisted the mans head to the left and right now youre about to find out second our prefect that morning now commands sixth legion youre still part of sixth legion so when we report this ballsup to him hell likely have you dismissed the service he hates this sort of corrupt behaviour third my first spear is a right nasty bastard hell want to have you strangled with your own guts when he finds out hes been done over for a century of men he badly needs men whose absence could place the entire cohort in peril he clenched his fist tighter lifting the now terrified man on to his toes without any apparent effort so first well beat seven colours of shit out of you take our one remaining century and leave and in about a week or so youll be a civilian with no citizenship and no pension and some time later some time youll never predict the first tungrian cohort will find you and leave you in a ditch with the life running out of you its nothing personal its just what you get for pissing off frontline troops dubnus you can have this one the hamians the centurions voice was little better than a squeak julius snorted his disdain what about the hamians useless bowwaving women all theyre good for is hunting game theres a war on in case you hadnt noticed we need infantrymen big lads with spears and shields to strengthen our line archers are no bloody use in an infantry cohort he raised his meaty fist no mate youre going to get whats coming your way the other man gabbled desperately staring helplessly at the poised fist theres two centuries of them two centuries take them and the tungrians and thats two hundred and fifty men marcus spoke having stood quietly in the background so far so we could make a century of the best of them dump the rest on the second cohort when we catch up with them and take back the century he sold them in return julius turned his head to look at the younger man keeping the transit officer clamped in place with seemingly effortless strength are you mad there wont be a decent man among them theyll be arsepoking makeupwearing faggots the lot of them all those easterners are its in the blood theyll mince round the camp holding hands and tossing each other off in the bathhouse lets just marcus spoke over him with quiet assurance ill tell you what julius rufius gets the tungrians and ill take the hamians as a doublestrength century and weed out the weaklings for dumping on the second cohort when next we meet or shall we just go back to the hill still one hundred and seventy men light julius sighed deeply then turned back to the transit officer it must be your lucky day heres the deal we take the tungrians the hamians both centuries mind and the money you keep your place here and perhaps just perhaps we dont hunt you down and kill you deal yes he pushed the terrified centurion away hard enough to bounce him off the offices wall right two knives youd better go and get your men ready to move lets see just how bad this is going to be oh yes and theres this he turned back quickly jabbing a fist into the transit officers face and breaking his nose with an audible crack then threw a right hook into the reeling mans jaw which dropped him dazed to the wooden floor prick marcus crossed from the transit office to the closest barrack and opened a door at random inside the barracks stonebuilt cell packed in like sardines on a market stall and dimly lit by the single small window through which the dawns chill was seeping into the room eight hamians were waiting quietly fully equipped and ready to march raising an intrigued eyebrow he walked briskly up the line of eightman rooms to the officers quarters rapped once on the door and walked in the three oliveskinned men waiting for him snapped to attention the tallest of them making direct eye contact in a way he guessed was designed to communicate status he was well built with wideset brown eyes above a strong nose and a broad jaw black hair cropped close to his scalp making the instant appraisal of all first meetings marcus was struck by the apparent unassuming confidence in the mans gaze direct but without any challenge at ease gentlemen whos the ranking soldier here the tall hamian nodded briefly keeping eye contact i am centurion your rank i am acting centurion qadir ibn jibran ibn musab centurion i currently command both this century and the other barracked across the way marcus nodded looking at the other two men with a raised eyebrow these men are my seconds hashim and jibril centurion i see very well acting centurion i am marcus tribulus corvus your new centurion your two centuries are to join the first tungrian cohort as an overstrength century as replacement for our losses in recent battle you shall be my chosen man and these two men your watch officers youll need two if youre to manage that many men perhaps it would be better if you were to provide your men with their commands for the time being until i have the measure of their command of latin the hamian nodded with an impressive imperturbability certainly centurion shall i parade the men we are ready to march as you may have seen marcus frowned yes im sorry your name again please simply call me qadir centurion thank you and why why are you ready for the road i mean i expected you all still to be sleeping qadir smiled placing both hands behind his back and bowing minutely it was not hard to predict your arrival the noise of the tungrian century departing ensured that we were awake and once it became clear to us that they had been bribed out of the transit officer it was easy enough to guess that we would be part of the compensation he would offer to you i saw one of your colleagues checking the tungrians last night and he didnt look like a man who would take disappointment quietly we have been here for three weeks now watching other centuries arrive and leave but now the barrel is clearly empty marcus fought the urge to smile i see very well chosen man qadir please parade the centuries for inspection the big man nodded deferentially and spoke a few soft words to his comrades they left the room in silence leaving marcus and qadir alone in the quiet of the small room the hamian seemed content to wait for marcus to speak first how long have you been acting centurion qadir six months sir and eight years before that as a soldier watch officer and chosen man marcus raised an eyebrow eight years from recruitment to centurion they must make officers very quickly wherever it is that youve come from either that or youre something special i apologise for taking your command youll get it back soon enough once we catch up with our sister cohort and exchange us for the men they stole this morning i think that will take longer than you imagine centurion and even when you do there will be another man posted to command my archers do not trouble yourself on my behalf as long as i am with my people and have the strength to bend my bow i need nothing more marcus paced to the window looking out into the grey dawn at the mustering hamians archers im afraid that archers are not whats needed now not while there are barbarian warbands in the field the other man appeared at his shoulder his soft voice close to marcuss ear we had guessed as much while we sat here and waited centuries of men with heavy armour and spears were in and out in less than a day it soon became clear enough to us that our having been sent here was a cruel mistake now that we are yours to command it is my expectation that we will soon have heavier armour than this he fingered the thin rings of his light mail vest drawing marcuss attention to its insubstantial nature compared with his own mail which was both longer and significantly heavier and spears of our own marcus nodded his eyes fixed in appraisal of the soldiers parading outside the window they were wiry for the most part a few simply skinny more bone and sinew than muscle though they shared the broad powerful shoulders that defined their skill at arms their mail looked too flimsy to resist a determined spear or swordthrust their conical helmets lacked cheek guards and their impractically light shields were circular rather than being shaped to fully protect a soldiers body none of the equipment on show would act as adequate protection in a pitched battle can your men run if you mean over a distance the answer is yes centurion we are hunters for the most part used to covering ground in search of game how they will perform weighed down with mail coats and heavy shields such as your men carry is another question but i make one request of you centurion and that is not to take their bows from them to do so would be a grave mistake marcus turned to face the hamian his face creasing into a frown as soon as i can manage it theyll be issued with a thighlength coat of heavy ring mail capable of stopping a spear a leather arming vest to wear underneath it and protect their skin from the mails rings when that spearthrust arrives an infantry gladius two spears an infantry helmet and a fulllength shield all of which weighs more than you might imagine until the first time you put it all on then theyll have to march or run up to thirty miles a day once were on campaign the additional burden of a bow isnt going to help them cope with the load qadir spread his arms palms upwards and bowed his eyes remaining fixed on marcuss i understand centurion and i can see that you are right and yet he paused searching for the right words to make his point without angering his new officer centurion to take their bows will be to take their souls each man has grown close to his weapon over long years of practice he has fired thousands of arrows in practice until he can put an iron head into a target the size of a mans chest at one hundred paces and can do this six times in one minute the very core of what these men have learned over those years is that to hit the target time after time after time they must lose all awareness of themselves simply focus on the centre of their target and become servant to the bow that seeks that target these two centuries contain some of the best bowmen i have ever seen loose an arrow capable of great accuracy with weapons they have come to love as dearly as their own children and so i tell you with very great respect to your rank and obvious character that if these men lose their bows then they will also lose their hearts and a century of men without heart would be of little use to anyone exactly so centurion exactly so and now with your forgiveness perhaps i have embarrassed myself enough for one morning shall we review your new command centurion corvus marcus inclined his head gesturing for the hamian to precede him through the quarters low doorway outside in the early morning chill the two centuries were paraded along the barracks frontage in a long double line he walked along the length of both centuries looking intently at the faces that stared fixedly to their front their eyes were bright enough although their skin was sallow with lack of sunlight dubnus strode across from the transit office to join him casting an unhappy glance down the line maponus help us two centuries of underweight bath dodgers whose only skill is hunting game for the pot quite how were going to turn this lot into infantrymen is beyond me anyway ive been thinking you take the tungrians and ill have these i can he stopped talking as a smile spread across marcuss face dubnus brother i wouldnt have amounted to anything better than a rotting corpse in a ditch on the road south from yew grove without your help over the last few months nor can i pretend that i was responsible for turning the ninth from a waste of rations to a fighting century that was mostly you too but trust me when i tell you this these men will not respond to your style of leadership they are lonely frightened but worst of all they feel worthless theyve sat here for the last month watching gaulish farm boys in armour get snapped up like the last cake in the bakery while they with all their abilities are demeaned as incapable of fighting our war his friend rolled his eyes but they are what are this lot going to do when a warband comes howling out of the forest run like fuck id say i know but theres something here i think we can use call it determination call it desperation if you like whatever you call it i think we can make a fighting unit from them quite what kind of fighting is still open to question dubnus gave him a long stare they carry shields made out of wicker they wear armour made with rings so thin it wouldnt stop a halfdecent spearthrust no spears no helmets to speak of and a decent wind would carry half of them away just equipping them is going to be difficult enough never mind whatll happen the first time they try to carry all that weight more than a few hundred paces they could be a real problem in the field marcus nodded worse than not having a hundred and fifty replacements worse than not having two more centuries of men following our standard dubnus shook his head in weary resignation i know better than to argue with you though i dont think your standardbearers going to see the funny side of this dubnuss and juliuss centuries were arrayed on the arab town parade ground the soldiers breath steaming in the grey dawns chill as they waited for the command to head away down the road towards the stronghold five miles to the west morban and antenoch respectively the th centurys standardbearer and marcuss personal clerk waited with equal impatience a small distance from dubnuss th century morban cast occasional dirty looks at the ths standardbearer and more particularly the standard held proudly in the younger mans hands he isnt keeping that statue clean the lazy bastard ive got a good mind to go and take the bloody thing away from him antenoch gave the th centurys standard a sideways glance and shot the alleged offender a sympathetic glance raising an eyebrow in commiseration and drawing a hurt rebuke from his friend i saw that the clerk shrugged his indifference huddling deeper into his cloak it looks fine to me anyway leave the man alone you grumpy bastard i dont remember you cleaning it all that often either you should worry more about helping two knives get a brandnew century ready to fight and leave the ninth to dubnus now that hes their centurion hang on here they come the first of the replacement centuries appeared around the corner of arab towns bathhouse its soldiers stepping out strongly under the close scrutiny of tiberius rufius and his newly acquired chosen man and watch officer morbans face split into a beaming smile yes look at that eighty sides of prime tungrian beef look at the muscles on those boys the bearll be after slipping a few of those lads into the tenth to replace the axemen who fell at lost eagle antenoch nodded keeping his eyes on the advancing century yes grandfather looks happy enough with his new men doesnt he morban squinted at the advancing rufiuss grinning face seeing the smile turn into a laugh as the veteran officer found him among the waiting soldiers that isnt happy thats pure pisstake look hes pointing back down the road whats he on about antenoch craned his neck to see over the marching troops theres two knives i can see his helmets crest but where the hell are his men hold on a moment realisation dawned upon him with a sickening thud i can see their helmets but only just its a century of fucking dwarves morban stood rooted to the ground as the first century marched past them and the second came into full view his eyes widening with genuine horror rufius stopped alongside the staring pair his face distorted with laughter oh morban if only you could see your face he staggered away clutching his sides a grimfaced julius marching alongside marcus gave him a dirty look as the front rank of the hamians drew level with them and halted at marcuss shouted command he shook his head in disgust at the older mans uncontrollable laughter i thought age blessed a man with wisdom as it took away his strength but clearly not in your case tiberius rufius and whats your problem standardbearer morban came to sudden indignant life rufius gets a century full of big strong lads and we get a gang of of underfed arab bow benders what use are they going to be when the bluenoses come hammering at our shields i marcus stepped between julius and morban then bent to put his face an inch from the indignant standardbearers his finger dimpling his mailed chest to emphasise his point his voice was low but insistent his face dark with anger be quiet and listen statue waver weve been bilked of a century by the bloody second cohort who bribed them out from under our noses this morning these men are the only troops left in the port and probably the only ownerless soldiers in the whole of britannia so these are the troops were taking home with us well swap them with the second at the first opportunity you can be assured of that but in the meantime you will treat them with the consideration due to the poor bastards whats more these underfed bow benders speak latin just as well as you do in fact probably with a good deal more eloquence and a lot less profanity and i doubt theyre all that happy with your reaction it isnt their fault theyre stuck here and if theyre going to be a part of our cohort wed better make them feel just a tiny bit welcomed if you dont like that you can always go back to the ninth and ill ask dubnus for his new boy in return morbans indignation melted to anxious disbelief in a second not fair centurion not fair at all you know young lupus ties me to you marcus kept his face stony tipping his head towards the waiting hamians with arched eyebrows in which case youd better get your head out of your backside and greet your new century chosen man qadir allow me to introduce the eighth centurys standardbearer morban hes a good man if a little overfond of drink and whoring not to mention the occasional wager in fact if morban offers you odds on anything the sun coming up in the morning rain being wet just anything consider very carefully before putting your money down morban smirked just a little his dignity sufficiently restored by his officers carefully chosen insults and stuck out a meaty paw to the tall hamian chosen man welcome to the eighth century chosen qadir took the hand carefully looking about him in mock incomprehension my thanks standardbearer although i see only one other man besides yourself perhaps it would be more fitting if the eighth century were to welcome you rufius having recovered from his earlier fit of laughter slapped the stocky standardbearer on the shoulder hes got a point morban if antenochs your century youd best go and join these lads im sure theyll follow your standard round if youre nice to them marcus nodded agreement and if you want them to regard it as something more than your personal badge of office perhaps youd better give them a bit of education the standardbearer nodded squared his shoulders and stepped out in front of the hamians the voice of rufiuss man was already ringing through the still morning air as he addressed the new th century he cleared his throat before shaking the centurys standard at the wideeyed archers eighth century i am your standardbearer morban and this is your standard i am entrusted with carrying this symbol of our century and with keeping it safe from any threat at the cost of my own life if all else fails which means if youre all dead you are collectively charged with a sacred duty to guard the standard which is the heart and soul of our century and to protect it during battle at any cost he ignored antenoch who was making crosseyed faces at him from behind marcus you will follow the instructions of our centurion marcus tribulus corvus which i will repeat through movements of the standard for those of you who do not understand them if i lean the standard to the left were turning left to the right were turning right if i dip the standard were starting the march if i raise it were stopping if i dip it two times were marching at the double and if i reverse it were retreating my mate here he nodded to the trumpeter alongside him who promptly blushed scarlet will sound his horn when im about to issue an order with the standard so pay attention and youll always know what were about to do he paused for breath and stared at the men closest to him with a fierce intensity in battle this standard is your rallying point if we advance the standard will be close to the front of the century and if we advance to the rear it will be with the centurys rearmost troops where the shit flies the thickest you will find me and this statue right behind you and you will make us proud just dont let us down centurion marcus stepped out in front of the hamians nodding to morban as the standardbearer waddled back to join antenoch soldiers you may not be tungrians you may be what our esteemed standardbearer calls bow benders and i guarantee you that getting you ready for life in an infantry cohort is going to be a challenge for us all however and listen to me very carefully when i tell you this because it means a lot to your new brothersinarms all those difficulties mean nothing to me because you are now tungrians let me say that again you are now tungrians he paused staring across the silent men aware that julius was standing just behind him and glaring at the wideeyed hamians with equal intensity at the moment that means little enough to you im just another officer spouting off about his cohort but you will learn what it means to be one of us and when you understand that you will be one step closer to reaching the standards we will be expecting of you now make ready to move were marching to noisy valley and thats a marching distance of twentysix miles which at four miles an hour will take us about eight hours including rest stops easy enough work for a fully fit soldier carrying the light equipment youve been issued with this is our first chance to see how you men measure up to our standards prefect furius rode into the rocks temporary camp in the middle of the afternoon with three centuries of soldiers marching easily at his back forewarned by a tent party of men sent running ahead for the last mile by centurion tertius the cohorts first spear was waiting at the camps entrance with his officers ready to formally greet their new commander he bellowed an order as the prefects horse drew level with their small group snapping the cohorts officers to attention furius dismounted and a soldier assigned to the task ran forward and led the horse away the prefect looked about him taking in the stone shell of the burnedout fort huddled under the walls unbroken defence the turfwalled camp alongside it was a picture of order the lines of tents perfectly aligned and the men set to guard the turf walls alert and crisp in their movements finding nothing to excite comment he turned to address the gathered officers first spear neuto sir a local name first spear a tungrian name prefect i was born in gallia belgica furius nodded i rode through your capital tungrorum on my way here you must miss it the first spear inclined his head i do sir although its a very long time since i saw the old place there are some men behind me who have seen your settlement somewhat more recently i have reinforcements for you from tungria a full century of freshly trained men the first spear smiled thinly so i see prefect i must admit that i wasnt expecting such a welcome addition to our strength reinforcements have been hard to come by with six full legion cohorts needing replacement the prefect smiled broadly either ignoring or simply missing the slightly disapproving note in his senior centurions voice and spread his hands like a conjuror soliciting applause for his latest trick then its a good thing for our cohort that i happened to be in the right place at the right time and with the right ah influence shall we say i suggest that we get these three centuries into quarters and you and i can have a discussion as to how were going to demonstrate some oldfashioned roman military justice to this cohort theres an officerkiller at large in this cohort and were going to find him and make him pay for his crime with his blood he smiled into neutos suddenly expressionless face before turning to the men unloading his effects from the wagon behind them and now lets get my kit off that wagon and safely into my tent shall we be careful with that jar it contains enough naphtha to burn down a legion fortress the tungrians reached noisy valley shortly before dark that evening passing the rock an hour before julius had shot a hard scowl at the smirking nd tungrian soldiers standing guard at the entrance to their earthwalled marching camp pausing for a moment to allow tiberius rufius to catch up with him hed tipped his helmeted head to the nd cohort men his face sour with disgust look at those smug bastards theres nothing those thieving arse bandits like better than to get one over on us and there they are with a century that belongs to us happily camped fifty paces the other side of their turf wall he spat on the ground his face hardening as the sentries nudged each other clearly barely restraining themselves from hysterics as the hamians hove into view ill fucking rufius restrained him with a hand on his arm shaking his head in gentle admonishment youll only regret it their first spear will be forced to send you packing and from what ive heard hes a good enough sort and his prefect will probably send a complaint to frontinius and make it all our fault julius shrugged off the older mans hand but to the veteran centurions relief simply stood and stared at the sentries until they decided that discretion was the better part of valour in the face of his obvious anger and slunk off behind the section of turf wall that masked the forts entrance marcus strode past alongside his struggling men a jaundiced glance at the forts walls the only sign of his disgust see young marcus has it right save your anger for a time when it can be put to good use the big man grunted shaking his head as he turned back to the march ill have blood for this just not today the th legions temporary headquarters was a sea of tents clustered around the partially rebuilt ruins of the northern commands noisy valley supply depot rufius having strolled back down the marching column to walk a while with marcus and qadir wrinkled his nose this place still stinks of burnt wood even now theyve cleared away most of the wreckage at least the sixth is getting on with putting it back to the way it was despite the hour the warm late summer air was filled with the sounds of hammering and sawing as the legions troops laboured to restore the camp to its former magnificence from the burnedout shells of armouries and supply sheds torched to prevent their being looted by the triumphant barbarians three months before the wooden bridge at the foot of the quartermile slope from the camp to the river had already been completely rebuilt and the valleys slopes on both sides of the fastflowing river tinea had been stripped of most of their remaining trees to supply wood for the reconstruction the result was a bare landscape studded with tree stumps their removal a low priority compared with the work of reconstruction and across which half a dozen bonfires etched their sooty stains into the late afternoon sky as conscripted brigantian labour collected and burned the unwanted debris left behind after the trees had been felled and cut up into usable sections by the legions artisans marcus nodded distractedly his attention focused on his men the replacement tungrians marching in front of them under dubnuss command accustomed to marching from their recent training were still relatively fresh by contrast most of his hamians looked fit to drop they had taken almost all of the day to cover the distance from arab town and the centurions faces had grown darker by the hour as the archers struggled to maintain even the standard marching pace their feet must be as soft as babies arses look that poor bastards got blood leaking out of his boots julius pointed to a man in the front rank as they paraded the replacements on the noisy valley parade ground both of the archers feet were visibly bleeding the raw flesh visible between his boots leather straps this lot are going to need some serious sorting out before they can get back on the road you go and chat up the legatus for any equipment he can spare ill get them into quarters and boots off marcus nodded unhappily ordering qadir to stay with his men and follow juliuss instructions he presented himself in front of the rebuilt headquarters one of the few buildings already completed by the repair gangs greeting the duty centurion with the appropriate degree of respect the man would consider his due from an auxiliary centurion centurion corvus of the first tungrian cohort requesting an audience with legatus equitius the legion officer leaned forward to put his face a foot from the younger mans and stared down his nose disdainfully his jaw jutting out between his helmets gleaming cheek pieces requesting an audience with the legatus and what makes you think the commander of sixth victorious has any time for you retaining his cool marcus returned the hostile stare with a calm regard mainly the fact that we stood together on a hillside quite recently while a barbarian warband battered itself to pieces on our shields his eyes narrowed slightly as he leaned forward in turn to put his face inches from the centurions which cohort centurion what he repeated the question with deliberate and obvious patience in which one of the sixth legions cohorts do you serve centurion the older man saw quickly enough which way the conversation was going and his answer was a fraction less gruff the second marcus nodded his eyes fixed coldly on the other mans i thought so youre a replacement from gaul or germany i suppose and so you werent here for the battle of lost eagle but i was and so was the legatus or prefect equitius as i knew him at the time i served with him after his promotion too hunting your legions lost eagle through the northern hills while you were still on the road to this place so centurion all things being equal i expect the legatus will be happy enough to see me he settled into a comfortable parade rest and waited while the officer stamped away and the headquarters sentries smirked quietly under their helmets a few minutes later a soldier came to the door to fetch him inside the imposing building leading him to the legatuss office equitius was seated behind an impressive desk with a scroll open in front of him one hand teasing at his thick brown beard as he read but he got quickly to his feet when he saw the young officer and greeted him with a smile of genuine pleasure centurion corvus you are quite literally a sight for sore eyes quintus a uniformed clerk appeared at the door from an anteroom legatus thats it for today my eyes seem to be getting old before their time clear up those papers well make a fresh start tomorrow morning and have some wine sent in please papers cleared and wine poured the legatus raised his cup to marcus heres to you young man and your apparent continued anonymity your false identity seems to be holding up well enough so far for all the fact that the name marcus valerius aquila hasnt been entirely forgotten yet marcus nodded sipping at his wine and youre still in command of the sixth then sir theres no danger of the legion being cashiered for losing its eagle equitius frowned reflexively at the question oh yes i believe theres been plenty of talk on the subject but i think were past the worst of it no legion has been disbanded in over a hundred years not since first germanica and sixteenth gallica were broken up for joining the batavian revolt back in the emperor vespasians day im told that some of the men around the throne were all for making an example of the sixth to put some backbone in the other legions but weve been fortunate in having avitus macrinus in command in the absence of an effective governor not only did he rubbish the suggestion before it was even made but hes also got enough influence in rome to squash the idea flat the sixth legion may have been humbled by the deceptions of a traitor but well survive to take our revenge for the loss of our eagle the only way we know on the battlefield he tipped his cup back savouring the wine for a moment so anyway marcus tribulus corvus what brings you to this gloomy supply dump when you could be enjoying life on the hill or else be out in the field hunting down our old friend calgus ill warn you now that you wont sleep a minute past dawn for the hammering of the armourers my idiot of a camp prefect set their new forges up right next door to the transit barracks marcus told him the story of their day getting a smile for his impression of morbans indignation on first seeing the hamians and then ten miles later hes already trying to talk his way into my new chosen mans purse equitius nodded sagely that sounds like the morban i recall how do you rate their chosen man marcus pulled a face hes disappointed with his demotion id say but hes hiding it well enough almost inscrutably in fact hes a politician then the younger man shook his head slowly no id say hes something better than that call it maturity or call it simple acceptance hell serve happily enough until the time comes to take his position back when you reclaim your tungrians from the second cohort something like that equitius raised an eyebrow calling for his clerk again ah quintus id like any information we have on the second tungrian cohorts new prefect straight away please the clerk saluted and left the room one of the privileges of senior command access to rather more information than im used to another cup of wine the clerk returned five minutes later with a record scroll updated only today sir prefect furius has joined the tungrians from the german frontier from the first minervia to be precise i see anything else no sir just the bare facts of his previous service a spell with twelfth thunderbolt in moesia some years ago more recently six months with first minervia then over the sea to join us thank you quintus that will be all the clerk withdrew and the legatus raised an eyebrow what my clerk is far too careful to say at least in front of a man he doesnt know is that serving six months with a legion before being pushed off into auxiliary service is something of a kick in the teeth for a gentleman it certainly wouldnt have been a step for his former commanding officer to have taken lightly given that furius appears to have been sufficiently well connected to be favoured with a legion tribunate in the first place and whether auxiliary or not cohort commands werent growing on trees when i was looking for mine so he must still have influential friends given that hes probably been quite a naughty boy he certainly must have some pull to have snagged a tribunes posting with first minervia in the first place he gave marcus a cautionary look mark my words centurion the second cohorts new prefect might well have a colourful recent past so i wouldnt bet on getting those troops back any time soon not until both cohorts are in the same place as a sympathetic senior officer so lets get down to it eh youll be keeping those archers for a while so what do you need to get them into the field with a halfdecent chance of survival later in the evenings chill marcus left the headquarters and walked slowly through the flickering torchlight to the hospital the soldier on guard duty saluted at the sight of his crosscrested helmet and the young roman returned the salute distractedly inside the building he paused for a long moment in a darkened corridor lost in thought legatus equitius had broached the subject of felicia clodia drusilla with diplomatic care mentioning as if in passing that the doctor kept busier than ever she had been caring for a single cohorts medical needs now that she had several thousand men to look after might appreciate a visit from an old friend the legions lucky that she was on hand to step in when her predecessor got himself killed on the road from the yew grove fortress luckier still that her father took the trouble to impart his surgical skills to her rather than abandoning her intellect to preparation for marriage and motherhood ive requested a pair of replacement surgeons of course but theres no word on when theyll be forthcoming until then its either the good lady or nothing not even the camp prefect can complain at her presence under those circumstances while he had kept his face straight and his feelings to himself in truth marcus had thought of little else since their last meeting or at least during those times when his mind had not been occupied by the duties of his command given both the circumstances of that brief encounter and those of her husbands death he had been prey to a host of doubts in the intervening weeks and so the young centurion lurked in stealthy indecision he and felicia had briefly been close but that was before centurion marcus jerked out of his reverie realising that he had been close to dozing in the quiet warmth of the hospital an orderly stood before him with a dim lamp the oil almost exhausted can i help you sir do you require treatment marcus shook his head removing his helmet no thank you i have come to visit doctor clodia drusilla im told that she is here and i would appreciate a moment of her time if the hour is forgivable yes sir i will pass your request on your name centurion corvus just that he waited a moment the fears of a thousand dismal reflections on their situation crowding back down on him she must see that his life was not for her she would have met another man a safer man she would be dismayed with his unheralded arrival she marcus felicia hurried down the corridor with her skirts flying and wrapped her arms around him in a warm embrace that dispelled his fears in an instant ive missed you id almost given up on you as a lost cause its been so long come into my office she took his arm and drew him down the corridor pulling him into the privacy of her room and closing the door before pressing him up against the wall in a long searching kiss breaking away after a long moment she held him out at arms length in the flickering lamplight appraising him as if in comparison with her memories before poking his armoured chest im sure i promised myself that you wouldnt be quite so sturdily dressed the next time we kissed its been so long marcus i was sure you werent coming back for me her voice sounded small almost lost and her eyes moistened with repressed emotion he took both of her hands her fingers warm between his im sorry ive been tied up patrolling the border area the locals have reacted badly to not being liberated by their northern brothers so theyve taken to hitandrun raids on roman outposts and farms the only way i might have seen you earlier would have been to get in the way of a bluenose arrow besides last time we met you were he dried up not wanting to say the words for fear of offending her felicia sighed and shook her head staring at the floor i know i was distant and ive cursed myself a thousand times since i suppose it was just a reaction to my husbands death that and being told that he was killed by a wound in the back marcus trod carefully prefect bassus had been stabbed in the back at the height of the pursuit that had followed the barbarian rout at the battle of lost eagle he was widely reputed to have brought his death presumably at the hands of his men upon himself his harsh leadership combined with an inability to see his soldiers growing anger with their treatment had seemingly driven them to deal with him in the only way left open to them you know he was a difficult man to like of course who knew that better than i did why else would i have run away from him although i thank the day i made that choice every time i pray to fortuna he didnt deserve to die that way though she was silent for a moment her hands clenched in her lap and i still feel guilty when i heard he was dead my first reaction was joy joy to be free of him and to have my chance to be with you she turned her head away staring into the rooms shadowed corner nobody with a calling to healing should be able to take even the slightest pleasure in death and he was still my husband i felt so ashamed of myself marcus put a finger to her chin and turned her face back to his own he spoke to me on that bloody hill when the second cohort pulled our chestnuts out of the fire at the last moment before the barbarian charge and i swear he knew what had happened between us or at least guessed he made it very clear that he was going to call me out after the battle but i couldnt have fought him i would have been forced to kill him and that would have brought disaster on both of us whoever put that spear in his back saved me from taking my own life to avoid implicating us both me for treason and you for adultery he paused for a moment to stare into her eyes anyway hes gone we can either decide to make the most of where we find ourselves or just waste our lives worrying about our mutual guilt i know which i prefer she looked back up at him her eyes soft in the lamplight shrugging the sleeves of her tunic off her shoulders so that the garment was held in place only by its friction with the slope of her breasts and youd like to know what my choice is why dont you lock that door and ask me properly it was another two hours before marcus made his way back to the transit barracks bone weary and yet elated beyond expectation rufius looked up expectantly as he opened the door to the barrack the four centurions had agreed to share julius and dubnus were already asleep in their bunks huddled down into straw mattresses ah so there you are i had half a mind to call out the guard to look for you its been so long but julius convinced me that you were likely just guzzling down the legatuss iberian red without concern for your elders and betters anyway what have you been up to you look like youre dead on your feet but you dont smell of drink the veteran centurion sniffed ostentatiously his eyes widening as he did so he leaned back in his chair and prodded the recumbent form behind him hey julius julius wake up man their brother officer woke with redrimmed eyes sat up shot marcus a glance and subsided back on to his bed hes back big deal let me sleep damn you rufius shook him by the shoulder i think youre going to want to see this or rather i think youre going to want to smell it julius sat back up with a frown looked marcus up and down and drew in a long breath through his nose he stared at marcus with a look of dawning amazement bugger me rufius snorted i wouldnt turn over tonight or the horny young sod probably will julius tried again youve youve been marcus reddened and rufius pounced yes he bloody well has while weve been sat here worrying that some nasty little thief might have clouted him and left him for dead in the dark hes been playing hidethecucumber not only that but he hasnt even washed the ladys smell from his skin before coming back to gloat over us poor celibates didnt they teach you to go to the baths after a tumble eh boy or least get a washcloth and a bucket and do your best with that marcus opened his mouth to retort only to get juliuss cloth square in the face still damp from his endofday wipedown have one on me lad just dont be settling down to sleep in here reeking like that or ill be as stiff as a crowbar all bloody night go on theres a bucket of water outside the door go and wash it off like a decent comrade he stopped caught off guard by the look on marcuss face hang on look at you you look like every lovestruck prick ive ever had the misfortune to bunk with over the last twenty years about as sharp as a ragmans donkey you didnt even see that washcloth coming i know who youve been with whats her name the doctor marcus turned for the door the cloth dangling in one hand felicia her name is felicia and she promised to marry me julius and rufius exchanged amazed stares then julius reached over to shake the only man in the room who was still asleep dubnus dubnus you are not going to want to miss this calgus and his bodyguard left the warbands camp in the dawns first light they slipped away unnoticed save for a few words with the men patrolling the camps western face men of the selgovae tribe and still fiercely loyal to their tribal leader calgus whispered fiercely into the ear of the warrior commanding the watch on the camps western wall youve seen nothing all morning vallo clear the guards leader a grizzled and scarfaced veteran of two uprisings against the hated invaders and fiercely loyal to calgus nodded impassively he had been on guard the previous day when the messenger he had been warned to expect had walked out of the forest from the west stopping fifty paces from the camps wall when vallo had gone forward to speak with him the northerner had simply uttered his message for calgus and then turned impassively away without any apparent regard for the dozen selgovae warriors standing behind their leader now vallo stood in front of his king looking unhappily at the halfdozen men of calguss bodyguard as they clustered around their chieftain we will keep silence my lord we will guard your tent and tell any that ask that you are ill he leaned closer to calgus his voice tense for all the softness of the muttered whisper but i do not like the risk you take in doing this calgus nodded and slapped the veterans shoulder looking round to ensure they remained unseen in the sleeping camp before replying in equally soft tones i know the votadini will complain more loudly in my absence and their king will continue his plotting but this thing has to be done in absolute secrecy if it is to bring us the victory we need so you walk out into the forest with a handful of warriors my lord it is a mistake it is the same mistake as when you were ambushed by the romans when you went hunting your bodyguard all killed and you spared only by the strength and speed of your sword arm calgus laughed softly recalling his first encounter with the roman traitor who had proved the key to their initial triumph over the roman th legion aye theres a story ill recount it to you in full one night when weve run the romans off our land for good but for now trust me when i tell you that this is a risk i cannot avoid not if i am to bring about the great victory we need to get their dirty feet off our land the warrior bowed and stood aside watching as the men of his chieftains bodyguard ducked through the artfully concealed opening in the palisade that surrounded the camp and moved out into the trees ahead of the king their spears ready to throw and their eyes on the forest about them turning back to his men he gestured for them to continue their guard duty looking across the camp long and hard to ensure that no early riser had spotted calguss quiet departure when he turned back to the forest the small group of men was already out of sight hidden by the profusion of vegetation that flourished between the thick trunks of the oaks the small party made cautious progress through the silent forest using a hunters track through the dense undergrowth which had seen little recent use to judge by the luxuriant foliage growing across it they broke off the line of their march several times to wait quietly in the cover of the thick undergrowth in hopes of surprising any attempt at following them through the forests gloom by midday they were crouched in the shelter of a fallen tree at the bottom of a valley about five miles from their camp no my lord we are not followed the leader of the warlords personal guard shook his head with absolute certainty his voice pitched low enough that only calgus could hear him the forest is quiet and anyone following us along these overgrown paths would be heard from two hundred paces calgus nodded his satisfaction good then i can push on without fear of being observed the warrior pulled a face looking around at the deep forests confusion of trees and bushes in all truth my lord i have a greater fear of what lies ahead of us than with what might or might not lie behind what i have said is as true for us as for any man tracking us calgus nodded his understanding i know once we start moving well be making as much noise as a herd of pigs on the hunt for nuts but nevertheless i have to move on and take that risk i have an appointment on the far side of this hill that i am unwilling to miss my lord the bodyguard stood gesturing to his comrades to prepare to renew their march calgus shook his head i not we this is a task that i must carry out alone and you men must wait here for my return while im away you can prepare torches in case im later coming back over the hill than would be ideal but you will under no circumstances attempt to follow me and if you dont return before dark calgus nodded its possible in that case you are to build a large fire and take turns in watching out for me but you are still to stay here he turned away and headed on up the hill pushing aside a branch that was overhanging the path and if you still dont return my lord how long should we wait calgus paused for a moment calling back over his shoulder as long as it takes he turned back to the path muttering under his breath which if ive misjudged my gamble wont be very long if ive got this one wrong well all be dead before dark falls he climbed the hill with a hunters caution his eyes and ears straining for any hint of a presence in the trees around him but neither saw nor heard anything to give him pause continuing his careful ascent until he reached the top of the hill sliding into the shadow of a tree he became absolutely still so quiet that he could feel his own heart beating and listened again after a moment he caught a sound through the incessant drone of the forests insects only a faint fragment of noise but enough to tell him that he was in the right place as he eased back to his feet a spear slammed into the trees trunk a foot from his face stopping him dead as a warrior rose out of the foliage another spear pointed straight at him more men at his back each one of them was heavily tattooed swirling blue patterns decorating their hands and faces the king of the selgovae raised his open hands careful to make no move that might be interpreted as threatening well thats the hardest part of the trick done ive found you without getting myself killed shall we go down the hill and see whos waiting for me at the bottom the man behind the levelled spear scowled at him gesturing his men forward take his weapons and tie his hands he watched as the rebel leader was relieved of his sword and had his wrists tied together in front of him calguss return stare remained steady throughout the swift process of disarmament and restraint do your people always treat invited guests in this way the spearman snorted mirthless laughter we are a long way from home and the hunting hounds have learned the hard way to trust nobody until they are proved worthy of it bring him prefect furius paraded the second tungrians after breakfast the next day waiting next to his first spear as the cohort marched on to the rocks parade ground the older man spoke after a moments silence you intend going through with what we discussed the prefect nodded confidently absolutely ill have prefect bassuss murderer underground before we leave here that or the local crows will eat well for the next few days my only concern about dealing with the matter today is that you havent managed to find the bastard over the last two months they stood in uncomfortable silence until the last century had marched on to the square and the entire cohort was stood at attention furius strode out to face them selfassured confidence in his authority apparent in his stride and bearing second cohort the ranks of troops waited expectantly to be ordered to stand at their ease normally i would order you to stand easy for my morning address but this morning isnt normal so you can all stay at attention in point of fact there hasnt been a normal day in this cohort since one of you put a spear through the spine of your last prefect if anyone had been dozing in the ranks before it was certain that nobody was doing so now until now nobody in this cohort has taken the trouble to find the man that killed prefect bassus by rights he should long since have been avenged by the penalty that military law demands of his murderer public execution it seems however that this cohort is content to brush its problems under the mat until today that is today second tungrians that failure to act will be rectified in the most public way possible before you leave this parade ground i will know who killed him either that or youll all rue the day you ever set eyes on him ive sworn to mars to take the murderers life as revenge for bassuss sworn on an altar with witnesses and a noble sacrifice with no way back from the promise and i will i promise you exact revenge for him how many more men die here alongside the prefects killer depends entirely on you he took a breath and looked across their packed ranks playing the moment out feeling the tension crackling through the men arrayed in front of him since i seem to be the only man seeking justice here im going to need some help i know that the first spear will stand alongside me so now i want to know where the other officers stand any centurion that is willing to support justice for prefect bassus stand forward three paces from your centuries there was an instant ripple of movement so fast that furius suspected that his first spear had blown quietly in a few ears some time since he had first briefed the man as to what he intended all ten of his officers stood forward of their men having crossed whether they realised it or not their own personal rubicons from which there would be no turning back very good at least this cohorts officers recognise the enormity of the crime were going to take retribution for so we have one man out of the eight hundred of you facing me to expose what will it take to make that happen i wonder in fact ive been thinking about it for the last five weeks ever since the moment i found out about my new command and the way in which it became available he paused for a moment allowing a powerful silence to settle on the gathered soldiers some years ago i served in the moesian border wars with the twelfth thunderbolt there was a unit with true roman discipline he stared across the cohort sneering into his troops collective wideeyed stare yes the twelfth knew about crime and punishment and any example of cowardice was met with the harshest of penalties im tempted to follow their example and decimate this cohort literally to condemn one man in ten to death at the hands of his peers as punishment furius paused again sweeping his gaze across the rows of stony faces but i realise that while that would be a fitting punishment the odds of killing the murderer would be far too low to justify the lost fighting strength so i have decided on a different approach you men are a disgrace willing to allow the death of your commander to pass unpunished and so im going to punish you collectively to the maximum extent i can without causing any loss of your fighting capability as a result the following punishments are effective immediately first you will all be fined an amount of pay equal to that which you have earned since bassuss murder on top of that no further pay will be issued until his killer volunteers himself for punishment he waited for a moment allowing the enormity of three months lost pay to sink in second if the killer is found and justice granted to prefect bassus today before the sun sets i will commute that fine to one months pay and lastly if the prefects killer is not identified today i will randomly select a man from each century for execution by his comrades execution which will be carried out without the use of any weapons other than your bare hands he looked across their ranks staring hard at faces whose gaze was locked firmly to the front not daring to meet his eyes you choose ive got no orders other than to scout this area for barbarians so we can stay here as long as you like while the man im looking for makes his mind up to come forward just as long as youre all clear that every new day will start with each century choosing a soldier to be beaten to death not to mention someone to do the dirty work ill be in my tent the quartermasters meaty hand made a loud thwack as he smacked it down on the counter his pale eyes flicked between the two men on the other side of the desk one hand distractedly smoothing his slickedback hair are you pair mad you pitch up as if you own the place and then you offer to relieve me of two centuries worth of equipment he glared across the wooden expanse at marcus and qadir an officer fresh out of his napkin and a chosen man in fancy dress with a bad suntan well the pair of you can fuck right off marcuss face hardened his wellbeing of the previous evening already forgotten youre making a big mistake storeman i the quartermasters eyes widened storeman fucking storeman i eat storemen for breakfast i shit storemen when i go to the latrine you boy do not call me a storeman you piece of auxiliary shit qadir raised an eyebrow at the tirade and then turned his head minutely as if only very slightly surprised as marcus put a hand to his sword a voice from behind them pulled his attention away from the scene of impending violence it was rufius speaking from the shadow of the stores doorway i wouldnt if i were you young two knives ive known the bigmouthed idiot for longer than i care to remember and hes been the same for all those years all piss and vinegar just as long as theres a nice wide counter between him and the men hes robbing theres two ways we can do this either you can argue with him show him your requisition all nice and official with all the right names and a pretty seal and eventually jump the counter and offer him a new set of lumps in the timehonoured fashion or i can simply remind him of one of lifes oldest rules i suggest we try it my way first and if that fails you can have another go at doing it your way now storeman brocchus lets see how well you remember your old comrades eh let me give you a clue i retired from the legion after twentyfive years only eighteen months ago no brocchus frowned with concentration thrown off balance by the as yet unknown officers supreme confidence no heres another clue i was the best first spear ever to grace the parade ground at yew grove no i thought not you never did recognise quality in either supplies or soldiers one last clue then i never did tell anyone about you and that lady you used to see on the side did i despite her being very close to a rather unpleasant centurion of our mutual acquaintance a man who would bite your throat out if he ever even suspected you of diddling his woman brocchus recoiled from the counter with a look of combined amazement and horror tiberius rufius but rufius walked out of the shadows swept his helmet off and slapped it down on to the counters surface a wolfish grin painted across his face i know its the sheer delight of seeing me again i heard you shouting the odds like a stallholders wife from outside and i thought bugger me its that old fool brocchus giving out just like old times but you retired i saw you go rufius grinned hugely reaching across the counter to give the quartermasters cheek a painful tweak and now you see me back again back in uniform sorry fancy dress and having the best fun of my life yes here i am again with my mate here just out of his napkin and his overtanned chosen man and were here to rob your stores of everything and anything of value to the hundred and sixty men standing outside that door not your legion issue of course no were looking for equipment fit for auxiliary shit and im betting youve got enough hidden away back there for our purposes given your love for squirrelling away anything and everything you might be able to sell he grinned widely at the quartermasters amazed stare and do you know just how much you can do to stop me given that weve got a signed requisition from the sixths legatus a man who recently saw battle alongside myself and napkin boy here and given that i know absolutely everything about your sordid little encounters with a certain officers wife encounters im sure youd prefer never got back to him nothing eh storeman so muster your work dodgers and lets be about equipping a hundred and sixty brave men to go and stand between you and those nasty barbarians im sure youve heard so much about the quartermaster paled turned and fled back into the storehouses gloom calling for his men rufius smirked after him raising a selfsatisfied eyebrow at marcus and qadir there you go lads definitive proof that it isnt who you know that matters but who you know theyve been shagging full infantry equipment for a double century of bow benders coming right up if the th century had made poor time the previous day their progress with sore feet and their new burden of armour and weaponry made the previous efforts look sparkling qadir walked alongside marcus as the hamians struggled up a slight incline in the road from the rock towards cauldron fort sweat beading his brow from both the warmth of the day and the weight of his new equipment each man was now shod with the standard heavysoled combat boots the hobnails lazily rapping out their laboured progress this mail must be at least twice the weight of our previous shirts marcus smiled grimly back at him not to mention the arming vest which youll curse all day when its this warm until it saves your delicate skin from being cut by the rings when they stop a blade anyway thats twenty pounds of heavy iron rings from neck to thigh the best armour in the empire strong enough to stop arrow sword or spear just as long as a ring doesnt break or a rivet pop and flexible too the first time you see combat with the bluenoses youll wish it was longer and thicker bluenoses yes our affectionate name for the tribes were fighting they have a tendency to paint themselves up for battle he raised an eyebrow at the hamians disbelieving smile oh you can laugh now but the first time you see a wall of screaming bluepainted lunatics charging at you youll not be quite so amused i see and the spear six pounds each you should be carrying two but we decided that one would be enough given you still have your bows before you ask the sword weighs three pounds the shield twelve the helmet five and theres another five pounds of kit on the carrying pole and you fight in this i can barely walk for the weight marcus nodded i know the first week is the worst once your men get used to the extra weight theyll find theyve grown muscle where there was little before the a scream from the century of tungrians marching to their front snapped his attention to their ranks a man had fallen out of the column an arrow protruding from his thigh buckets and boards dubnuss voice rang out in the sudden shocked silence stirring the stunned troops into a flurry of movement as shields were pulled from the troops backs and helmets thrust over their heads marcus turned to his own men his own order for increased protection dying in his throat qadir his bow already in his hand gestured with an open hand towards the distant treeline with your permission before they realise what we are marcus nodded blankly unprepared for the sudden turn of events be my guest a halfdozen tribal bowmen were standing a few paces from the safety of the trees ready to dart into their shelter just as they had during the outward march three days before nocking a wickedly barbed arrow to his weapons bowstring the hamian effortlessly pulled the bow back to the limit of its ability to store the energy he was forcing into its stressed woodandbone frame he took a moment longer to compose his shot breathing in and half releasing the breath before loosing the arrow in a long shallow arc as the arrow punched into his first target he was already nocking a second missile sending it after the first before the barbarian had completed his nerveless slump to the ground dropping the man standing alongside his first victim even as he gaped at his fallen comrade without quite comprehending what was happening a third man fell as he started to shout a warning and a fourth as the remaining tribesmen turned to run the hamian loosing his arrows with a speed and accuracy unlike any that marcus had seen before morban standing alongside him gaped in astonishment his mouth hung open unnoticed as the big syrians bow spat arrow after arrow at the now terrified barbarians two men were left now another shot dropping one of the pair as they sprinted for the trees in terror of the arrows that were killing them in remorseless succession the last man reached the treeline and darted behind the trunk of a massive oak peeping back out at the watching troops morban roared his approval shaking the centurys standard in triumph five men dead in twenty heartbeats cocidiuss hairy nuts but youre he fell silent as the hamian chosen man nocked a last arrow ignoring the standardbearers noisy approval qadir waited for a long moment holding another deep breath with his eye fixed on the distant tree then loosed his last arrow just as the briton looked out from his hiding place again turning away to resling the weapon across his shoulder without any apparent interest in the shots success for a moment nothing happened but then the last of the tribesmen staggered from his hiding place behind the oak with the last arrow protruding from his neck and fell full length to the ground qadir turned to marcus and repeated his small bow of the previous morning hands open wide at his side julius ran down the road towards them a broad smile on his face bloody good work thatll make the stupid young bastards think twice before any of them try that again lets get on the move again qadir inclined his head respectfully i would with your permission centurion prefer to retrieve my spent arrows and some of those men may not be dead i think i can see one of them moving julius clapped him on the arm pointing to the forests edge and the wounded barbarians youre shithot with a bow thats clear enough but you still have a lot to learn about war here on the frontier those men you just put down can lie there and bleed to death for all i care they might all die where they fell or one or two of them might well make it back to their village either works well enough for us since either way the message gets round the locals in doublequick time your arrows will give them pause for thought and thats a price worth paying centurions saddle your men up and get them moving the exhausted hamians trailed the other centuries on to the hills parade ground late that afternoon wearily forming up for review alongside the replacement tungrians as acting prefect frontinius marched down from the fort morban nudged qadir in the ribs muttering from the side of his mouth right mate thats first spear sextus frontinius or uncle sextus when hes not within earshot hes a decent enough officer straight enough and doesnt even mind being told when hes wrong as long as you dont rub it in if he asks you a question dont try to be clever just answer him and then shut up if he wants to know more hell ask you quick enough frontiniuss step was lively enough but the waiting officers saw the obvious stiffness in his gait and exchanged meaningful glances you can stop pulling faces at each other when you think im not looking yes my bloody knee is still as stiff as a spear shaft and yes it still hurts like buggery when i bend it first thing in the morning and not much less at any other time thats the price you pay for offering an easy target when there are bluenose archers within bowshot all of which is of far less importance than exactly what youve brought back from arab town a double order of tunic lifters was the term the officer of the guard used when he put his head round my office door five minutes ago and it doesnt look like he was far off the mark for all the nice new armour theyre struggling to keep upright so whos going to enlighten me julius stepped forward snapping a crisp salute before walking across to his superior leaning close enough that his words would be for the first spears ear alone our rules sextus frontinius shot him a penetrating stare raising an eyebrow our rules twice in one year this ought to be good the centurion nodded to acknowledge his old friend and superior officers point our rules then the second cohort has a new prefect some hothead fresh from germania with a point to prove the bastard bribed the arab town replacements officer to let him walk off with one of our centuries which left us with two choices either to come back eighty men short or to bring back enough of these hamians to get us back to full strength the first spear raised an eyebrow looking out over the centuries paraded in front of him and you went for numbers it wasnt my first choice ill live with it seeing as weve got them reequipped somewhat more like soldiers than dancing girls and given that one of them killed a halfdozen of the local idiots on the way back but left to me theyd still be sitting in arab town wondering why its so cold in the middle of summer i see well come back to the local idiots so exactly whose first choice was it our young gladiator who else oh i ought to mention that hes asked a certain lady doctor recently widowed if you get my drift for her hand in marriage which cocidius the mighty hunter be forever mystified she seems to have agreed to you can expect the boy at your table one evening soon now asking for your formal permission the first spear raised a sardonic eyebrow shaking his head gently that young mans been nothing but a source of entertainment ever since prince dubnus walked him through the gates but lets concentrate on the hamians for the time being well worry about the marriage later i presume hes intending to practise his transformation skills on his new century julius nodded sagely looks like it im not sure that he understands the difference between what he managed with the ninth century and turning untrained men into soldiers never mind untrained men quite so lacking in muscle he did persuade legatus equitius to cough up the kit to make them look respectable although they talked him into letting them keep their bows hence the dead idiots yes amazing shooting by their chosen man too he knocked over half a dozen of them in less time than it takes to tell the story the fools never knew what hit them until it was too late they were trying the usual shootandrun stuff in fact theyd already hit us on the road east killed one man and wounded another we left him with centurion corvuss wifetobe in the noisy valley base hospital frontinius snorted without mirth so the locals bit off more than they could chew good perhaps theyll think twice in future so these are useful tunic lifters then despite appearances julius shook his head almost imperceptibly his eyes lifted briefly to the sky in unspoken comment theyll shoot well enough but the rest of the pictures just one broken tile after another theyre nearly all twenty pounds underweight and a hands length too short they handle their weapons so badly the bluenoses will piss themselves laughing if we ever have to put them into a battle line and their feet are as soft as silk or at least they were two days ago now theyre just a bloody mess like i said ill live with it and ill give two knives all the help i can but i think its a lost cause two minutes of toetotoe with the locals will see half of them dead and the other half running frontinius nodded slowly his eyes fixed on the hamian ranks i can see your point from here on the other hand were likely to be back in the action before very long and a doublestrength century isnt a thing i can afford to turn my nose up at perhaps we need to allow centurion corvus the benefit of the doubt for a little while parade them properly julius spun away bellowing for the four centuries to come to attention and the two men waited for a long moment for the soldiers to settle down into immobility under the spirited goading of their watch officers the hamians frontinius noted for all their obvious exhaustion settled first and with a minimum of fuss nodding his satisfaction the prefect paced out towards the tungrian replacements and walked the front rank with questioning eyes they still make big lads in tungria i see nice tidy equipment you air your iron the soldier obediently unsheathed his sword presenting the weapons hilt to the officer clean sharp nice quality too a good result id say this is your century centurion rufius yes youre a lucky man although im not sure what youve done to deserve it now lets have a look at our archers he walked along the th centurys front rank assessing their tired but erect stance nice armour new swords and spears too well done centurion corvus good use of initiative to have sixth legion reequip your men although quite how you got equipment this tidy out of their stores is something of a mystery to me marcus met his questioning stare i had a little help from centurion rufius first spear local knowledge still counts apparently good well done rufius ill buy you a cup of wine later on for saving our young colleague the trouble of going through that whole do you know who i am routine this is your new chosen man i presume centurion chosen man qadir first spear thank you chosen might i take a look at that bow qadir saluted smartly and handed him the weapon frontinius tested the bows draw grunting quietly with the effort then handed it back i hear that you killed half a dozen men with this earlier today the chosen man nodded yes first spear frontinius handed the weapon back to him with a look of respect then stepped up to address the century raising his voice to be heard clearly soldiers of the eighth century you may have been born and trained in syria but you are now part of the proudest and most respected auxiliary cohort on the northern frontier the first tungrians have faced battle in these hills many times and always come out on top always we win gentlemen no matter the odds we win we bury our dead we mourn and we move on you will find your comrades hard bitten uncompromising and this may be offputting to you but you will adapt to our way of going about our business i suggest that you start adapting now for i fear that your time to do so will be shorter than might have been ideal welcome to the war the sun was close to the western horizon by the time the nd cohort delivered forth prefect bassuss murderers respectfully summoned by first spear neuto furius strode out on to the parade ground where the cohort had stood for most of the day the soldiers were standing to attention their faces fixed and sullen two soldiers stood out in front of the cohorts third century half a dozen of the cohorts officers arrayed around them furius strolled up to the group eyeing the pair carefully both men fixed their gazes on him both wide eyed and pale with the gravity of their situation the prefect turned to first spear neuto gesturing to the men so these are prefect bassuss murderers neuto nodded grimly yes prefect centurion tertius commands their century centurion tertius stepped forward and saluted briskly soldiers secundus and aulus prefect they have admitted to killing the prefect furius walked up to the pair looking both men in the eyes for several seconds before speaking again you both admit to the crime of murdering your commanding officer aulus said nothing simply turning his bruised face away secundus nodded his face a mask of contempt i done the most of it put my spear through his bronze and his spine in one go and dropped the bastard face down all he did jerking his head towards the man standing alongside him was take his iron to him once he was down you want to take your revenge you take it from me why the soldier spat on the ground in front of the prefects feet sneering into his face he wasnt an officer nor a gentleman he was just a right bastard punishments for this and punishments for that never a nice word for a good job never a day off for the lads when we made him look good i did it but there was plenty more that wished they had i never had to buy a drink for weeks that followed not until they all started to worry about how revenge might be taken furius looked to tertius with a raised eyebrow the officer shook his head never taking his eyes off the man in front of them as he spoke soldier secundus is an inveterate waster prefect he drinks he idles whenever he can he whores hes a good fighter but he lacks discipline i see and this one auluss face was turned away from his officers and his eyes turned to the ground as if to deny the weight of events now pressing down hard on him furius pulled his sword from its scabbard putting the blades point under the silent soldiers chin and forcing it round until they were face to face the blades tip dug into the soft flesh starting a trickle of blood down the terrified mans neck why why attack your prefect when he was already dying there was silence for a long moment before the soldier found his voice quavering with desperation i hated him he had me flogged furius looked to tertius for confirmation twice prefect ten lashes the first time and twentyfive the second soldier aulus is good for nothing slovenly lazy not even a decent fighter prefect bassus had hoped to knock some sense into him furius nodded scowling into the soldiers face and then there he was helpless on the ground and you with a sword in your hand and your blood up from chasing barbarians eh what did you do auluss eyes closed with the memory i stabbed him in the neck just once he didnt move so i didnt do it again tears ran down his cheeks provoking a weary sigh and a sad shake of the head from his centurion you see the problem with the man prefect he cant even make his confession like a man furius nodded decisively then lunged forward without warning burying the swords point deep into the weeping soldiers throat angling the blade upwards under the mans jaw the man crumpled nervelessly his blood spraying across both the officers polished armour furius stepped back from the falling corpse swinging the bloody blade back to point at the other man i made it easy for your comrade here because he was misguided and ineffectual in his complicity with your crime you are the real murderer here and for that you will pay a little more dearly than this simpleton did tie his hands he stepped back the blooded sword still clamped in one hand second tungrians hear my words the cohort stood in absolute silence every man straining to hear whatever their new officer was about to proclaim their former disdain suddenly fascinated attention the prefect pointed to the horizon where the sun was dipping to almost touch the hills to their south and west you have given your comrades up to justice in time to save yourselves two months pay this mans crime he pointed to the corpse huddled on the ground in front of him was to be weak and to be in the wrong place at the wrong time this man on the other hand he pointed the bloodied blade at secundus deserves the heaviest penalty i can award against him tomorrow morning he will be scourged fifty lashes to be administered by the cohorts centurions and then he paused smiling slightly with a clear relish for the sentence he was about to pass once the scourging has been completed to my satisfaction he will be crucified and the cohort will parade past him to receive an example of the punishment to be expected for a crime of this severity his legs will not be broken since he does not deserve anything other than a slow and painful death at the mention of crucifixion the cohort started visibly and even neutos eyes widened as he stood behind his new commanding officer i know that you will be wondering how i can order such a punishment i know that it is more usual for the crime of murder to meet with death by beating with staves to be administered by the killers tent party but this man will meet his fate like the criminal scum that he is he paused for a moment jaw jutting and stared out across the cohorts ranks in challenge he will be guarded tonight by his own century if he dies before the time i have appointed for him or escapes in some amazing and unexpected manner i will have that centurys officer chosen man and watch officer crucified in his place and the rest of his century decimated not once but three times thirty men will die tomorrow if this man fails to make his appointment with the hammer and nails for any reason he turned to first spear neuto inclining his head to indicate that the senior centurion should carry on and then turned and walked back to his tent the bloody gladius still held in his right hand centurion tertius turned to the first spear in amazement once the prefect was safely out of earshot crucifixion first spear in maponuss name neuto snapped at him his tired face contorted with anger dont you dare bring shame on this cohort by appealing to the gods for the life of a senior officers murderer you fool you told me you had no idea who killed bassus and ill continue to believe that since you swore an oath but that man dies tomorrow and thats an end to it he rubbed a hand over his face in the meanwhile you can work off that bitterness by getting your man nicely secured against any unforeseen accidents i expect youll find your chosen man and watch officer more than happy to make sure nothing remiss happens to him then you can build me a cross youll find plenty of wood and nails in the remains of the fort more importantly well need something to hold your man upright tomorrow while hes being flogged tertius frowned puzzlement written across his face upright all the scourgings ive seen have only needed one thick post you bend the victim over it and tie his hands and feet to keep him there while hes having his back opened up the first spear rolled his eyes upwards yes i know and this ones going to be different i want that idiot to be held upright while were flogging him to death if you take my point so i want two posts set in the ground tall enough to hold him up and wide enough to stretch him out standing up with ropes tied around his wrists you can angle them forward just a little too make sure hell stay up even if he loses it halfway through angle them away from the parade ground mind you dismissed it was close to midnight before tertius was done with his preparations for the next day labouring by torchlight his men had set up two stout posts to hold the prisoner up during his ordeal the following day alongside the whipping posts they had erected a simple rough cross formed from two scorched wooden beams one nailed horizontally across the top of the other once it had been sunk deep into the soil that underlaid the parade grounds thick gravel dismissing his work party to wash and find their beds he walked exhaustedly to the tent inside which the centurys watch officer sat patiently showing no sign of weariness ill watch him for an hour go and get a wash and a bite to eat hes not going anywhere the man nodded his respect his backward glances at the prisoner expressing with perfect eloquence what military discipline forbade him to say out loud the prisoner smirked at tertius across the tent thatll be him shitting roof tiles for the next hour id bet you every denarius i have hell go no farther than behind the nearest tent if i hadnt already spent the lot on the noisy valley whores that and if i werent going to be flogged to ribbons and then nailed to a plank for the entertainment of the cohort in the morning tertius shook his head sadly i could find it in my head to feel sorrow for you brother if only you had any idea why you speared the prefect you didnt really know at the time i seem to recall and you still havent got a clue today do you the condemned man shrugged under the heavy ropes securing him to the tent post not really he was there shouting the fucking odds i had the spear you know how it is tertius shook his head again no i really dont mother always wondered how on earth she produced two boys so very different i know just look at the state of you tertius laughed quietly despite himself youre going to die in horrible pain tomorrow secundus doesnt that dent your humour just a little the other man shook his head itll be over soon enough and ill be on the other side of the river so fuck em all he sized his brother up with an appraising glance youve come to say goodbye consider it said youve come to ask me if ill take our secret with me to the grave i will youve done well for yourself young un better than i ever reckoned you would you little bastard make an offering for me whenever theres an altar to bacchus handy theres a good lad the centurion looked up his eyes wet with tears i didnt come to ask you to protect me i came to tell you that ill have revenge for you youve earned a death sentence right enough but not this way not like a bloody barbarian slave that bastards got it coming and ill take his blood for doing this his brother laughed without mirth nodding approval i expect you will youve done everything else you ever set your mind to just dont end up tied to a tent post and waiting to be nailed up after youve done it now dry your eyes and share one last smile with me you dont want to be caught crying over vermin like me he waited while the centurion wiped his eyes and face with the hem of his tunic now before anyone else turns up lets get one more thing agreed eh tertius tilted his head in question what tomorrow when the prefect hands the scourge round to the officers and invites you all to do your bit for military justice the centurion took a long breath composing himself what lay it on me like youve got a pair of swingers the size of apples eh no good my taking our little secret with me to the grave if you cant do your bit furius was relaxing in his tent with a beaker of wine when the tent flap opened and a centurion stepped through the gap coming smartly to attention in front of the astonished furius what the bloody centurion appius reporting prefect the prefect stared at the centurion recognising him as one of the two officers sent to escort him from arab town to join the cohort so it is is it usual in this cohort centurion for individual officers to make their entrance to the prefects tent late in the evening and without any formal request relayed via their first spear appius shook his head still staring straight ahead at the tents far wall but without any of the nervousness that the prefect would have expected his admonishment to provoke in the man no sir i am however responding to your request of a few days ago my request yes sir back in the guest house in arab town you told us that any man that could point you at the fugitive thats reputed to be in hiding with one of the wall cohorts would be well rewarded furius smiled slowly indeed i did centurion appius sir indeed i did appius so what do you have for me theres a young lad serving as an officer with our sister cohort myself and centurion tertius met him in the arab town mess before we came to meet you he looks very roman yes sir dark hair brown eyes and darker skin than we usually get round here unless the men have been shipped in from a lot farther south on top of which he wears a sword with an eagles head as pretty as anything ive ever seen beautifully engraved he had meant to mention the cloak pin whose inscription hed read at arab town but the sceptical look on the prefects face changed his mind and you think hes the missing man eh just because his eyes are brown and he has a nice sword again appius didnt flinch from the harsh words i didnt say i was sure hes the one prefect but i do wonder what a young roman would be doing in such a position i believe its more usually the case that young lads from the right background go to serve with the legions prove themselves fit to command and end up as legion commanders he stopped talking as he realised that an evil look had crept across the prefects face after a moment furius realised that he was no longer speaking and wrenched himself from his bitter reverie what oh yes youre right that is more usually the case so why not bring this to me through the first spear i shouldnt imagine hed be very happy to discover you were here without his permission appius nodded still apparently untroubled by the prefects comments happy sir hed have my balls off with a rusty dagger i just thought given that hes a good friend of the first cohorts first spear that we ought to keep this discussion between us for the first time in the conversation the prefect smiled absolutely right centurion in which case youd best be on your way and come back when youve got some slightly better evidence to offer me eh and dont worry man i wont be letting on to dear old neuto that we had this conversation i dont intend to give either the fugitive if thats what he is or the men hiding him from justice any warning that hes been uncovered you find me the evidence and ill do the rest and ill make sure youre well rewarded for your loyalty to the throne the tungrian officers gathered in the hills gloomy headquarters building for morning reports as usual just before dawn the main halls only illumination the torches burning along its cold stone walls a hulking brown bearded centurion crossed the floor and clasped hands with julius and rufius before turning to marcus accentuating his welcome with a hearty slap of the young mans shoulder well young two knives i hear youve taken pity on us lonely men and recruited in a double century of syrian girlie boys marcus nodded in mock resignation its true i knew that if i returned with a century of infantrymen youd be after me for your cut so i settled for hamian bow twangers instead there are no axemen for you to be lusting after in the eighth century brother youll just have to pester tiberius rufius for your replacements the th centurys centurion slapped his shoulder again laughing easily in the quiet gloom you cunning dog you always were the smart one he turned to rufius his hands spread in supplication and as he says grandfather you do have a fullstrength century of big strong lads surely you can spare me a few half a dozen would be a start ten would be perfect will you help your brother rufius raised his hands defensively backing off from the big man in apparent dismay oh no it just isnt possible titus you know id like to help you but these new boys of mine are all welleducated and housetrained young men drilled in the fine arts of infantry combat and military etiquette i couldnt in good faith condemn any of them to descend to the degraded standards of behaviour your men have sunk to i attention the gathered officers turned to face the door and snapped to attention first spear frontinius had entered the room with the prefect following him brother officers stand at ease make yourselves comfortable i know that youre not used to seeing the prefect at morning reports but we received a courier just before nightfall yesterday with the message weve all been waiting for the new governor has taken command at noisy valley and his first order is for several cohorts including ourselves to march in and join up with the legions as of now the war with the northern tribes is back on again and theres still enough campaigning time left in the year for us to finish calgus and his rabble off if theyre unwise enough to offer us a straight fight he paused for a moment looking around his brother officers were ordered to report for attached duty with sixth victorious by dusk tomorrow night which gives us one day for preparation and then a days march to join the legion youve got today to get your men and their gear ready for a good long stint in the field so i suggest you make the most of that time and make sure we wont have anyones boots falling to pieces or spearheads coming loose at the wrong moment you centurion corvus had better start educating your hamians as to just what it feels like when the bluenoses come knocking and i think youd better have some help with that given the amount of time weve got prefect the man waiting patiently behind him stepped out of the shadows gentlemen for those of you that have been away putting down the carvetii my name is gaius rutilius scaurus my orders from the governor were quite straightforward to get ready for a months campaigning and bring my cohort across to join with the sixth legion by the end of tomorrow given the sparse nature of those orders there isnt all that much to be said on that particular subject but i can give you an insight into this new governor i believe that the last man to hold the post tended to take a back seat to the legion commanders when it came to setting the pace of operations that will not be the case under ulpius marcellus i can assure you well soon be up in calguss face and looking to provoke him to come out of whatever hideyhole hes hidden himself in and fight i know this cohort has a proud reputation and i know that reputation only got stronger given the fight you won against the odds earlier this summer i think you can confidently expect the governor to be keen to make full use of your abilities so make sure your men are ready for action because make no mistake gentlemen its coming your way first spear frontinius stepped forward thank you prefect we parade at dawn as usual full kit and marching order please both practice swords and iron to be worn today my brothers is going to be a long day for us all dismissed gentlemen with the exception of the following officers corvus julius rufius and dubnus i need a discussion with the four of you on the subject of getting our newest recruits ready to fight before this new governor puts us back into the war the nd tungrian cohort paraded soon after first light once the cohort had marched on to the rocks parade ground found their places under the grey sky and settled down prefect furius walked out in front of them with a grim face he nodded to neuto and the first spear rapped out a crisp order bring out the prisoner soldier secundus was marched on to the parade ground and tied to the whipping posts his arms stretched tightly out to either side to keep him upright ropes strung between the posts at chest and groin level waited to catch his body when as was usual with heavy floggings he passed out with the pain and loss of blood the men guarding him stripped away the loincloth that had been his only garment and stepped away from the whipping posts prefect furius squinted across the parade ground at the posts a note of uncertainty in his voice an interesting arrangement first spear not exactly standard neuto nodded shrugging its my usual method in these circumstances prefect once the scourgings well under way hell faint away from loss of blood and pain and i like to keep them on their feet keeps the blood in the body longer and lets the troops see the mess were making of the man sets an example if you like he watched the prefect carefully as the man raised an appreciative eyebrow good thinking first spear neuto sets an example indeed neuto muttered a silent prayer of thanks to his gods nodding his respect to the prefect with his face an inscrutable mask thank you prefect now if youll permit me he walked out in front of the cohort shouting for the waiting men to come to attention second cohort the silence while the soldiers waited for him to speak again was almost tangible second cohort you will this morning witness the execution of the man that murdered prefect bassus let this be an example to you of how we deal with criminals within our ranks he walked grimly across to the helpless prisoner readying himself to play his part as the first officer to wield the scourge shaking its leather ropes loose with an impatient gesture before pulling his arm back in readiness for the first blow hold furius stepped forward his hand outstretched i think ill take the first five first spear you did the hard work yesterday in getting the fool to confess he hefted the scourge for a moment letting all gathered see him examine the braided ropes jagged pieces of bone knotted into the leather at each fingerlength from the handle then flicked the whip high over his shoulder before delivering a fearsome blow across secunduss back from right shoulder to left kidney he struck again aiming at the left shoulder to paint a rough cross of deeply scored wounds on the condemned soldiers back blood began to seep slowly down the valley of the mans spine the third blow was delivered horizontally across the small of the prisoners back the prefect swinging his whole body into the whips vicious strike the fourth blow scourged his backside clawing deep into the soft flesh of his buttocks while the fifth was delivered with shocking power straight down the back of his head ripping away lumps of hair and scalp the last blow tore a moan of pain from the previously silent soldier furius turned back to his suddenly wideeyed troops walking the few paces to the third century and handing the whip to tertius a soldier from a century to his left suddenly bent double and noisily puked his breakfast up on to the parade ground momentarily unable to comply with his centurions barked command to get back in the ranks five lashes per centurion starting with the prisoners own officer and all to be delivered with the same force ive just demonstrated two to the back one to the kidneys one to the arse and one to the head any man going easy on this piece of shit at any time will be ordered to repeat the blow and be subjected to administrative punishment and loss of pay i know thats five more than i ordered but lets call it five more for luck eh begin tertius stepped forward the tremor in his right eye hidden from the watching soldiers by his helmets brim hesitating for a second that seemed to last a lifetime as he looked down at the scourges bloody leather ropes a piece of skin was caught on one of the whips bone teeth almost translucent in the early morning sun and he bent to flick it away into the parade grounds dust go on lad the words snarled through his brothers gritted teeth snapped him back to the moment he bent over the whip readying himself to swing it back over his head for the first stroke and muttered a reply that only his brother would hear ill be making a sacrifice in your memory brother but not to bacchus my offering will be to nemesis he arched his back to put the maximum possible power into the first stroke before swinging the bloody leather ropes across his brothers back that part of him which quailed at the horrible damage wrought by the scourges bone teeth buried deep beneath both the need for survival and the possibility of sparing his brother the crosss final indignity wielding the scourge with such power that his feet left the ground momentarily during each stroke he hammered the whips flailing tails into secunduss body with all his strength with the fifth blow delivered raking as powerfully into the helpless body suspended in front of him as the first tertius turned back to the cohort with a stone face seeing neutos nod of approval out of the corner of his eye as the first spear took the scourge from him as tertius settled into the parade rest at the head of his century he saw the senior centurion deliver his first blow grunting explosively with the force he put into the scourges application more than one of the whips tails flew astray their bone teeth flicking across the prisoners throat unseen by most of the men on parade as he watched his eyes narrowed with the realisation as to just why neuto had bid him set up the unusual whipping posts the first spear delivered the same blow to the other shoulder and again the whip strayed fractionally in its path to rake across the helpless soldiers neck the prefect stood contentedly to one side as the whip was passed to the next centurion with a few quiet words of encouragement from neuto his satisfaction evident as this officer also laid into the prisoner with all his strength again the first two strokes flicked around his brothers throat and watching the mans legs carefully he saw a thin rivulet of blood twisting round the bared thigh a sharpeyed soldier to tertiuss right muttered a comment to his mate and he whirled round rapping his vine stick across the mans arm with a meaningful stare silence in the ranks after thirty or so lashes secundus sank against the ropes stretched across his body the agonising pain and blood loss robbing him of his ability to stay upright the blood running down his neck no longer sheeted down his chest and legs to merge with that flowing from his ruined back but now fell in a shower of heavy drops into the gravel a foot in front of his feet still the prefect did not seem to realise that the prisoner was now fighting for his very life and the officers continued to take their turn with the scourge now heavy with torn flesh and an accumulation of drying blood the cohorts mood had subtly changed as the scene had played out in front of them and as more of the soldiers had realised that their prefect was being robbed of his crucifixion with every heavy drop of blood that fell from their comrades neck previously standing in sullen resignation they now watched with hawkeyed attention the vigour with which each centurion prosecuted his share of the flogging realising with something approaching gratitude their officers determination to kill the man with the whip and spare him the crosss agonising asphyxiation with the punishments completion the first spear stepped forward and put an expert finger to the motionless prisoners bloody windpipe pulling a face and turning back to the cohort with a shout for assistance bandage carrier while the field medic fussed around the prisoner seeking a pulse the senior centurion grimaced to furius it happens sometimes the jews i believe limit the practice to forty lashes for fear of killing the offender he paused as the bandage carrier turned and shook his head as seems to have been the case here no matter prefect justice has been done and been seen to be done we have a cross ready shall we nail him up and parade the men past his corpse the prefect stared closely at his deputy for a moment his eyes narrowed slightly in suspicion but the first spears return gaze was blameless furius nodded his face sour indeed first spear a shame to be robbed of the mans last agonised breaths though the wistful look on his face told neuto everything he needed to know about his new commander the tungrian cohort marched down the hill to the parade ground an hour after dawn with both purpose and trepidation the troops were unusually quiet and orderly in the cold early light reflecting soberly on orders that could see any or all of them dead inside the month the prefect stood alongside first spear frontinius watching the centuries march past his german bodyguard close behind him the redhaired giant a full head taller than his master had excited much comment in the cohort both for the obvious strength in his heavily muscled and scarred body and as a result of his apparent unwillingness to speak to anyone save the prefect himself more than one of the officers had greeted the man to be met with no more than a respectful nod of his massive head while there was nothing at which anyone could take offence neither was there any hint that the man would be a source of either conversation or more importantly to the cohorts soldiers information your men look purposeful enough first spear although id expected a little more prefect scaurus paused for a moment searching for the right word banter horseplay usually youd have got it they express themselves just like any other cohort on the frontier but they know whats coming we lost the best part of two centuries at lost eagle and they were probably assuming that it was too late in the year for any more serious campaigning the prefect nodded his understanding nobody can say they havent demonstrated their loyalty to the emperor this year thats the problem with reputations theres always someone that wants to see them demonstrated frontinius studied the younger man with a sideways glance as his new commander watched the centuries flowing out of the fort and down its paved road on to the wide parade ground a head taller than the first spear the prefect had a spare frame more suited to distance running than infantry combat yet seemed to carry the weight of his armour and helmet easily enough and speaking of reputations youre still not sure what to make of what you see eh first spear frontinius started at his prefects comment delivered in a level almost bored tone without the younger man ever taking his eyes off the marching troops im sorry prefect i was just relax it would be a strange thing if you werent still wondering what to expect from your new commander right about now i should probably be telling you what an experienced soldier i am putting your mind at ease on the subject of whether im fit for command of your men am i right after all ive been here for a fortnight and never once even hinted at my experience beyond telling you what positions ive served in previously frontinius nodded grudgingly its often the case that a new commander will make a point of telling his officers about any fighting hes taken part in although i dont really he stopped talking as scaurus turned to look at him with a halfsmile playing on his lips i know you want to know my capabilities but you dont want to overstep the mark in asking me to tell you where ive been and what ive done well first spear lets have an agreement shall we i wont question you on the subject of your competence other than wanting every last tiny detail about this cohort and this war from you and in return youll let me demonstrate the way i work by just watching me work whether you take that as a sign of strength or weakness doesnt really concern me very much and well learn a good deal more about each other than we might by trotting out lists of achievements that either of us could have gilded or even plain fabricated for all the other man knows agreed frontinius held his return stare for a moment before nodding slowly as you wish prefect the cohort paraded the grounds sandy surface grey in the dawns weak light frontinius strode out in front of his eight hundred men addressing them at a volume that made his words audible from one end of the parade to the other good morning first cohort this is an important day this day will live as long in your memories as that little skirmish with the bluenoses a few weeks ago he paused for a moment watching the faces of those men in the ranks closest to him their expressions betraying a mixture of faint amusement and sick apprehension this is the day we go back to war now that weve got a new prefect and two centuries of replacements we are considered ready to fight our orders are to march east and join up with the sixth legion for one last effort before the weather gets too cold for us to stay in the field soldiers this cohort was the first one on the list when the governor was deciding which units to put alongside his legions in the line of battle you are proven battle winners and your reputation goes before you he paused searching the same faces and finding them mostly set with determination good enough i know that you were hoping not to be called back into the war this year but i also know that you are strong enough to give the emperor your best efforts for as long as it takes to finish this war and put calgus in chains and on his way to rome and now before we start let me introduce you to your new comrades the sixth century eighty homegrown tungrian recruits to bolster our fighting strength and the eighth century a doublestrength century of archers from hamath in the province of syria far to the east of rome as of this moment they are fully fledged members of this cohort and i expect them to be treated with the appropriate respect its obvious to all of you that the men of the eighth century are different to the troops that we usually encounter but i dont expect that to make any difference to any soldier here the first man in front of me at the punishment table for raising a hand to any of these men without very good reason will feel like hes been hit by a falling tree by the time ive finished with him he paused for breath raking the impassive troops with a hard stare nevertheless our new hamian comrades do present us with something of a problem in that they are unused to bearing the kind of weight that we routinely carry around on campaign and so he gestured to his officers and then waited while marcus dubnus rufius and julius walked out in front of the cohort to join him the eighth century will need help to achieve the same performance as the rest of you and so i am therefore temporarily detaching these three centurions from their centuries and giving them and centurion corvus forty men from the eighth apiece to work with with a little luck well have our new centuries ready for anything the bluenoses can throw at them by the time that we see action centurions carry on with morning exercises the four centurions quickly divided the th into four equalsized groups each of them pulling their temporary command into a tight huddle around them marcus having retained qadir in his party spoke slowly giving his chosen man time to translate his words for those men whose grasp of latin was imperfect you may be archers but youre going to learn to fight as infantrymen and youre going to do it quickly whenever we have the opportunity you will train as one century but with frequent and close attention to your sword and shield drill my brother officers and i will help you learn how to fight in practice combat with their centuries but first we need you to grasp the basics and the first basic is shield handling you come out in front with me the wideeyed hamian stepped away from the comfortable anonymity of his place in the front rank eyeing his new officer uncertainly and casting the occasional nervous glance at qadir raise your shield until you can just see over the top no higher thats right now brace yourself and remember that your shield is your only defence against the enemys swords and spears well worry about spears later so lets see how you do against a trained swordsman antenoch his clerk stepped forward swinging a heavy wooden practice sword and smiling at the nervous archer in anticipation as he limbered up to fight he held up the sword making sure the hamian got a good look at its scarred wooden blade this is a practice sword its heavier than the real thing to help build strength in the sword arm and that means it will make an almighty bang when it hits your shield it will jar your shield arm but if you drop the shield then the next thing you know youll be face down with your guts hanging out ready the hamian managed a hesitant nod triggering antenochs attack hammering at the mans shield with the heavy wooden sword he beat back the panicking archer until the hamian was almost on his knees then thrust the blade over the top of his sinking shield to inflict a painful jab into the gap between his mail coats neck and the rim of his helmet he stepped back from his grimacing victim watching the man rub the sore spot you let the shield fall and opened yourself up for the kill youre dead get back in ranks you come out here another man stepped out to face him his face set in determination good you look keen lets see what you can do remember keep that shield up ten seconds later the hamian was on his back cursing at the pain in his right ankle while antenoch reached down to pull him back to his feet that was better but if an enemy sees that your shield is held too high hes likely to try to go under it and cut your feet off you need to keep your eyes open and drop your shield to stop his attack if necessary lets try that again qadir leaned across to marcus and if two men attack at the same time one high and one low surely then the man is doomed marcus smiled without taking his eyes off antenochs demonstration not if hes in possession of the infantrymans two most important assets the chosen man raised an eyebrow and those are marcus lifted the ornately decorated gladius bequeathed to him by legatus sollemnis halfway out of its scabbard the razoredged blade gleaming in the weak morning sun one of these and those he pointed at the gathered hamians as they watched antenochs demonstration with wide eyes soldiers marcus shook his head not soldiers qadir brothers and all in good time calgus strolled out of his tent later that morning having apparently spent the night there in reality he had entered it less then five minutes before through an opening cut in the side facing the forest having made the return journey through the forest by the light of torches carried by his bodyguard his adviser aed was waiting for him as summoned and the old man looked up at his king with a calculating gaze the slight wind ruffling his thin hair my lord i trust your venture into the forest met with acceptable results calgus nodded looking out over the camp from their vantage point the highest ground within the palisade wall oh yes very acceptable once their initial caution was out of the way when the time is right our trap will spring shut on the legions with a finality that will remove the print of their boots from our soil for good we will slaughter romans in numbers not seen since their great german massacre and after that disaster theyve never attempted to colonise the lands beyond the rhenus in all the one hundred and fifty years that have followed i will make these lands as great a source of terror to the romans as ever the forests of germania were and drive them back into their fortresses far to the south of their wall never to return the old man nodded his soft voice expressing views intended for his kings ears alone a glorious aim my lord before that however you may have to consider dealing with king brennus at some point in the near future in your absence he has continued to spread discontent and his defiance will inevitably encourage others to consider their obedience to you do we still need his peoples spears in our strength given your apparent success in bringing fresh support to our cause calgus nodded looking down the slope to the votadini section of the camp i suppose not given their continual agitation against me but i cannot send them back to their land my own warriors would start to question the need for them to remain were that many spears to walk away and as for the other kings aed smiled thinly his eyes bright with purpose perhaps there is an opportunity here were the votadini to be caught in the open by our enemies they would undoubtedly be massacred to the last man that would leave their king alone and isolated here and his kingdom open for annexation if only we could find someone within their number with sufficient ambition to allow himself to be lured into such a mistake it is quite possible that our enemy would remove the problem without ever dreaming of the service they would be performing for you he paused for a moment his sly glance flicking to meet his kings amused stare perhaps you might cultivate king brennuss nephew martos my friends in their camp tell me that he longs to lead the tribe into battle at their head and cover his roof beams with roman heads calgus shook his head slowly a smile spreading across his face as the audacity of the idea gripped his imagination gods aed but youll outdo me for ruthlessness any time you like you advise me to send the votadini to their deaths murder their king and take his lands aed shrugged his expression neutral sometimes large problems demand harsh solutions my lord the votadini will be no worse off under your control than under brennus and there is no way you can trust the man his behaviour shouts his defiance of your reign and he has more men available than are camped here if the warriors he has held back succeed in their search for the hostages he will have us both at spear point five minutes after the news of their release reaches him a change of leadership might bring some relief from his incessant complaining and scheming i suspect that he is in contact with the romans calgus laughed i dont doubt hes in contact with them or how could he have been so confident that my head would buy him peace with them i dont think his men will find their kinfolk in a year of searching and i dont believe that we can kill him and be sure that the act wont have repercussions beyond our control but i take your point hes a focus for discontent and that can only get stronger once we join battle with the romans and their lackeys there is an idea ive been musing on these last few days a way to bring the remaining legions north with a fury on them that will have their heads in our trap before they have the time to see it perhaps i might invite brennuss nephew along to share the spoils the morning stayed dry despite the gathering clouds threatening rain and by the break for the midday ration marcus reckoned that the hamians had absorbed as much shield drill as they were going to for one day dubnus confirmed his view with a weary shake of his head their heads have gone to cabbage its all too much for them i vote we get them out in the hills and get some air into their lungs the other officers agreed and once the midday ration was consumed the th was formed into column of march and headed off into the land to the walls south initially setting a gentle pace marcus gradually increased his speed at the columns head until the hamians were covering ground at something like the rate required to keep up with the rest of the cohort on the march he turned and walked backwards for a moment assessing their sweating strained faces and painful gaits before calling across to morban keep them moving im going for a chat with qadir the chosen man was halfway down the column encouraging a flagging man to keep up his pace marcus waved to dubnus pointing at the struggling archer and his friend ran up the column with a barked command to keep moving this mans finding it hard and i need to talk with the chosen man can you help him along for a few minutes dubnus nodded gesturing qadir to surrender his place alongside the flagging archer the mans eyes now rolling with desperation the chosen man moved aside and in a second the massively built centurion was in his place his mouth close to the strugglers ear are you finding this difficult the man nodded would you like to stop the hamian nodded eagerly his face lightening with the promise of relief marcus winced knowing what was coming next as dubnus sucked in a lungful of air and bellowed his response into the flagging soldiers ear well you fucking well cant stop because if you do ill put my boot up your arse to the third lace hole youre in the field your centurys on the march and youll stop for nothing and nobody unless your officer says so its march or fucking die for you sonny and the rest of you so forget that it hurts and focus on the man in front of you if he can do it so can you you in the next rank stop your fucking smirking unless you want to come for a private run with me and see how long you last you bowtwanging ration thief marcus shrugged at qadirs raised eyebrows as they moved a few paces away from the marching columns path he was my chosen man until recently and he seems to have retained the noncommissioned officers approach to motivation farther down the line julius was giving another man the same treatment his face contorted with apparent rage that pain youre feeling is weakness leaving your body so stop your snivelling and march you maggot if you fall out of the line of march i will beat you back into it with my vine stick and if that breaks ill use the flat of my fucking sword you can either march or choke but whichever one its going to be fucking get on with it qadir looked back for a long moment and then turned back to his centurion with evident distaste it is not my approach marcus shrugged more than a little embarrassed at his chosen mans air of disappointment i know but given the time we have to make these men battle ready were left with little alternative youre going to have to harden your heart a little chosen or your men arent going to be ready when the time comes for them to march and fight with the rest of the cohort the other man nodded unhappily as marcus continued yesterday they finished a march that should have taken four hours in twice that time and their feet were raw meat before they even started if we take them into the field in this state theyll be a liability to the cohort incapable of either marching or fighting so ive got two choices i either get them fit at a reasonable pace and give them time for their feet to recover or i push them through their pain and get quicker results and you and i need quicker results their feet will turn to leather quickly enough but i need your help i need you alongside me while im pushing them so that they can see theres no way out of this nightmare except to give more of themselves than they knew they had in them qadir looked at him a hint of disbelief in his face and if they do not have any more of themselves to give marcuss smile was grim oh theyve got it we all do it just has to be pulled out of them my friend dubnus has one method rufius julius and i are all a little different in style but were all looking to get the same results by the time weve finished with your men theyll march thirty miles in a day and still be singing their hearts out for the last mile theyll stand in line and stop a barbarian charge with the rest of the cohort i hope theyll still be archers but they will be infantrymen i promise you that the century marched on for another twenty minutes until marcus judged that they had reached the point he had agreed earlier with julius morban gave the signal for the halt reinforced by the centurys trumpeter blasting out a single note rest break water only and leave your field rations alone the hamians sagged exhausted to the ground for the most part and marcus allowed them a few minutes of rest before gaining their attention with three raps of his practice sword on a soldiers shield eighth century there is something wrong here can anyone tell me what it is no a silver sestertius to the man that can tell me not you morban you already know the answer the hamians stared at him and about them searching with renewed interest anyone no the answer isnt out there its right in front of me the hamians stared at marcus uncomprehendingly as he hardened his voice with scorn the second i called the rest halt you soldiers were on your backs without a care in the world no guards posted no one worried about anything beyond getting a gutful of water and no concern for what might be over the next hill or waiting for you in that wood he pointed at the treeline two hundred paces distant and blew his whistle in a shrill blast armed and armoured men emerged from the trees forming into a battle line lucky for you thats only the fifth century and not a bluenose warband screaming for your blood there are two lessons to be taken from this one you take your rest stops standing up from now on and each tent party chooses a man to stand guard with the specific duty of watching the ground around them for danger now would anyone care to guess the second lesson the hamians stared at him blankly and a feeling of neardespair made the young centurion shake his head the next lesson gentlemen is basic infantry fighting in two minutes those soldiers are going to charge into our line in exactly the same way the bluenoses will once they get the chance this is your chance to practice your shield drills from this morning form a line move later that evening with the sun well beneath the horizon and the th century nursing blisters and aches in their barrack too tired on their return to the fort for there to be any point in archery practice the centurions gathered for a cup of wine in the hills officers mess marcus tipped his cup back and called for another with a speed that raised rufiuss eyebrows julius and dubnus exchanged knowing glances and rufius tipped the cup towards him ostentatiously staring into its emptiness anyone would think youd had a hard day lad rather than the gentle stroll round the hills that we enjoyed today or is there something on your mind perhaps marcus blew a long breath out through his lips what do you think we march for noisy valley tomorrow and we could be in action against the tribes a few days after that how in cocidiuss name are we going to turn them into soldiers before they have to fight for their lives against men that have spent most of their lives getting ready to kill them julius shook his head his scorn evident even through a mouthful of dried meat one day and youre giving up just because my lads gave your boys a gentle spanking marcus closed his eyes at the memory juliuss th century had battered the th into submission in less than a minute despite being half their strength the brutal simplicity of their assault had scattered the hapless hamians like chaff and their march back to the hill had been a sombre plod conducted in resentful silence rufius shook his head on the other side of the table our young friends dismay is simply the result of inexperience he put his cup down placing both hands on the tables scarred surface marcus have you ever taken a century of recruits from raw to trained your exploits with the ninth dont count your lads were already infantry trained they just lacked the right leadership until you turned up i dont doubt your ability to lead experienced soldiers im just asking if youve ever been part of turning a collection of farm boys into infantrymen marcus shook his head slowly i wasnt a guard officer for long enough and the praetorians tend to take in men whove already had the rough edges hammered off them you see taking stupid lazy kids and turning them into fighting men is a bit of an art julius nodded sagely and even dubnus was giving the veteran centurion an approving look you get them on the parade ground on their first day and youd swear they didnt know left from right much less which end of their new spear has the pointy iron thing attached all youve got is eighty or so individuals some stupid some lazy and all of them utterly clueless as a legion centurion faced with that all youve got to help you is a chosen man to push them around from behind and a watch officer who if youre lucky has trained recruits before that and a few simple rules learned from older and possibly wiser men down the years of your service rufius raised an eyebrow to the other two both of whom nodded sagely as he continued his lecture there are only three tricks that a centurion has to perform to turn the average bunch of teenage idiots into trained troops ready to try their hand against the barbarians number one is obvious he has to drill them in the use of shield sword and spear in every spare moment until every possible move attack or defend is as natural to them as breathing that way theyll do whatever he orders without even having to think about it number two he has to get them fit ready to run all day if thats whats needed and he has to run alongside them every step of the way or lose their respect but those are the easy bits and without trick number three all you end up with is a bunch of fit idiots who know how to sling a spear but cant see any reason why they should he paused for a drink aware that every officer in the room was listening now most of them with faint smiles he gestured around the mess with his free hand see both young caelius and that battered old bastard otho both know what i mean trick number three is the most delicate and difficult trick a centurion ever gets to try it isnt written down anywhere because every one of us does it a different way depending on our personal style and who we learned it from for some officers its the most natural thing in the world others find it so difficult that they can never really get their recruits to swallow it i know that i can do it and every other man in this room knows the same or he wouldnt be here i also know that your bow benders wont learn even the most basic moves properly unless we apply it to them good and hard i can teach you how to do it if youll let me he paused giving his friend a long stare but youre a good man educated cultured yes youre a trained gladiator and youve killed on the battlefield enough times to show youre a warrior we all respect that but marcus put his cup down a note of irritation creeping into his voice go on its simple enough trick number three is about being a bastard thats the top and bottom of it your recruits have to know that given the slightest excuse youll come down on them so hard theyll be reaching up to wipe their arses and marcus im just not sure youve got enough bastard in you to turn these boys around given the amount of time weve got he glanced up as the mess door opened and a bulky figure ducked through it into the room oh cocidius help me here comes the bear for another try at lifting a tent party out of my century the next morning dawned grey and damp with an insidious drizzle that swirled in the fitful wind and found its way beneath the ths cloaks and into their armour even before the bears th century had stamped down the line to their place at the far end of the cohort frontinius who made a point of keeping his most likely replacement as first spear fully briefed at all times walked alongside juliuss th century as they marched down the forts steep road to the parade ground his conversation with his brother officer conducted in tones too quiet for the soldiers marching alongside them to overhear so all in all you really dont know what to make of our new commander the first spear nodded wryly thats about the size of it he hasnt given me any hint as to his previous experience beyond the positions hes held previously which wouldnt worry me too much if his career wasnt quite so unusual julius glanced across at him unusual it didnt occur to me at first but people like him members of the equestrian class they follow set paths through their lives he was prefect of an auxiliary cohort over ten years ago by my reckoning which would have made him about twentyfive and thats younger than is usual for a first command theyre supposed to do a few years of public service to knock the rougher edges off them before theyre let loose on the army after that he was a tribune with twelfth thunderbolt during the war against the quadi and then again with the fifth macedonica fighting the marcomanni i reckon he would have completed that last stint a couple of years ago and after that exactly nothing at all until he pops up here as an auxiliary prefect again its all wrong julius he should have gone on from his tribunate to command a fivehundredstrong cavalry wing and by now he should be commanding a fullstrength wing like our old friend licinius either that or be retired to public service instead of which he seems to be going backwards there are two goodsized questions about our new prefect that id like to hear the answers to for a start why has he been demoted from his last declared position back to command of an infantry cohort julius nodded his agreement and whats he been doing for the last two years exactly something doesnt add up here and until i know the answers to those questions im not going to turn my back on the man julius grunted his agreement then raised a crafty eyebrow i meant to ask have you had anyone in front of you asking for permission to marry since we got back from arab town the first spears face brightened funny you should ask there was a young centurion in to see me only last night bright young lad seems to have found a good woman a widow but young enough and with some skills that would make her a valuable person to have around the cohort he made a persuasive case for all that were only days away from marching back into bluenose territory and he might be dead in a week yes we had a good chat on the subject and frontinius turned to face him a mocking smile on his face our rules just sextus and julius old mates that enlisted on the same day and have always reserved the right to ignore rank and speak our minds to one another julius nodded well under normal conditions i would as first spear be forced to tell you that i must respect the confidential nature of the conversation under our rules however i can tell you he paused for a moment drawing out the silence as the th century marched past them yes to mind your own business you nosy bugger he stalked on to the parade ground with a grim smile at the weather and called for his centurions to brief their troops on the days march to noisy valley marcus turned to face the hamians already looking bedraggled in the persistent drifting rain and found that unlike on the previous day he was the sole object of their attention one hundred and sixty pairs of eyes were fixed on him their message a combination of anger and misery and he paused for a long moment before speaking good morning eighth century he paused and smiled into their resentment today you see britannia in all its true glory we get weather like this roughly one day in every five youll be pleased to hear today we will be making the march to noisy valley which will get you warmed up soon enough but before we do lets consider yesterday we marched fifteen miles at the standard campaign pace and nobody failed to finish even if some of you needed some encouragement along the way he waited for one of the sea of stony faces to crack nothing halfway through the march we conducted a surprise attack which unsurprisingly didnt go very well you were assaulted by a century of battlehardened soldiers and you lost painfully some of you have bruises to show for that defeat and youve all got sore feet its raining youre cold youre wet and youd like nothing better than for me and my brother officers to drop dead on the spot if you could stand here and look at yourselves with my eyes youd see unhappy men some of you angry most of you just sullen and let me tell you let me guarantee you its going to get worse today we march to war he glanced up the line and saw that most of the cohorts centuries were already on the move back up the hill to the fort nodding to qadir he gestured for the th century to follow chosen get them moving get some breakfast into them and make sure theyre ready to march straight afterwards once the century was climbing back up the hills steep slope he dropped back to qadirs place at the columns rear good morning chosen the big man inclined his head good morning centurion how does the day find our men truthfully centurion anything else would be to the detriment of us both then truthfully centurion they are tired footsore and they long for anywhere other than this living hell marcus nodded recalling rufiuss advice of the previous evening exactly as i would expect and its going to get worse for them before it gets better im afraid but i have only two choices chosen one being to drive them through this hell while the other is to allow them to surrender to their pain and misery no choice at all really they have to reach the infantrymans sad understanding of his plight since time began which is centurion that theres something worse than pounding on down the road when your feet hurt when the rains bucketing down and there are still twenty miles to go before stopping to build a camp for the night they have to understand that keeping going is much better than what will happen to them if they stop qadir marched on in silence for a moment before responding and if you gain a century of infantrymen while losing their skills with the bow we did not practise yesterday and now we must march for most of the day marcus took a long moment to answer in all truth qadir i would take what this cohort so badly needs and count the loss as an acceptable price acceptable for you and for these men i would expect the loss to be devastating to them and you would be right marcus paused again taking stock of the moment qadir my brother officers tell me that in their experience we must take this century to its limits to find their motivation and that without motivation they will never be ready for what awaits them to the north in time if that happens then you and i might as well cut each of our mens throats now and save the barbarians the trouble if im going to make them into soldiers fit to march north past the wall and into enemy territory then you and i must both be as one in our approach to their training qadir looked away from the line of their march for a moment beads of water falling from his helmet as he strode along beside the ths last rank i do not like the thought of descending to behaviour as base as that i have seen from your brother officers i feel that it demeans these men who have joined your army under such different circumstances to be used so roughly and in a cause for which they are simply not prepared and yet marcus held his breath while the hamian paused as if lost in thought and yet i see that we are trapped in this terrible place and so i will ally myself with you in using their methods to make my men fit to survive this coming journey into darkness marcus sighed audibly with relief qadir i but there is a condition i must beg you to accept without it all is lost to these men whether or not they become the soldiers you so crave them to be i must insist that we find a way to give them time to practise with their bows each day the young centurion nodded i was just about to get to that the cohort mustered on the parade ground again after breakfast each centurys tents cooking gear and rations packed on to carts that would form part of the supply train moving in the cohorts centre on the march as the th century marched down the hill to their place on the parade ground morbans usual place at their head was occupied by antenoch while the standardbearer stood with his grandson lupus at the forts gate hopping from foot to foot in his impatience where is the dozy old bag the cohort will be leaving in a matter of minutes and i cant leave you here alone perhaps that idiot boy didnt deliver my message a young woman came into view running up the hill past the centuries making their way down to the parade ground she saw the waiting standardbearer and dashed up to him breathlessly panting out her news morban listened for a moment then left the weeping child in her company and hurried down to where marcus stood in front of the ths men centurion the boys grandmother marcus listened for a moment told the standardbearer to take his place at the centurys head and walked briskly to the first spears review platform excuse me first spear centurion we have a problem sir morbans grandson was to stay with his grandmother in one of the local villages but weve just had word that shes died overnight theres no other family to leave him with and as the son of a soldier he left the sentence unfinished both men knew that the boy would be fair game for the locals without his last direct family member to keep them at bay the threat of massive reprisals would ensure that nobody local was stupid enough to take fire or iron against the fort in their absence but the victimisation or even the murder and quiet disposal of a soldiers child would be another matter entirely frontinius gave the matter less than a seconds thought bring him with us to noisy valley well find someone there to look after him while we go hunting barbarians in the hills morban nodded in quiet relief pointing to the wagon bearing the centurys equipment get on that cart lad sit still and dont touch anything thank you centurion i couldnt have left the poor little sod here on his own marcus nodded his mind elsewhere as the leading century started marching up the hill that separated the fort from the military road that ran to the east and west behind the line of the wall well take him as far as noisy valley and no farther im not risking him getting mixed up in a fullscale battle and in the meantime youre responsible for his good behaviour that means no wagering while hes around you and no whoring either not that i expect youll get much of a chance with several thousand legionaries ahead of you in the queue the cohort arrived at the noisy valley fort late in the afternoon and was directed into temporary defences thrown up alongside the partially rebuilt wooden fortress that dominated the main road to the north they were camped alongside the th legion and several other cohorts from along the walls length as the hamians gratefully slumped to the ground for a short rest before pitching their eightman tents morban slapped the th centurys trumpeter on the shoulder with his free hand no digging for us tonight my lad lets make a beeline for the vicus or whatever the lazy bastards have rebuilt of it see if we cant find a wet to wash the dust from our throats marcus put out a hand to detain him not so fast standardbearer first we need to make sure that our new troops get their tents pitched in such a way that the first gust of wind wont blow them away after that i want an hours practice with spears and shields and after that theyll need to have the evening campaign routine explained to them all of which means that youre going to be the busiest man in the century and thats before you spend whatever times necessary to look after your grandson the th century exercised with their spears once their camp was set up their efforts under the tuition of the four centurions watched with amusement by the rest of the cohort and with exasperation by the first spear who called marcus over to him after a few minutes standing in silence beside the exercise ground utter rubbish youll not get them slinging a spear straight in anything less than a month and well be in action inside a week take their spears off them and find a way to get them motivated to learn which end of their swords does the damage if that demonstrations any guide well have to dump them on the hamian cohort as replacements the century lined up to hand their spears in to the quartermaster with broad smiles although their relief was soon forgotten in the face of marcuss grimfaced statement once they were back on the parade ground julius rufius and dubnus stood behind him their faces dark with anger at the implied criticism of their training methods their harsh stares scouring the centurys suddenly solemn ranks for any sign of levity youve had your spears taken away because you were about as much use with them as a gang of vicus drunks some of you seem to regard that as a victory your officers on the other hand consider it something of a disgrace just to be clear any attempt to provoke the removal of your swords and shields by means of such wilful underperformance will result instead in the loss of the only thing that seems to matter to you if you fail to improve your collective performance with your remaining infantry weapons i will have no choice but to relieve you of your bows and turn you over to the sixth legions camp prefect for general duties you either make a bloody effort or youll find yourselves cleaning out the latrines on a permanent basis he paused and scowled across the centurys ranks allowing the threat to sink in properly so sword drill and i suggest you put some effort into it this time watching the th going through their paces again frontinius noticed marcus nod to qadir motioning for the practice to continue before taking antenoch and morban to one side he nudged the prefects arm pointing at the three figures as they limbered up for sparring the centurion seems to have decided to work off his frustrations with a little swordplay watch carefully hes quicker than greased weasel shit once he gets going the two soldiers each took up a wooden practice sword buckled their helmets tightly and raised their shields ready to fight marcus who as the prefect was intrigued to note was wielding a second wooden sword instead of a shield waited in almost perfect immobility while the two men approached him from either side with slow careful steps clearly intending to attack their officer in a pincer movement in the hope of overwhelming him they paused in their advances for a moment exchanged glances and then in a sudden flurry of movement both men struck antenoch stabbing his sword at his officers chest while morban swung his weapon in a vicious arc at his head marcus parried the first attack while ducking under the second and shouldercharging his standardbearers shield the impact making the older man stagger back off balance and fall back on to the ground with one assailant momentarily out of the fight marcus turned on antenoch with a speed and purpose that immediately put the clerk on the defensive hammering a blow into the edge of his clerks raised shield with his lefthand weapon as antenoch compensated by pushing the shield round to his right the young centurion feinted left then darted right leaping into the air to jab his blade around the shields edge and into the soft flesh of his neck pulling the blow to avoid breaking the skin but still inflicting a painful scratch he spun away from the cursing soldier avoiding a wild swing from morban by a hands span as the standardbearer charged back into the fight the older man went for him with furious purpose hacking wildly in the hope of overwhelming his defence but marcus simply stepped back out of range of a shield punch parrying the blows until the shortlived power of the standardbearers attack had burned out as the pace of his attacks slowed the centurion took the attack back to him disarming the sweating soldier with a deft slap to the wrist of his sword arm with the flat of his blade which left the sword hanging uselessly from the standardbearers numb fingers morban stepped back and dropped the useless weapon shaking his head to stop the fight first spear frontinius raised a questioning eyebrow at his prefect i told you he was good didnt i scaurus nodded his agreement with his first spear his eyes narrowed as he watched the young officer talking his men through the fight pointing out the points at which he had ridden his advantage to beat them both while i find myself forced to agree with you first spear id still like to see him fight a real swordsman no disrespect intended youve built a fine cohort here but your men are like most other soldiers drilled to fight and kill from behind a line of shields and not to duel like that ill fight him first spear frontinius turned with surprise his eyebrows raised as he looked from the prefect to his bodyguard who had previously been as silent as always in his place at the senior officers back did he just say what i thought he said scaurus nodded his lips pursed in a slight smile he doesnt say very much but when he does its invariably interesting you want to spar with that officer the german nodded and scaurus turned back to frontinius with your permission first spear i think your man would find arminius here a worthy enough test of his mettle shall we pair them up and see what happens frontinius shrugged this should be interesting centurion corvus the german strode out on to the parade ground tossing aside his cloak and tunic to reveal a torso slabbed with muscle his chest scarred in several places and at the point where his arm and shoulder met dimpled with the telltale pucker of an old arrow wound he took a practice sword from antenoch but disdained the proffered shield reaching instead for morbans blade the standardbearer gave up the weapon with raised eyebrows walking around the towering bodyguard and muttering into antenochs ear he fights dimachaeri style too eh fancy the odds the clerk pursed his lips look at the bloody size of him and the state of his body thats a fighter if ever i saw one ill have five denarii on him the two men squared up their practice swords almost touching the german kept his eyes locked on marcuss and hefted the wooden weapons to take their balance his grating voice loud in the parade grounds sudden hush as the sweating soldiers craned their necks to see what was happening ready marcus nodded and the bodyguard went for him with a speed and grace that belied his size forcing the young centurion backwards with a swift succession of attacking blows with both swords which looked for a moment likely to end in the romans painful defeat adjusting quickly to the other mans allout style and taking a perverse enjoyment in having his skills tested properly for the first time in months marcus began to match him blow for blow stabbing parrying and hacking with a fluidity and skill close to matching the best the watching men had seen him muster with his blood up on the field of battle he took the fight back to the german with singleminded intensity pushing the bigger man back half a dozen steps with the ferocity of his counterattack the two men fought to and fro all four of their swords ceaselessly hunting for an opening in the others defence while continuously fending off the others attacks stepping in close his swords flung wide to deflect the romans blades the german shaped to deliver a powerful headbutt to his opponent but marcus trained from his youth by men experienced in the dirtier side of combat in romes savage arena fighting saw the move coming and spun away hooking the other mans leg with a swinging kick and putting him on his back the german simply rolled backwards out of the fall regained his feet with a broad grin and charged back in with both swords putting marcus back on the defensive once more the fight became steadily more physical as both men sought to take an advantage that their mutual swordsmanship denied them both punching marcus with a fierce blow from his muscular forearm sending the younger man staggering back with stars flashing in his vision arminius shaped for the kill only to grimace with pain as the roman thoroughly enraged at the blows force danced back in and put a hobnailed boot into his knee the two men separated for a moment and circled each other each of them eyeing the other with a new wariness searching the others face for any sign of weakness first spear and prefect shared a glance and nodded to each other enough the prefects shouted command hung in the air for a moment neither man acknowledging the order until with distinct reluctance the german dropped first one and then the other of the practice swords he held out a hand to marcus who dropped his own swords and took the offered clasp wincing with the force of the germans grip the previously blankfaced bodyguard was smiling slightly you fight well as well as anyone ive crossed swords with ill fight with you again marcus nodded that was the best bout ive had since i left home youll have to teach me a few of those moves the bodyguard nodded leaning in close to whisper in his ear i was taught by a master swordsman when the time is right i will share what i have learned with you prefect scaurus and the first spear took their leave of the cohort once the soldiers had settled down to the evening meal frontinius left julius in command scowling darkly at the ground around their earthbanked defences well move to full campaign routine centurion double patrols and nobody allowed out of the camp without your express permission the watchword is lost the response is eagle well be back in a couple of hours if this commanders conference goes to form so make sure theres something warm left over for us when the rest of you have finished filling your faces inside the fortresss stone wall blackened by smoke from its buildings destruction by burning in the face of the warbands advance months before the two men followed directions from the gate guard to find the headquarters the prefect smiled wryly at the size of the new building typical legion thinking if the eagles going to live anywhere for a while it has to be housed in a building big enough for a cohort to bunk down in inside the building they found two dozen or so senior officers waiting around in quiet conversation frontinius spoke quietly in his prefects ear no sign of the second cohort looks like well be hanging on to the hamians for a while yet oh here we go from a side room a trio of men entered the praetorium their polished breastplates shining in the torchlight the oldest of them a thin man with a grey beard nodded briefly to scaurus while the th legions legatus acknowledged his old friend and former first spear with a swift handshake giving his successor a brief but openly curious stare they walked briskly to the raised briefing podium adorned with the th legions bull emblem and turned to face the collected officers frontinius whispered in his prefects ear i hear he eats bread shipped all the way from rome and that by the time it gets here its so stale that he cant get much of it down him at a sitting because it cuts his gums up so badly scaurus smiled faintly muttering out of the side of his mouth thats how he stays so thin he also writes out a dozen or so orders every night before he goes to sleep and has the officer of the guard send them out to his legates and prefects at intervals through the night to foster the illusion that he never sleeps the governor addressed the gathered officers in a clear calm voice gentlemen let me introduce myself i am ulpius marcellus former governor of britannia now returned at the command of my emperor to put this wretched province straight again for those of you that dont know them these men are my legion commanders legatus equitius commanding sixth victorious and legatus macrinus commanding twentieth valiant and victorious ive sent legatus metellus back south with six cohorts of the second augustan to keep order on the western border while the rest of his cohorts have been divided between the sixth and the twentieth that gives us a pair of overstrength legions and a total force of fifteen thousand legionaries add in your auxiliaries and we comfortably outnumber the strength that our spies tell us we can expect calgus to put into the field he paused sweeping a piercing stare across the gathered officers my predecessor seems to have spent altogether too much time in leisure and nowhere near enough up here keeping tabs on the barbarians as a result of which we find ourselves here today while he finds himself ordered back to rome he paused again looking around his assembled officers where gentlemen he will find himself in a distinctly unhappy position as might we all if we fail to put down this revolt quickly and without further serious loss this isnt an emperor to take failure easily gentlemen not when praetorian prefect perennis who as some of you will know is the man standing behind the throne discovers that his son was a casualty of the opening battle of the war failure is therefore not an acceptable option for any of us these next few weeks before the winter starts to close in are going to be hard and dirty for all concerned and by the end of this campaigning season im firmly expecting that well have this man calguss head either on the end of a chain or in a jar headed for rome by fast courier either will do the only question that needs answering right now is how were going to achieve that he paused again turning to his staff officer map the map was unrolled and spread across the table in front of the senior officers marcellus looked around the group gathered at the table all told we have some twentytwo thousand spears to put into the field our intelligence including information from some sources rather closer to calgus than he could ever suspect tells us that he has no more than fifteen thousand men at best so once we get them to commit to a straight fight itll be over quickly enough however and this is going to be the moot point of this campaign any engagement with these barbarians must must take place on favourable ground the officers round the table nodded solemnly the battle of lost eagle and its grisly aftermath for both sides were still a raw memory for them all we want calgus to bring his fifteen thousand out on to open ground give us time to get our twenty thousand into line and then mince his men up in the usual style he on the other hand being a clever brute wants us to advance eagerly on to ground of his choosing forest broken ground anywhere that our tactics dont work half as well and then set his dogs loose on us from several directions were going to be gathering round this table every night of the campaign gentlemen and im going to be expecting you to bring me every idea under the sun to make calgus ignore his instincts and come out to meet us before the winter sets in especially as he gets near the limits of his supplies i have no intention of reporting back to the emperor that weve had to settle in for the winter without a victory preferably one that ends this squalid little war here and now so youd all better get thinking he pointed to the map indicating noisy valleys position two miles south of the junction of the north road and the military road so now were ready to strike north up the main road and into the mountains to the northeast such as they are we suspect that calgus has his warband camped somewhere around here on the southern slopes of the range hidden deep in the forests our first task is to find his warband so therell be a broad screen of cavalry out in front of the main force probing forward seeking contact once weve got them located the next trick will be to either draw them out into the open or if we cant manage that feat fix them for long enough that sixth and twentieth legions can bring their strength to bear on their defences in a classic siege while were doing that well patrol aggressively to either flank just to make sure the locals keep their heads down and let us get on with it unmolested that ought to give the auxiliary cohorts something to keep them out of mischief the next day dawned brightly and calgus mustered the tribal leaders once the morning meal had been taken the command had gone out for every man to be ready to march with his war gear and a days food and there was a palpable tension in the air as the gathered chieftains watched him stalk into their midst his bodyguards looking about them with poorly disguised anxiety at the hostile faces around them calgus turned to survey the scene taking the measure of the men gathered at his command the tribal leaders stood impassively for the most part many of them with sour looks that told him they would rather be elsewhere only the men of his own selgovae tribe had raised a cheer when he entered their circle the other tribes he judged had at last realised that a war fought in what appeared primarily to be his peoples best interests would not necessarily be good for them brothers calgus paused waiting for any reaction from the gathered mass of warriors but none came you have delivered a hammerblow to the men that seek to invade our land subjugate our people and strip us of both our wealth and our dignity we have already defeated one legion in battle and forced the romans to scrape up every spare soldier in the northern half of their empire in order to put their boot back on this provinces throat i know that some of you are saying that we have done little more than pull the tail of a dangerous beast provoking it to strike back at us with all of its power and in truth you are both right and wrong do the romans still have three full legions in britannia yes does the bulk of that strength lurk waiting to strike out and crush us and within two days march of this encampment of course it does he had their attention now he knew it even without staring round at the faces surrounding him ask yourselves however what would happen if we managed to repeat that trick and crush another of their legions in the same way what then when there are no more replacement soldiers to be had he allowed the silence to build looking around him with a broad grin watching realisation starting to dawn on the men around him three legions my brothers thats all they have there will be no further reinforcement from over the sea if we break one more legion they will be unable to replace it not now that every available man in the northern empire is already in this province the roman governor will be faced with a stark choice to defend their wall with only two legions and one of those needed in the south to keep the western tribes under control or to retreat south by a hundred miles and form a new line of defence based on the fortresses of yew grove and fortress deva an indefensible line with a mountain range running straight through the middle and the whole of the brigantes tribe south of their wall suddenly liberated to join the rebellion and to double our strength in fighting men the governor will try to hold on to wait for eventual reinforcement rather than face the disgrace of abandoning a wall built by an emperor and making their defence of britannia impossible and he will be doomed to fail now was the critical moment in his oration his chance to grab the men around him by the balls my brothers if we can just take down one of the legions facing us there will be no more reinforcement for their northern frontier and their general will be forced to make the terrible choice i have described to you and this whole country will fall to us like an apple whose time on the tree has come to its end we will be free to take back the wealth they have stolen from us free to travel wherever we wish without needing their permission free to live the way we choose without their legions forever forcing us to live by their rules he waited for a moment turning to look around his audience every mans eyes were locked on to him and in each face he saw nothing like the apathy of five minutes before nearly so how do we destroy another legion first my brothers we are going to anger the romans by taking our war to them in a way that they will neither predict nor be able to tolerate tonight will be a fat moon by which we will be able to make our way to their wall and cross it undetected nightfall today will see us in position to strike at a border fort to mount a swift and terrible attack that will destroy both fort and garrison and by tomorrow evening we will have returned here in triumph of course their cavalry will outpace the legions in the search for us as we retreat back here they will find our trail and follow it here bringing the legions in their wake but that is exactly what we want them to do when they think they have us trapped that will be the moment for our greater trap to be sprung and this greater trap calgus just what would that consist of the question came from brennus of course powerful allies king brennus powerful enough to smash a legion with the shock of their attack if that legion is stretched to besiege us here as i expect later with his plan of attack reluctantly approved by the gathered tribal nobles calgus sought out martos king brennuss nephew ignoring the hostile looks he was getting from the men around the young noble he strode up to the man stepping close to speak in quiet and measured tones prince martos i would like to speak with you in private for a moment if youll hear me martos checking the edge of his sword with his thumb nodded dourly i will speak with you if that is your wish calgus i may not agree with your methods but i believe that we both want the same thing from these next few days indeed we do mused calgus inwardly as he extended an arm inviting the votadini prince to walk with him but only one of us is going to live to enjoy it the sky clouded over in the early afternoon and a thin drizzle contrived to insinuate itself into any and every place it could possibly reach the tungrians spent the day making sure that they were ready for another lengthy spell in the field sharpening weapons and checking their equipment for any fault that might let them down on the march the th century spent the morning on the exercise field practising with swords and shields every man paired with a veteran soldier from the cohorts other centuries and drilled time and time again in the simple disciplines of attack and defence marcus walked among his allocated forty men with qadir gauging which of them might just be capable of standing in a battle lines front rank by watching the faces of the soldiers set to teach them their murderous trade that one training with the oneeyed soldier front rank the imperturbable chosen man made a mark on his writing tablet and followed marcus down the line when they compared notes with julius dubnus and rufius their combined findings made uncomfortable material for discussion with first spear frontinius when marcus met up with him to discuss the morning sessions results ive got about a dozen men that i can put in the front rank with a clear conscience and another thirty or so with a fighting chance of surviving their first fight after that its a lottery the rest of them are just so much padding frontinius nodded gravely work them harder youve got a day perhaps two soon after midday another cohort arrived at the fort and was directed to establish their camp alongside the tungrians once the soldiers realised the identity of the newcomers they quickly entered into the usual spirit of the two cohorts encounters exchanges of abuse quickly giving way to exchanges of news and gossip scaurus and frontinius waited for the appropriate period of time then made their way into the nd tungrian cohorts camp and presented themselves at the command tent escorted inside they found first spear neuto and prefect furius bent over an equipment list working out what to raid the forts stores for furius turned and recognising scaurus with a heartbeats pause that was imperceptible unless the watcher was looking for it he took the offered hand and shook it vigorously rutilius scaurus i hear youve got the first tungrians and here i am with the second cohort just like old times with the good old twelfth eh here meet my first spear neuto neuto this is my old comrade rutilius scaurus from my days in germania with the twelfth legion scaurus and i were both thinstripe tribunes with the legion when we were sent to root out the german tribes both of us not much better than callow youths with no real idea of soldiering and yet here we both are with independent commands to play with the first spear gave scaurus and frontinius a look that spoke volumes for his relationship with his prefect offering his hand to scaurus before clasping frontiniuss and slapping him on the shoulder with his other hand the two men were clearly glad to see each other and at neutos suggestion they headed off to the forts officers mess to share information and work out whether either could help the other with supplies or equipment outside the tent neuto gave frontinius a look that told him even more about prefect furius his voice kept low but with a distinct edge of anger im glad to see you old comrade although i wish it were under happier circumstances lets get a beaker of something warm inside us and ill share my news with you not all of it good with the first spears departure the two prefects stared at each other in a long moment of silence furius spoke first his eyes suddenly hard as he faced his former comrade well gaius rutilius scaurus its been a long time since moesia what have you been up to for the last ten years scaurus shrugged i stayed with the twelfth for three years after you left to return to rome until wed finished off the quadi in fact a year after that i was back to moesia for the war with their neighbours the marcomani this time with the fifth macedonica and now ive been sent here to help put down another barbarian uprising ive spent the occasional few months in rome to remind me why we fight but mostly ive been in the field a warriors life then still dedicated to mithras eh and yet here we both are both of us with an equal status after all those years despite my little slip at thunderbolt gorge dont you find that galling eh scaurus you toil away on the borders of the empire for a decade while i enjoy the comforts of home then in six months i go from enforced retirement to command of a thousandstrong infantry cohort doesnt that rankle just a little scaurus shrugged without any visible sign of concern not really we come from different worlds you and i our families couldnt be much more different if wed tried i do what i do and you well you do whatever it is that you do still fond of the odd crucifixion are you furius nodded slowly im still a firm believer in keeping discipline nice and taut if thats what youre asking while we were out over the wall i managed to find and punish the man that killed this cohorts previous prefect i had him whipped to death from the rumours flying round the camp furiuss voice took on a note of selfjustification he went on the cross as well scaurus shook his head gently you crucified a dead man furius bristled his temperature clearly rising it served as an example scaurus kept a straight face seeing the signs he had long ago learned to recognise in the other mans reddening features im sure it did frontinius took a cautious sip at his broth pursing his lips at the taste and putting the steaming beaker down as he passed judgement on his new prefect for neutos benefit so at first i thought he was just another weakchinned amateur like most of the idiots we get as prefects but all in all id say hes probably going to be good enough given his experience not that hes been very forthcoming about exactly what hes done in the last ten years but he seems to have seen enough action to have knocked the corners off him even if he wont talk about it what about yours the two first spears had found a quiet corner in the officers mess and were sitting over their broth waiting for it to cool slightly the hot soups steam rose into the rooms chilly air as the steward laboured to get the fire properly lit frontinius had quickly recognised that his old friend needed to share his recent experiences with someone that he could trust having asked the question he kept his mouth firmly shut in the hope of encouraging the nd cohorts senior centurion to tell his story neuto grimaced shaking his head as he spoke at first i thought furius might be a decent replacement for prefect bassus hes not short of money thats clear hes got a jar full of naphtha that he uses to light his brazier just a small splash and the wood goes up like a grain store with the first spark from the flint and that must have cost him a small fortune he seemed to know what he was talking about too he told a good story about his time in moesia fighting some tribe or other and he was brisk and businesslike in just about everything he did here i thought is a man that i might be able to do business with perhaps not quite such a find as your last prefect now there was an officer but decent enough nevertheless he sipped at his broth it took me about three days to get over that sadly mistaken first impression first of all he paraded the cohort at red river and told them what a shower of bastards they were for killing bassus and how he was going to make them pay for it three months pay forfeit for the entire cohort reduced to one month if he got his man before dark the same day frontinius grimaced in turn but he got his man right theres simply no way a full cohort is going to stand for losing that much money to protect one man id say his tactics were spot on neuto shrugged unwilling to cede the point his friend was making yes he got his man but then you cant really argue too hard against his methods can you after all whoever it was did kill a prefect lets not forget that anybody i know neuto shook his head dismissively no just some idiot soldier a typical woodenskulled headcase who acted on impulse and stuck his iron through prefect bassuss back simply because he didnt like the man to make it worse he was the older brother of one of my centurions something i was supposed not to know and of course something i actually knew from about an hour after the younger brother joined up our new prefect had him crucified frontinius blew on his broth and took a mouthful we heard the cavalry lads were full of it when they pulled in last night a little severe for all that he killed an officer i hear the man died on the whipping post neuto nodded a small smile touching his lips yes prefect furius made the mistake of ordering him to receive fifty lashes fifty exactly hed probably have died even if my officers hadnt contrived to open the poor bastards throat with the scourge after id had a few quiet words in the right ears but i wasnt taking any chances then the idiot had him nailed up anyway frontinius grimaced again i still couldnt argue that hes unfit for command so what if hes a little free with the hammer and nails the man had it coming to him right neuto sat back looking at his friend i can live with the carpentry fixation just about but hes just not very good we were sent out to look for the bluenoses a roving commission for a new prefect and the perfect chance for him to get used to his new command right i advised him to use the cavalry to screen our movements and seek out any signs of the warband and neutos face wrinkled with disgust he didnt allow them out of sight for the entire time we were out there the man was in perpetual fear of bumping into a fight and he said he wanted all his spears close to hand in case of a pitched battle i tried to get across to him that four hundred horsemen werent going to put any sizeable hole in a decent warband and wed be better finding them without being found ourselves and then steering well clear but he wasnt having any of it no we just blundered round the hills without a bloody clue and for all i know the only thing that stopped the bluenosed bastards from hacking us to bits was either simple dumb luck in that we missed them or else they were too busy laughing at us and hes hardly walked a mile since he arrived rides a horse alongside the cohort on the march like hes a legion tribune he drained the beaker and slapped it down on the table with a calculating glance at frontinius ill tell you what else hes absolutely fixated with some fugitive thats evaded the imperial strangler hes always on about it how hell pay a big reward to the man that finds him how much prestige hell get if hes the man to bring the fellow to justice i ask you how likely is it that some runaway aristo is going to be hiding up here with us in the middle of twenty thousand roman troops eh he looked across the table at frontinius his eyes suddenly narrowed not even you could be that stupid and you did some monumentally daft things when we were young recruits as i recall eh sextus frontiniuss face froze into immobility how long have you known neuto shook his head disbelievingly jupiters tits i prayed i was wrong that bright young lad with the two swords the same hes the one that found the supplies waiting for calguss western attack and burned them out back in the spring remember that if not for him wed have had ten thousand of the bastards at our backs as well as the warband to our front the boys good neuto and i cant just abandon him now that hes made a place with the cohort how did you work it out his friend shook his head taking another sip of his broth i didnt my least favourite centurion seems to have worked it out after meeting your man at arab town these things have a habit of finding their way back to a man who keeps his ear to the ground as well you know does your prefect no on second thoughts im better not knowing cocidiuss sword and fucking spear sextus how long do you think you can keep this quiet now that were tucked up close with half the bloody army the next thing youll know is furius will be calling for the carpenters again except this time itll be you tied up ready for the scourge frontinius frowned ive got an idea to get him out of the fort tonight and tomorrow thats fine for today and tomorrow but were going to be in the field for weeks mark my words furius is offering a bag of gold to the man that unearths him and rumour has it that one of my centurions is on the scent knowing the man in question hell be all over your cohort trying to get some proof and if that bastard furius gets a sniff of your boy hell be dog meat inside a day as will you he sat back shaking his head at his old friend frontinius nodded grimly and thats my problem and not one for you to get dragged into although id appreciate any warning you can give me i guess its for the best that we never had this conversation neuto nodded grimly agreed now lets talk about the reinforcement century prefect furius seems to have procured out of the arab town docks for me no fucking way those men are mine and im keeping them if the mood in furiuss tent had darkened with the departure of the first spears it had turned distinctly ugly once scaurus had raised the subject of the stolen century he held a level gaze on furius watching his eyes intently you knew very well that those troops were earmarked for my cohort didnt you gracilus furius were still significantly under strength and yet you bribed them out from under our noses without a second thought and now you tell me that youre going to hold on to them no matter what furius leaned back in his chair a faint sneer playing across his face thats right and theres not much you can do to get them back ive got a requisition document signed off by the replacements officer all nicely legal and the century in question is already distributed into my cohort so unless youve got some shiny new sponsor that i dont know about you havent even got the clout to take this up the ladder you do know how i got this command even after thunderbolt gorge and the best part of ten years of enjoying the pleasures of home dont you it was simple i just asked my father to get me back into uniform if you thought he was well connected ten years ago well you should see him now he may be a wrinkled old bastard but hes got more money than he knows what to do with if hed wanted to become a senator he only had to ask hes got ten times the money required for the favour and he knows where to spend it that breadnibbling beanpole ulpius marcellus is a friend of the family and i can tell you what his reaction will be if you take the problem to him hell just laugh in your face senior officers like their commanders to show some initiative or hadnt you heard they find this sort of squabble amusing to watch but irritating to deal with so youve got as much chance of getting that century back as you have of being promoted to legatus you pipsqueak apart from that you also got two centuries in the place of one id say everyone should be happy he smiled tightly but the smile turned to a thinlipped glare as scaurus stared at him for a moment longer before speaking again his direct gaze making the other man uneasy this wasnt the sort of behaviour furius remembered from their last spell as colleagues if youre determined to do this then so be it just dont be surprised if you end up regretting it i believe youve regretted one or two things youve done recently if the words ive heard are true regret it why am i going to scaurus got to his feet ignoring the other mans spluttering thank you gracilus furius for your hospitality and for the conversation he turned to go furius caught his arm his sense of superiority picked to threads by something for which he had no real concept a moment rutilius scaurus i asked you a question and you havent answered me yet your sponsor who is your sponsor these days scaurus turned back easily taking the other mans hand from his sleeve youre right i didnt answer you did i he turned away and walked out into the drizzle leaving furius with a bemused almost worried look as he watched his colleague walk away into the cold autumn afternoon he stared about him until his gaze alighted on one of the soldiers standing guard you take a message to centurion appius tell him to report to me immediately first spear frontinius hurried back to the cohort once his discussion with neuto was done and spent a few minutes talking urgently to scaurus before going to look for the th century he found them marching wearily back on to the exercise field in readiness for another long session with their swords and called marcus and dubnus to him with an urgent wave a change of plan centurion corvus we need to get you out of camp one of the second cohort centurions you met at arab town last week seems to have worked out who centurion corvus really is and i dont want you around when he comes looking for proof the prefect of the second cohort is looking for you and it wont take very much more deduction on his part to put us all in deeper water than we can swim in get your men some bread to eat and then take them out for some night familiarisation you can take the fifth century with you theyre good at night work and the prefect has asked me to send his man arminius out with you as well apparently he grew up in the german forests so he should be a handy man to have along for the night this way we can show our hamian brothers what its like to patrol in the open countryside after dark and as a side benefit i expect youll be able to work out who among them is suitable to send out on listening patrols in future just get them out of the main gate as quickly as possible without making it look like youre in a hurry the two centurions led their men north from the fort without fanfare with the archers dressed in their heavy woollen cloaks to provide as much anonymity as possible striking out from the north road into open country as soon as they were out of sight of the walls they conferred for a moment and then dubnus went forward with a pair of tent parties to scout the ground in front of their line of march the th century men took turns to trot forward and then go to ground searching their surroundings intently for any sign of the enemy the remainder of the two centuries marched forward at a gentle pace behind the scouts and marcus was pleased to see that the hamians were coping with the terrain well enough even if many of them were still clearly footsore the prefects bodyguard strode forward in silence always staying within a few feet of him and marcus quickly realised that his presence was more to do with his protection than any benefit the german might gain from the exercise less than ten minutes after their departure centurion appius strolled into the st cohorts lines promptly challenged by the guard sentries and having asked to speak to one of the centurions he had met in arab town the previous week he found himself staring into the barrel chest of an officer he had not previously met titus stared down at him with an unreadable expression for a moment before speaking his voice a growling rumble youre looking for one of my brother officers appius nodded suddenly conscious of the fact that even less than fifty paces from his own men he was very much on another cohorts turf i met some of your mates last week on the coast i just thought id come and say hello to them again he stopped speaking aware that the giant standing in front of him was looking decidedly uninterested theyre out on detached duty come back another time bring a century of tungrian infantry with you if youre hoping for any sort of welcome the big man turned away leaving appius standing alone in front of two unfriendlylooking sentries he turned away inwardly cursing his luck furius had made it very clear that he expected quick results from him given his certainty as to the young roman centurions real identity the hamians and their escorts made steady progress across the open land to the forts northeast skirting round isolated copses and crossing the open farmland in a long column under a cloudless sky their cloaks long since removed in the warm afternoon air as the sun dipped towards the horizon the centurions called a halt bringing their men together in the cover of a large copse of oak trees marcus gathered them all in close so as to be heard without having to shout well be staying out overnight so you can eat half your bread now if you want to but keep the other half for the morning what were going to do now is advance across the ground in front of us as quietly as possible taking as much time as we need to make sure we do it silently were going to try to get within a hundred paces or so of one of the wall forts without being detected as an incentive for you all if we do manage to get in and out without being noticed youll all get an afternoons free time when we get back into camp and i would imagine that those of you with bows would be welcome to join the hamian cohort at shooting practice to find out if you still know how to use them eat your bread and take a rest well be on the move again once the suns below the horizon the soldiers waited patiently some of the men passing the time with quiet games of odd or even while others simply talked softly among themselves the older and more experienced soldiers rolled themselves up in their cloaks and slept dubnus among their number once he knew that marcus had no intention of resting arminius lounged on the grass underneath a massive gnarled oak close to marcus and qadir and listened in silence to their conversation until a lengthy pause developed both men turned to him in surprise as the previously taciturn german addressed the hamian chosen man you seem very much out of place here chosen man you and your men might i ask how you came to this province qadir shrugged in the early evenings halflight there is very little to tell you but i will share what there is we were recruited from our home in the city of hamath which means fortress in my native tongue by the occupying troops of the third gallica legion for some of us it was a choice between desperate hardship or imperial service for others it was a simple desire to see the world beyond our limited experience the german nodded knowingly and for you the big hamian stared at him for a moment before answering i committed a crime that would have seen me dead within a day had i waited for what passes for justice in hamath to catch up with me i knew that once i was sworn to service i would be beyond the reach of my pursuers he stared at the ground for a halfminute before continuing both marcus and arminius respecting his reverie anyway i am sure you both know that my people have a certain ability with the bow and for as long as we have been subject to other nations we have provided their armies with archers many of us were already blessed with more than acceptable skill with the weapon but our roman instructors drilled us in one task and one task only to hit a mansized target at a distance of one hundred paces time after time we would shoot hundreds of arrows a day and do so day after day until we could all put an arrow into a man at a distance of one hundred paces no matter whether it was the first or the one hundred and first shot of the day we developed the strength in our shoulders punishing our muscles until they were strong enough to bend our bows hundreds of times a day and our backs and bellies became hard with ridges of muscles where soft flesh had been before finally when we were deemed ready to serve the empire we were marched north through a succession of countries destined to serve on the frontier in germania in a war with a vicious barbarian enemy or so we were told but by the time we arrived on the northern frontier the fighting with your people was already at an end and we were put into service in hunting game to supplement the standard rations rather than killing other men he paused again a halfsmile on his face germania was very different of course with thick green forests and wide rivers and quite unlike our home but we came to relish the hunting in those happy days when we were allowed to roam more or less as we wished in search of wild pigs and deer for the pot it came to an end of course it was only ever an interlude in our path to this place how could such a perfect existence last when there is always a war somewhere on the edge of the empire that needs to be fed with mens lives and so we moved north again passed along the frontier from one fortress to another until we found ourselves on the shores of the german sea and ordered to take ship for the province of britannia as reinforcements which is the reason why we came to be sitting in the barracks of a port called arab town when the centurion here came looking for infantry soldiers since when our very lives have been turned upside down we are to become infantry or to die in the attempt as seems more likely to me arminius nodded his thanks for the tale quite unabashed at the hamians fatalistic view of his mens future you are more fortunate than you know chosen man qadir in that you have already avoided one long and brutal war the peoples that lived north of the river danubius my people the quadi among them were strong and proud of their prowess with the sword and axe strong enough to have put our roman masters on their back foot for more than a year when the war began we crossed the river in strength ten summers past and defeated the roman army that stood between us and their settlements in the shadow of the alpes mountains the romans sent another army to put down our revolt once we had their main fortress besieged but we defeated them in their turn and took the fortress once the relief force was beaten for a time we believed that we were invincible but we had little enough time to enjoy the feeling for the following year a mighty army drawn from legions across the whole of europa forced us to retreat back into our own lands and imposed a truce upon us that gave them time to gather yet more strength in readiness to cross the river in their turn soon enough the romans brought the war to our lands hunting the tribes down one by one and taking bloody retribution for their earlier losses he paused taking a drink from his water skin when they broke their truce and attacked into our tribal lands claiming that we were giving aid to our neighbours the marcomanni in their fight for survival we knew that we would have to fight them to the death either theirs or ours and that no quarter would be asked or given by either side and so it was on a blindingly hot day at the height of the summer that we lured the twelfth legion the thunderbolt as they termed themselves on to perfect ground and sprang a trap that bottled them up in a rocky defile we had them helpless trapped under the full heat of the sun and without water oh yes you smile now thinking the lack of water a trivial thing but they were desperate for it even before the sun was at its full height and they had been marching most of the morning without reaching the stream around which we had based our trap we charged into their line three times and with each attack we killed and wounded more of their soldiers and sapped the strength of those men left on their feet after the third charge our leaders shouted that victory was inevitable and that we would wait for the romans to surrender once they succumbed to their thirst our warriors paraded up and down their line within a dozen paces drinking water carried from the stream pouring it over their heads to rub in their lack of anything to drink as we waited for them to surrender however something strange started to happen in the sky over our heads clouds gathered boiling up into huge thunderheads and darkening from white to a sullen grey in what seemed only a few minutes rather than release the rain that their appearance promised they continued to grow and darken turning an unnatural colour bluegreen like a huge bruise on the heavens it seemed as if the sun had fallen below the horizon and so much light was blocked out that we could barely see the romans as they stood and waited for our next attack then without those warning rumbles a storm usually gives out a mighty thunderbolt speared down from the clouds to shatter a tree not fifty paces from our line instantly sending it up in a pillar of flame the roar of thunder that accompanied it was instant without any pause at all and it battered at our ears so powerfully that some men were deafened by the noise my own hearing was certainly affected as if my head were wrapped in heavy wool he paused smiling wryly at marcus now i am not you must understand a man given to what you romans call superstition but even i i will admit was taken aback by this sudden sign from the skies my comrades were for the most part terrified out of their wits and the romans could not have failed to see our previously solid line disintegrate into chaos even if they still lacked the energy to attack us moments later though while our warriors were still quailing at the flaming tree so close to our shields and what it might mean a rainstorm smashed down from the clouds gathered overhead the rain lashed down so hard that it stung our skin and the downpour was so fierce that trickles of water became busy streams in minutes of course where we saw a dark omen the romans whose shields bore the thunderbolt their legions name boasted saw quite the opposite once they had collected enough of the falling rain to slake their thirsts they came at us like ghosts out of the storm their faces painted with mud like the barbarians they called us we saw their shields every one emblazoned with the lightning bolt loom out of the storms murk and that was enough for most of us he shook his head sadly his eyes misting over with the memory we were broken men before ever the fight started they put us to the sword showing no mercy until we broke and ran for the hills i ran with the rest of course not to do so would have meant dying without ever getting a chance to fight back such was the panic around me but when i got the chance i hid myself and waited for the romans to pass i meant to attack them without warning and die with some pride unlike my comrades who were falling to their swords and spears without even turning to fight it was a lost hope of course the second i leapt from cover i had half a dozen soldiers in my face and i went down to a bash on the head from a man i never saw that would have been it except a young tribune stopped them from killing me and claimed me as a slave a tribune as you may have guessed by the name of scaurus he gave me a strange choice but a clever one either to serve him as a bodyguard and earn my freedom by saving his life and thus repaying my debt to him or go back to my people in shame my life forfeit and forbidden to fight again for fear of the retribution of his god he told me that when he realised that the legions men were trapped with many soldiers and even officers terrified for their lives and knowing that they would all die without some divine intervention he offered a prayer to mithras he told me that he offered to bring another man to his service for every remaining year of his life if the god would show his hand and provide some chance for the romans to regain their natural ascendancy over us it seemed to him that the words were barely out of his mouth when the clouds started to gather i chose to serve him of course and so joining his service to mithras was only right marcus nodded his understanding and in return youre training him to fight the way that you do the german gave him a strange look then nodded yes and hes a quick student and you centurion will you share your story with us marcus looked across the clearing at dubnus asleep in his cloak on the grass i cannot tell you much or you will both be in as great a danger as my friend there i will tell you that i hope for little more than you have both achieved to find some measure of peace after the events that have conspired to bring me here i crave the ability to turn my mind to the future rather than brooding on the past and dreaming of revenge qadir nodded his head looking squarely into his centurions eyes that is a wise desire centurion corvus the lust for revenge can take over a mans life and come to master him until it drives him to the exclusion of all other cares but i can counsel you from my own experience that it bears little fruit other than bitterness and destruction when i took a mans life as recompense for my personal loss i found little in the act to compensate me for the price i was to pay for that moment of bloodlust once the sky above them was darkening to purple marcus roused his men many of whom had taken the chance to get some sleep before the long night before them and set them to making their silent approach to the walls defenders after a few minutes progress across the open hillside he realised with a start that he could hear almost nothing from the troops behind him intrigued he peeled away from the line of march and squatted in the grass watching and listening as the soldiers moved slowly past him after a moments contemplation of his men he realised with an even greater surprise that the men making the more audible noise as they progressed up the hill were not the hamians but the th century men who were supposed to be their teachers in the art of night patrolling he got back to his feet when the columns rear passed him dropping in alongside qadir and speaking quietly in his ear your men seem to have the measure of this chosen the other man smiled at him through the evenings gloom no need to be quite so surprised centurion i told you that we are hunters by training and that we spent much time hunting in the forests of germania these men all know what it means for their stealth to be the difference between eating and going hungry and now i suggest that you make a little noise and return to your place at the head of the column these men wont stop advancing until you tell them to by the time the sun had set and the moon had risen to take its place over the empty countryside the main barbarian strength was already south of the rampart the warband had crossed the frontier undetected through an abandoned mile fort between the rock and white strength flowing unhindered out into the open ground behind the wall scouts led the warband to within a mile of white strength with calgus and his bodyguard following close behind apparently undetected the barbarians deployed quietly into and through the silent pine forest that ran to within two hundred paces of the forts southern gate silently closing the noose on the man garrison without betraying their presence so close to their enemys main line of defence calgus squatted down on his haunches at the forests edge and the main tribal leaders gathered around him their differences forgotten in the wake of his speech that morning once the mornings gathering had broken up and the leaders had gone to prepare their men for the march calguss adviser aed had given him a curious sideways glance so my lord do you really believe that if we destroy one legion the romans will inevitably lose their grip on this entire province calgus had laughed softly keeping his voice low enough to prevent his bodyguard from overhearing those fools needed something to fight for so i gave it to them the theorys sound enough though if we could destroy a legion or hit them both hard enough to send them running south licking their wounds then wed give their governor a choice to make that he cant get right no matter whether he chooses to retreat to the south or hold the line of their wall and to make that happen i need warriors with fire in their hearts not just a collection of men yearning for home now he watched the roman fort with a careful eye seeing the torch flames fluttering in the breeze blowing across its high stone walls eight hundred men just there for the taking id say ten thousand of us ought to be able to knock one little fort over without very much trouble what matters most is how we use the garrison once theyre defeated he turned to the tribal leaders clustered around him looking for one man in particular martos your uncle and i have disagreed as to the right way to finish this war but you and i have the chance to put our people in such a position of strength that no roman general will have the ability to defeat us will you put the votadini tribes warriors alongside our own in this battle the votadini prince nodded decisively i will calgus my people will fight the romans to the limit of our abilities tell me what you need from me calgus clapped him on the shoulder i need your men to help smash our way into the fort of course but i also have in mind a means of getting the romans to come after us with a rage upon them that will lead them blindly into the trap i am building for them it will be dirty work but if you can make the picture i have in my mind become a reality then nothing will restrain them from their need for revenge or the consequences of such blind fury the honour of provoking these usurpers to make their greatest mistake will be yours the first indication marcus had that his men were not the only force abroad in the darkened forest was the suddenness with which the hamian walking alongside him froze into immobility putting a hand across his centurions chest and hissing a soft warning the men behind them went to ground without needing to be told and for a second he was left marvelling at their discipline until the man alongside him ruined his feeling of wellbeing in an instant with a quiet whisper in his ear other men in forest not roman hear speaking dubnus appeared at his other shoulder sufficiently alert not to speak the hamian reached across and nudged him pointing out into the darkness and then waggling two fingers in front of him to indicate moving men miming a man talking by opening and closing his fingers close to his mouth dubnus whispered a quiet question how many the hamian pulled a face to show he was guessing then pointed back up the column before raising ten fingers closing his hands and then opening them again marcus and dubnus exchanged glances the latter whispering again with an edge of incredulity thousands of them marcus nodded putting a cupped hand to his ear to indicate that they should listen the sounds were quiet muted to the edge of inaudibility by the forests foliage but they were unmistakable an army was crossing the forest in front of them the sounds of snapping twigs and guttural voices reaching them through the trees the two friends exchanged glances again and then marcus turned back to the hamian alongside them bending to whisper in his ear fetch qadir quick and quiet the man nodded and was gone ghosting away back down the column without a sound dubnus leaned close and spoke quietly in his ear they must be moving to attack white strength qadir appeared beside them a moment later his face still imperturbable in the moons faint illumination marcus beckoned his head close before whispering to him your men seem to have the edge when it comes to silent movement in the dark do any of them have what it takes to kill in the dark do we have any thieves or murderers i need a few men that wont be afraid to put a knife in a barbarians back and wont waste any time staring at the corpse well qadir pondered for a moment and then whispered an order to the man next to him who vanished off into the darkness i have sent him to find two men who are of the background you desire they have reformed saved by the discipline demanded by their bows that and the worship of their goddess and both have renounced their former crimes as have i marcus grinned wolfishly his teeth a pale white in the shadows then lets hope i can persuade the three of you to revive your former selves for a short while dubnus youd best gather a few of your best men and you he turned and spoke to arminius who was waiting in silence three paces behind him youd better come too were going hunting only minutes later just as the guard mounted at all corners of white strength was changing the sentries posted to watch out over the wall to the north reported lights on the horizon in increasing numbers the cohorts prefect ran to the watchtower and took the stairs two at a time the units first spear close at his heels they pushed aside the gaggle of soldiers watching the distant flickering dots of light and took stock of what little they could make out in the darkness shit the prefect turned to his senior centurion its a warband all right theres nothing of ours that large that would be running around by torchlight in the dark moon or no moon the decision is ours we either abandon the fort and head for noisy valley or stay here behind our walls and make a fight of it the centurion a leathery twentyfiveyear veteran with less than a month to his discharge under normal circumstances spat expressively over the towers parapet i say we stand and fight ive already supervised the reconstruction of this bloody fort once this year and ill be damned if i want to have to do it all over again besides that lot might just be a diversion to persuade us to run for it for all we know theres thousands more of the bastards already south of the wall and waiting for us between here and the legions at the valley the prefect grimaced at the thought of his command caught on an open hillside in the dark by a warband of barbarian warriors raving for their heads i agree you get the cohort stood to and ill write a dispatch for the governor with a bit of luck we can keep the buggers tied up for long enough to let him manoeuvre two legions into position for the kill you never know this could be the action that finishes the war the tungrian hunting party went forward in total silence and again marcus was struck by the way that qadir and his hamians seemed to ghost through the darkness with an almost total lack of sound within a dozen careful paces they had taken the lead padding softly through the darkened forest ahead of the tungrians with delicate care for twigs or branches underfoot their footfalls muffled by the carpet of pine needles somewhere off to their right an owl screeched and the party froze into immobility for a long moment before starting off down the gentle slope again after a few minutes more careful progress the leading man raised his hand to halt them and marcus eased forward to crouch next to him many men close we stay here listen watch any closer we be prisoner marcus nodded signalling to the other men to hold fast to their front the sounds of the warband were ever more apparent as the barbarian raiders gathered their strength to attack dubnus leaned in close to whisper in the mans ear theyre waiting for something seconds later a horses scream of agony rang through the woods answered almost immediately by a roar of triumph from the tribesmen dubnus nudged marcus putting his head close to his friends ear dispatch riders most likely the warband were waiting to capture the message for help those poor bastards are in for it now marcus nodded in response to his friends bald statement stay here im going forward for a look without allowing any time for argument he wormed forward on his stomach crawling fifty paces or so until he reached a fallen tree where the trees roots had been ripped from the soil by its fall a wide plug of dry earth still clinging to their tangles a dark hole had been formed between the trunk and the bowllike depression left in the ground he slithered silently into the gap covering his head with his cloak and looking out at the ground on the other side of the fallen tree the clearing before him was almost empty with a knot of warriors dragging three struggling men across the needlestrewn forest floor as he watched them the barbarians a dozen strong manhandled the trussed romans to their feet and quickly lashed them to trees before cutting away their clothes to leave them naked and shivering in the cool night air with a sick certainty marcus watched as one of their captors unsheathed a knife its polished blade a pale bar of moonlight in his hand and stepped up to one of the captives he thrust the blade deep into the captives thigh without any warning wringing a reluctant snarl of pain from the helpless man before pulling the bloodied knife free and dragging its blade across the mans eyes if the mans first cry had been born of physical distress torn reluctantly from him by the sudden unexpected pain the scream that echoed through the forest as he was blinded was a howl of agonised despair with the dispatch riders away towards the southwest the soldiers manning the forts ramparts waited anxiously the first spear watched impassively as the torches drew closer counting under his breath he stared ruminatively at the flickering lights muttering to himself two hundred or so hardly seems enough for a fullsized warband say theres one torch for every ten of the bastards thats more like a shout from the forts southern wall spun him round staring out into the darkness in the deep shadow of the woods to the forts south where the faint moonlight was unable to provide any illumination a spark of light was bobbing along the line of trees every few seconds a new light would kindle in its wake until the wood was alive with light the first spear hurried down the towers steps into the forts bustle calling the officers to him they gathered to find him grim faced one hand reflexively gripping the hilt of his gladius weve been fooled theres a warband in the woods to the south and it looks like theyre getting ready to storm the gates he issued a crisp stream of orders sending a century to man the forts southfacing wall splitting another to guard those parts of the east and west walls to the south of the point where the forts defences met the walls line and took the calculated risk of leaving only one more to man the forts northern side the prefect stood alongside him as gathering the other three centuries to the southern gates double arch he arrayed the nervous soldiers on all three sides of the forts most vulnerable point the veteran officer shook his head ruefully its quite simple really prefect they showed us the torches to the north to flush us out the man leading that collection of savages out there knew that one of two things had to happen once we saw what looked like movement in strength to the north either the full cohort retreating to the south or our messengers heading for noisy valley either would be an acceptable result for the man commanding that warband since all he ever had to do to bottle us up in this trap was kill our only means of getting a message through to the heavy boys with our messengers almost certainly taken theres no way for the legions to know hes got our nuts between the bricks and without the legions therell be no escape for us hes got the rest of the night to chop a way in through one of the gates most likely this one since the other three are all on the other side of the wall he pointed to the twin south gates their thick timbers reinforced with three heavy oak bracing bars apiece it looks tough enough now but theyll be hacking down a tree out there right now and getting it ready to swing at those doors no gate can take that sort of treatment for long the prefect frowned weighing up their options if their main strength is to the south surely we could still run to the east on the northern side of the wall standing orders specifically instruct all fort commanders not to waste lives defending fixed positions the senior centurion rubbed a hand across his tired face blinking away his fatigue in the darkness and with two or three thousand of them waiting out there to the north id say were better off taking our chances here prefect he turned to the men gathered around the gate raising his voice to make sure they all heard him men leaned out over the ramparts internal wall keen to hear the man who ran their small world speak well now my brothers heres the thing those bluefaced bastards have pulled a nice little trick got men to the south of us as well as the north theyre between us and noisy valley so theyre probably already carving up the messengers we sent that way if you listen carefully youll hear them screaming most likely its what they always do with captives partly to get the piss running down our legs and partly because well thats just what they do he paused for a moment looking around at the soldiers serious faces in the flickering torchlight this only ends one of two ways gentlemen either we hold them off for long enough that the legions at noisy valley can get here and save our arses or those barbarian bumfuckers will manage to bludgeon their way in here which is more than likely and then try to overwhelm us in nasty dirty street fighting they have the advantage of numbers we have discipline and superior equipment and training on our side you all know the drills all you have to do is follow them and we have a decent chance of getting out of the other side of this night with our heads still on our shoulders he pointed up at the walls soldiers on the rampart youll have men with ladders looking to swarm up on to the walls your first priority is to push the ladders clear and dump the bastards into the ditch but watch out theyll have archers behind them shooting at anything that moves any man that gets his feet on to the fighting surface is your numberone target and you take him down with spear sword or your teeth and nails if thats all youve got left he took a breath casting a jaundiced eye over the men standing around him many of them looming over his stocky frame soldiers in the streets once ive finished this little speech youll form a wall of men from one side of the street to the other and on all three sides of the gate this is going to be street fighting my lads so no throwing your spears this time i want ten bluenose dead for every spear not just one front rankers tonight we fight in the oldfashioned style spears held underarm and thrust up into bellies and throats from behind your shields none of that overarm nonsense youll just open yourself up to a sword in your armpit rear rankers if you can reach you can go in overarm but be careful not to stick it through your mates ear it may not endear you to him the soldiers smiled wanly at the tired old joke appreciating his effort under the circumstances if you lose your spear air your iron and take it to them in the usual way short thrusts throat thighs or guts it doesnt matter which open your man up and step back to let him bleed to death nothing fancy and no heroics rear rankers if the man in front of you goes down his place is yours so dont wait to be asked jump in there and fight like youve got a pair because if the line breaks youll be the first one looking down the shaft of a barbarian spear thats scraping your spine he looked around him taking the measure of his men in the moment of silence he distinctly heard a distant wail of agony from the treeline as he had grimly predicted the barbarians were torturing the captured messengers using their screams of pain to send a message back to the forts garrison one more thing you lot look like youll run like frightened children the second that gate gets smashed in its simple enough if we fight well enough to hold them off until dawn then we get to live or at least some of us will if theres anyone here that cant take a joke well its a bit late to wish you hadnt joined so lets give these bluefaced sheepshaggers something to think about you lot sing well enough when theres nothing at stake lets see if you can belt it out when the bluenoses might have your heads off within the hour wholl start us off a man on the wall above responded first his voice ringing out clearly above the rattle of equipment from the street below the centurion took a message to the generals villa where the response from the cohorts men was instantaneous they roared into the song lifting the hair on the first spears neck he was greeted by the great mans wife in face and body fair having given her the tablet he bowed and turned to leave but found the ladys gentle hand had gripped him by the sleeve amazing the senior centurion turned to find the prefect standing behind him he leaned in close shouting into his subordinates ear as the second verse began youve just told them that this is going to be the goatfuck to end all goatfucks and they burst into song at the first opportunity perhaps well get away with this after all the veteran officer nodded leaning over to shout his own response over the cohorts enthusiasm perhaps the song gives them something familiar to hang on to lets just pray theyre still singing that loudly in an hour and lets hope we can find the right god to ask for that small favour marcus hadnt waited to witness any more of the barbarians torture of their prisoners but headed back up the slope as fast as he could without making a noise that might betray him to the tribesmen he looked around at the small group of soldiers his face rigid with rage and his voice a furious whispered growl theyre torturing the message riders we heard them capture there are twelve of the bastards and eight of us if they manage to warn their comrades that were here then well probably all die to the last man both centuries but if we dont do something then those three men are going to die after several hours of that agony whos with me qadir drew his dagger from its sheath holding it up to the moonlight ill come with you well all come dubnus nodded weve got three archers so thats two shots apiece and six men down before they know whats happening and another six for the five of us seems fair enough they crawled down the slope in silence gritting their teeth to ignore the shouted pleas for mercy and screams of pain as the barbarians were clearly warming to their role of making the message riders torture painfully obvious to the men defending the fort when they reached the fallen tree marcus set qadir and his three bowmen along its length and ordered them to keep their heads down until he gave the signal then led the remaining th century men away in a low crawl to the right the scene was now lit by several torches set in the ground around the trees to which the prisoners were tied and the tungrians took special care as they crawled slowly around the clearings edge until they were between the scene of torture and the warband then huddled for a last whispered briefing from marcus when i give the order the hamians will put two arrows into the air apiece if we wait for them to stop shooting well likely be too late to avoid one or more of the survivors making a break into the forest and if that happens well have minutes before there are hundreds of men combing these woods for us so ive got a better idea the barbarians were gathered around the last of the three message riders to have retained his consciousness however much he might have preferred to have slipped into the merciful oblivion that had claimed his colleagues their hands bloody from their torment of the other two men they were competing to see which of them could wring the loudest scream from their helpless prisoner and were watching one of their number as he probed inexpertly at the root of the mans penis with his knife when a call from behind alerted them to the presence of newcomers who the fuck are you the tallest of them strode out from the group with a swagger backing up his challenge with his obvious bulk while his comrades turned to back him up and crowded in behind him the newcomers four men huddled into their cloaks for warmth stopped just inside the clearings edge the largest of them calling out a reply in their own language we are sent by calgus to help you the torturers leader stepped closer to them waving them away dismissively we have no need of help go back to the fight if you have the balls for it he stopped in his tracks as a series of muffled thumps reached his ears turning back to see one of his men down and another two staggering away as he stared uncomprehendingly another three of the torturers jerked with the impact of the unseen arrows hammering into their unprotected bodies the newcomers dropped their cloaks to reveal their armour and weapons and sprang forward with their swords ready to fight but the barbarian had already realised his peril and turned away from their threat sprinting for the clearings far side and gathering his strength to hurdle the fallen tree that lay across his path seeking escape into the night in search of help a shadowy figure rose from the ground in front of him sharp iron glittering in the moonlight and the tribesman ripped his sword from its scabbard as he used the trees trunk as a springboard for his attack leaping at the other man with the blade held ready to strike his opponent snarled and bounded forward to meet his charge swinging his sword in an arc of razorsharp iron marcus ran toward the prisoners with both swords drawn butchering a tribesman who turned to face him with a brutal hack of his spatha which cleaved the mans body from shoulder to breastbone before kicking him off the blade and turning in search of a fresh target for his rage another man ran for the forest behind the trees to which the prisoners were bound but made barely a dozen paces before an enraged scarface ran him down and sank his gladius between the fleeing tribesmans shoulders while dubnus charged into a pair of hapless barbarians with the heavy axe that was his habitual night patrol weapon smashing the butt of the axes heavy wooden handle into the face of the nearest man and breaking his jaw with an audible crack he dodged to the right to avoid a swordblow from the other cleaving his attackers arm clean off at the elbow with a swing of the heavy blade spinning through a full circle he lopped off the stricken barbarians head and then swung the axe blade high before hacking it down into the reeling victim of his butt stroke chopping his head almost in two and killing him instantly he ripped the axe blade from the dead mans head as the oneeyed soldier known to his mates as cyclops dragged the last mans body across the clearing and dropped it on to the ground next to them marcus walked across to a writhing tribesman the mans hands fretting at the arrow buried in his back and dispatched him with a swift stab of his gladius then looked over the corpses of the dead tribesmen and frowned there were a dozen of them i see only eleven dead men dubnus pointed at the fallen tree one of them ran that way go and see for yourself the barbarian groups leader was laying spreadeagled a dozen paces beyond the tree while the three hamians stood solemnly around him seeing their centurion approaching they moved away to allow marcus to view the body the mans corpse was almost headless only his neck and lower jaw remaining attached a gout of blood had exploded down his chest glistening black in the moonlight and the rest of his head lay in the pine needles half a dozen paces from the rest of him how did you qadir pointed silently to a dark figure standing in the shadows behind them marcus nodded to arminius and then turned back to the prisoners still tied to their trees even the man that was still conscious was babbling meaningless gibberish at his rescuers and the other two men were simply lolling against their ropes with no sign that they would regain consciousness any time soon the barbarians had tortured them beyond their endurance using their knives to ensure that the romans would never be able to walk or use their hands again the two unconscious men had endured the brutal ruin of their sexual organs and all three had suffered dozens of knife cuts the ground around the two unconscious men was sticky with their drying blood and its coppery stench filled the air around them cyclops spat on the ground shaking his head were too bloody late theyd have been peeling the poor fuckers soon enough all weve done is saved them from any more of these animals fun he hefted his sword and stepped closer to the nearest of the three mutilated men best i do this quickly young sirs marcus shook his head and pushed the blade aside youre right theres no way we can take them with us but if theres a need to finish them off ill not let another man do my job for me dubnus take the men back to the century and ill join you once ive seen these men across the river his friend nodded and gathered the tungrians disappearing quickly and quietly back up the slope and into the darkened ranks of trees marcus sheathed his spatha hefting the gladius and putting the short blades point against the first mans ribs angling it ready for the mercy stroke a thought struck him and he turned away to search the barbarians bodies until he found a purse full of roman coin on the big man that arminius had beheaded taking three coins before discarding the purse he moved quickly pushing one of them into the unconscious mans mouth before repositioning the gladius go to your gods my friend he stabbed the sword through the message riders ribs expertly putting it through the mans failing heart and killing him instantly a thin wash of blood trickled down the mans chest testament to the amount he had already lost under the barbarians knives and he died with no more than an almost silent last exhalation of breath marcus moved to the second man but found his skin cold and his eyes empty he pushed a coin into the mans mouth then looked across at the last of them to find the captives eyes locked on the gladius in his hand take me with you marcus shook his head sadly hefting the sword as he spoke the barbarians have left you a wreck friend severed your hamstrings and cut off your thumbs even if i could carry you to safety youll never walk or hold a sword again better to die here with some dignity a tear trickled down the message riders cheek make it qui he grunted with pain as marcus struck fast and without warning slamming the gladius into his chest and twisting it to make sure of the kill the dying mans eyes stared into his own for a long moment then rolled upwards as his spirit left him marcus stood in silence for a second before tucking the last of the three coins into the dead mans mouth and wiping and sheathing his sword a voice from the shadows at the edge of the clearing spun him round hands reaching for his swords you are a good man centurion corvus not many men would have taken the time to find coin and see these men safely across the river arminius stepped out of the gloom his face sombre in the presence of the dead messengers an unhappy passing but you gave it all the dignity that was to be had and now he gestured up through the trees to where the two centuries would be waiting for them marcus nodded but turned back towards the doomed fort we should leave before were discovered i know but i have to see it the german nodded quietly then we go as far as the forest edge any closer and we may find ourselves in the same trouble as these poor bastards the duty officer at fine view fort seven miles to the east of white strength frowned with concentration as he leaned out over the forts western parapet turning his head slightly in the hope of reducing the winds whine as it ruffled the crest of his helmet youre sure you heard a trumpet his watch officer shifted uncomfortably certain centurion it was the lad here that heard it first he gestured to a soldier so young that his face was not yet darkened by any trace of a beard i can still hear it sir listen there it goes again the centurion grimaced screwing his face up in concentration there it was just barely audible over the winds gentle moan fuck me theyre blowing the alarm signal you run for the first spear tell him that white strength is under attack in the five minutes that it took for the senior centurion to make his way to the forts rampart the distant trumpet calls had stopped he stood on the wall and stared out to the west the frisians are in the shit from the sound of it the first spear turned to his prefect i doubt well need to evacuate before dawn theyll be too busy trying to fight their way into the strength but youd best order the preparations well have to get word to noisy valley though they wont be seeing or hearing any of this given the lie of the land his superior nodded and went to find his dispatch riders the three men were waiting by their quarters dressed and ready to ride well predicted gentlemen there seems to be some kind of attack going in at white strength and were going to need you to ride for noisy valley and get the legions into the fight the small groups commander a young decurion temporarily detached from the petriana cavalry wing his aristocratic bearing confirmed by the thin purple stripe decorating the sleeves of his tunic where they protruded from beneath his bronze breastplate nodded his understanding yes prefect ill send these two east and then south theres no way theyll get through to the west the cohorts commander raised an eyebrow not riding out yourself decurion the young man smiled easily pulling on his helmet and fastening the strap tightly under his chin oh yes sir im riding just not to the east i said these two wouldnt make it but then neither of thems riding my horse his superior stepped closer looking the decurion up and down are you completely fucking mad young man if you ride to the west those bastards will have you dangling by your ankles with your balls in your mouth before sunrise the cavalryman smiled again his eyes steady on the prefects it will take until well after daybreak for these two to get through to noisy valley by which time white strength will be finished and those barbarians might well be knocking at your door too eh prefect i can probably make the ride in about two hours and with a bit of luck the bluenoses wont know im coming until im past them the prefect nodded slowly putting out a hand my apologies cornelius felix id taken you for something of a fop if you get away with this youll have a place in the histories for centuries to come the younger man took his hand then tapped the hilt of his sword the torchlight glinting off its gold and silver decoration and if i dont at least ill go down fighting mind you i wont be the bluenoses biggest problem if they catch up with us have you seen the chaos hades can cause when the wicked bugger starts kicking the defence of white strength had begun well enough for the garrisons men they had waited under cover of the forts walls until the attacking barbarians had carried their improvised battering ram up to the gates by means of ropes tied around the stripped trunk sufficiently loosely to allow them to be lifted with the ram directly beneath them ready to be swung at the gates they had rained a hail of heavy stones down on to the heads of the men swinging the tree trunk dozens of the tribesmen had fallen under the barrage and when more of them had rallied to the faltering attack a shower of oil heated to the point of boiling by fires built into the forts walls had sent them away in screaming agony for a few minutes it had seemed that the barbarian onslaught would fail but a fresh group of attackers had quickly discovered that the gates initial defence had all but exhausted the supply of both stones and oil and had set to swinging the heavy ram with gusto while archers peppered the rampart above their comrades with arrows as soon as any of the defenders showed themselves even as the lefthand door of the twin archways started to disintegrate under the rams crunching impacts and the soldiers waiting in the streets below shifted nervously in their defensive lines around the point of attack with their shields held up against the rain of arrows coming over the southern wall warning shouts rang out from the forts northern side the first spear ran from his place behind the centuries waiting around the straining gate his view of the forts northern side blocked by the buildings between him and the source of the sudden commotion as his field of view to the forts northern wall opened up he stopped and stared aghast at what he was seeing along the forts thinly manned north wall barbarian warriors were climbing over the parapet from what appeared to be a dozen siege ladders the outnumbered defenders were fighting back bravely enough their swords flickering in the moonlight as they struggled to hold back the tide of attackers but there was already a knot of tribesmen holding out against attacks from both sides of the forts northwest corner and more warriors climbing over the wall behind them with every passing second turning to shout to the nearest of his officers the first spears eye was caught by a flicker of light in the sky above the north wall in a flurry of flame a shower of fire arrows arced in over the forts defences the missiles impacting in showers of sparks across its northern side while most of the arrows would strike the buildings tiled roofs or the paved streets a few he knew from grim experience would inevitably hit the wooden frames around which the barrack blocks were built another volley of blazing arrows hammered down into the fort breaking the spell that had frozen him in place for a moment he spun back to bellow an order at the men waiting for orders on the walls to east and west fourth century get your arses on to the north wall and throw those bastards back where they came from as the century hurried along the forts walls to confront the new threat he stalked back to the men clustered around the gate putting the fire attack to the back of his mind he hooked a thumb back over his shoulder towards the growing flames shouting to the prefect over the fires crackling and popping fire arrows from the north well have to let the old place burn weve got no men to spare to fight it all we have to do is keep the cohort alive through the night nothing else matters weve rebuilt the barracks once this summer already we can do it again just as long as we can survive until morning besides at least we get to fight in the warm for a while the southern gateways lefthand arch sorely tested by repeated blows from the barbarians improvised ram burst open with a weary groan of tearing timbers the doorway stood open to the darkness beyond but for a moment there was no flood of attackers through the ruined defences rather a moments unnatural quiet as both attackers and defenders gathered themselves for the fight in that brief instant of peace the shouts and screams from the north wall seemed like no more than the rumour of a distant battle disconnected from the havoc about to break on the grimfaced centuries clustered ready to defend their tiny world a soldier in the front rank hawked loudly and then spat on the ground in front of the defenders shouting a challenge into the night come on then you bluenosed sheepfuckers lets be having you as if the barbarians outside the gate had been waiting for the challenge and as the echoes of his shout died away a wave of tribesmen stormed through the opened gateway and threw themselves on to the defenders shields other men hacked away the bracing that was keeping the righthand door secure the second arch was open within a minute despite the high price in blood the defenders made the men fighting to open it pay for the privilege hacking at the soldiers with their long swords the barbarians made easy targets for the expertly wielded spears striking into their mass from all three sides of the gate their first attack foundered in a welter of dead and dying men as wounded and dying warriors staggered away from the roman line in sprays of their own blood the prefect shouted encouragement into his senior centurions ear were holding them the veteran officer grimaced ducking as an arrow struck his helmet and clattered to the ground early days prefect early days im going up to the north wall see if weve a shout from the forts south wall almost directly above them made them both crane their necks fresh enemy warriors were climbing over the southern defences gaining footholds on the wall all the more easily in the absence of the men sent to repel the attack on the forts north side their archers filled the air to either side of them with flying iron to impede the defenders attempts to get at their ladder a soldier fell from the parapet with an arrow lodged in his throat thumping heavily to the cobbles beside the officers in the space of a minute there were fifty men on the walls broad fighting platform and the defending soldiers were clearly already on the back foot they were fighting not so much to evict attackers but simply to hold their ground against the inexorable buildup of warriors now pouring over the southern wall in three places as the officers watched helplessly one of the barbarians slung his spear down into the defenders ranks with a triumphant shout piercing a defenceless soldiers neck from back to front and dropping him like a sack of beans in a fountain of his own blood the first spear shouted into his superiors ear to be heard above the clamour of combat theyve got the fucking walls we either pull back or stay here and let them shower us with iron until were too weak to resist the other man nodded his understanding fall back theres no choice his subordinate grimaced waving a hand at the scene before them a fighting retreat with the enemy coming on like vicus drunks this is going to be fun he bellowed above the fights noise keeping a wary eye on the barbarian warriors gathering on the wall above him centurions to me cornelius felix rode west at a measured pace using the light from the moon overhead to follow the road to the west as it ran parallel to the south of the wall the big horse beneath him was skittish unaccustomed to working in the dark and its ears pricked forward and twitched at every tiny noise after several miles the road climbed a gentle ridge providing him with a good view of the neighbouring fort seemingly afloat in the sea of torchlight from the surrounding attackers the black stallion beneath him pawed at the ground impatiently made nervous by the darkness and clearly eager to run white strength fort seemed adrift in a sea of flames from both the blazing buildings within the walls and the hundreds of blazing torches clustered around them as he watched a volley of fire arrows arced over the forts walls in the nights quiet air the wind having fallen away to nothing for a moment he could just make out the distant sound of singing he listened for a moment then muttered quietly to himself as he spurred the horse on down the track well if you men have still got the balls to sing a marching song with that many bluenoses battering at your gates im sure ive got enough to make one quick run past you come on hades you cantankerous bastard lets go for a gallop and see where it gets us he urged the horse forward using the reins to hold the big animals speed down to a fast trot as they closed the gap to the embattled fort all the while calculating when to unleash the power rippling through the horses flesh beneath him with half a mile left to run he bent to speak into the horses ear right then my lad if there was ever a time for you to prove youre not just an evil sod that likes biting grooms this is it he touched his spurs to the horses flanks again easing his tight grip on the reins to allow hades to gradually accelerate his pace until they were cantering nicely and then when it seemed impossible for them to go unnoticed for another second by the mob of tribesmen now swarming around and into the fort he kicked the big horses flanks hard and bellowed encouragement clamping his thighs to the animals flanks he rose slightly from the saddle as the stallion responded with an exhilarating acceleration to its full speed a bounding gallop that catapulted horse and rider along the stretch of road that ran past the forts southern walls they were spotted almost immediately guttural warning cries alerting the archers closest to the big horses path who swung to fire the next volley of fire arrows not into the burning fort but at the unknown rider flying past them faster than most of them had ever seen a horse move most of the arrows flew too high archers accustomed to shooting over the forts wall failing to adjust their aim sufficiently but one flaming shaft streaked in low shooting across the horses nose with barely a hands span to spare and the big animal baulked for a moment fighting the momentarily terrified beast for control felix jabbed his spurs into its flanks with savage intent firing the animal across the firelit ground in a foammouthed charge both horse and rider intent on nothing more than escaping the rain of fire arrows one missile hissed unseen past the decurions head and another rebounded from his helmet the incendiary weapons now replaced by the evilly barbed ironheaded hunting arrows that the archers intended showering on to the defenceless garrison once their stock of fire arrows was exhausted the horse lurched in midstride as a dart buried itself deep in its shoulder lunging sideways away from the source of the pain until the decurion pulled it back straight despite the arrows impact the beast charged on if anything made faster by the wounds pain a final flurry of arrows whipped past the fleeing horseman and the last of them found its mark punching up into his unprotected armpit as he leaned forward over the horses neck and nearly unseating him with the impact almost insensible with the enervating shock felix slumped across the galloping horses neck and hung on to its mane with the last of his strength as the pair were swallowed up by the surrounding darkness the big horse slowed feeling its riders weight across its heavy neck and turned its head to look at the decurion through the delicately decorated armour that covered its long nose and eyes the officer rallied his strength his entire right side numb with the pain of the arrows protrusion up under his arm and only his good arms grip on the reins keeping him from slipping from the saddle a figure loomed out of the darkness and the wounded horse reared its head in surprise only to find its movement restrained by a strong grip on its bridle cornelius felix reached left handed for the hilt of his sword but found his hand restrained by a strong grip that the pain of his wound left him powerless to resist he slumped on to the horses neck hanging on for dear life as the animal reluctantly followed its unknown captors into the forests moonless gloom in the burning fortress the frisian cohort had retreated from their walls those men not already felled by barbarian arrows and spears fighting their way back into the forts centre to mount a desperate last defence against attackers now railing at their shields from all sides for every warrior that fell to their spears another two implacable enemies came through the gates and when the barbarians had gained first a foothold on and then control of the forts south wall and began to shower the troops with spears from above the first spear had had no choice but to order a retreat fighting his way back through the tight streets with his men he had been one of the first to fall to his knees with an arrow buried in his calf decapitated an instant later by the barbarians pressing hard against the retreating troops bereft of their leader the auxiliaries had fought on under the prefects command the senior officer donning a soldiers helmet and shield to take his place in the line but now they were being steadily ground down by the ceaseless attacks coming from all sides as they consolidated into an increasingly beleaguered defensive square at the forts heart in front of the burning headquarters barely two hundred of us still standing now a panting centurion the last officer still fighting other than the prefect himself gave his superior a weary look and nodded agreement the prefect grimaced from the pain of flesh wounds in his right thigh and arm baring his teeth in a snarl of frustration we fight on theres still a chance that the legions at noisy valley have got wind of this if they moved out an hour ago they could be here in minutes the centurions face was blank with battle shock his eyes alone betraying the combination of hope and disbelief that flickered in his otherwise reeling mind so we fight on my turn in the line i think you take a moment to get your breath back if i go down then itll be up to you to rally these men and to hold on as long as you can the centurion nodded raising his sword in salute as the prefect his teeth bared in a snarl of defiance stepped into the squares thinning line one last time parrying a barbarian spearthrust with his borrowed shield before gutting the weapons owner with a blow that would have made the dead first spear nod with quiet admiration the cohorts remnant fought on in silent exhaustion their meagre perimeter shrinking by the minute as the barbarians crowded in eager to kill before the fight ended the officer parried another attack shouting above the barbarians clamour to his men one last song lads show these bastards were not done yet the generals wife he led the song off smiling grimly as the soldiers responded to the familiar words of the first verse their voices momentarily drowning out the guttural cries of the tribesmen baying for their blood the cohorts remnant fought on with desperate purpose hemmed in by the press of their enemies as the barbarians remorselessly tightened their grip on the remaining defenders the centurion straightened his helmet and stepped into the line alongside his prefect filling his lungs to belt out the songs last verse our hero like a gentleman inclined his head once more and wondering who was booked in next he headed for the door on leaving the house to his surprise he found an impatient queue his chosen man watch officer and his clerical writer too the two men shared a moment of unspoken understanding the fact of their vastly different origins rendered meaningless by desperate circumstance the prefect tipped his head to the centurion lifting his shield a fraction as the barbarians massed just beyond swordreach and readied themselves for their final assault a voice rang out above the warbands baying clamour and the tribesmen fell silent from behind the barbarian line the voice called again this time speaking perfect latin to the prefects astonishment soldiers of rome i am calgus lord of the northern tribes i have taken your messengers burned out your fort and reduced your strength to a shadow of its former pride with only a small portion of my army your position is hopeless and in a few minutes you will all be dead or dying in ways that will make you beg for death if you surrender now you can spare yourself such indignity you have fought well against impossible odds but there will be no rescue for you no word of this dirty little battle will have reached your legions yet they still lie asleep behind their walls at noisy valley and you truly are alone in the dark surrender to me soldiers and renounce your service of the empire and i guarantee you will not die here prefect and centurion shared another glance the senior officer raising a questioning eyebrow his grim amusement obvious there was no way that the surrender of a roman of the equestrian class so obviously advertised by his purpleedged tunic would be greeted with anything other than protracted torture from which his eventual death would be a welcome relief the centurion spat on the bloodslickened cobbles then called back to the unseen speaker you bastards just want some prisoners to make sport with well not die now ill give you that but youll drag us away to the hills for a more leisurely game than youll get here if im going to die then itll be with a sword in my hand and with as many of you dead as i can manage before you put me down not with my dick sawed off and my eyes pulled out in some forest clearing now fight or fuck off before the legions turn up and bend you over for a good shagging you bluenosed turd punchers the prefect nodded his respect looking around at his men and raising his voice to be heard in turn well said centurion lets show this barbarian scum how roman soldiers fight to the bitter end calgus spoke again his voice light with amusement very well if death is what you desire i shall grant your wish his voice hardened as he barked out an order in his native language the waiting warriors pressing forward to swing their swords down on to the tightly packed soldiers while others thrust their spears into the gaps opened as the defenders lifted their shields to fend off the fierce swordblows calgus stood in the ruins of the shattered fort pulling his cloak over his face against the reek of smoking timbers his bodyguard had spread out round him stabbing down into the fallen auxiliary troops whose corpses still littered the narrow streets of white strength to ensure that none of the fallen soldiers was faking death the combined stench of burnt wood blood and faeces was overpowering even through the cloaks rough material the bodies of the defeated romans littering the ground in increasingly tight circles centred on the piled corpses of their last stand the votadini warriors he had put at the front of the assault were busy taking heads and searching for booty but martos spotted calgus and called his men to attend their leader they stood and gathered around him bloodied but proud of their victory calgus stared around him with evident pride warriors you have struck a huge blow at our enemy a whole cohort of their traitors torn to pieces another of their forts made useless to them and another piece of their defences burned out mark my words the soldiers to the east of this place will be clenching their arses when they see the smoke from this victory rising into the sky come the dawn he pulled his sword from his hip and punched it into the air victory the warriors gathered around him echoed the shout in a mighty roar he sheathed the blade clasping arms with martos well done prince martos well done indeed your men have proved themselves despite the mutterings of some of the men around my council fire the votadini will be in the front rank of the great plan that will have these roman bastards off our land for good and you my friend are going to be the man your people will praise for your victory all that remains now is for you to complete the job as we discussed ill leave a small party of my men to guide you back to the forest when youre done and be assured youre part of my plans for the future of this country once weve smashed their remaining strength martos nodded his gratitude turning to encourage his men in their last grisly task calgus moved away with a quiet smile of satisfaction heading for the forts gates and the road back to the warbands forest encampment at the gates a single figure detached itself from the shadows and stood waiting for him the man was reed thin with only a short sword to burden him my lord you know what to do dont fail me the gate guards standing guard duty on noisy valleys northern gate tumbled sleepily out of the warmth of their guardhouse their haste encouraged by their centurions shouts and liberally applied vine stick as he chivvied them up on to the forts wooden walls get your fucking helmets on and get ready to fight theres something coming down the road you go and get the first spear run the sounds were distant sometimes lost in the wind but distinctive enough boots and hoofs clattering on the roads paving stones the soldiers peered out anxiously over their shields hefting their spears and looking for something to throw them at the centurion strained to make out more detail in the uncertain light of the torches fixed over the walls parapet theyre ours get the gate open and get them inside two hundred men and more clattered through the briefly opened gates their centurion raising a weary hand to the guard centurys officer who was staring at the arrow protruding from the right flank of the horse he was leading the horses rider was apparently more dead than alive slumped unconscious in the saddle with his dangling right arm black with blood the centurion spoke with quiet authority watching as his exhausted men marched into the safety of the forts walls good morning centurion im tribulus corvus centurion first tungrian cohort white strength fort has been attacked by a force i estimate to be several thousand strong the barbarians were shooting fire arrows and had broken through the gate when i last saw it the unconscious rider groaned softly his arm dripping blood on to the roads surface mars look at all that blood its a wonder you got him this far the guard centurion turned away barking orders at his men bandage carrier get something round that arrow and put some pressure on it or hell be dead before we get him to the hospital chosen you look after this lot id better get the first spear and the prefect out of their beds the wars back on again the eastern sky was showing the first signs of the dawns onset by the time the toiling votadini tribesmen had completed their grisly task and the tribes warriors were eager for the command to run for the forests safety a trio of selgovae warriors stood ready to guide them their leader a painfully thin man clearly well accustomed to covering ground at speed martos strode over to the man gesturing with a hand to the north our task is complete now we must make haste before their cavalry find us here the leader of the guides nodded respectfully then follow me my lord and i will lead you as instructed by my lord calgus the warriors ran for a short time to the west until they reached the gate through which they had breached the wall hours previously then spilled through the small opening and headed north in a long column following the bobbing torches carried by their guides as the night lightened to reveal a thick blanket of early morning mist making the direction of their travel almost impossible to discern martos ran forward to join the guides they were jogging easily he noted where his own men their energy nearly exhausted by the harrowing battle for the fort were staggering along in their wake barely managing to keep up with the easy pace being set for them youre sure you know were on the right track i cant tell where we are the lead guide nodded confidently we planned for this my lord ive left marks to guide our steps about another fifteen miles id say satisfied the young chieftain dropped back to give his men the news but as the column of men ground their way towards safety he still frequently stared out into the impenetrable murk visibly unhappy at his lack of control of their situation at length the guides indicated that the warband should stop for a rest break the votadini warriors gratefully fell out of the line of march and sat down in the pale shadows of the trees that lined the rough track they were following chests heaving for breath as they tipped the last of their drinking water down parched throats the selgovae guides stayed on their feet their leader pacing cautiously forward into the stillthick mist while his comrades stared back down the columns length with faces set in stoic immobility one of the tribes family chieftains limped tiredly up the column after a few minutes an older man walking respectfully behind him my man here reckons were off our path my lord martos raised an eyebrow gesturing to the mist around them behind him unnoticed by the resting warriors the two remaining guides exchanged significant glances and began to step carefully backwards into the mist keeping their gazes fixed on the tribal leaders back and how can he tell in this the peasant warrior came forward bowing his respect his hair was grey and his features seamed with lines but his eyes were bright with intelligence lord i grew up on this ground many years ago i know my own country lord and i just sat down by a tree i used to climb as a lad i know every inch of that tree and i yes you know where we are so where are we if were heading back to the forest we came from id say were too far to the west my lord ten miles too far martos frowned turning to the place where the guides had stood a moment before only to find it empty the sound of mocking laughter sounded from the mist and his clan leader stared angrily into the mist beside him a hand clenched on his swords hilt were betrayed my lord those selgovae bastards have led us out to the west not to the north theyve hung us out for the roman cavalry to find out here the second this mist lifts well stand out like ticks on an oxs back and were probably only ten miles from their camp martos spat his disgust into the dirt aye and our people are exhausted it will take us all day to reach the forest in this state the older tribesman stepped forward his head still inclined respectfully if i may my lord i know of somewhere we might find a hiding place less than a mile from here if their first sweep misses us perhaps well be able to reach the forest tonight martos nodded unhappily its not much of an option but its probably the best chance weve got and if we do reach the forest ill hunt calgus down and carve him to ribbons for this calgus arrived back in the barbarian camp in the middle of the afternoon riding in at the head of his bodyguard having left the rest of the warband marching in his wake aed was waiting for him at the camps gateway falling in alongside the barbarian leader as he jumped down from his horse success my lord complete success as we discussed it both the roman garrison and the votadini dealt with king brennus has been asking for news of his men since sunrise i think he may have realised just how vulnerable he is with his warriors out of the camp calgus drew his sword an angry scowl twisting his face ill bring him news once my men have ripped through his bodyguard ill take that sour old bastard by the throat and tell him how ive left his men for the romans to make sport with then ill take my knife and carve out his aed put a cautionary hand on his masters arm it might be better my lord if the king were to be unmarked when the remaining nobles see his body you can claim that his bodyguard attacked you when they realised their king was dead and if theres no sign of violence you can argue with a straight face that he died a natural death and that their attack and subsequent deaths were a tragic misunderstanding he was an old man after all calgus nodded grimly turning for the short walk uphill to the kings tent and gesturing for his men to follow him ill smother the old bastard then its time to make king brennus regret the day he ever questioned my judgement the th legion returned an hour before dusk the troops solemn in their unaccustomed silence and the th came through the gates as the sun dipped to kiss the horizon two auxiliary cohorts in column with them first spear frontinius watched the sullenfaced legionaries march tiredly through the gates the two legions had headed north with swift and brutal efficiency just before dawn the leading cohorts pounding out through the gates at the double march less than half an hour after the arrival of the tungrians ordered to make their maximum speed to the embattled fort and to engage and destroy any barbarian forces they encountered the legionaries had sallied without their packs and carrying poles to let them sustain the punishing double march for as long as required taking their bread and water ration on the move to save precious time the auxiliaries had been left to guard the fortress for the few hours that the legions were in the field while the armys two cavalry wings had ridden out shortly afterwards to scout beyond the wall and seek any sign of where the barbarian warband might be hiding in the wake of the attack on white strength the first spear watched the returning soldiers for long enough to identify the auxiliaries marching alongside them the vangione and cugerni cohorts thats fine view and aelian bridge evacuated then but no frisians julius call a centurions conference and brief our brother officers that well be on the road at first light tomorrow anyone that needs anything to be ready for war had better get their shit in a pile double quick if im any judge of men those lads have seen something that they didnt like very much and i dont think our new governors the type to let an atrocity go unanswered and send a runner to the prefect now that the eagles have come back to roost well be called to a senior officers briefing soon enough i expect they were as ordered the auxiliary cohort prefects gathered in the forts headquarters where the grimfaced governor and his legates were waiting for them both mens cloaks and boots still spattered with mud once the officers were settled in the chairs set out for them the governor stood his face more stony than usual youll be aware that white strength was attacked last night and that both legions went forward at full strength to attempt the garrisons relief what you dont know is what they found when we got to the fort legatus equitius you were leading youd best tell it the tungrians former prefect rose looking across the gathered prefects and first spears with a bleak stare we advanced on white strength in haste but with three cohorts abreast where possible a front broad enough to hold the barbarians if they chose to attack us out of the ruins of the fort we could see the flames from three miles out probably past their worst but still licking at the sky we crested the last ridge and i ordered a halt and a deployment to battle formation the ground around the fort was teeming with lights hundreds of torches which we mistakenly assumed was the warband waiting patiently for us to arrive twentieth legion deployed to support us and to refuse any attack from either flank and then i ordered the sixth forward in a deliberate attack slow enough to detect any traps or ambush the way down to face them was clear of anything that might have obstructed our advance or any sign of hostile intent and i was soon pretty sure that there were no tribesmen waiting for me at white strength although that didnt explain the torches still burning around the fort he paused for a moment rubbing his tired face with one hand i rode forward to join the lead centuries curious to understand the point of the display we were perhaps three hundred paces from the fort when i guessed the truth of the matter and half that when i realised with a sick heart that my suspicion was justified the officers leaned forward to hear his voice as it sank close to the point of inaudibility with the memorys apparent power the torches on which we were advancing were not you might have guessed by now simple brands left burning to guide us to the scene of the frisian cohorts massacre they were human bodies the legatus shook his head with the memory human bodies stripped and then impaled on wooden stakes painted with pitch and set on fire an entire fivehundredman cohort slaughtered and then used as a demonstration of our enemys appalling brutality in victory he fell silent for a moment staring at his boots then spoke again turning to the governor and inclining his head respectfully believe me sir when i tell you that theres no desire in my head to tell you how we should fight but be assured that my legion will be eager for blood when we face these bastards across a battlefield sixth legion has sworn to mars cocidius and jupiter that we will take these men down whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself legatus macrinus stepped forward his face dark with a thunderous rage as has the twentieth the governor took the floor looking across his gathered officers and taking stock of their facial expressions and body language so gentlemen our enemy has raised the stakes quite dramatically in the space of a day he has confirmed that his army is still in the field he has destroyed an entire cohort and burned out yet another wall fort he has our men desperate for the chance to slip their collars and run wild at his warriors as a statement of intent its dramatic enough but as a device to tempt us off our own ground and away from the strengths that will win us this war its masterful he looked around the briefing seeing thoughtful looks start to take hold among his subordinates we will find that warband and we will take their heads and leave the remainder for the crows that i promise you but well do these things in our usual disciplined manner there will be no rash gestures not by our soldiers and most certainly not by anyone in this room any man here that breaks this rule or even connives at its circumvention will be stripped of his rank and sent back to rome for punishment are we clear the officers nodded soberly recognising the truth in ulpius marcelluss harsh words good make sure that message reaches all corners of your commands along with this i will sacrifice to the gods alongside them in thanks for bloody revenge when we find and flatten this gang of savages under our hobnailed boots but that victory will be gained in the tried and tested way fighting in line and taking our enemies lives while offering none of our own in return thats all a flurry of activity in the headquarters entrance hall turned the assembled officers heads a familiar figure strode into the room his ornate helmet held under one arm his agelined hawkish features were alive with the joy of the moment a man in his prime doing what he loved most he walked quickly to the front of the room snapping off a salute to the governor and nodding to his friend equitius tribune licinius i presume the petriana wing has news for us given your unexpected entrance licinius nodded confidently governor my men remain in the field standing guard around a detachment of the enemy who seem to have lost their way there are fifteen hundred of them more or less camped in an old hill fort less then ten miles away from here as the crow flies we came upon them in the late afternoon as we patrolled back towards the wall we must have been in too much of a hurry when we passed them on the way out but theyre bottled up well enough for now i had the horns blown long and hard enough to bring the augustan wing to join us so we ought to be able to keep them there overnight the governor looked to his legates well gentlemen perhaps our prayers are answered equitius frowned i can see no good reason for any barbarian to be anywhere other than tucked up safely in whatever hide theyve built in the deep forest well to the north taking up a position so close to the wall is tantamount to suicide or sacrifice you suspect a trap equitius nodded looking to his fellow legatus for support theres something not right with this no leader in his right mind would choose to put his men in such a trap unless he expected to have his chestnuts pulled out of the fire my instinct is to take this gift but to make very sure that we screen the attacking force with overwhelming strength just in case these trapped men are bait in a larger plan ulpius marcellus nodded decisively i agree lets grind these unfortunates into mince gentlemen and give our men something to cheer about frontinius walked back to the tungrians section of the camp deep in thought his mind dwelling on the slaughter inflicted on the frisian cohort men he had soldiered alongside for half of his life the mood in the cohorts lines was more anger than sorrow attitudes hardening as the manner of their comrades slaughter and the defilement of their corpses sank in the news that a woman had been killed in the forts vicus the previous evening raped and then strangled in the opinion of clodia drusilla barely merited a mention in their conversations alongside the enormity of this latest barbarian atrocity julius was waiting for him in the command tent pacing impatiently around the small space with a hand on his sword were marching in the morning yes the first spear nodded dropping his helmet on the table yes weve got an appointment to destroy a warband that the petriana have bottled up north of the wall unless theyve allowed the barbarians to slip away in the meantime well not be back in camp until weve found calgus and taken our iron to him and his murdering savages id say the next few days are going to be more than exciting enough for a pair of old soldiers like you and me and now id better go and make sure that morbans found someone to look after his grandson the last thing we want is for the poor sod to be worrying about the boy when things are getting hectic the army marched soon after dawn the following day each of the two legions supplemented by auxiliary cohorts to make up two forces ten thousand men strong each with the legions cavalry thrown out in front of them to provide a screen against the threat of a barbarian ambush the th legion turned east a mile south of the wall shaking out on to a wide front and heading for the charred wreckage of white strength while the th legion and its supporting cohorts including both the st and nd tungrians headed on north through the gate where the road met the wall scaurus had briefed his officers fully making clear their part in the next days plan the governors decided to clear the ground to the north and south of the wall before we strike out into enemy territory he wants to be sure that our supply line back to the valley stays open while we dig calgus out of the hills so we have to make sure there are no nasty surprises waiting to jump out behind us once weve marched north were also to deal with the warband that the petriana have trapped about ten miles north of here although theres still no clear reason why theyd be camped out in such a dangerous spot so ourselves and the second cohort and the cugerni will go north of the wall with sixth legion turn east once were clear of the forest and sweep the ground in front of the wall when we reach the spot where the warbands waiting for us well split into two groups one under tribune antonius to attack the hill fort and another led by the legatus to form a defensive line to the north and make sure nobody tries to interfere after the briefing hed spoken with frontinius outlining his plan for the next day ive suggested to legatus equitius that we take the lead once were through the wall gate and peel off a century to have a quiet wander through the forest and look for any sign of the enemy before meeting the rest of the cohort on the far side that will get centurion corvus safely out of the public eye for another few hours his men are supposed to be hunters lets allow them to do something they ought to be good at once the tungrians were well clear of the wall gate frontinius stepped clear of the column and waved back in the preagreed signal at marcuss command the th century peeled off the line of march and stepped on to the twentypace strip of ground dividing the road from the forest cleared of any vegetation to prevent an attacker from falling on marching troops without any warning the hamians stood and watched as the column ground past them up the road the auxiliary cohorts followed by a seemingly endless stream of legion centuries their layered plate armour marking the difference between them and the auxiliaries that led the column your men seem alert enough marcus turned to find the german arminius at his shoulder his eyes on the hamians as they took their short rest break casting a careful eye over his men marcus was surprised to note that one man in every tent party was watching the forests dark wall intently and ignoring the legions parade up the road yes they seem to have absorbed their lesson about keeping watch well enough he stared into the forest pleased to see that the ground cover between the looming oaks was light enough for his men to pick their way through it with relative ease at his command the century shook out into a long line with ten feet between each man and at qadirs shouted signal they stepped off into the forest to the east of the road with their shields unslung and swords held ready to fight once they were fifty paces or so into the forest each man was as good as alone in the gloomy light that managed to penetrate the thick overhead cover the mass of vegetation all around them dulling the faint sounds of their passage to nearinaudibility scouting through the forest with the apparently instinctive caution that had so surprised marcus the previous night they hunted through the shadows for an hour before low whistles passed down the line summoned him to the scene of a discovery several men were gathered around a patch of scorched earth marcus took one look and spoke quietly to his soldiers you four allround defence ten paces out and keep your eyes on the trees and your mouths shut and listen if a rabbit has a noisy bowel movement anywhere within a mile of here i want to know about it you and you signal the century to gather here quietly he turned back to the object of their interest to find arminius squatting down alongside the burnt earth poking at the ash with his finger these ashes are cold but recent and its a big fire enough for twenty to thirty men marcus waited until the century were gathered around him their faces both eager and nervous with the discovery i want a search of the area around this fire fingertips in the grass knives in the soil thirtyodd barbarians dont camp out without leaving some clue as to who they were and do it in silence no talking raise a hand if you find anything qadir quickly organised the troops to form a search line and sweep across the area around the fires black scar on their hands and knees searching the ground in front of them with their fingers and probing the soil with their daggers for any small item that might have been dropped and trodden into the earth after ten minutes a soldier put his hand in the air his find carried across to marcus by one of the watch officers the man held out his hand showing off a small piece of silver that the centurion took from his palm jewellery very pretty someones going to be annoyed when he finds this missing from around his neck a replica axe head crudely fashioned but still recognisable for what it represented sat on his palm he showed qadir the find seen anything like this before his deputy shook his head staring blankly at the glinting pendant i have the two men turned to find arminius staring at the tiny silver ornament his face creased in concern it was midmorning by the time that felicia was ready to remove the arrow from the wounded cavalry officer she stood over her patient his eyes slitted in a deathly pale face as he clung to consciousness with a tenacity that gave her hope for his survival despite the bloodcrusted arrow protruding from his armpit decurion decurion can you hear me the exhausted officers eyes flickered in her direction his mouth opening fractionally in a hoarse whisper i hear you he swallowed painfully licking his lips felicia knelt by the bed taking one icecold hand in both of her own my horse she smiled despite her concern your horse cornelius felix bit two men and kicked several more black and blue while they were getting the arrow out of him but im told hes happily chewing his way through the forts stock of barley even as we speak and as for you decurion you have a barbarian arrow deep in your left armpit it seems to have missed your lung and more importantly the artery that runs through your shoulder down your arm but it must come out immediately i need to clean out your wound and prevent the onset of sepsis youve lost too much blood already and youll lose more while i remove the arrow but to leave it there will probably kill you anyway his lips moved again the smile touching his eyes this time get the blasted thing out now eh she nodded mutely do it but promise me yes if the arm has to come off yes just kill me i cant ride that monster hades onehanded shaking her head sadly she gently squeezed the cavalrymans right hand my oath forbids me any such act well just have to make sure this stays attached to you now drink this she put a beaker to his lips and patiently tipped the drink into his mouth in small sips what is it a mixture of wine honey and the dried and powdered sap of the poppy flower it will make you drowsy or possibly even put you to sleep given the amount of blood youve lost what i have to do to you now is going to hurt considerably more than the pain youre in at the moment the doctor waited for a few minutes noting the soldiers gradually slower breathing as the drug took effect hes asleep lets move him to the table you have to keep his arm absolutely as it is now straight out from his body we have no idea what the arrowhead might be touching in there she supervised the orderlies as they carried the decurion from his bloodstained bed to the operating table where so many men had laid in recent months their wounds open to her gentle skilful fingers the tables surface was crisscrossed with the scars inflicted by her knives and saws marks left from those occasions when she had decided that the removal of a limb was a safer alternative than risking the onset of gangrene in a shattered arm or leg the woods grain was rubbed smooth by the incessant scrubbing she insisted on to remove each successive mans blood from the surface before the next soldier was laid out for her attention keep his arm steady thats it now get him on to the table with the unconscious mans body arranged to her satisfaction his arm held firmly at right angles from his body by one of the orderlies she surveyed the wound carefully noting the blood still leaking from the arrows wicked puncture stepping away from the table she studied her instruments for a moment before selecting a pair of polished concave bronze blades one with a blunt curved end the other with small hooks at its end turning to her helpers she addressed the man standing ready to help her by the unconscious patients head so what do we know about arrow wounds orderly julius doctor the arrow is often barbed and will cause more damage during removal due to further tearing of the flesh inside the wound and so the usual method for the removal of such an arrow is to push the arrows head out of the body through a second wound opened for the purpose when this can be achieved without risk this allows the arrow to be broken in half and safely removed and given this arrows location it would be impossible to make a second opening the arrow must be withdrawn through the original wound she smiled encouragement good have you carried out this procedure before no doctor i have not very well you shall have your first opportunity shortly from the look of the wound this is a broadheaded arrow with only two barbs and not one of ours we can be thankful for that small mercy can we not julius the orderly responded dutifully certainly doctor a flatbladed arrow opens a pocketshaped wound which will close itself well enough as a result of the flesh swelling in response to the arrows intrusion a wound made by the threebladed arrowheads used by our archers will not close however and requires much more attention during recovery and and it has three barbs rather than two exactly so back to this particular patient our decurions arrows upper blade and barb may be close to the large blood vessel that runs along the shoulder and down into the arm and if we snag that vessel with the uppermost barb we will have a dead man on this table inside a minute or so im going to use these she lifted the bronze blades to display them to the two men to prevent that from happening these two items are called a dioclean cyathiscus because their use was invented by the greek diocles she bent over the patient sliding the first blade into the wound probing gently for the arrowhead there it is now im pushing the blade up and over the barb its smooth and blunt so there shouldnt be a risk to the blood vessel thats it now theres a tiny hole in the top of the blade which im going to engage with the point of the barb got it that barb is now harmless to the patient now the other blade goes in see i engage the tiny hooks over the first blade like so and i can now pull the arrow from the wound with the second blade both providing the traction and keeping the first blade in place over the barb thats the worst part over with and not too much more blood spilt either she looked at julius theres another set of blades over there go and get them weve managed to protect the blood vessel so now its your turn to make the other barb safe the arrow was out of the wound a minute later the orderly having made a decent fist of engaging its other barb before ceding control of the extraction to felicia she drew the vicious iron blade smoothly and slowly from its incision looking critically at the missile before putting it to one side theres a memento for our cavalryman when he wakes up now for this wound she explored the wound carefully with bluntnosed forceps pulling out a scrap of cloth from deep inside the decurions armpit and holding it up for the orderlies to see see a fragment of his tunic punched into the wound by the force of the arrows impact we must never leave such an object inside a wound it will cause sepsis possibly gross infection and frequently end in the death of our patient especially a man as weak as this from loss of blood so orderly julius what does celsus advise us to do now the orderly looked up for a second remembering his long hours of reading the textbooks that felicia had lent to him doctor we must pack the wound with lint soaked in vinegar to stop the bleeding and pure honeycomb to assist the healing correct and the vinegar will also help to prevent infection of the wound how long do you think we should wait before sewing up the wound the mans face reddened in truth doctor i do not know she smiled and you will not guess which does you credit well make a medic of you yet julius the answer is that we will decrease the size of the wounds packing with every change which will be twice a day until we can see that the flesh inside is healthy in colour and feel and that the interior of the wound is closing only then can we safely close the wound well done colleagues i do believe that this man will live to fight another day the th scouted through the forest without any further result for the next three hours emerging out of the trees and into the bright daylight at midday more or less the soldiers took their meal in the shelter of the forests edge and then slung their pack poles over their shoulders heading for the meeting point that had been agreed at a brisk march they saw no sign of any enemy during their tenmile trek across the rolling country north of the wall and overhauled the legion after an hours progress the auxiliary cohorts were out front sweeping forward on a broad front behind a cavalry screen provided by the th legions cavalrymen the legion itself remained in column of march albeit that their pace was slowed to accommodate the auxiliaries cautious progress the th century marched up the columns length steadfastly ignoring the inevitable barrage of insults thrown at their backs by the legionaries and marcus snapped off smart salutes to each cohorts first spear in turn as they passed the columns head past the thicket of standards that led the legion on the march a single horseman rode out alongside them his horse trotting easily alongside the running soldiers marcus had recognised his former prefect the moment his horse had peeled away from the legions officers and his salute was accompanied by a smile of genuine pleasure equitius leaned down from his saddle throwing him a return salute centurion i saw the colour of your mens shields and guessed that you might be tungrians ill assume that youve been undertaking some private scouting mission for prefect scaurus to judge from the haste with which youre tearing off into the distance marcus stepped closer to the horse almost rubbing his armoured shoulder against its flank as he lowered his voice to ensure privacy weve been scouting the ground to the north of the north road crossroads legatus and keeping out of the way if you know what i mean equitius nodded sagely a good choice by your prefect given the continued interest in your possible whereabouts and marcus handed him the tiny pendant waiting as the other man turned it over in his hand a piece of barbarian jewellery it means nothing to me the centurion took the piece back dropping it into the pouch on his belt nor to me legatus but prefect scauruss bodyguard tells us hes seen another exactly the same north of the wall far to the north equitius nodded again a new understanding dawning in his eyes i see well in that case i wont detain you id imagine that your prefect will know well enough what to make of this interesting snippet of intelligence without my interference given his experience gentlemen he gestured to the land beyond the legions lead cohort your comrades are out there about a mile in front of us they shouldnt be too hard to find theyre the fellows poking their spears into every bush on a twomile front as chance would have it the first unit the century encountered was the nd tungrian cohort mindful of the warnings not to advertise his presence marcus felt a frisson of uncertainty as he looked for an officer to ask where the first cohort might be found the centurion he approached rendered anonymous by the stark lines of his helmets cheek guards took one look and grinned triumphantly i remember you weve met before youre two knives thats it the tungrians built a hurried camp alongside the nd cohort the cugerni cohort from aelian bridge and three cohorts of the th legion the turf walls were raised quickly and to a foot less than the regulation height since the prefects wanted their men to be fresh for the fight first spear frontinius sent his men to dinner once their section of the rampart was complete marcus sat with qadir and antenoch the latter casting dark stares at a chastened lupus who had been discovered hungry and thirsty beneath a tent on the centurys wagon the little bastard must have sneaked himself on to the cart when we were getting ready to pull out from noisy valley the clerks exasperation with the childs desperation to be with the century had been all too evident as had morbans mortification when his presence had been discovered lupus had still been wet eyed an hour after his discovery as the two men had taken turns to tell him just how stupid he was i caught the little sod grinning to himself when he thought no one was looking morban had confided to marcus so i clipped his ear again to teach the cheeky bugger a lesson the child was sitting solemn faced between antenoch and qadir the object of great curiosity for the rest of the century who kept wandering past in ones and twos until their attention became tiresome and their centurion ordered them into their tents theres no way to get him back to the valley marcus had told a tightlipped antenoch youll just have to keep an eye on him and when we run into the bluenoses hell just have to hide somewhere the clerk had shrugged angrily dragging the protesting child to his tent by one ear with dark threats of fearsome retribution for any further infringement of the rules laid down for him first spear frontinius surprisingly enough had been more relaxed on the subject than anyone else in the boys chain of command sitting at his meal with julius he had shrugged when the subject was raised what can we do about it now nothing the lads going to end up as a soldier in any case hes just getting an earlier start than the rest of us anyway hell be safe enough for tonight at least i doubt that anyones going to be bothering us with the rest of the sixth less than two miles to the north and in a particularly bad temper given that we get to take revenge for the frisians while they get to stand guard julius smiled sourly ill happily swap if thatll make them happier most of them are replacements for the men that died at lost eagle and weve already seen one decent fight this summer frontinius laughed quietly it doesnt work that way though does it were blooded as are the boys from the sixth wholl be fighting alongside us legatus equitius has put the first team into this fight so its up to us to justify his confidence julius shook his head squinting into the setting suns dying rays just as long as the bloody sixths cohorts actually come to the fight he stretched his massive frame tired from the days march so what did young corvus find in the woods that was so significant frontinius shook his head no idea some piece of jewellery or other the prefect took one look and went into a huddle with his man the german hes gone over to the sixths main body for a chat with the legatus so doubtless well find out soon enough anyway off to dinner with you and then get your lads heads down for the night well be up before dawn and i want everyone nice and fresh in the quiet time after dinner as the troops made their last preparations for battle before turning in for the night a strange officer appeared in the tungrian lines following directions from the patrolling sentries he made his way to the th centurys row of tents and sought out marcus the two men stood talking in the camps torchlight for a few minutes then clasped their arms before the stranger turned to head back to his own part of the camp the young centurion watched him go for a moment then walked across to the st centurys section of the camp seeking out the first spear with a worried look on his face frontinius listened impassively to his story then sent for julius you met a pair of second cohort centurions at arab town when you went to pick up our replacements julius scratched his head still itching after a full day beneath his crested helmet decent enough lads as i recall tertius and appius yes thats it our brother officer marcus has just had a visit from tertius they met on the march today by pure good fortune tertius wanted to warn marcus that the second cohorts prefect is convinced hes the son of a disgraced roman senator and that hes recruited this appius to find him and deliver proof of his whereabouts the bear told me that he was around our lines at noisy valley only a few minutes after i sent the eighth out on night exercise julius frowned shaking his head at the apparent inevitability of the net closing around them after which prefect furius will denounce the fugitive take the credit for his discovery and do his level best to have us all nailed up alongside two knives frontinius nodded exactly from what ive heard he might even have a go at sticking it to prefect scaurus julius frowned why would this tertius be so keen to tell us this surely hed be better off just keeping his mouth shut frontinius acknowledged the point reaching for his helmet and vine stick its a longer story than weve got time for now suffice to say that centurion tertius has quite a good reason not to be all that fond of his new prefect im off to the sixth legions lines now theres a command conference well finish this discussion later but for the time being lets keep centurion corvus under as much cover as possible the detachments senior officers gathered in the command tent waiting for tribune antonius to make his entrance the auxiliary cohorts prefects and first spears rubbed shoulders with three hardfaced legion senior centurions and a pair of junior tribunes the latters equestrian status clear from the thin purple strip on both mens tunics antonius entered the tent a moment later and every eye was upon the senior tribune as he walked to the briefing table to announce his intended plan of attack he stepped up to the table pointing to the rough map sketched on its surface and speaking in a clear confident voice this ought to be straightforward enough i should think there are reported to be about fifteen hundred of them camped on that hill they know were here so they will be ready but they probably havent eaten all day and theyve already fought one pitched battle with six cohorts we outnumber them by nearly three to one so good enough odds for an assault id say nothing too fancy unless anyones got any better ideas we simply break in we put them to the sword and calgus has one less warband to play with he paused looking around the tent at the gathered officers im reminded that its usual for auxiliary cohort commanders to be offered the first crack at the enemy in this sort of situation ill bet hes been reminded of that old tradition mused frontinius inwardly in fact ill bet he had a queue of centurions falling over each other to remind him of it so gentlemen its up to you will the tungrians and cugerni lead the line for this action prefect furius stepped forward nodding decisively to the amazement of the other two prefects and their first spears neutos face froze into immobility only his eyes betraying his surprise yes tribune i think youll find that were more than up to the task i propose that we make up the first wave and that your legion infantry be kept in close reserve ready to assist us if the going gets difficult antonius nodded approvingly a brief smile twitching his lips well said prefect furius excellent spirit very well i suggest that you take some time between the three of you to lay out your battle plan the sixth legion will back you up in whatever you decide thank you gentlemen outside the tent a thinlipped scaurus put a hand on furiuss arm his anger clearly boiling over next time you decide to do something that stupid id appreciate some bloody warning furius bristled indignantly and the cugerni prefect walked away a few paces studiously ignoring the two men as the nd tungrians prefect pointed a finger at his colleague stupid i think you should explain yourself rutilius scaurus scaurus held his ground his voice lowered to avoid the words carrying back into the command tent when antonius offered us first place in the line he was simply doing what the legions always do putting dispensable auxiliaries to his front to soak up the worst of the casualties but what you offered him went a long way beyond that youve just let him off the hook for this battles conduct and given him a castiron excuse for holding his cohorts back as long as he likes were not four thousand men attacking fifteen hundred any more in fact were not much better than evenly matched unless antonius throws his men in alongside us and he wont do that until weve already got the barbarians beaten so wed better do some quick thinking as to how this battles going to be fought because i dont think a frontal assault is going to be good enough he caught the lurking cugerni prefects eye and raised his voice i suggest you both come to my tent in an hour he summoned frontinius with a jerk of the head and stalked away his mind working fast heading back to his own cohorts lines and talking as he walked so youve got another chance at glory first spear frontinius were to assault the hill fort with the other auxiliary cohorts while the sixth legion sits on its backside and watches us go about it id imagine that young antonius couldnt have imagined a better result if hed tried the first spear shook his head in disbelief we get to attack a barbarian warband uphill into prepared defences while the legion cohorts sit and laugh at us from behind their shields we might win but itll be a bloody victory id take lost eagle over the goatfuck this could turn into if cocidius decides weve had enough divine favour for one lifetime scaurus nodded unless we can turn their flank and avoid a frontal attack im forced to agree with you frontinius snorted turn their flank unlikely since theyre defending a circular position they walked into the prefects tent and scaurus slumped into a chair gesturing the first spear into the other i take your point talk me through it then youre the leader of this particular warband how do you go about defending yourself when the romans come to play frontinius scratched a circle in the tents dirt floor theyll assume that were coming from the south since they know well enough that were camped here theyve not had the time to put up any kind of palisade so if it was me in command of that rabble id line them up behind the southern side of the earth rampart ready to fight but safe from any artillery we might have with us then id post a few men on top of the wall perhaps four or five each to north south east and west to watch for our approach he knows that a force this size cant approach silently so a few men with sharp eyes and ears ought to be enough to warn him of an advance from any direction after that itd be simple enough to move his force around the wall to match our point of attack and when we do show our hands hes got time to get any field defences hes prepared into place sharpened stakes tribuli that sort of thing if we had any sense wed just sit back and wait for them to give up for lack of food and water and if we split our forces he splits his and the basic problem remains unchanged scaurus nodded slowly so the watchers on the wall are the key if they fail to give a warning the warband remains oriented on our most likely line of advance frontinius glanced across at him sharply yes well i was just thinking about the eighth century frontinius nodded unhappily so was i weve got a problem with centurion corvuss visibility already and i suspect your ideas about to make it worse five minutes later the two men walked into the th centurys section of the camp and sought out marcus quickly outlining the prefects idea to the young centurion could it work marcus nodded slowly i think so prefect theres a man wholl have a better judgement than mine though he called for qadir the chosen man mulled the idea for a moment and then he too nodded yes we can do this but not wearing armour he held up a hand to silence the first spears reaction please believe me first spear frontinius we can only perform this task if all conditions are right we must be in position at exactly the right moment when the rising sun lights up the men on the earth wall we must reach that position completely undetected or we will lose the element of surprise and to do this we must not be burdened with your heavy mail shirts helmets and shields it would be impossible for us to make a silent approach carrying all that weight and your plan prefect depends on our being as silent as a fox hunting across the desert at night frontinius pulled a sceptical face and if the barbarians discover you what will you do against hundreds of them without your equipment the tall chosen man returned his stare without blinking for several seconds first spear in the eighth century you have one hundred and sixty of the best archers in the world at your command every one of us is capable of putting three arrows into a mansized target at one hundred paces in less time than it would take a man to run the distance it would be a brave warrior that could run into that the prefect looked at marcus questioningly do you agree yes sir i suggest we wear our cloaks to cover up our tunics but otherwise it should work well enough if we can deal with their flank sentries undetected scaurus took a deep breath in that case first spear i suggest we go and speak to my fellow prefects although whether gracilus furius will appreciate our pulling his balls out of the fire is debatable as it happened both furius and the cugerni prefect agreed with the plan readily enough while tribune antonius picked a piece of lint from the broad senatorial stripe that decorated the right shoulder of his tunic and smiled in quiet amusement at the contrast between this quiet acceptance and the mans bluster of an hour before he dismissed the officers to their preparations with a last quiet word of encouragement well gentlemen youd better go and warn your centurions that tomorrow starts early and will end in victory im looking forward to seeing the cohorts that won us the battle of the lost eagle in action again appius waited until well after dark before leaving his tent with both cohorts bedded down for the night and the sentries attention turned mainly outside the marching forts earth wall dressed in his dark leggings and tunic and keeping to the shadows he made swift and silent progress through the camp and into the st cohorts lines slipping from the shadow of one tent to the next with a careful eye open for the patrolling soldiers all the time keeping the other closed to protect it from the torches providing patchy illumination for the rows of tents within minutes he had found the tents housing the hamians slinking noiselessly up their line until he reached the spot where he estimated the centurions tent would be positioned worming his way round the tent he lifted the front flap fractionally peeking into the darkened interior with the previously closed eye wide open a single body was lying rolled up in a blanket a centurions helmet laid alongside the bed with a vine stick next to it he slipped quietly inside the tent and across the grass floor to the neatly folded pile of clothes that awaited the young officers wakening ignoring the wooden chest at marcuss feet for fear of a noisy hinge waking the sleeping man running his hands across the garments he encountered a hard object the prick of a pin to his finger telling him that it was the cloak pin he had picked up from the floor of the arab town officers mess he pulled the metal disc from its hiding place beneath the mans cloak and grinned to himself in triumph slipping it into his pocket and moving silently back to the tents entrance opening the flap a fraction he froze into immobility as a patrolling sentry padded past the mans attention clearly elsewhere since the slight movement went unnoticed when the soldier was twenty paces farther down the line of tents the intruder slipped out of the small opening leaving the sleeping centurion none the wiser as to his presence the cohorts mustered for their short march to the hill fort an hour before first light hundreds of torches blazing out into the darkness marcus walked with qadir as the chosen man checked his mens equipment in the flickering light watching as the hamian and his watch officer took each mans bow in turn and tested its draw it is customary the big man had told him they expect us to examine every mans bow before we use them in battle if i were to ignore the ritual they would fear some form of bad luck befalling them besides better for a mans bowstring to part here than in the heat of battle dubnus walked down to the ths place at the rear of the tungrians column smiling grimly at the sight of marcus in his cloak the heavy wool held closed with a borrowed bronze pin he glanced at antenoch noting the clerks sombre demeanour whats wrong with him dont tell me hes getting nervy before a fight for the first time in his life his friend frowned in the flickering torchlight no nothing like that my cloak pins gone missing and hes blaming himself ive told him its my fault it probably fell off last night so itll either be trampled into the mud or safely tucked away in some lucky soldiers pack his friend grimaced his sympathy everyone in the cohort knows its yours so if its found itll come back and besides youre better off with that bronze pin this particular morning its just a shame youve no armour underneath the cloak marcus returned the smile with a raised eyebrow and lifted the heavy wool to reveal his mail shirt we havent all given up on the virtues of a good strong defence once the bluenoses realise whats happening theyll come across that fort like a pack of dogs after raw meat and someones going to have to deal with the men that dodge our arrows his former chosen man nodded solemnly well be with you as quickly as possible marcus tapped the hilts of his swords and until then ill be getting some practice with these just dont take too long he shook hands with morban detailed by the first spear to remain behind and look after lupus much to his disgust frontinius had ignored his protests waving him away dismissively its not as if a standards going to make much difference in this instance and you should have made sure he was being cared for grin and bear it standardbearer because it isnt going to change the auxiliary cohorts led the column out of their temporary camp in a blaze of torchlight making their way across the intervening ground between the marching camp and the hill fort at a brisk pace the th century dressed in their dark cloaks and without armour or shields slipped in quietly behind the last of the three auxiliary cohorts keeping back far enough to be sure that the torchlight would not betray their presence to any lurking scouts marcus and qadir watched from the darkness behind their comrades as the cohorts paraded for the assault before the hill forts southern rampart the centurions marshalling their men with bellowed orders is it always this way theyre making enough noise to summon the dead from their resting places marcus shook his head despite the darkness no theyre making a special effort to get noticed once the warband have taken the bait we can get moving they waited for a long moment before qadir tugged at his centurions sleeve pointing as vague figures appeared on the wall in the pale golden light of the cohorts torches there on the wall there must be hundreds of them marcus strained his eyes watching as men appeared along the length of the forts southern rampart yes and there will be many more hidden behind the wall a target for every arrow we have and more besides follow me marcus led the th away into the deeper darkness scouting away to the west around the forts curving earth wall moving slowly to ensure that the century stayed together as they crossed the rough ground when he judged the distance they had moved away from the main force was sufficient he stopped the advance with a soft command to qadir and the hamians settled down to wait for the dawn in the distance they could clearly hear the sounds of men being prepared for a fight shouts of command and the occasional blare of a trumpeters horn all the while answered by the harsh cries of the barbarians waiting for them qadir spoke quietly into his ear there must be thousands of the savages to judge from their noise if this goes badly then ours will not be the only lives lost this day i have read about assaults on defended positions like this and i fear your friends will pay a steep price to take that ground marcus nodded into the darkness his face grim as he searched the invisible horizon for any sign of the coming dawn wed best not miss the mark then in the space of two minutes a subtle difference in the sky above the forts earth wall became clear to the waiting soldiers the beginnings of a gentle change of hue in the night sky to the east within another five minutes the first real hint of dawn tinged the slowly retreating darkness with a faint pink hue marcus stared intently up the slope sensing qadir doing the same at his shoulder without having to look round there he followed the other mans pointing arm seeing a silhouette against the faint glow and another the shape of a shaggyhaired warrior moved across the dawns faint glow as he crossed the earth walls surface to speak with the first man spotted they stood facing the south ignoring their guard duty to focus on the likely point of attack qadir murmured quietly into marcuss ear we are still deep in darkness down here so they see nothing and neglect their given task they speak of the fight to come at their front gate and perhaps their desire to be part of that rather than this less than noble duty either that or they wonder if they might still slip away into the dawn unnoticed marcus nodded again can your men take them down with this much light even in the gloom he saw the white of his chosen mans teeth bared in a fierce smile we can but we need better light for the next task besides i expected more than these two a short while longer would be wise i think marcus whispered agreement and the two men waited while the glow of the eastern horizon slowly brightened he was on the verge of ordering the attack when another silhouette climbed up the forts slope seeming to rise up out of the earth in front of them and joined the other two men now clearly outlined against a pink dawn sky he must have been at the foot of the slope perhaps praying silently to his gods marcus snorted mirthlessly emptying his bowels more likely its time another five minutes and theyll have enough light to see us antenoch stay here to guide the ninth century to us once the excitement starts i dont want to risk them missing their way in the dark and leaving us without any means of fighting back if the barbarians get past our arrows qadir nodded muttering a quiet command to the dozen archers he had picked out for this critical first task still indistinct to marcuss eyes their capes merging with the forts deep shadow they nocked arrows to their bows and took up the first slack marcus nodded to his chosen man now pulling back their bowstrings until the weapons made tiny creaking sounds under the strain the archers made the last adjustments to their points of aim waiting for qadirs command the chosen man paused for a long breath to allow them to settle then hissed a terse command the barbarian sentries staggered under the impact of a dozen arrows all three slumping to the ground as the humming note of the bowstrings died away hopefully unheard from within the fort marcus drew his cavalry sword and bounded forward up the slope reaching the top in thirty seconds of scrambling climb then dropped on to his chest and hugged the earth walls parapet alongside the fallen barbarians one of the men was quietly choking on his own blood in the dawns silence his bubbling breaths silenced by a swift stroke of the blade across his throat from the walls vantage point the enemy camp was laid out beneath him their fires still burning across the area enclosed by the circular rampart in the dawns pale light with the sun still below the forested horizon the mass of the enemy gathered paces away on the slope of the hill forts southern wall was an indistinct seething wall of shaggy warriors baying for blood only the warbands front rank was standing on the earth walls parapet presumably to protect the remainder of the warband against the possibility that the legion artillerys bolt throwers might yet make an unwelcome appearance the remainder were gathered in the southern ramparts protection for the time being marcus could clearly hear the shouts of their leaders building their men up for the bloodletting to come and obviously determined to make the invaders pay dearly for every foot gained scanning the wall to the east and south he quickly spotted the expected groups of sentries still watching the ground to their front clearly still unaware of the threat to their rear crawling back to the edge of the rampart he beckoned qadir and his selected archers to join him muttering into the big mans ear i need you to take down the other two groups of sentries he pointed out the fresh targets to qadir who swiftly detailed a target to each of his men but two arrows each may not be enough for a silent kill i suggest you bring up the rest of the century and have them ready to start shooting the second the sentries are down qadir nodded and waved the rest of the century forward to just below the ramparts lip grim faced they nocked arrows and held their bows pointing downwards ready to lift draw and shoot marcus looked at qadir one last time ready the chosen man nodded shoot qadir jerked a hand forward to unleash his picked marksmens arrows the sentries fell under the hamians volley one man clearly attempting to call out a warning despite his wounds but the clamour of both the waiting cohorts and the warbands imprecations drowned out his efforts long enough for another arrow to slam into his back and drop him face down on to the walls dried mud as the sentries fell the remainder of the ths men scrambled up the last few paces of climb quickly forming two lines with their bows held ready to shoot every one of them now staring at qadir in readiness for his order without waiting for permission qadir spread his arms to indicate that the whole century was to shoot then pivoted to point at the mass of warriors unwittingly waiting under the threat of their bows the hamians first volley of arrows arced down on to the unsuspecting barbarians out of the dark western sky dozens of men fell some dead before they hit the ground but most of them screaming out their sudden agony as the barbed iron slammed deep into their heads necks and chests even as the first victims reeled under the shock of impact another volley punched down into their ranks taking a fresh toll of their strength as the archers still uncomprehending victims fell with blood frothing from their horrific wounds marcus grinned wolfishly pointing at the enemy warriors with his cavalry sword keep them shooting pour it on qadir nodded without taking his eyes off the target as he nocked another arrow and sent it into the warbands screaming mass shouting to his men to rain arrows on to the stilldefenceless barbarians marcuss eyes sought and found the ths trumpeter sound the advance blow man blow as the sweet notes of the call to advance sounded above the warbands howls he drew his short gladius and held it alongside the longer cavalry weapon testing the weight and balance of the blades in readiness for what he knew must come soon enough already the warbands rear ranks were struggling to regain some semblance of order those men with shields sheltering behind them as best they could while fighting their way through the human wreckage of the ths stricken victims a lone warrior broke away from the pack and sprinted towards the archers with his shield held close to his body followed over the next few seconds by several more the mens swords glinting in the dawns pale light as they charged across the gap between the hamians and their targets in a growing tide of fury marcus turned back to find qadir still pulling arrows from his quiver and loosing them into the warband with impressive speed keep shooting ill deal with anyone that gets through the chosen man nodded grimly lowering his bow a fraction to shoot an arrow into the legs of the closest barbarian before shouting a command over his shoulder front rank target the runners rear rank keep shooting as marcus watched his swords raised in their familiar stance with the blade points level the front rank took aim at their attackers and loosed a volley of arrows that dropped half of them with head and leg injuries a warrior who had been brave enough to attack without the protection of a shield reeled under the impact of half a dozen arrows and toppled to the ground without ever breaking stride his legs kicking even as he sprawled full length in bloodslickened grass even with half the century now focused on their defence they were still shooting hundreds of arrows into the defenceless warband every minute giving the cohorts priceless moments of opportunity to smash through their defence of the hill forts walls you the trumpeter jerked his eyes from the charging barbarians and on to his centurion with a guilty start keep sounding the advance if they break through to the archers you will drop that horn pull your sword and defend them to the death the other man nodded jerkily putting the trumpet back to his lips and drawing breath marcus turned back to their attackers judging that the survivors had closed to within thirty paces he shouted over his shoulder to qadir over the trumpeters renewed efforts readying himself for the first clash im going down on to the dance floor to try my luck try not to shoot me what the chosen man paused in midshot as his centurion stepped down the earth wall and out into the space between the front rank and the charging barbarians fewer with each volley that ripped at their tattered ranks but gathering strength with every second as more men fought their way out of the warbands milling chaos to run towards the ths position on the earth wall he drew the arrow back to the limit of the weapons capacity forcing his strength into its stressed woodandbone frame waited a second to allow his target to run on to the point of aim then loosed the missile into the warriors face at less then twenty paces skimming the arrows point across the top of the barbarians shield and squarely through one eye socket the tribesman spun to the ground with the arrows immense impact only half of the shaft protruding from his otherwise undamaged face marcus forced his fascinated attention from qadirs victim to the nextclosest attacker watching as two then three arrows slammed into the mans shield heavy iron heads punching through the layered wood with ease at such close range the warriors arm was probably pinned to his board by at least one of the arrows his blood flowing down the inner bowl but from the wideeyed rage contorting the mans features it wasnt going to hamper the damage he would do if he fought his way through to the hamians another arrow slammed through the attackers calf but he staggered on charging towards the centurion with his long sword sweeping down in a vicious blow at the unshielded officer marcus stepped to one side with an easy grace caught the barbarians blade with his own longbladed spatha and steered it away to his right pushing his attackers right arm across his body to open up his unshielded right side before stepping in fast hooking his shortbladed gladius round to punch hard into the warriors ribs then straightening to shrug the grievously wounded man off his blade another man charged in to attack him from the left too close for marcus to reorient himself in time but giving him enough time to see the pair of arrows protruding from the warriors left shoulder the limb would be pinned in place by the arrows unyielding intrusion useless for anything better than holding the mans shield in place diving to the ground he scythed the spatha in under the shields immobile defence severed the warriors calf muscle and rolled back on to his feet leaving the staggering cripple to the hamians bows a flight of arrows whipped past marcus and into the oncoming barbarians close enough that he heard the breathy whistle of the closest as it flicked past his ear several more tribesmen went down with wounds to their heads and legs but enough had survived to narrow his eyes in calculation as to which would be his next combat the two leading runners made his mind up for him drawn to his crosscrested helmets dull shine in the early morning sun one of the pair a split second in front of his companion with his eyes fixed wide in the fierce joy of combat marcuss thrown gladius spun one precisely judged revolution through the dawns chill air before embedding itself in his throat and dropping him choking into the dewsoaked grass parrying the other mans sword blow with the blade of his spatha the centurion dropped to one knee to grasp his fallen comrades long sword by its carved bone hilt lifting it to deflect the warriors next attack before jabbing the spathas blade up into his attackers jaw after an instant of resistance the blade penetrated the roof of the barbarians mouth and sank deep into his brain he staggered backwards out of the combat his eyes rolling up as he sagged lifelessly to the ground recovering his footing marcus saw a trio of warriors closing on him fast and beyond them another halfdozen advancing with their shields raised and realised with a sickening lurch that he had allowed the heady exhilaration of combat to put him in extreme danger a fresh wave of energy washed through the young officer as he steadied himself to meet the threat his vision seeming to narrow and darken slightly as his body fed every usable drop of blood to his muscles nostrils flaring to suck in air he rose on to the balls of his feet as if preparing to dance as the first three men charged in to attack the leading warrior made a straightforward lunge with his long sword his eyes widening comically as marcus smashed the blade aside with his lefthand sword then thrust the other into his thigh shifting his weight on to the weapon to force it through the heavy muscles and out of the mans leg in a shower of blood from the severed artery as the wounded man screamed in sudden pain staggering where he stood with one leg unable to support his weight marcus hacked the spatha into the face of the warrior to his right so fast that it was all the man could do to parry the blow upwards leaving himself open to a brutally powerful halffist that ruptured his throat and dropped him choking to the ground marcus hacked at his first victims head with his spatha gripping the sword buried in his leg and kicking the grievously injured warrior backwards to impede the last of the three from bringing his weapon to bear tearing it free as the barbarian fell away from him he ducked reflexively as the last mans sword hacked through the air where his head had been but before he could move to either attack or defend an arrow flicked over his shoulder and buried itself deep in the barbarians ribs the shock dumping the man on to his backside with eyes slitted against the pain stepping swiftly back from the fallen warriors wary of a last desperate knifethrust from one of the wounded he eyed the next wave of attackers with cold calculation where there had been half a dozen only four remained and two of them were limping from arrow wounds but they were still advancing towards him with their shields raised to deflect the continual flicker of hamian arrows others following close behind you might be better off behind this a shield slid into place across his body a strong arm holding the heavy wooden board rock steady marcus didnt need to look around to know who the newcomer was no brother youll need it more than me dubnus chuckled darkly in his ear me ive got another somewhere ah here it is marcus looked round to see a soldier move into position alongside the ths centurion putting his shield across dubnuss body in turn well met scarface although you might be better using that board for your own defence the veteran soldier shook his head solemnly cant do that sir we look after our officers in the fifth century as well you know both past and present and besides marcus grinned wearily the fierce heat of combat seeping out of his body i know youve got a friend or two on the way more of the ths men were pouring over the earth wall ducking through the stillfiring archers to take their place in the shield wall the fourman group of barbarians stopped advancing a dozen feet from the centurys quickly forming line of shields as the numbers facing them tripled in less than ten seconds then started to back away as the full th century mustered in front of the hamians rapping their shields with their spears and shouting insults at the unnerved barbarians marcus spoke without taking his eyes off the scene to their front this could still get ugly if that lot decide to come at us in strength he turned back to find qadir on the wall above him qadir shoot everything youve got left into the warband the ths rate of fire increased the tired archers giving the last of their trembling arm strength to rain their remaining arrows on to the wavering warband with a triumphant bray of trumpets the hill forts southern rampart was suddenly crested by familiar figures the shields and helmets unmistakably roman as the auxiliary cohorts fought their way into the demoralised defence qadir cease firing on the warband selfdefence only even as the bows fell quiet their little part of the battlefield suddenly silent without the incessant twanging of bowstrings the depleted warband broke under a savage frontal assault hundreds of men streaming away from the illmatched fight across ground carpeted with the bodies of the dead and wounded for a moment it appeared as if the remnant of the warband would escape at least as far as the cavalrymen patrolling beyond the forts earth walls but as the tungrians watched the hill forts rim was suddenly lined with the silhouettes of hundreds of soldiers waiting grimly for the tribesmen to attempt a breakout their spears held ready to throw sixth legion dubnus nodded grim assent to marcuss statement and about bloody time seems were taking prisoners after all the routed tribesmen helpless in the face of such overwhelming force threw down their weapons and stood helpless under the legionaries spears legatus equitius came forward with the remainder of the legion later that morning keen to understand just why the warband had been camped in so precarious a position he found the detachment in high spirits and his senior tribune delighted with the result antonius led him across the ground over which the cohorts had trampled earlier that day up the hill forts slope and down into its bowl as they crested the slope the scale of the slaughter became apparent legionaries were toiling to stack the barbarian dead on one side of the fort while the wounded were squatting and lying in even greater numbers on the other equitius stopped to survey the scene how many of them did you kill four hundred and seventyodd dead nearly twice as many wounded and our losses the tribunes smile told him most of the story before he even opened his mouth to reply thirtyfour dead sixtytwo wounded and a dozen of them likely to be dead before nightfall equitius stopped walking and turned to face the tribune his eyebrows raised you killed and wounded twelve hundred barbarians for the loss of less than fifty men i would have expected a nought on the end of our side of that tally how did you manage it antonius smiled modestly i deployed the auxiliaries in front of our own men and assaulted the barbarians in the usual manner with one small variation the tungrian cohort has a doublestrength century of archers and i understanding dawned on equitius ah i see the tungrian archers lets have a look at the wounded shall we they crossed the forts bowl and equitiuss bodyguard fanned out with their swords drawn and shields ready their centurion walking forward with his vine stick under one arm in an obvious show of bravado the wounded had for the most part one feature in common the legatus favoured his deputy with a knowing smile horrible things ironheaded arrows when youre not wearing armour and a decent helmet but lethal if youre caught in the open without a nice thick shield a sound idea antonius very fine work clearly youve been hiding your talents from me these last few months eh antonius thought quickly i cant take all the credit legatus it was prefect scaurus that first mentioned the existence of his archers to me equitius smiled easily quite right tribune credit where its due i stationed men all around the fort once the fight was properly started took almost three hundred prisoners you took prisoners the tribune gave his superior a careful glance i thought youd want to know what they were doing here so i took the liberty equitius nodded his agreement where are they ive got a couple of centuries guarding them back at the camp sir i thought it best to separate them from their wounded given that were treating them in the usual manner equitius nodded again battlefield rules yes sir the senior centurions are making the assessments given that weve got such a small number of wounded the legion medics are getting plenty of arrow removal practice on the easier cases but anyone that wont be able to walk away from here is being taken over the forts wall and put to the sword equitius shrugged watching another seriously wounded man being carried up the earth wall by a pair of legionaries theyre all going to die whether now or later and now id best get over to your camp yes sir youll be wanting to question their leader you got their chieftain alive well well tribune in the words of a legatus i served under on the german border its as good to be lucky as it is to be good and you young man having called down the iron rain on these poor fools and still pulled their leader unharmed from the wreckage you can truly consider yourself to be a lucky man yes i very much want to meet the murdering bastard but before i do ive a more important appointment to keep equitius strode into scauruss tent fifteen minutes later to find prefect and first spear waiting for him gentlemen you knew i was coming the prefect smiled tightly tapping his right ear its not hard to guess when a senior officer is likely to appear through the tent flap when one can hear a succession of centurions shouting at their men to stand to attention all the time getting steadily closer it was either going to be you legatus or the governor and ulpius marcellus isnt one for venturing out into the camp the legatus smiled wryly very clever nearly as clever as that trick you pulled on those poor barbarians you had young tribulus corvus and his syrians use for target practice this morning my broad stripe had a decent go at taking credit for the idea cheeky young sod but it was pretty evident he wouldnt even have known you had any archers on the payroll much less that theyre led by a man who cant be allowed out into the countryside without him finding some novel way of bringing death to the bluenoses he caught the look in scauruss eye you look less than happy prefect am i to presume that im aware of your little secret with regard to my officer legatus that i have already sought to minimise his exposure to those people likely to be looking for him or perhaps that im just a little concerned that this latest success necessary though it was for the survival of my command will bring the interest of the wrong people down on us all like flies on fresh shit that would be yes to all three sir equitius turned away hiding a momentary smile so youve already taken young corvus under your wing eh prefect and why would that be when everyone from the governor down tells me that youre as straight as the road from dark pool to the banks of the river abus youre supposed to be imperial through and through prefect so why dirty your hands with our fugitives sordid scrabblings to avoid justice eh scaurus put both hands on his hips his tongue played on his bottom lip as he judged the right answer to give to a man who was for all the tension in the air still his superior why legatus because i see myself in him and if you want to see behind that statement youll be a long time waiting that and the persuasive case my first spear made for the mans capacity for battle hes simply worth saving eh prefect those were the words that came to me when i asked myself what in hades i was doing sheltering him from the thrones hunting dogs while i was in your shoes but now we have a larger problem than our own ability to combine our obedience to the empire with loyalty to our ideals do we not scaurus nodded unhappily indeed we do theres a man less than two hundred paces from here who hates my guts with a passion i doubt either of you can comprehend and who has a very good idea that tribulus corvus has found refuge with this cohort i can assure you that for all the imperial favour that unearthing such a fugitive would bring him it would give him nowhere near as much enjoyment as seeing me unmasked as his protector the cohort awoke to mist and drizzle the next morning took a hasty breakfast and prepared to stand to in the grey morning light marcus dressed in his tent attended by antenoch and a sleepy lupus tucking his tunic into his woollen campaign trousers the garment was a comfort permitted by the first spear only when the cohort was in the field late in the campaign season a time of the year known for its wind and sudden rain ill never get used to wearing these blasted itchy things all those years reading that trousers are the mark of the barbarian and suddenly i cant go outdoors in anything other than high summer or whatever passes for summer here without them antenoch muttered his response into the pile of his officers equipment i can see how your delicate legs would enjoy the protection centurion would you like the leg wrappings too a look passed between them and marcus snorted gently a halfsmile creasing his face dont mock the afflicted clerk and pass me those socks and my boots he tugged the heavy woollen socks into place tucking their open ends under his feet as he laced up his polished hobnailed boots streaks of mud decorated their gleaming leather betraying the lack of any attention the previous evening well move this morning antenoch brushed an errant horsehair back into place in marcuss helmet crest and placed it on his bedroll you dont get this many troops in one place without the boys in bronze wanting to march them aimlessly round the countryside its their way of convincing themselves that theyre doing something meaningful marcus pulled on his padded leather arming vest meant to protect the wearers flesh from being cut by his mails rings if they were struck by sword or spear carefully pulling it straight to ensure that it wouldnt wrinkle and chafe under the armour theres still a warband out there or perhaps youd forgotten that well be advancing to make contact with the enemy his clerk snorted ill put down ten to your five that our glorious leaders dont have the first clue where the bluenoses are hiding somewhere in the forests to the northeast is about the limit of their intelligence so once again well get to go and find them the hard way under the pretence of scouting to the flanks lupus help me with the centurions mail he lifted the heavy mail shirt over marcuss head and pulled it down on to the leather arming vest while lupus pulled the mails hem down his thighs to ensure its close fit to his shoulders antenoch rubbed a finger at the rings across one shoulder holding his hand out to the child dirty you were supposed to brush and polish this shirt before bed last night you idle little bugger you want me to send the centurion on parade in dirty armour he reached for the soft brush and set about the rings with vigour the swift strokes shaking the uncomplaining marcus from side to side as he raised an eyebrow at an unabashed lupus antenoch clipped the back of the childs head with his open palm you leave this dirty another night this month and you can kiss your purse money goodbye whats that starting guiltily the redfaced boy repeated his muttered comment aloud i said theres nothing to spend it on anyway antenoch snorted welcome to my army you dozy little sod of course theres nothing to spend it on this is a fighting cohort on campaign not a tour of the walls honeycake stalls and while were at it i can see mud spots on those boots the centurion can see them too but hes too polite to mention it he shot a hand out and grabbed the boys ear twisting it painfully and pulling the child close to his face you can consider this your administrative punishment next time itll be loss of pay and privileges for you my lad now off with you and find your grandad make sure hes ready for parade and bring him here lupus ran from the tent clutching his reddened ear marcus raised an eyebrow pass my belt and baldrics youre too hard on the boy antenoch shrugged passing over marcuss officers heavy belt and sword harnesses and youre all too soft on him youre too nice morbans too busy being his grandfather and the rest of the troops treat him more like a mascot than a kid with a need for discipline someones got to act like a father for him and in the absence of anyone else he raised an eyebrow at marcus inviting further comment but none was forthcoming after an uncomfortable pause the officer held out a hand helmet please thank you the centurion pulled his helmet on tightening the leather chin strap and looking around him looking for this antenoch held out the thick knobbly vine stick and marcus took it rotating it unconsciously until his thumb found its accustomed resting place in a small indentation youre right as it happens we do spoil the boy in our own ways i suppose were all trying to compensate him for the roll of the dice hes had to endure in the last few months i take your point though and ill try to be a bit more like an officer with him and a bit less like he fell silent and antenoch nodded his understanding his face softening his older brother dont change a thing centurion ill make sure that the troops give him a bit of a harder time starting with that old bugger morban you just teach him how to throw iron around the way that you do and leave the tough stuff to the rest of us marcus nodded his eyes momentarily far away then gathered himself and turned stepping out into the mornings murk calling for qadir antenoch turned his attentions to packing away the centurions gear muttering quietly in the tents silence no dont change a thing centurion being his older brother might help keep you the right side of sane given all thats happened in the last few months late in the afternoon of the day after the battle of the hill fort the th legion rejoined the th having completed their sweep of the ground to the south of the wall bringing with them the governor and his staff shortly after their arrival the votadini chieftain was escorted into the governors presence by the leader of equitiuss bodyguard a pair of soldiers with drawn swords guarding against the unlikely chance of his being able to shed the coils of thick rope that bound him so tightly it was all he could do to walk unaided his face was badly bruised testament to the harsh treatment he had received from his guards since being captured men incensed by the massacre of the frisian cohort ulpius marcellus raised an eyebrow at equitius do we really need the swords legatus even ignoring my unlikely contribution there are two legates half a dozen prefects and the same number of tribunes facing this one prisoner who i am forced to note is trussed up with enough rope to restrain a prizewinning ox what are your men going to do cut his throat if he hops towards me in a threatening manner equitius nodded his agreement making a subtle gesture to his stonyfaced guard commander who with a look that spoke volumes ordered the two soldiers out of the tent the governor leaned closer to the helpless prisoner thats better who can focus when theres sharpened iron six inches from the back of his neck eh so whatever your name is do you speak any latin the prisoner nodded his battered face defiant i am martos sisters son to king brennus of the votadini and i speak your language well enough in the time before this war my tribe was a friend to your people ulpius marcellus leant back in his chair resting his chin on his hand yes i know i was governor of this country for four years and i came to know your tribal king brennus tolerably well youll probably be aware that were still in communication with him of a sort and that weve offered him peace if he can deliver us this upstart calgus in return i would have thought that a decent enough bargain but now i find your people implicated in a fresh atrocity against our forces i know you took part in the attack on white strength so dont think to attempt to mislead me on the subject he stared unblinkingly at the prisoner whose shoulders slumped at the accusation we fought at white strength calgus he lied to you made you believe that you could succeed your uncle under his guidance that you would be a strong man if you helped him to victory martos nodded his eyes on the ground so your men led the attack on the fort am i right another nod and how many of your warriors died breaking into the fort and putting the garrison to the sword five hundred the reply was almost a whisper more probably twice that many legatus macrinus spoke up with your permission governor youre telling us that you sacrificed nearly half your strength to buy this calgus a victory and that in return he had you and your men dumped right in the path of our cavalry response you want us to believe that hed be willing to throw away so much of his strength to achieve a meaningless tactical victory and then pull the fangs from what was left of an unreliable allys dissent hed have to be mad to be so profligate with his strength unless martos lifted his gaze to meet the romans his confidence returning yes unless he has more strength than youre aware of spare my life and i will tell you everything i know kill me and i will take secrets to my grave that might cost you this war the governor scoffed waving away the suggestion spare your life when i can interrogate any number of your men and discover everything i need to know without having to consort with a man that put an entire cohort of good men to the sword and then desecrated their corpses why dont you just ask me to name you emperor martos kept his gaze fixed on the governor i was close to calgus for long enough to know more about his schemes than he was willing to reveal to me i overheard snatches of conversation i was never meant to witness and i saw things that were meant to stay between calgus and the men close to him and ill make you one firm vow if you free me and enough of my people to stand around me in battle i will hunt down calgus for you and bring you his head i will swear an oath to any god you care to name to take vengeance for the lies and disaster that he has brought down on my people ulpius marcellus thought for a moment his eyes narrowed have this man taken away legatus i think any debate on the subject should be private the stonyfaced centurion marched the bound prisoner from the tent leaving the romans looking at each other equitius broke the silence shaking his head gently with wonder i met calgus just before they attacked my cohort at lost eagle and i knew then that he was a cunning bastard but this is simply beyond my understanding leading an entire tribes remaining strength into our path to cement his power over the others thats more than just a bold step whos to say there isnt more in his plan that we have yet to discover the hard way another lost eagle might cost us this war possibly even this province we all know that the governor raised an eyebrow are you suggesting that we do as this murdering barbarian requests legatus give the man his freedom and let him vanish into the depths of the wild country escaping the justice that should already have his head on a stake outside this tent prefect scaurus spoke into the silence that followed his voice quiet and yet clear demanding to be heard despite the absence of drama in his tone considering what the votadini have been through its at least worthy of consideration governor he continued not waiting for permission lets say they lost a thousand men at white strength we killed another five hundred or so breaking into the hill fort and theres probably the same number of wounded that wont fight again for a few months even if they werent badly enough hurt to rate the legions gladius solution what does that leave two hundred warriors two hundred and fifty calgus has already betrayed martos once so if he were to come back from the dead with that small a force id say the odds are excellent that the lord of the northern tribes having already told his men some story or other about how the votadini have betrayed them all will have his men put them to the iron without a second thought he stood silently for a moment allowing his words to sink in theres another point worth considering as well governor before the war the land between the two walls was divided roughly into two parts not equal but very distinct nonetheless to the west living under the control of thousands of our troops were the selgovae novantae and damnonii forever testing our strength with ambushes and skirmishes a posting up the north road was no cause for celebration for any soldier i ever discussed the matter with to the east on the other hand were the votadini compare and contrast gentlemen there were no forts on their territory no requirement to control the tribes gatherings and no need to tie down thousands of our men in static positions that would make them a target for every disaffected young blood with a point to prove i think the main question should be how we want this land of theirs to be governed after the war do we want to put four or five thousand more troops on to votadini land with all of the problems we always had with the western tribes or would we prefer to take things back to the way they were the governor nodded glancing at his legates for their opinion your point prefect is well made i can take quick and satisfying revenge on this man and the survivors of his warband such as they are or i can play the politician and spare him with his support and friendship the price i exact in return opinions scaurus glanced around him taking the measure of his seniors reaction apart from furiuss grim face most of the men in the room looked thoughtful the th legions legatus spoke up his lips pursed i dislike the idea of allowing this man his freedom when he should by rights cough out his last breaths on a cross but he shrugged shooting an appraising glance at scaurus the prefect does makes a persuasive case i would recommend a subtly different approach however reprieve the man by all means but dont allow him to run free in fact i say we keep him close his men will make excellent guides as we push northwards into the hills and when the time comes you can slip their collars and send them after calgus when he least expects it in fact once hes unburdened himself of these hints and whispers he says he can recount to us i commend you to put his men under the stewardship of young scaurus here he can worry about liberating his kingdom once calguss head is on the pole in place of his own scaurus hadnt seen his first spear so much as irritated during their brief association so the experience of triggering incandescent anger in the man engendered something between exhilaration and genuine fear i dont give a fuck what the governor said frontinius put his pointed index finger squarely in his superiors face his hold on a temper of glacial slowness but volcanic ferocity completely lost you can tell him that there is no fucking way that an assorted collection of barbarian murderers are going to find a place in my cohort scaurus raised an eyebrow apparently hugely amused by the other mans rage thats odd first spear i could have sworn it was mine frontinius ignored the wry question too far gone in his uncontrollable anger those bastards should all have been beheaded the second it was proved they took part in the white strength massacre that theyre still breathing is bad enough but for the senior soldier in the whole of britannia to ask us to take them on he spread his hands wide frustration written across his face what does he think we are what does he think i am i served with their first spear he was a soldier with this cohort for a couple of years until the frisians needed some replacements scaurus shook his head decisively one word rapping out across his subordinates diatribe enough the senior centurion raised his head at the sudden harshness in his superiors tone finding the prefects face set with an implacability equal to his own he drew breath to speak but the words were unformed when scaurus moved from his place by the tents field table putting his face uncomfortably close to the first spears features set in a snarl of anger the match of his subordinates and more i said enough and youd better appreciate something that you might not have been faced with for a while first spear i am your fucking superior officer frontinius flinched at the sudden venom in his superiors voice when i give you an order you may seek to debate its merits you may tell me that you dont especially like it but you will carry it out as completely and effectively as if it were you own idea and for my part while i will listen to your views both seek and respect your opinions i will eventually issue commands that i believe to be correct given my understanding of the overall situation which may well surpass yours as for your questions let me sum it up for you by answering just one of them what does the governor think you are the governor thinks youre a soldier of rome sworn to follow the instructions of your superiors no matter what you may think of those orders his voice softened slightly the governor sextus frontinius believes you to be a professional a career soldier with the ability to bury your distaste for this order and ensure that your people bury theirs alongside it weve been chosen quite deliberately for this duty first spear and its a responsibility i neither can nor would seek to avoid whats left of the votadini warband marches with us when we leave here tomorrow whether we like it or not the tungrians paraded the next morning with more than one man staring open mouthed at the motley collection of votadini warriors drawn up in three rough lines alongside their prefect and first spear soldiers nudged each other in the ranks and shared whispered speculation as to the reasons why the survivors of the battle of the hill fort might be parading in front of them perhaps were going to put them to the sword you know for white strength morban turned a withering glare on the th centurys trumpeter do they look like theyre ready to be slaughtered you prick theyre all armed for a start a man in the centurys front rank spoke up in the silence that followed perhaps they join cohort like us morban spluttered with poorly restrained mirth his gaze fixed on the barbarians oh fuck me thats even better yes thats right were going to take a pack of untrained murdering barbarian halfwits into an infantry cohort why didnt i think of it sooner tell you what ahmad or whatever your name is ill give you twenty to one on that no fuck it ill make that fifty i take bet standardbearer onedenarius stake easy money the trumpeter still red faced from his earlier rebuff opened his mouth to speak and no you fucking cant have some of that now shut it uncle sextus is about to let us in on whats going on the tungrian cohorts marched to the southwest along the line of the foothills for the first two hours after breaking camp and wading across the ford a dozen message riders from the petriana wing walking their horses alongside the marching soldiers the votadini warriors almost two hundred and fifty men strong walked to either side of the lead century their leader silent and uncommunicative in their midst the tungrians and their new comrades eyed each other unhappily from time to time neither side capable of trusting the other given their recent history as the day wore on towards midmorning the troops started to sweat under their heavy cloaks and the order was given for both cloaks and helmets to be removed and the latter to be hung around their necks take your cloak off boy roll it up and put it in your pack let the wind get to your skin and youll soon be comfortable again lupus followed antenochs example watching as the clerk bundled his own cloak into his pack ready to be hoisted on to his carrying pole once the rest stop was done antenoch yes why cant i have a sword youve got a sword whats that in your belt the boy frowned not a wooden sword a real one glaring a warning at the nearest soldiers antenoch unsheathed his gladius and handed it to the child handle first take a grip of that no dont wave the bloody thing around just hold it for a moment see heavy isnt it the boy shrugged his eyes fixed on the weapons blade as it weaved unsteadily in his hand not really i could carry it everyone else has got one well what if were attacked how am i supposed to fight without a sword the clerk looked to the sky seeking inspiration that clearly wasnt coming an th century soldier nudged him quietly displaying a short dagger under the cover of his cloak and raising an eyebrow antenoch frowned raised an eyebrow of his own and tilted his head to the child the hamian nodded encouragingly how much to you ten denarii to the boy is gift lupus watched the two men uncomprehendingly a gift antenochs eyes narrowed why you fancy him or something the other man laughed no i do not like boys is simply gift you were never boy eh you never wanted knife shiny and sharp antenoch held his stare for a moment then shouted up the length of the centurys column of relaxing men morban the standardbearer stayed seated at the centurys head raising his head what you all right if lupus has a knife the answer took a split seconds thought how much antenoch rolled his eyes muttering to himself fuck me not do you think hes old enough but how much thats our morban its a gift course he can if its free dont ask stupid questions antenoch rolled his eyes at the hamian muttering a quiet insult tightarse he turned back to the boy who having realised the subject of the discussion was wide eyed with anticipation the sword dangling forgotten in his hands ill tell you what young lupus ill make you a deal here give me that back the child reluctantly held the gladius out watching hungrily as it slid back into antenochs scabbard heres the deal you keep the centurions boots gleaming no mud marks and you polish his armour every night without fail and you get to hold on to this he took the dagger from the hamian and held it up for the child to see sliding the small blade from its sheath he put a finger gingerly to the blades silver line as it flashed in the mornings brightness cocidius but its sharp the weapons donor smiled happily no point in blunt knife no point see the briton raised both eyebrows in protest yes thank you for proving conclusively that the old ones are indeed the old ones so boy the knife stays yours just as long as you do your jobs properly the first time i find either his boots or armour including his helmet dirty when were dressing him in the morning the knife goes straight back to whats your name the hamian bowed his head in greeting touching a hand to his forehead i am hamid to your new uncle hamid deal yes good put the sheath on your belt like this see the child stared happily at the knife resting at his hip putting one hand on the handle in a selfconscious pose never mind posing for the sculptor say thanks to uncle hamid here for being so generous the hamian struggled to stay upright as lupus wrapped his arms round his neck thanks uncle hamid now off with you up the column go and show your grandad your new weapon oh he arrested the childs departure with a swift grab at his belt and one more thing no messing about with it right no throwing it no cutting your initials into trees and no trying to cut your hair either i catch you mucking about with that or hear about it from anyone else youll lose the knife and you wont get it back you want to be a soldier youd better learn to behave like one go lupus ran happily up the centurys length shouting to his grandfather antenoch settled back on his elbows puffing out a sigh and shaking his head slightly with a halfsmile i dont know where the childs energy comes from he held out a hand to the hamian thanks hamid that was decent of you the other man shrugged he good boy we all been young wanted knife he been unlucky we hear give him little happiness eh antenoch nodded besides his grandfather foolish enough to make me large bet this morning he already paid for knife ah that was you was it well it was still kind of you here he delved into his bag and pulled out a small paper parcel passing it over to the hamian i was saving this to share with the boy later but i think hed rather have the knife cake honey cake good too go on get it down your neck before were on the move again i cant see the boys in the shiny armour waiting very long before getting us on our feet again the mornings too good to waste when theres still a long way to go to the river farther up the column the barbarian warriors were sitting in a tight group close to dubnuss th century the two groups exchanging wary glances after a few minutes dubnus sighed told his chosen man to keep an eye on things and got to his feet walking across to the votadini group hundreds of soldiers watched his move with mixed feelings one of them nudging his mate and pointing at the young centurion fuck me the prince is going for a chat with them frontinius overheard the comment and swivelled from his discussion with scaurus taking in his centurions approach to the diminished warbands leader standing in front of the squatting votadini nobleman he put out a hand you must be martos my name is dubnus formerly a prince of the brigantes people and now a soldier of rome if we are to walk these hills in company we might as well be on speaking terms the words hung in the air for a long moment as martos looked the centurion up and down with blankfaced neutrality before returning his gaze to the outstretched hand well dubnus former prince of the brigantes he took the offered hand using it to pull himself to his feet face to face the two men were well matched both powerfully muscled from years of wielding their heavy weapons their faces dark from the continual exposure to the elements and their stances confident in their ability to best any man put in front of them it seems we have something in common you and i for i am a former prince of the votadini now reduced to running with the very wolves we sought to drive from our land he stared hard at the centurion waiting for any sign of offence to his surprise dubnus merely smiled grimly oh yes i know that feeling and yet i have made my peace with these people and turned my sword arm to their purpose will you walk alongside me when we rejoin the march perhaps we can offer each other some conversation of interest martos nodded slowly i will i might better understand what put you in that uniform frontinius watched as the two men nodded to each other and returned to their respective sides of the divide between the tungrians and votadini of all my officers it would be dubnus to make the first move he turned to find scaurus with a quizzical look on his face im forgetting you dont know the man the centurion in question was tribal nobility south of the wall before he joined the cohort perhaps he understands what your man martos is feeling in this situation better than the man himself and perhaps we start to see the method in our governors apparent madness eh first spear frontinius snorted and turned away calling the cohort back on to its feet for the march but scaurus had seen the thoughtful look on his face and stood waiting for the march to resume with a quiet smile the two cohorts marched at the standard campaign pace for most of the morning skirting along the edge of the mountains in bright sunshine from their path along the mountains outskirts two and three hundred feet above the plain they could see the main body of the army the two legions were marching alongside the river as it snaked across the valley and a mile beyond their columns the two cohorts thrown out as guards on the right flank clung to the low slopes of the hills to the south dubnus and martos walked together between the th century and the votadini remnant deep in conversation speaking in their own language their initial diffidence had quickly been forgotten as the barriers of their respective causes fell under their mutual curiosity so i had little choice once my father was gone i knew that going back to my own people would see me dead inside a day besides he made me swear to go to the romans as he lay dying martos nodded solemnly such an oath cannot be denied once made aye it was hard for me here at first even if uncle sextus he caught the britons uncomprehending frown sorry first spear frontinius only he was a centurion at the time had made a promise to my father to take me in the men that commanded this cohort then did all they could to break me he smiled the formal beatings never really bothered me and they stopped the informal beatings after i got tired of defending myself and put three men in the forts hospital for a month after that things just settled down and we all got used to each other mind you i still wouldnt be an officer today if it werent for a ro for a man that joined us a few months ago but thats another story and you how do you come to be walking into danger alongside us instead of waiting for us with your comrades martos recounted the story of his desire to supplant his uncle the king and the subsequent betrayal by calgus his voice bitter with the recent memory i was a fool and nothing less i should have stood by my king but my head was turned by calgus and his promises that i would return to my tribal lands in victory and as his closest ally his voice fell the words so soft that dubnus strained to hear them i wanted to be king and all i achieved was the massacre of my warriors and the destruction of our family my king is probably dead by now and calgus will send one of his trusted men north to rule my kingdom my children will be put to death and my woman will either be killed or more likely made a toy for the new leaders men he stared out over the plain below them in silence for a moment before speaking again his voice stronger all these things will happen theres no way to prevent them but i tell you this centurion dubnus i will have revenge on that slimy piece of shit that calls himself lord of the northern tribes i will twist his guts in my hand and tear them from his body and i will fill his clever mouth with his torn manhood before i allow him to die either that or i will die with my sword thick with his mens blood i have sworn this and my warriors have sworn to follow me to either victory or death dubnus smiled darkly and such an oath cannot be denied once made i wish you well in your quest for revenge and given the chance i would count myself honoured to fight alongside you i too have a score to settle with calgus the other man gave him a scornful look you think well be allowed to fight in your line i doubt it centurion our ways are too different and i doubt that were trusted even half well enough for such an honour dubnus nodded ignoring the bitter tone in the other mans voice true enough but were not like them he pointed down at the two legions grinding their way across the plain below them they fight in a ponderous fashion much as they move across the land their movements cautious and measured always seeking to bring their swords and shields to bear on the right ground we on the other hand are faster across ground and while we can fight their way we can also take our iron to the enemy with speed and stealth your chance to fight alongside us may come sooner than you think after the midday rest stop tribune scaurus and the first spear walked down the cohort to meet up with furius and neuto at the head of the second cohort the votadini say its time to turn north and get up the mountain a fair way if were going to keep scouting along the mountain flanks apparently well have to cross the red river about ten miles from here and the only good ford is above a waterfall up in the hills furius grimaced i still dont like following these savages off into the wild for all we know theres a fucking great warband waiting for us up there well be cut off from the main body probably out of sight too scaurus nodded in apparent sympathy i know if its any consolation i dont think these men will lead us astray their hunger for revenge on calgus is too strong furius snorted a view based on your long experience of dealing with the locals eh rutilius scaurus scaurus leaned closer to furius lowering his voice you know gracilus furius one of these days youre going to make one thoughtless remark too many for your own good as it happens i do know much more about this country and its people than most people appreciate and while there are some very good reasons why i intend keeping it that way im happy to tell you this in my opinion martos doesnt intend us ill call it instinct or call it the very simple fact that he has the strongest possible motivation for guiding us to the right place either way i dont think hell be selling us out so i suggest that we show some balls and get on with it before our subordinates start wondering if were just a little bit lacking in eagerness to do our jobs he turned away without waiting for an answer from his astonished colleague first spear frontinius lets have the first tungrian back on their feet and ready to march please well camp beside this ford for the night and head off into the wild tomorrow morning the afternoons march was harder on the troops than the mornings progress the late summer sun beating down on them without interruption and by the time the river came into view their tunics were wet with sweat beneath their mail armour frontinius knew that every man in the cohort was looking at the clear cold water flowing down from the mountains above them with something close to desperation he paraded them with their backs to the water raising his voice to be heard above the rivers rippling cascade down its rocky bed and the thunder of its fiftyfoot drop over the falls a hundred paces farther downstream the nd cohort formed up alongside them their first spear gesturing to him to brief both cohorts as to their previously agreed course of action first and second cohorts you will dump your kit in the places where your tents will be pitched once the walls built you can have a drink from your water bottles if youve got any left and then get on with building the turf wall if you have no water left he paused to gauge how many of them were straining to hear the next words then you are an idiot and will go thirsty until the wall is up to the satisfaction of myself and my brother officers each cohort will build one long and two short sides to the camp and link up in the standard twocohort pattern lots have been drawn and the guard centuries will be the third and eighth centuries of both cohorts which was fortunate given that the hamians still had little talent for cutting turf to the right dimensions or placing it to form a strong wall and were little better than porters for the cut turf when the turf wall is complete both cohorts will use the river to wash two centuries at a time in strict lottery order and for the length of a fivehundred count the guard centuries will patrol the area to ensure that we dont get any nasty surprises and will wash and eat last all centurions to first spear neuto for camp layout and guard duties centurions tertius and corvus to me please soldiers to your duties the parade broke up into the usual purposeful chaos of campbuilding the centuries streaming away to their allotted sections of the earth wall marcus told his men to wait where they stood and hurried across to the first spear who was giving instructions to a pair of message riders who were to ride out and find the legions and deliver the customary report as to the cohorts position to the governor the two centurions nodded their greeting to each other as frontinius turned back to them this country should be empty of any barbarian forces since were supposed to have them penned up to the northeast but you can consider me as sceptical as ever when it comes to the words should be so centurions youre going to scout the vicinity and tell me what you can see tertius youre going to take your boys across the river and see whats over the next hill cautiously though i dont want to advertise that were here centurion corvus you can do some climbing too go to the top of that hill behind us and take a good look around dismissed the two centurions saluted shared another brief nod and headed away to their men gathering the th marcus pointed up the hill to the camps west its slopes rising steeply from the riverbank to a rounded summit high above the ford were going up there chosen well leave our shields here with a tent party to watch over them tell them i want every one of them washed clean by the time we come down again just in case they think theyve drawn easy duty the century started to climb at first grumbling quietly at the renewed exercise but then as the view below them expanded with their progress up the slope and as the cooling breeze dried their sweat with less complaining and more chatter about what they could see from their elevated viewpoint after a few minutes of climbing marcus stopped for a moment taking a deep breath to slow down his racing heart qadir following close behind him took the opportunity to pause in his turn this is harder work than i expected marcus nodded pointing down at the marching camp yes but look at the view see theres my old century toiling away at the anklebreaker ankle breaker sorry i dont suppose youre familiar with our terms its a ditch that is dug all the way around a marching camp if time allows and the spoil is thrown to the inside of the ditch to form the basis for the turf wall its called the anklebreaker because the sides are cut straight and at least two feet deep if you fall into it in the darkness youll almost certainly break your ankle we havent bothered with it until now not with two legions within earshot but now that were well and truly alone out here its a necessity his chosen man nodded gazing down at the labouring troops i see and you know they are your former troops because ah thats easy i can see dubnus striding round and shouting at the idlers there see add to that the fact that there seem to be a gang of barbarians carrying turf for him qadir nodded should we perhaps resume our climb some of the men are already close to the top marcus turned back to look up the hill gods below you lot might not like marching but give you a peak to climb the view from the top of the hill was worth the climb down in the valley below they could see some of tertiuss men working their way up the hill on the far side of the river while other tent parties had split off to left and right to follow the line of the river to north and south the marching camp was already half built its wall casting an appreciable shadow in the late afternoon sunshine the land was pretty much bare of any vegetation bigger than small bushes except for a number of trees scattered down both banks of the red river to the south of the falls to the north and west were rolling hilltops of much the same height although a succession of gradually higher peaks rose towards the highest of all a good ten miles distant to the east the southern slope of the hill facing the ford ended abruptly in a nearvertical drop thats interesting marcus pointed down at the river see theres a shelf of hard rock running through the hillside thats what makes the waterfall so tall this side of the river its hidden under the ground but on the other side of the river its been uncovered he stared down at the seam of rock running away into the distance to the south of the outcrop was gently sloping land seamed by tributary streams of the red you know that makes the riverbank below the falls much easier to defend it would take a good while to get a body of men down that rock face to the far bank its steep enough to make for a slow climb and far too tall to jump yes but look over there marcus followed qadirs pointing finger off to the east almost at the limit of visibility a line of smoke was rising from a valley three or four peaks away might that be the barbarian camp marcus nodded id guess so and if we can see that they turned to the southeast taking in the view down the red rivers valley far away down on the flat land out of the hills undulations they could see the occasional flash of sun on polished metal the legions theyll be camping for the night too probably busy doing exactly the same as us hacking out a marching camp and dreaming of a dip in the river yes unaware that up here there are two cohorts who have already washed their sweaty backsides in the water that will flow past them in an hours time marcus laughed at him unable to contain his amusement at the hamians turn of phrase if i didnt know better chosen man qadir id say that youve spent too much time consorting with morban of late washed their sweaty backsides qadir grimaced its inevitable you should hear some of the things that our men have started coming out with first spear frontinius caught tertius watching him again as they reached the crest of the valleys eastern slope the nd cohort centurion had been shooting him surreptitious glances ever since the first spear had declared his intention to join them in fording the river and exploring the ground on the other side the rivers fastflowing water had been delightfully cold cooling and refreshing the troops of tertiuss century and breathing fresh vigour into their tired bodies as they waded across the calfdeep stream amazing what a bit of running water will do for a man eh tertius ten minutes ago this lot were puffing and groaning at the thought of more marching and now theyre off up the hill like fourteenyearolds on a promise tertius answered with a noncommittal grunt continuing his climb up the valleys side the first spear smiled to himself this was a game he played with loaded dice so tell me centurion since weve not met before how long have you served with the second tungrians the other man took a long moment to answer his tone cautious thirteen years first spear i joined a year after the cohort moved to fair meadow local boy tertiuss reserve was still evident in the guarded tones of his reply not really my father was a centurion with the twentieth legion he retired to veterans hill with my mother before i was born another officer that had settled down with a girl from a fortress vicus frontinius mused a marriage of convenience for both parties an older man with money and influence but lacking a companion with whom to share his retirement and a woman past her youth and staring into the abyss of approaching middle age with soldiers money getting harder to come by as her looks started to fade she would have provided him with company and comfort in return for respectability and security a new start in one of the veterans colony towns was the usual way to provide suitable anonymity to such a union a soldiers son then he must have told you a good number of tales about his time following the eagle the twentieth was heavily involved in putting down the last bit of local stupidity back in the sixties tertius smiled that he did i grew up with the old mans stories that and his mates forever showing up to sit round and relive their glory days and so you ended up on the wall eager to make him proud he died five years ago before i made centurion it was his last ambition to see me with a vine stick in my hands but making it to officer rank takes the time it takes for most of us the last comment was added in a tone so quiet that frontinius half wondered whether he had imagined it he pushed on as the men in front of them turned up the slope towards the saddle the lower ridge between two hills you have a good first spear one of the best and hows that new tribune shaping up furius isnt it tertius grimaced slightly although it could have been the effort they were now having to put into climbing the valleys side tribune furius is a strong man first spear he does what he thinks is right and allows the consequences to fall out as they will frontinius snorted dont i know it ive a double century of archers to prove that i hear hes a man with a taste for the crucifix as well tertius looked startled his mouth working without anything coming out the sudden reminder of his brother turning the words to dust in his mouth frontinius ploughed on in a gentler tone recognising the emotion washing over the centurion i heard about your man falling foul of him and the way that neuto and the rest of you spared him the indignity of the nails i would have done the same in my colleagues place tertius took a moment to reply his eyes moist as he stared out across the rolling hills all i can tell you first spear is that if theres an irregularity to be found anything this tribune can turn to his own advantage he will find it and he will use it he turned to face frontinius for a moment taking a deep breath of the cool breeze anyone with a secret to hide would be better off somewhere else frontinius nodded his understanding then clapped a hand on the centurions shoulder well then centurion lets get to the top of this pimple and see what we can see look the eighth century have already got to the top of their hill so then he as good as told me that furius already knows about young corvus and advised me to move the lad or risk discovery he was less subtle with marcus yesterday tribune scaurus took a sip from the single cup of wine to which he had rationed himself for the night before replying the first spear had come to his tent soon after the evening meal was finished and doublestrength sentries had been posted both around the marching camp and as listening patrols out across the river which means not only that furius has a pretty fair idea that corvus is not what he seems but hes not doing all that good a job of keeping the fact to himself so first spear what to do frontinius scowled darkly into his own cup not as simple as you might think tribune the boys a member of the cohort now not the friendless fugitive he was six months ago hes fought and killed alongside these men formed the kind of bond that sometimes takes a lifetime the ninth century would fight to the death for him almost to a man and my centurions count him as a brother if we send him away to uncertainty even with the best intentions well have a very unhappy cohort on our hands i can promise you that and yet if we keep him here and that meathead furius denounces us to ulpius marcellus neither of us is going to see many more sunsets and dont forget that there are at least two senior officers embroiled in this nasty little affair both your former tribune and tribune licinius i can think of half a dozen heads that will end up on stakes if this goes public no he has to disappear into thin air and it has to happen soon once were south of the wall again the same day we pass through the north road gate he has to vanish and take his doctor with him or shell be the next subject of furiuss ill intentions frontinius nodded sadly id hoped that we could keep him here a while longer and that the excitement would die down and allow him to settle and make a new life if any man has earned some peace then that young man is a decent enough candidate scaurus tipped the rest of the cup down his throat and you of all people first spear are well placed to know just how unfair life is as it happens i have an idea that might just keep the lad alive for long enough that he gets to enjoy a little of the peace you describe and his woman too but it requires him to leave this cohort at the first opportunity preferably with killed in action noted against his name in the pay records its either that or watch your command be torn apart around you while furius has a cross built for you it may not be much of a choice but its the only one youve got oh and by the way he pointed a finger at the view through the tents open end in the th centurys lines the tungrians and votadini were indulging in a temporary weapons swap the soldiers were hefting the barbarians heavy swords above their heads marvelling at the strength required to make more than a couple of the chopping attacks the long blades were made for while the tribesmen were laughing at them from behind a row of borrowed shields grimacing through the gaps between the shields and the brow pieces of the helmets they had donned to complete their impersonation amazing isnt it how quickly fighting men find the things that make them the same and learn to ignore the things that make them different dubnus strolled into the th centurys section of the camp an hour later martos walking alongside him with a hand unconsciously resting on the hilt of his sword the hamians were already asleep in their tents exhausted by the days march but as the young centurion had expected marcus was still wide awake discussing possible tactics for the next day with qadir and his watch officers all four men were wearing their heavy woollen cloaks in contrast to the two britons who seemed not to notice the evenings chill marcus stood clasping hands with dubnus and turning to regard martos steadily his expression neutral martos this is my brotherinarms marcus marcus this is martos a prince of the votadini tribe now our ally and as of today my friend marcus nodded his greeting extending a hand martos took it sustaining the grip for a moment your hand is cold marcus that and your face tells me that you were not born in this land marcus nodded i was born in rome and lived there for most of my life this may be a pleasant evening to you but im used to warmer and your soldiers marcus smiled extending a hand to qadir who took his cue to bow his head slightly my chosen man can speak for himself but since his homeland is even warmer than my own you can probably draw your own conclusions the briton looked at the hamians bleakly for a long moment before speaking again i asked dubnus to show me the men who broke my warriors will in the battle for the hill fort i was curious to meet the soldiers who rained death on to my people to look into their eyes and see what kind of men they were i expected coldhearted killers and yet as with the other men of your cohort find only ordinary men like my own if anything your men look even more out of place here than mine qadir stood offering his hand to the briton i must ask your forgiveness prince martos my men have been trained for years to regard their targets as simply that targets i am not proud that we killed so many of your warriors although i am in honesty pleased that they managed their first battle as well as they did please accept my sympathy for your losses martos nodded his eyes locked on the big hamian my heart is still bleeding for the men that have preceded me across the river and i have hardened it for revenge on my enemies but i cannot number you among them for simply fighting as you have been trained his eyes flicked on to marcus narrowing with curiosity a few among my men warriors that managed to fight their way clear of the slaughter you called down upon us speak of a lone officer who stood against a dozen of them two and three at a time this man they say fought with two swords and possessed both speed and skill they have not seen before he looked at the roman expectantly gesturing to the two swords at his sides this man was you marcus smiled my archers are new to this style of fighting and to war itself and even a few of your warriors would have put them to flight in minutes i had no choice except to get out in front of them the briton surprised him by bowing slightly necessity or not you have the respect of my tribe to stand alone against so many angry men will have taken great bravery either that or hes had the sense knocked out of him by too many blows to the head martos tossed his head back and laughed uproariously at dubnuss jibe thats good ill tell my warriors that the man who bested several of their number single handed was punch drunk at the time he put a hand on marcuss shoulder his focus on the roman intent its a good thing i didnt manage to get free of the press of my men or i too would probably have ended up face down under your blades i look forward to the opportunity to wield my own sword at your side now that fate sees us both looking for the chance to take the same mans head and now new friend dubnus id better get back to my men before they grow restive dubnus turned to follow him raising a fist to marcus for a tap in parting and nodding to qadir the chosen man watched the two men walk away towards the th centurys tents they have a different approach to life these britons in my country a man in his position would take his first opportunity to put a knife between your ribs and mine too in all probability marcus pursed his lips considering the point i cant say that it would be any different in mine and yet to all appearances the mans happy to treat the whole thing as water under the bridge lets hope he feels the same way when were toe to toe with his former allies the next morning started out fine enough the cohorts standto their breakfast and preparations for the march illuminated by the early mornings soft red light the supply carts were to be left in the marching camps shelter for the day each man carrying a double ration in his pack in case as seemed likely they were unable to return to the camp that evening morban freed from his duties minding lupus by antenochs reluctant agreement to remain at the ford with the boy and a tent party of men to guard the supply wagons stared sourly into the sky above the hill to their east nudging the ths trumpeter with an elbow red sky the youth followed his pointing arm and the standardbearer raised his eyebrows despairingly looking around at the equally uncomprehending hamians fuck me backwards you really dont have a clue do you didnt your dad ever tell you what happens when the skys that colour what colour pink dont get funny with me you little prick red sky in the morning soldiers warning no never mind just make sure that your cloaks packed at the top of your gear youre going to be wanting it out before the midday stop as it happened and as the trumpeter took great pains to point out to him at the midday ration break the day stayed clear and bright all morning as the two cohorts slogged across the largely treeless hills and valleys nevertheless dark clouds were indeed building up behind them in the southwest eventually after the fifth or sixth comment at the expense of his weatherforecasting abilities morban judged that the moment had come very good smartarse if youre so confident that its not going to rain how about a small wager or are you only brave after the event the cohorts moved on again a few minutes later the votadini reckoning that they were only a few miles from the warbands presumed stronghold scaurus and furius in a spirit of some reconciliation after their fallingout the previous day agreed that their respective units would switch their cohorts modus operandi from the march to a more tactical approach frontinius gathered his centurions a note of quiet satisfaction in his voice right were now officially the point of the spear the first cohort takes the lead from now so its quiet routine from here brothers no trumpets no singing we advance at the walk rather than the march and i want eyes on the horizon to all sides at all times dubnus youve got the scout century so youd better get your idle bastards to start justifying their boasting and get right out front i want you as far out as you can get without being out of sight and i want every blade of grass turned over for signs of the enemy theyre somewhere out there probably lying in wait for the legions and our job is to find them without being spotted if you do find them you make the signal you pull your horns in and wait for me to come forward to join you no heroics and yes you can take your new friend with you just as long as you dont let him any farther forward than you and the rest of his men stay well back this advance will be scouted exclusively by roman forces from this moment the th went forward in the manner they had perfected in the previous months individual tent parties scouting forward in complete silence and communicating with dubnus by hand signals they advanced cautiously across the hilltops broad expanse every seam and fold in the otherwise bare ground explored carefully by the advancing soldiers an hour later with dark clouds gathering overhead the leading tent party probed cautiously into a copse half a mile in front of the cohorts advance the soldier scarface motioned to his mates to stay where they were at the trees edge and raised his spear ready to throw as he slid noiselessly into the copse weaving carefully around the gnarled trunks of the clustered oaks the veteran soldier sniffed the air with a furrowed brow then silently laid his spear and shield down on the grass to ease his stealthy movement through the trees drawing his sword and once more motioning for his troops to hold their positions advancing cautiously around the rock outcrop that dominated the thin collection of trees and scrub his sword held ready to fight he froze into perfect immobility in front of him with his back turned to the wideeyed scout a barbarian warrior was squatting with his breeches around his ankles grunting quietly in an apparently fruitless act of defecation inching forward his attention locked on to the back of the barbarians head for any sign that his lurking presence had been detected scarface stalked the tribesman with his sword raised until he was less than a foot from the mans oblivious back hardly daring to breathe for fear of alerting his target he paused for a moment unconsciously rehearsing with tiny movements of his hands before taking a decisive step forward and wrapping a big hand across the barbarians face stifling his surprised exclamation and pulling his head back to open his throat to the swords blade ignoring the blood sluicing from the massive wound opened across the barbarians neck as the man tottered to his feet scarface stepped back to reverse his grip on the swords hilt before pivoting forward on one muscular thigh to punch the point into the dying mans back and through his heart dropping him lifeless on to the grass sheathing the bloody blade he grabbed the dead mans corpse by the arms and weaved back through the trees the way he had entered the copse dubnus ran forward to meet the eight men struggling back towards him martos and his fourman bodyguard running alongside him the soldiers were gathered in a tight group as they came to meet him apparently weighed down by something large and heavy as he reached them they dropped their burden to the ground and stepped aside revealing the dead barbarian warrior with his throat ripped wide open and a gout of blood down his chest the dead mans eyes were bulging in testament to his last frantic struggles scarface stepped forward still breathing heavily from his retreat pulling the mans dead weight he was in the trees i caught him with his back to me so i cut his fucking throat to stop him shouting out to his mates and then put my iron through his back we grabbed him and got him out of there before anyone noticed but theyll be looking for him soon enough dubnus looked more closely at the dead man so why are his trousers round his knees the veterans expression was a study in pained explanation because centurion he was trying to have a shit when i did him why do you think ive got the bloody stuff all over my feet seems my iron unstoppered his arse better than all the grunting he was doing while i crept up on him the young centurion shook his head in disbelief looking at martos with a raised eyebrow the other man returned the gaze his face set grimly this is worse than i expected weve thrown a stone into a wasps nest and we have only a matter of minutes before the swarm is upon us dubnus nodded drawing his sword and hacking off the dead mans head picking it up by the mane of greasy hair and turning back to scarface did you actually see any more of them the veteran shook his head but his expression spoke volumes no but as i was stalking this boy i could smell wood smoke and plenty of it could be a dozen of them could be the entire bloody valley full for all i know cocidius help us given that the warbands supposed to be five miles farther east and given that the young centurion pointed to the severed head staring slackly back at them id say were in deeper shit than what youve had sprayed on your boots he pointed to one of the younger soldiers you boy you fancy yourself a runner so you take this and you leg it back to the first spear as fast as you can go he pushed the barbarians severed head into the soldiers hands and you tell the first spear theres a camp over the hill cooking fires lit strength unknown and make sure he gets to see that hell know what to do he turned to his men as the runner bounded away right one man runs to each tent party and tells them to get back here quiet over quick mind you and save their wind i reckon weve got a long run ahead of us by chance it was rufiuss century that the runner reached first and the veteran took one wideeyed look at his grisly trophy before grabbing it from him and running back up the cohorts column with a speed that belied his years finding the senior officers watching the th centurys stealthy but hasty retreat with professional concern he held out the dead barbarians head to his first spear too breathless to speak to his surprise scaurus was the first to speak gods below hes a venico furius wrinkled his brow hes another dead barbarian thats what he is why so frontinius having stared for a long silent moment at the dead mans head at the face decorated with swirling blue tattoos spoke over him as if not even aware that a superior officer was speaking how far is it back to last nights campsite would you say centurion rufius ten miles give or take first spear he nodded and then turned to scaurus youre right of course that is indeed a barbarian of quite another tribe to those we thought we were facing if calgus has managed to achieve what this looks like then were on very dangerous ground indeed and you recommend that we get both cohorts turned around and running for their lives in very short order this mans mates are going to miss him look for him and fail to find him at which point theyll come over that hill the second they realise were here well have a full warband at our heels id get the message riders away to the legions too tell them that well be holding the line of the red river at the waterfall ford prefect furiuss frown deepened not so fast first spear we find a single barbarian several miles from our objective and were going to take to our heels for fear of the rest of the warband coming to find him this is probably just a stray hunter or rufius spoke out having regained his wind from his run up the hill with respect prefect thats no stray ive fought these bastards in the hills to the north of the river tava and those tattoos tell me hes a warrior and the scout century reported wood smoke cooking fires most likely scaurus nodded decisively enough chat he raised a hand to silence his openmouthed colleague no gracilus furius one moment first spear frontinius get the first cohort turned round and headed for the ford id recommend the double march but thats for your discretion ill have a quiet word with my colleague while you get them moving frontinius saluted and turned away then stopped and half turned back one problem prefect the eighth century wont sustain the double for more than a couple of miles and i cant risk three other officers to chivvy them along under these circumstances i know tell centurion corvus that hes on his own free to make his way back to the ford by any route he sees fit but we cant wait for him now my colleague he led a protesting furius away ignoring the curious glances the message riders were giving the two of them as they waited for their instructions come over here and listen to what i have to say no just for once just this once listen to another mans opinion before shouting your own from the rooftops the other mans spluttering protests ran dry under his level stare replaced by a thinlipped glare as scaurus spoke quickly and with a hard edge in his voice that his colleague had not heard before that dead man belonged to a tribe we call the venicones in their own language they call themselves the hunting hounds and if we think weve had a rough war this far then i can tell you its about to get worse much worse they live beyond the antonine wall and their men are tattooed wearing their warpaint all the time and not just when the mood takes them there are thousands of them and they live to raid and burn and most of all to kill their enemies in cruel and barbarous ways they have an utter disregard for danger and a burning desire to see us dead all of us furius had quickly lost any hint of his previous bluster his eyes flicking nervously to the st cohort which had now turned around and was heading back across the hills empty expanse at the double march scaurus continued to speak as he tightened his helmet strap ready for the march you want to know how i know this youve doubtless heard about the antonine wall and how we decided to abandon it purely to shorten lines of supply back to yew grove and fortress deva all of which was a carefully concocted fiction there were nineteen forts on the northern wall more than we have on the current border yet guarding a frontier less than half the length it was perfect less than forty miles to defend easy to build a concentration of troops that would intimidate the locals into peace he snorted ive read the governors report scrolls from the period and they were genuinely terrifying those inkedup bastards burned out more than half of the forts at one time or another killing thousands of men before we decided to cut our losses and leave them well alone so colleague furius when whoevers camped over that hill comes looking and finds our tracks beaten into the grass i want to be as far along the march back to the red river as possible you can stay if you like but i guarantee that the last few minutes of your life will be more exciting than you would have wished he turned to go and furius recovered his wits putting a hand on his sleeve and blurting out a question his voice quavered slightly and his gaze flicked to left and right like that of a man seeking a means of escape surely the governor would want us to hold our ground shouldnt we scaurus turned back to his brother officer a softer look on his face than the hardeyed stare hed fixed on the other man a moment before its all right furius i was there at thunderbolt gorge remember i know what youre going through because i was there the last time it happened to you and no theres nothing to be gained from making a stand here except a quick and unpleasant death the governor put us out here to make sure that nobody gets to swing a hook into the legions left flank when they go in to dig calgus out from his hideyhole agreed which you might have guessed is exactly the reason that these barbarian maniacs are lurking out here they wont have come south looking for a fight in anything less than full strength so unless we manage to alert ulpius marcellus to their presence hell find that even two overstrength legions are not really any match for thirty thousand or more angry barbarians driving in hard from two or three different directions unless we manage to warn him whats waiting out here well end up with calgus in possession of every bloody eagle in britannia the country aflame and probably lost for good i suggest that you get your men moving prefect marcus and qadir watched as the st cohorts centuries ground past them the soldiers too busy gulping air to shout the usual insults at the hamians indeed he wondered whether he detected a hint of sympathy in the glances that the labouring troops were shooting at them as they left the th century toiling along in their wake his discussion with the first spear had been both brief and bleak i cant leave anyone to help you my main priority now is to get the cohort back to the ford and ready to fight off the venicones when they come swarming across the red youll have to make your own way back and join up with us when you can my advice would be not to push your boys too hard and make sure theyre ready to use their bows on anything that catches up with you it wont be much use having the ability to hit a man at a hundred paces if youre too winded to pull the arrow back hed slapped marcus on the shoulder wished him good luck and marched off at the head of the cohort prefect scaurus had done much the same a few minutes later having the good grace to look a little guilty at leaving the hamians to fend for themselves it will rain soon qadir stared skywards as they marched watching the heavy grey clouds hanging over them a slight green tinge hinting at the downpour lurking within their dark looming bulk marcus looked upwards briefly then shot a glance back over his shoulder past the rapidly closing nd cohort at the hill behind them lets hope so a decent downpour might give us the chance to get back to the ford before the venicones catch us out here and with a brilliant flash a lightning bolt crackled between cloud and ground a mile or so distant a crashing boom loud enough to wake the dead rolling over the marching hamians a few seconds later marcus tapped qadir on the arm shouting over the thunders reverberation keep them moving in fact push them up to a hundred and twenty paces a minute if they get to brooding about whats behind them theyll be more likely to get twitchy so lets give them something else to think about the nd cohort thundered past at the double march their glowering prefect sneering across at the single labouring century from his horse behind them appearing over the hill in their wake came half a dozen horsemen marcus shouted to qadir pointing back at the barbarian riders have the men ready to shoot but keep their bows hidden until the moment comes i want them nice and close before we show our hand so wait for my signal the chosen man dropped back down the column and spoke quietly with the archers as he went his hands emphasising his orders the horsemen closed steadily on the centurys rear stringing arrows to their own bows in anticipation of ranging alongside the century and shooting into their helpless mass further slowing their retreat qadir chisel tips get ready the chosen man nodded unslinging his own bow under the cover of his mens ranks and reaching back to pull one of a few flatheaded arrows from the quiver hung over his shoulder locating the arrow by a small protrusion on its base the horsemen rode up alongside the century their loose formation opening up as they prepared to start shooting no more than thirty paces from the hamians qadir now at his chosen mans shouted command the archers stopped marching swivelled to face the horsemen and lifted their bows to shoot the riders proximity making their marks laughably easy their broadheaded arrows flicked across the gap punching into the horses sides with savage power and the animals screamed as the chiseltipped arrows did what they were specifically designed to do the flatheaded arrows horrific power punched chunks of ribcage snapped free by their impact deep into the animals bodies crushing their lungs and internal organs and inflicting fatal wounds on the hapless beasts their riders were pitched from their saddles by the sudden collapse of their horses struggling back to their feet only to find themselves facing a line of bows that riddled them with arrows in seconds the few horses that didnt fall immediately struggled away in obvious difficulty the arrows protruding from their sides slick with frothy blood spouting from their punctured lungs and their riders made easy targets for the arrows that dropped them from their dying mounts inside seconds the pursuit had gone from easy chase to bloody ruin a single riderless horse trotting slowly out of arrow range before slumping to its knees unable to rise as its blood sluiced from three deep chest wounds keep moving marcus pointed impatiently at the next hill waving the th century forward morban a hundred and twenty a minute lets get out of here the th century ground on up the slope the nd cohort already over the top and on their way down the other side there were still marcus reckoned another three valleys between them and the ford a good two hours marching even in good weather with a gentle patter the longawaited rain started to fall the initial shower intensifying quickly until the hamians were marching through a downpour their bows quickly hidden from the rain in oiled goatskin bags at the top of the slope marcus stopped letting the century continue past him as he squinted back through the rain on the crest of the valleys far slope a mile or so distant their numbers made uncertain by the shifting curtains of rain a mass of warriors were crossing the summit and starting to pour down the hill they would catch his men in much less than half an hour he guessed he turned back to find his centurys ordered line of march suddenly disintegrating into chaos as a hundred and more barbarians charged out of the rain to their front the st cohort reached the red rivers ford by midafternoon exhausted soldiers splashing their way through water already a good six inches deeper than had been the case that morning the rain beating off their helmets with increasing vigour as the last centuries staggered up the reds western bank one tired tungrian slipped into the rushing water and for a moment it was touch and go as to whether he would find his feet again or be washed downriver and over the falls on to the rocks below it was a mark of their physical exhaustion that not a single soldier took the chance to poke fun when he rose out of the rivers icy grip water streaming from his helmet and made the bank in a flurry of limbs first spear frontinius greeted each century that crossed with the same greeting fill your water bottles get any food youve got down your necks and get ready to stand to centurions to me when the officers were all gathered bedraggled and mudstained he laid out his proposal for the defence weve no choice but to make our stand here its the only defensive position for miles itll be dark in about six hours so well have to hold them off that long unless the rain gets heavier and makes the ford impassable well hold the riverbank unless anyones got any better ideas twoman depth and fourhundred threehundredandtwentyman width that should be plenty to stop them getting any foothold on this side well build an earth wall on the riverbank use the turfs from the marching camp then fight with spears not swords and keep them down in the water and at the mercy of the cold and the current one tent party per century to set up the tents as cover for the wounded the rest of the cohort to build that wall as fast as possible and be careful to leave a gap for the second cohort to cross through tribune anything to add scaurus shook his head clearly still exhausted after the punishing pace of their march anyone else got a question centurion rufius is this about the eighth century rufius nodded tensely yes first spear i request permission to take a small party back out and look for the eighth denied centurion and you too julius before you ask the eighth will have to take their chances get to work dubnus you left here this morning with two centuries worth of votadini but i dont see them now i dont suppose you could enlighten me as to where they are dubnus grimaced waving an arm back across the river martos wasnt about to leave the eighth on their own to be slaughtered first spear he said there were too many good men to leave to the venicones and he wasnt about to ask me for permission to leave the cohort either i suppose dubnus nodded tiredly for what its worth i think hell be back and hopefully with the eighth following him for what its worth centurion i hope youre right the nd cohort struggled across the ford fifteen minutes later and neuto found frontinius supervising the building of the earth rampart along the fords western bank pointing critically at the way the soldiers were stacking their turfs not too close to the water or itll be washed away if theres much more rainfall farther up the valley like this see now carry on only faster he turned to face neuto shaking the mud from his hands glad you could join us all present the other man nodded dourly shaking droplets off the brim of his helmet we lost a few that couldnt take the pace theyll be dead by now but the rest all got here the last we saw of your boys they were shooting holes in the venicone horse scouts but then the rain came down like the sky was falling and we lost any sight of them frontinius nodded his expression forcedly neutral now youre in we can close the wall i doubt well get it more than three feet high before theyre crossing the river but even that should be enough now lets discuss what your boys can add to the defence scaurus had greeted furius as his horse climbed from the river taking a grip of the animals bridle and leading it away from the soldiers toiling to fortify the reds treacherously slippery bank in the pounding rain arminius followed the two men as scaurus took his colleague far enough from the troops that their privacy was guaranteed turning his back on the officers to face the river and ensure that no one tried to interrupt them furius climbed stiffly down from the exhausted animal and turned to face scaurus but before he had time to say anything the other man forestalled him by raising a hand to silence whatever it was he had been about to say im taking command gracilus furius im sorry but theres no way to sugarcoat it so were best getting it out of the way here and now furiuss eyes widened with anger youre taking command by what authority scaurus smiled grimly shaking his head in quiet amusement its always about power and rank with you isnt it furius by ulpius marcelluss authority who else could give it to me i was sent north on a scouting mission before he was even formally appointed when it was clear to everyone but the last governor that the northern tribes were ready to boil over of course it had all gone to ratshit by the time i got here but that didnt make my job any less valid just a damn sight more dangerous furius interrupted impatiently so fucking what youve no more right to shut up furiuss head jerked back as if hed been struck and before he had any chance to regain his composure he found scauruss face close to his own his eyes suddenly slitted with anger in a face white with suppressed anger and his voice a furious monotone one more word from you and ill take my sword to you i know you gracilus furius i know what youre capable of on and off the battlefield youre the big man in camp all right all spunk and swagger when theres a condemned man to nail to a cross or some helpless girl to terrorise but i stood next to you that day at thunderbolt gorge and watched you change from a selfassured bully to a snivelling coward in the time it took for you to decide that we were all going to die if you think im going to let you anywhere near those soldiers once there are ten thousand venicones on the far bank of that river and all of them screaming for the chance to carve our balls off youd best think back to just how much leadership you gave your cohort that day if you stay here alongside me and keep your mouth shut then assuming were not all dead before nightfall ill see that you get a share of whatever good news comes our way before youre sent home but if you make one squeak or squeal that might sap these mens capacity to resist those tattooed bastards will be practising their knife work on your bloody corpse he raised his voice ignoring the openmouthed furius thank you arminius ill have the scroll now please frontinius and neuto turned to face scaurus as he walked up to them the german at his shoulder holding a message cylinder with its wax seal still intact scaurus held out his hand and took it from him gesturing to it as he addressed the two men scaurus nodded to both men gentlemen this scroll contains some very explicit instructions from the governor as to the limits of my authority which for the avoidance of doubt are just about nonexistent unless and until im talking to a legatus im taking command of this defence in order to ensure that there are no unfortunate misunderstandings on my colleague furiuss behalf we stand here gentlemen and we either hold this position or we go down fighting he stared at his subordinates waiting for any comment neuto scratched under his helmets left cheek guard before replying his face impassive and about time too if you were to ask me lets get on with it the venicones arrived on the far bank half an hour later at first in a trickle down the eastern slope of the red rivers valley but soon in greater numbers until the eastern bank of the river was thronged with warriors a few were waving heads and roman helmets at the defenders but given the rain it was impossible to make out any detail julius and rufius stood and watched them desperate to know whether marcus had fallen victim to the barbarians could be our boy but then again tiberius rufius turned away sickened at the sight of what might be his friends severed head if it was him then at least it was probably quick rufius nodded acknowledging juliuss point ill give you that if id known that those bloody archers would lead to this id have youd have what stopped him from adopting them made sure that the prefect made a point of dumping them on that prick furius nothing you or i or even the first spear could have done would have prevented whats happened and what is simply is now if you dont want to make your exit the same way that poor bastard did whoever he is then get your shit in a pile and get ready to defend this piece of riverbank rufius nodded again breathed deeply and then held a hand out to his friend ill see you when this squalid little fights done either here or in hades the st cohort were drawn up behind the freshly built wall in battle order their shields running with water as the rain showed no sign of abating each man in the front rank held a spear ready to use while the men in the rank behind held three apiece each with the front rankers spare and his own pair ready to hold the soldier to their front in place on the slippery ground with a steady grip on his belt when they come across the river the front rank will ready spears for defence take your spears to them while theyre climbing out of the water do not wait for them to get to the top of the rampart dubnus was ranging along the rear of the th century bellowing out his last instructions to the soldiers waiting tensely for the fight to begin keep your wits about you and your shields ready and watch out for their swords scarface tested his footing behind the turf walls modest defence seeking a firm footing before the fighting began he muttered quietly to his neighbour tipping his head to indicate their centurion im not sure whats worse that lot over the river shouting the odds or having him strutting up and down like hes an officer or something the other man nodded spitting morosely into the rivers fastflowing water yeah was better when we had our young gentleman to tell us what to do an he was stood behind us with the big stick dont suppose well be seeing two knives again though scarface nodded morosely before looking back over his shoulder you rear rank youll have to keep a better grip of my belt than that unless you want me in the river with those tattooed bastards across the river after the expected period of time for orders to work their way down to the family groups that made up the warband the venicones stopped milling about and advanced into the river with fresh purpose the water reached almost to their knees reducing their progress to a slow walk as they fought against the reds continual efforts to pull them off their feet the waiting tungrians settled down behind their shields crouching into their shelter as the stronger venico warriors began hurling their spears for the most part futilely although one lucky throw toppled a rd century soldier across the rampart with his throat torn open the barbarians advanced through the freezing rivers flow to the western riverbank and began their assault in earnest attempting to climb the earth wall and get to close quarters where their swords could come into play hopelessly disadvantaged by the turf rampart losing the ability to use either spear or sword against the defenders as they climbed out of the water they were easy meat for the tungrians spearthrusts within half a minute blood clouded the rivers water as dozens of men fell back from the attack with horrific upperbody wounds inflicted by the darting spearheads that struck repeatedly into their ranks a warrior might fight on for a short time with a single wound but with hundreds of spears thrusting at the attackers ten or twelve times a minute the slaughter was more than the venicones could sustain a horn blew and the remaining attackers withdrew past their dead and dying comrades shouting insults and threats at the impassive soldiers scarface took a deep breath wiping the blood from his face where it had sprayed after his spear had pierced deep into a venico warriors chest he spat over the rampart into the rivers torrent watching the surviving barbarians straggling back to the far bank easy enough i did for five of the fuckers without ever even seeing a blade never mind using my shield they can keep doing that as long as they like on the eastern hillside in a position chosen to allow the senior officers to see over the st cohort and with uninterrupted views to both north and south the two cohorts tribunes and first spears watched as the venico warriors backed away from the earth rampart first spear frontinius curled his lip dismissively pulling unconsciously on his moustache that was a diversion and not much more by my reckoning there are men moving along the bank in both directions lets hope your men up and downriver are up to the task prefect furius the bands of warriors dispatched along the reds banks moved quickly the northern group climbing the gentle slope until the wide expanse of the ford gave way to the steeper and narrower banks of the river where it ran through the softer rock that had once overlain the fords granite shelf higher they climbed seeking a narrow point at which to wade or jump the river and thus reach the western bank unopposed to the south another warband headed downriver skirting round the falls by way of a slow steep climb down the sloping rock face before jogging downstream in search of their own crossing point frontinius watched them go his eyes narrowed in calculation as he stared into the rain the downpour slowing as the clouds above them started to lift the rains stopping which means well only have a few hours before the ford reduces in speed and depth enough for them to rush us in real numbers three hundred paces upriver the northern warband had found what they were looking for a narrowing in the stream caused by the presence of a huge boulder buried deeply in the eastern bank the massive ancient rock reduced the rivers width to less than a running mans jump if well judged half a dozen men stepped back and ran at the jump vaulting off the boulder and landing in all but one case squarely on the far bank the one exception missed the banks edge by six inches floundered and was swept away downstream in an instant by the fastmoving stream the remaining warriors turned to signal to their comrades and went down under a volley of spears from the nearest nd cohort century as they advanced out of the thinning rain the soldiers rushed to the bank and formed a hasty line meeting the next wave of warriors with spear points that dumped every man unceremoniously into the red to be washed back downstream to the ford in clouds of their own blood the centurion gestured to his men half of them forming a defensive line while the rest set to work behind them with their turfcutting spades to open a gap which when cut through to the rivers bank would widen the river sufficiently to make the leap impossible without the cover afforded by the rain the nd cohorts dispositions were now becoming clear several centuries stepped up the western bank in ambush positions for just such an eventuality scaurus watched as the nd cohort men toiled at the riverbank his face thoughtful theyll get no joy that way the rivers moving far too quickly its a crossing downstream from the falls that worries me the flow might be slow enough for them to find a way across somewhere down there frontinius grimaced into the gentle drizzle that still drifted in the air i could send more men down there yes but we need to keep the whole length of the river defended as well as possible weaken the section upstream of the falls and theyll find a way across there instead well just have to make the best of what we have he looked to the south again but the venico warriors that had gone south down the reds eastern bank were now invisible in the afternoons murk a thick mist replacing the rain as the days warmth steamed moisture out of the sodden ground the th century and martoss warriors lay soaked muddy and bedraggled against the northern bank of a small stream a tributary of the red that ran in the shadow of the long rocky shelf scarring the hillside to the east of the falls with his feet in the fastflowing water marcus peeped over the banks crest just able to make out the figures of the venicones as they hunted down the reds eastern bank less than two hundred paces away within a minute he realised they would draw level with the streams entrance into the river and have clear line of sight to the ths hiding place he looked up and down the line of his men gesturing them to stay prone against the mud a single warrior moved into view his presence almost ghostly in the curtains of mist hanging in the muggy afternoon air the man stood slightly crouched scouting the path for the warband behind him his head cocked to one side as he listened for any threat then slowly moved on down the rivers bank another man followed then more these warriors less alert than their scout how could he not see us martos answered his quiet question in an equally low voice mist mud luck theyre looking for a way across the river yes did you see their axes they will look for a tree to drop across the river then call the warband down here and seek to cross it in stealth your people will have centuries posted along the bank but with this mist he shook his head and marcus understood his frustration with such restricted visibility such a breach of the cohorts defences might go unnoticed long enough to allow a buildup of warriors on the far bank too strong to be contained there were only thirty of them by my count marcus turned to face the votadini leader you propose to attack them martos pursed his lips his gaze steady in this mist they will not see us until we are almost on top of them and if there are more following then we will make a brave stand until your mens arrows are spent we cannot stand by while these men breach your defences undetected marcus nodded youre right lets get into them before any more of them climb down the outcrop and pitch up here martos clapped him on the shoulder thats the way my men will go first and take down those few and i suggest your men take our northern flank get their bows uncased now that the rain has stopped and be ready to shoot the next few minutes will be exciting for us all the venico scouts had ghosted noiselessly through the shifting curtains of mist for half a mile down the red rivers course before they found what they had been sent to look for a pair of trees at the rivers edge which could with the right felling be dropped neatly on to the far bank and so form a makeshift bridge sending a man back to call for reinforcement the warbands leader ordered his four best axemen to set about the trees thick trunks watching with satisfaction as they hammered deep notches into the wood their cuts perfectly placed to put the trees leafy tops on to the eastern bank as they fell the rivers far bank was wreathed in mist that was rising from the saturated ground under the suns heat as the rain clouds temporarily cleared and the sound of their axes was muffled by the murk to the degree that he doubted anyone more than a couple of hundred paces away would have any clue as to the threat they would shortly pose to the roman right flank with a creaking tear the first tree fell exactly as required its leafy branches easily reaching the far bank the trees massive trunk stretched out into the misty air above the swollen river an immovable bridge into the heart of the roman defence a moment later the second tree fell bouncing off the trunk of its companion and coming to rest tidily alongside it a man grunted behind him and the chieftain turned to find one of his men on his knees with a spear protruding from his chest even as he took in the scene a dozen indistinct figures charged out of the mist mudcoated wraiths wielding long swords and butchering his unsuspecting men even as they realised they were under attack the venico warriors hesitated for fateful seconds at the sight of the men running at them long haired and clad in clothing identical to their own and their weapons equally familiar the venico leaders realisation that these were not his own people came to him far too late as he saw that the mudsmeared man shaping to attack him was not only wielding two swords one long one short but was wearing a roman centurions helmet the attacker brushed his sword aside with one blade then punched the other into his chest so quickly that he hardly saw it coming even as he gaped at the sudden shocking pain the mudcoated warrior drove the other sword under his ribs before ripping both blades free and shouldering him aside to fall dying on the muddy ground as his life slipped away from him he saw a tall and muscular warrior walk up to the roman slapping him on the back in congratulation a good kill centurion marcus nodded watching the venico leaders glassy eyes lose their final spark as the mans spirit left him the poor bastard didnt realise what was going on not until he felt my iron in his heart he shook himself free from the moment of reverie calling out to his men still hidden in the mist eighth century to me quickly now his men hurried from their hiding place to join him clustering round their officer with the air of lost children martos smiled around him recognising the hamians fear of such an unexpected and desperate circumstance that was our turn to do the killing little brothers but yours will come soon enough make your hearts hard as they were at the hill fort for you will soon be killing your enemies again this i can promise you the archers stared back at him without comprehension their eyes wide at the sight of the bodies of the venico warriors and marcus realised with a start that his men for all the slaughter they had wreaked on martoss warband days before had not yet been face to face with the human debris of battle he clapped his hands to get their attention eighth century the time has come for your greatest test at the end of this day youll all be able to hold your heads up among the soldiers of our cohort as warriors now follow me across this makeshift bridge and once youre across unpack your bows and get ready to shoot nobody looses an arrow without my command because martos and his men will be following us across martos bring your men over as quickly as you can therell be more of them along he nodded to the briton and then clambered nimbly on to and along the trunk of one of the fallen trees with morban following closely behind him jumping down on to the reds western bank he turned back to wave the th century across shapes were forming in the mist in front of him soldiers drawn by the sound of the trees fall advancing to attack with their spears ready and marcus threw himself to the ground pulling the standardbearer down with him knowing that the first spears would be thrown at chest height roman soldiers eighth century first tungrians a soldier loomed out of the mist his spear held low and ready to thrust and marcus called out again his voice tight with urgency roman soldiers the spears point stopped an inch from his throat and the soldier behind it braced the weapon ready to drive it home get up marcus climbed to his feet wiping a fresh coating of mud from his face im corvus centurion of the eighth century first cohort those men across the river the soldier turned away centurion appius his officer came forward to the riverbank took one look at marcus and shouted for his chosen man he turned back to the roman with a wry smile well now look at you centurion two knives theres me looking all over for you and then just when im least expecting it the gods drop you out of the sky or so it seems well have to marcus interrupted him with a dismissive shake of his head no time we can discuss whatever it is you want from me later but for now my century is across the river waiting to cross appius nodded well talk later then chosen appiuss secondincommand got the hamians moving across the tree trunks while the two centurions considered the threat to the cohorts defences marcus pointed into the mist towards the outcrop hidden in the rolling mist they sent a runner back to the warband we killed the rest of them but he was gone too quickly as long as it takes to get back to the ford and back again then well be knee deep in barbarians speaking of which there are friendly locals on the other side too so youd better pass the word for your men to hold on to their spears until they hear the command to throw antenoch dropped from the trees curved surface saluting both officers centurion corvus there are warriors climbing down the rocks we can hear them marcus turned to the other centurion weve got five minutes no more and therell be hundreds of them fighting us for this piece of riverbank my archers can hold them off for a time but we need to destroy these trees appiuss men took guard around the trees impromptu bridge while the hamians the last men of the th century still crossing took their positions up and downstream readying their bows to shoot the first of the votadini came across the bridge at something close to a run the urgency of the situation telling in the speed with which the warriors crossed one or two coming perilously close to falling into the red martos the last man across walked across the impromptu bridge at a more dignified pace pointing back across the river theyre close i could hear them shouting to each other theyll be trying to cross in less than a minute and nothing short of burning these trees out will keep them at bay if that were even possible appius snapped his fingers turning to marcus with a new light in his eyes fire thats it i know a man that keeps a ready supply keep them busy eh two knives youre in charge here until i get back marcus caught his arm as he turned to go take our votadini allies with you theres no way they can stay here he turned to martos offering the votadini warrior his hand thank you for staying back to lead us to safety we would have been found and slaughtered without your guidance follow this officer and he will lead you to the main body youll be better off there safe from the risk that some idiot will take you for a venico martos nodded taking the offered hand before beckoning his men to follow him then ran north along the riverbank behind appius heading for the ford marcus called qadir to his side right chosen i suggest that you get your men ready to start shooting there are no friendlies left to cross the bridge aimed shots only and no volleys we need to make every arrow count the shouts of the approaching venicones were audible over the rivers babble now their excitement turned to anger as they encountered the bodies of their comrades in the mist wreathing the reds far bank they milled around for a moment and then goaded by their leaders started their assault leaping on to the fallen tree with swords and spears ready to fight they advanced along its length hideously vulnerable targets for the waiting bows the hamian archers picked them off with lethal precision dropping the warriors into the rivers fastmoving water with their blood spraying from two or three arrow wounds apiece as the skirmish played out before him marcus was looking not to the barbarians his men were killing by the numbers but to those on the bank behind them their number swelling by the minute as more of the warband struggled down the outcrop and ran to join their comrades still calculating the odds he staggered back as an arrow punched into the mail armour covering his chest the missile dropping to the damp grass with its energy dissipated against the stout iron rings another arrow flicked off morbans helmet and the standardbearer ducked for cover behind the hamian line with an unaccustomed agility archers target the far bank with volleys he smiled grimly as the hamians loosed a volley of arrows across the river which resulted in a chorus of groans and screams from the warriors milling about on the far bank recognising the tactics being employed by whoever was in command on the far side in an instant whether deliberately or not the game had been changed forced to fire en masse in order to kill or suppress the barbarian archers the hamians would run through their remaining arrows in minutes rather than the much longer time possible if they were required only to pick off single targets while the first volley tore into the mass of barbarians lining the far bank sending most of them to earth the second and third found far fewer targets as a result cease volleys aimed shots only and probably a tenth of their stock of arrows were expended in less than half a minute an astute leader on the far bank might reckon it worth the loss to throw his men back on to their feet to make the romans run through their arrows and remove the threat to their crossing at the cost of a few hundred lives without the threat of the archers and with their bowmen to keep the defenders heads down whoever was leading the men on the far bank would be able to mass twenty or thirty men on the trees broad trunks ready to rush into their midst with hundreds more at their back a few wellpicked men with their feet on the western bank might occupy the defenders for long enough for their fellow warriors to reinforce them and secure the tiny bridgehead allowing the trickle to become a flood the warriors were on their feet again quickly enough once the iron rain no longer fell among them barbarian arrows once more flicking through the ranks of the hamian and tungrian defenders volleys another three volleys were loosed to good effect another tenth of their arrows gone the situation was descending into a straight tradeoff bodies for arrows and with sick certainty marcus watched as the warriors rose again some with more than one arrow wound qadir the chosen man hurried across to him keeping low as barbarian arrows resumed their irregular but potentially lethal hail how many arrows do we have left the big man grimaced perhaps fifteen per man they had enough arrows for five more rounds of their deadly game perhaps seven or eight if he restricted them to two shots each time ten minutes worth and no more aimed shots only no more volleys tell your men i want no wasted arrows he turned to the other centurys chosen man and watch officer shaking his head in apology sorry gentlemen your boys will have to take their chances with the barbarian archers if i keep firing volleys to make them keep their heads down ill be out of arrows in less time than itll take for reinforcements to arrive an ugly thought occurred to him could either of you throw a spear across the river the men looked at each other then at the river calculating the distance the chosen man nodded slowly his eyes still calculating the throw not sure that i could but ive got plenty of big strong boys that would make it easily marcus motioned to qadir signalling a withdrawal get them back ten paces qadir were in spear range i suggest you do the same cho the instruction died in his throat as he turned away from his men the iron head and ash shaft of a venico spear hissing past his face close enough that he felt the wind of its passing on his cheek the other centurys chosen man jerked backwards a pace as the spear having missed its target by the merest fraction buried itself in his throat and took his life as compensation another halfdozen men were hit as they retreated from the rivers bank two of them hamians while the first archers mail coat saved him from any harm worse than a severe bruise the second man hit was less lucky and went down with a spear through his back as his mails rings parted under the weapons impact qadir ran forward and grabbed the fallen hamian by the collar of his ring mail snatching up his shield and raising it against further attack as he dragged him back to safety marcus knelt by the mans head and put a finger to his throat hes dead the men of the th watched him lying motionless in the mud with what the young centurion momentarily took for numb detachment until he realised that the dead man was the first casualty the century had suffered since his assumption of command marcus and qadir stood behind their men watching as the hamians systematically shot down any man that set foot on the fallen tree trunks steadily depleting their remaining arrows theyre manoeuvring us neatly into position to be mobbed once weve run out of arrows and shot back whatever theyve shot at us we cant defend the bank theyll just shower us with spears and bleed us dry and that means they can throw men across until theyve built enough strength to roll us over make sure every arrow finds a target he stalked away forcing himself to ignore the arrows aimed at his distinctive helmet as he approached the nd cohort soldiers cowering behind their shields with their chosen man dead the century was leaderless at least until appius returned from whatever task he had decided would provide an answer to the fallen trees threat watch officer and standardbearer to me a pair of soldiers detached themselves from the century using their shields for protection against the intermittent barbarian arrows marcus hefted the shield he had picked up from beside the dead chosen man and ducked into its cover with your chosen man dead youre the only leadership left for your men the two men regarded him unhappily content to enforce their officers discipline and to organise the more mundane duties of the century neither looked particularly eager to assume the burden of command he stepped in closer to the pair leaning to put his face only inches from theirs and to allow him to speak more quietly but with an unmistakable edge to his voice i can see that you dont like the idea but you have no choice in the matter without your leadership these men will break and run once my archers run out of arrows and the barbarians will come across that bridge with their tails up and looking for the revenge on us for all the men weve killed here and if your men run if you let that happen they will be hacked to pieces inside five minutes as will we all within half an hour every man in both cohorts will either be running for their lives or have their guts laid out for inspection so gentlemen what will it be death or glory the two soldiers looked at each other each of them seeing his own uncertainty mirrored in the others face marcus changed tack reaching for humour where the plain facts werent succeeding youre both scared shitless right they nodded reluctantly the standardbearer cracking the thinnest of smiles as he spoke ill probably manage one good shit once those bastards are across the river marcus sighed gently thanking his gods for the soldiers unfailing gift of humour in the darkest situations he looked quickly to qadir who held up a hand with the five digits splayed out five arrows per man perhaps three more minutes ill let you into a secret then ive just led these lads all scared out of their wits by those headhunting bastards through rain and mud and blood to get across the river in one piece all that time hiding up hills and in ditches and ive been busting for a good long sitdown all that time the two men goggled at him an officer and clearly a nicely broughtup boy too telling them that he needed the latrine and if i can hold on to my arse all afternoon on the wrong side of the river with that lot running around then im sure that you two can give me a few minutes of leadership for these poor buggers so heres the deal you take four tent parties each and you deploy them to either side of my lads one left one right his plan explained he hurried back to his century drawing his cavalry sword and praying for both men to find their courage when the time came how many left one or two arrows apiece he took a deep breath eighth century every man without any arrows remaining raise your right hand two dozen or so hands went up when another dozen barbarians had been toppled from the tree trunks he shouted again if youre out of arrows right hand up and keep it up about sixty this time looking back into the mist he could see nothing no sign of reinforcement that they would have to fight hand to hand was now inevitable that there was only one way that they could fight successfully and even then only for a very limited time seemed equally likely eighth century those of you with arrows keep shooting but listen to me when you run out of arrows put your arm in the air when enough men have run out i will give the order to draw swords if youre still shooting put your bow down and air your blade pick your shield up and form a line two men deep just as we trained you more hands went up in the air until about ninety per cent of his men were no longer able to shoot at the attacking venicones draw your swords the remaining archers stood and with the rasp of metal on metal the century drew their swords and jostled into something approaching the standard defensive formation twenty paces or so from the riverbank the venicones were already crossing the trees in numbers perhaps a dozen men now visible on the western bank marcus muttered under his breath judging the right moment to commit his men mithras forgive me sending these innocents to face those animals he drew breath and bellowed in his best parade ground roar eighth century at the walk advance for an awful moment nothing happened as the archers struggled to digest the terrible novelty of their situation from his place behind the century qadir suddenly roared a command his voice unrecognisable compared to his usual mannered speech forward where the formal command had failed to galvanise the hamians the sudden bellow from their rear set them moving crouching behind their shields like terrified recruits faced with their first practice battle perhaps but nevertheless advancing on the baying tribesmen marcus shot a surprised look at qadir and was amazed at the fierce stare he received in return as his chosen man spoke his voice an angry snarl theyre dead whether they attack or simply stand and wait for it to happen they might as well go to meet their goddess with their dignity intact marcus nodded stepping forward to stay close to the rear rank pushing at their backs with the dead chosen mans long wooden pole as qadir followed suit with his own the bellowing venicones were less than ten paces away hammering swords against their small shields to raise a din calculated to stand off the numerically superior roman force while more men crossed the river behind them qadirs voice boomed out over the tumult again forward board and swords gut the bastards the hamians edged forward their reluctance to take the fight to the wildeyed warriors railing at them painfully obvious the venico tribesmens confidence visibly grew as they took in their opponents clear desire to be somewhere else half a dozen of them stepping boldly across the slowly narrowing gap to hammer at the archers shields with their long swords one of them his confidence in the face of such poor opposition clearly sky high angled his sword down over a shield in a powerful thrust putting the blades tip through the throat of the man behind it the dying hamian convulsed with the wounds shock his struggles disrupting the centurys line of shields and encouraging another tribesman to step in and attempt a kill the blade flashed down in a vicious arc missing its intended target by a hairs breadth but more critically scaring the wits out of the men to either side and suddenly decisively splitting the century into two distinct halves separated by a twofoot gap unless it was closed at once the tribesmen would be in there hacking furiously to either side and in all likelihood shattering the ths already fragile confidence completely marcus dropped the wooden pole drawing his spatha with a flourish and reaching for the hilt of his gladius in readiness to throw himself into the gap but as he pulled the short sword from its scabbard and steeled himself to fight he was elbowed aside by a bulky figure syria qadir had snatched up a shield and beaten him to it leaving him standing impotently with both swords ready to fight but without any means of getting at the venicones hammering at the shield wall behind which he was trapped watching helplessly and aghast at his chosen mans likely fate he was amazed to see the previously placid hamian bury his sword deep in the closest tribesmans guts then kick him off the blade while parrying an attack from his left with an almost dismissive flick of his borrowed shield he swung the blade already running red with blood backhanded hacking into another mans neck and almost severing his victims head from its shoulders with the force of the blow a spray of hot blood showered the front rankers around him its coppery stink filling the air deasura the scream came not from the nearberserk qadir but from one of the archers standing close to him and like the clap of thunder that presages the full fury of a gathering storm it galvanised the hamians to sudden almost unbelievable action in the space of a heartbeat their blood was up in a way that marcus would never have predicted most of the front rank screaming their defiance and amazingly gloriously actually fighting back with their previously useless swords not all of their thrusts were anywhere near a target but within the space of ten seconds there were half a dozen more dead and dying tribesmen at their feet for the loss of one man who charged out of the line in the full grip of his newly discovered bloodlust and died quickly and messily once separated from the protection of the centurys line of shields the century had been transformed from hapless terror to clumsy but effective attack by qadirs sudden lunge into their front rank and with their blood up the hamians showed no sign of backing off their intended prey thinking quickly marcus abandoned his original plan and gestured to the nd cohort watch officers to hold their ground then ran to the end of the ths line bellowing down its length to get his mens attention eighth century a brief somehow unnatural quiet fell across the tiny battlefield the remaining venicones attention grabbed by his appearance at the end of the roman line just as much as that of his own men eighth century advance to the riverbank a pair of barbarian warriors one lean and sinewy with a pair of throwing spears and a small hand shield the other a giant of a man with a sixfootlong broadsword broke from the knot of surviving warriors and sprinted across the narrow gap towards him with furious purpose allowing no time for the hamians to respond marcus stepped forward purposefully to meet their charge ducking and twisting under the first of the thin mans spears as it hissed past his head taking the spearman for his first target given the lanky warriors twopace lead on his larger companion he slapped the mans shield with his extended spatha before spinning in a lightningfast full circle to the spearmans right the unexpected move put the barbarian between him and the broadswords greater threat and marcus scythed the long cavalry sword round in a long arc that ended in the spearmans unprotected flank the devastating backhanded spatha cut open his side beneath his ribcage to his spine the grievously wounded warrior dropped his shield with a howl of agony his bowels voiding themselves in a stinking rush as he tottered on legs turned to jelly by the wounds fearful pain shifting his balance swiftly from his bent left leg marcus sprang upright kicking the grievously wounded warrior on to his comrade even as the other man drew his massive sword back only to be thrown off balance as the dying spearman flew backwards into him without hesitation marcus stepped in fast and thrust the spathas threefoot length through the dying spearmans body and into the swordsmans guts letting go of the swords hilt and raising the gladius over his head he flashed the blade down to point at the frozen venicones snarling at the hamians behind him to the riverbank no prisoners the archers swept forward with the irresistible force of an incoming tide gladius blades licking in and out of their line in silver and red flashes as they put the suddenly terrified tribesmen to the sword the venicone warriors that remained either went down fighting against impossible odds or broke and ran for the fallen trees bridge to the eastern bank barely a dozen escaped the hamians onslaught two of them tripping in their haste to cross the river and falling into the fastmoving flow washed away into the mist in seconds the hamians left in gloriously undisputed possession of the riverbank were suddenly exhausted as the brief exhilarating combat rage washed out of their bodies more than one man found himself yawning uncontrollably where he had felt godlike power only a moment before now i see why you people speak of battle the way you do marcus turned from wrenching his spatha from the bodies of the two venicone warriors to find qadir standing at his shoulder his sword and shield hanging loosely by his sides this was the qadir he had grown accustomed to once more quietly spoken and considered it was quite amazing one moment i was watching my men suffer at the hands of those barbarians the next he ran out of words a small tremor in the corner of one eye evidencing his sudden exhaustion marcus slapped his shoulder hard a blow calculated to sting the next minute brother the animal in you found his release you took your iron to the men that were killing your men and you fought like a demon dont try to rationalise your rage recognise it for what it was and what it will be again if need be old julius had better watch out you could give him more than a run for his money oh yes one more thing deasura qadir nodded she is atargatis our goddess in battle we call on her as the dea syria a sudden yelp from the riverbank had them both ducking for cover marcus from long practice qadir with a certain selfconsciousness but no less speed a flight of arrows from across the river slammed into the slumping archers dropping one man choking with a barb in his mouth and wounding several others in arm and leg beyond the protection of their ring mail the th shuffled backwards out of the heavy rain of arrows each mans shield studded with feathered shafts by the time they had gained the safety of their previous position all but invisible to the barbarian archers qadir stalked away up the line counting under his breath and shaking his head sadly on his return how many the chosen mans reply was delivered in a downcast tone one hundred and fortythree men capable of fighting we have eight dead including the men we left by the river and the rest are wounded in varying ways some of them will live if we can get medical attention marcus shook his head little chance of that im afraid the nearest real medic is miles away with the legions were more likely to see the venicones face to face again and soon the two prefects and their first spears were standing on the hillside behind the st cohorts defence of the ford watching the venicone warriors on the far bank as they stood immobile in silent ranks eerily quiet as they waited behind the mists diaphanous veil they cant ford the river here not while its flowing this fast and not with our spears waiting for them and they cant cross up or downstream because weve got men waiting for them there too what else can they do but wait frontinius fell silent for a moment as he stared down at the silent tribesmen massed on the rivers far bank then turned to his opposite number how many of them would you say there are down there the nds cohorts first spear pursed his lips i can see four perhaps five thousand of them or so why are you wondering where the rest are frontinius nodded slowly so am i that many of them just dont seem enough for their leaders to have made the gamble to throw their lot in with calgus i would have been expecting ten thousand at the very l hang on whats that a body of barbarian warriors was advancing quickly into view up the reds western bank running ten paces behind a single man with his sword drawn and for a moment the watching officers believed that some great catastrophe had occurred farther to the south and the venicones were upon them then even as frontinius opened his mouth to start shouting orders he found neutos hand on his arm in unexpected restraint hold up thats my man appius leading them in those bluenoses must be your tame votadini frontinius narrowed his eyes and peered down at the newcomers youre right coming with me neuto nodded tersely and frontinius turned to the prefects saluting quickly excuse us gentlemen the two men bounded down the hill frontinius favouring his bad leg meeting appius at the bottom the panting officer gasped out a brief account of the ths crossing of the red beckoning martos forward to join them the votadini leader stepped up nodding his respect to the officers while appius eased himself out of their field of view then turned and slipped unnoticed away to the rear your officer has his men in good order but he told me to warn you that they will only hold for as long as they have arrows to shoot you must take reinforcements to them or the venicones will cross the river and sweep your men away frontinius turned to neuto three centuries his colleague thought for a moment four id say we have no idea what we might be running into frontinius turned to the st cohorts line along the riverbank shouting to his officers centurions julius dubnus rufius and titus to me and bring your centuries with you quickly the rest of you take a wider spacing and keep your guard up theres no telling when that lot might choose to start shooting arrows at you otho you have command here until i get back take your instruction from the prefect he turned back to martos pointing to the hill behind them youve done well but this is our fight now stay here and keep out of the way unless you dont have a choice the officers marched off to get the st cohorts centuries moving and martos spoke to the men gathered around him without taking his eyes off their retreating backs so do we stay here and wait for something to happen as instructed or do we go with them and make it happen his one surviving chieftain stepped forward we should go and find a fight my lord although we may be mistaken for the venicones in this mist martos nodded grimly its a risk ill take we fight on the hill above them furius and scaurus stood in uncomfortable silence watching as the four centuries disengaged from their defensive line and hastily formed a column of march a movement below them caught scauruss eye and he nudged furius pointing down at the running man its that officer of yours again appius is it but whys he carrying a torch at this time of day and whats in that jar prefect furius stiffened recognising the bright red pot jar gods below thats my bloody naphtha on the riverbank downstream the hamians waited nervously watching as the venicone warriors once more built up their strength on the reds western bank in ones and twos crossing the bridge in safety now that their opponents arrows were exhausted the hamians having shot back the scattering of barbarian arrows they had scavenged from the ground around them marcus and qadir stared into the mist spotting figures moving on the other bank but they were too far back from the river to be sure given the mists obstruction morban joined them his standard held in one hand as he stared across the rivers thirtyfoot width whats happening over there it looks like marcus nodded like a body of men passing to the south a lot of men sounds like it too from the little i can hear with this mist deadening everything nothing we can do about it though so i dont intend giving it very much thought qadir shivered his battle rage had long since burned out leaving him damp and tired there must be sixty or seventy of them now should we attack again marcus shook his head his gaze fixed on the gathering tribesmen huddling defiantly around the fallen trees branches soon i want more of them across the river before we go again more more if we attack too soon their archers will pepper us as we close for the fight but if there are enough of them across the river their view will be blocked besides we were successful last time mainly as a result of your heroics this time were going to do it my way he looked to either side of the hamian line to check that the tungrian century was still in position the soldiers prone on the damp ground and therefore effectively invisible in the mist the barbarians continued to cross the river until he judged that there were enough of them on the western bank for his purpose he stepped forward raising his sword to get the hamians attention eighth century youve done it once you can do it again to the river the hamians went forward without bravado but steadily enough while the venicones waited for their attack with grim faces aware from the corpses clustered around them that the previous fight had gone against them when the archers had advanced into swordreach the barbarians began their furious assault in nearsilence they were fighting for their lives hacking brutally at the hamians shields and helmets and for a moment as first one and then another of the men close to him reeled from the fight with horrific head wounds marcus wondered whether hed left it too late to make the attack the century held its ground though fighting back with the grim resolve of men that knew they lacked any other option however terrifying the disfiguring injuries of their comrades it was time for the other century to play their part eighth century at the walk pull back morban as we discussed it he exchanged a glance with qadir both of their faces taut with the moments uncertainty if the century had mastered the idea of the fighting retreat they would pull off the simple trick he had planned for the barbarians if not then the plan would most likely turn into a bloody rout slowly almost reluctantly they retreated at the pace the standardbearer was dictating qadirs long pole held across their backs to keep them steady as the hamians pulled back from the barbarian warriors their unbroken wall of shields and readied swords kept the venicones advancing in their wake firmly at bay for thirty steady paces the hamians pulled back their pace remaining even and their attention focused on the warriors to their front nearly marcus glanced quickly to his left looking for the watch officer he needed to be waiting there the nd cohort man now on his feet and waiting for the signal caught his eye through the mist and raised his sword to show that he was ready looking to the right he found the standardbearer equally ready to fight eighth century stand fast it was the pivotal moment would the hamians be capable of halting their retreat however measured qadirs bellow rasped out along the wavering line hold them deasura the response was immediate a stiffening of backs and a shouted response deasura the hamians stopped in their tracks catching the advancing venicones off guard as they blundered on to the waiting swords recoiling from the shock of the suddenly stiffened roman defence they presented the opportunity marcus had been waiting for tungrians attack the nd cohort centuries rose from the mistcovered ground to either side of the barbarians still unnoticed by the tribesmen the watch officer to marcuss left spat on the wet grass hefting his broadbladed thrusting spear and muttering encouragement to the men alongside him come on then my lads if these puny little bastards can show the bluenoses the colour of their guts i dont see any reason why we shouldnt have some fun too advance four tent parties to either side the tungrians advanced swiftly from their hiding places driving hard into the flanks of the venicones with their spears some of the enemy warriors fell without ever seeing their attackers others turned to face dim figures half seen in the mist and went down under their attack without ever raising their swords in defence turning to face the unexpected attack from their right the beleaguered warriors offered an undefended target to the four tent parties still waiting unseen to their left rising out of the mist they too tore into the unprotected flank presented to them spears flashing from their line of shields to spill yet more venico blood caught between the two attacks and with the hamians line of shields obdurate to their front the tribesmen fought and died where they stood the slaughter complete in less than a minute panting from their exertion the watch officers found marcus and saluted both mens armour sprayed with blood from the massacre what now sir take your men and his attention faltered as a light grew in the mist to their left swelling from a glow to a point of fire in seconds appius ran out of the mist his blazing torch casting shadows across the waiting soldiers breathing hard he stopped running and arched his body backwards to ease the pain in his sides take this he passed the torch to marcus hefting the jar as he sucked air into his lungs to speak again naphtha belongs to our prefect magic stuff you just put a splash on a fire then set a spark to it burns lovely we empty this on that tree itll burn like yearold firewood ill do the pouring you throw the torch on once im clear the two officers moved forward accompanied by two tent parties of tungrians who hunted down the few tribesmen lurking in the mist close to the riverbank gulping another deep breath into his heaving chest the tungrian centurion unstoppered the heavy jar and stepped into the foliage pouring splashes of the pungent fluid over the branches with the trees topmost foliage ready to burn he stepped away putting a hand up to marcus to forestall any move to throw the torch into the fume laden air plenty left lets do this properly stepping through the spread of branches to the rivers bank he poured more naphtha over the lower branches emptying the jar with a last flourish and dropping it into the mass of leaves turning to leave he staggered as if he had tripped putting a hand into the naphthasoaked foliage to stop himself from pitching on to his face as he straightened up from his crouching position the arrow which had struck him protruding from his neck and a look of disbelief on his face a volley of spears arced low across the river one of them punching through his armoured back and dropping him face down across the trees leafy mass raising his head with agonised slowness he lifted an arm beckoning feebly to the waiting soldiers the standardbearer started forward but found his arm gripped by the stonyfaced centurion that isnt what hes asking for the fallen officer waved again pointing feebly at the trees pale foliage a pair of tribesmen mounted the trunk ignoring the reek of naphtha as they scurried across the river to reach him the dying mans head and helmet would make a mighty prize marcus lifted the torch offering it to the watch officer and standardbearer hes got an arrow through his neck and a spear in his back and those bluenosed bastards will have his head off before he dies unless we do something this is what he wants hes your officer do either of you want to both men shook their heads in that case may mithras forgive me for sending him a warrior in such circumstances he threw the torch into the trees mass of fading greenery as the flaming stave hit the fallen trees branches the naphtha ignited with a heavy thump shooting a ball of fire unlike anything that any of the men present had ever witnessed high into the misty air appius reared up out of the flames with one fist held high then sank slowly back into their grip somewhere in the blaze something exploded presumably the jar and a fresh gout of flame bloomed briefly in the branches already well alight the barbarians who had crossed the river to take the dying centurions head dived from the burning trees into the river their hair and clothes burning and the mist around the violent blaze vanished in seconds vaporised by the intense heat with a clear view over the river for the first time marcuss eyes widened at the sight of hundreds of venicone warriors more than could ever have made their way down the rocky path alongside the falls he turned to speak to qadir and saw movement out of the corner of his eye pointing he bellowed the only warning that the two centuries were going to get ripping his spatha from its scabbard venicones the warriors came out of the mist to the romans rear over one hundred strong their swords flashing orange in the fires flickering light and fell on the hamians with savage war cries caught unawares the archers dithered for a moment dying by the dozen as the barbarians hacked and thrust at their unprepared line marcus bellowed a desperate order knowing that his command was seconds away from rout and slaughter turn and fight fight or die with thirtyodd men having been felled by the sudden attack the men not already dead or dying lifted their shields into a rough wall and momentarily halted the slaughter marcus bellowed an order at the tungrians pointing with his sword to emphasise the urgency in his voice flanks the two men nodded and ordered their men waiting behind the hamians to run to either side of their wavering line temporarily preventing the barbarians from overlapping their defence qadir walked down the decimated hamian lines rear bending to shout into his centurions ear over the guttural cries of their attackers they must have a crossing point somewhere downstream marcus nodded grimly his swords held ready by his sides nothing we can do about that our only hope now is that the fire attracts some attention a soldier in front of the two men spun on his feet and dropped with his throat opened and fountaining blood and marcus stepped into the gap before his chosen man had the chance he battered away the killers bloodied sword with his gladius thrusting the spathas point into his throat another warrior stepped into the fight and swung his sword up for a downstroke opening himself up long enough for marcus to take a fast step forward and whip a booted foot into his groin doubled over with the pain the swordsman was an easy kill as the young roman hacked hard at the mans bowed head chopping into his skull and dropping him to the sodden turf around him his century was slowly remorselessly being taken to pieces a continual stream of venicone warriors strengthening their attackers as they hacked and chopped at the hamians the tungrians alongside them were suffering equally and marcus guessed that he had less than half his original number of men facing perhaps twice as many of the enemy he parried a venicone spear with his gladius killing the man wielding it and then the men to either side with swift economical attacks that seemed to happen with unconscious volition his mind focused more on their predicament than the fight the man next to him went down with a spear thrust through his mouth choking on the blood that was gushing down his windpipe with a horrible gurgle and qadir stepped in alongside him scowling over his shield at the odds they were facing as the two men shared a momentary glance preparing to die where they stood a shout rang out over the din of their doomed fight tungria tungriaaaa with a start marcus realised that there were helmeted heads looming over the barbarian left flank big men their faces contorted with rage as they hammered into the abruptly wrongfooted venicones their axes rising and falling in arcs of bright silver and sprays of blood the bears th century had discarded their shields to a man and were wielding their weapons like barbarian berserkers each man painting himself with blood from head to toe as they raved at the venicone warriors like men possessed eighth century attack attack the remaining hamians responded to qadirs exhortation like punchdrunk boxers their swordthrusts no better than a reflex reaction to the bellowed command hardly a man put his blade to his intended target but with tituss men to their flank and rear in full battle rage and the soldiers to their front seemingly intent on revenge where a moment before they had been all but out of the fight the venicones were unable to offer resistance they turned and fled still dying under the tungrian axes running wildly in all directions to escape their implacable enemies the hamians stood in their uneven line unable to offer pursuit as the barbarians ran able only to watch hollow eyed as another tungrian century appeared out of the mist julius and frontinius hurried to the ths line seeking marcus he saluted aware that he was trembling on the edge of exhaustion the first spear clapped a hand to his young officers shoulder in delight ignoring the blood that stained his armour its good to see you centurion wed written you off hours ago your situation marcus pulled his helmet off dragging a bloody hand through his sweatsoaked hair first spear the eighth century and our second cohort colleagues here have held this crossing since we used it to reach this side of the river as you can see its now useless thanks to the bravery of centurion appius he told the story of their defence of the crossing point in swift economical terms frontinius nodded approvingly at the short tales end turning to the two centuries remnants and raising his voice to make himself heard well done all of you very well done id say youve more than played your part today centurion corvus take your men back to the ford you can stand guard at the camp in case any of those tattooed bastards get past us he turned to julius pointing south into the mist centurion julius take all four centuries south down the riverbank and find their other crossing point and quickly that can only have been a probe and wherever it is theyre crossing theyll still be putting men across the river we cant afford for them to build their strength up whatever theyre using to get across make it unusable and then form a stop line in case theyve already got more men across than we know about i think a few of them got past us but all theyll find is the rest of our two cohorts now centurion corvus lets you and i march for the camp and you can tell me about how you came to be here at all rather than face down in the mud on the other side of the river and for that matter how you managed to scatter barbarian dead around quite so liberally given your mens lack of any battle experience martos led his warriors away from the ford without any of the defenders seeming to notice climbing the steep hill to the south of the defences in long rangy strides that put them on the flat summit within two minutes with their leader setting the pace the votadini headed south along the crests rolling surface martos staring intently down into the mist for a sight of the place he was looking for after a few minutes he saw the hamians marching tiredly north along the rivers bank followed closely by the survivors of the tungrian century cant be too far now he led his men cautiously down the valleys steep slope their swords drawn and ready his eyes scanning the ground there a man to his right had spotted the scene of the battle to hold the riverbank marked by both the burning trees billowing smoke and the corpses scattered across the rivers narrow plain by the score martos waved his men forward and down the hill make it quick the longer were here the more chance of our being surprised julius took his four centuries south at a gentle jog balancing the need to make haste with that of his men being ready to fight when they met the inevitable opposition the other three centurions ran alongside him their faces grim as they listened to his instructions it has to be another warband thats the reason those lads back at the ford havent attacked again theyre waiting for this lot to turn our right flank theyll be building up their strength ready to attack the riverbank hoping to sweep away any blocking force and fall on the defenders at the ford without warning when we find them we form a threecentury line and then advance to make contact with the bears lads held back in reserve we kill every bluenose we can find then we let the axemen loose on whatever theyre using as a bridge while the rest of us use our shields and spears to protect them as best we can right its time to slow down and listen he signalled the advance to slow to walking pace and ordered a quiet deployment into battle line the muffled jingling of the soldiers equipment the only clue to their presence as they drew their swords and hefted their shields ready to fight they could hear the enemy now a distant murmur of voices in the mist as they advanced cautiously down the riverbank julius signalled to his brother officers pointing to his eyes and calling softly to them theyre closer than they sound in this fucking mist keep your eyes open with a gentle gust of wind the mist shifted momentarily opening a window on the venicones gathered by the rivers bank fuck me sideways the veteran scarface in his usual place at the centre of the th centurys line stared aghast at the scene revealed as the mist rolled aside for a moment hundreds of venico warriors were milling about on the riverbank less than fifty paces in front of them clearly waiting for their leaders to send them along the river in force behind them a continual stream of men were crossing the trunks of three trees that had been felled and lashed together to span the rivers churning course the red now foamed and gurgled around rocks that protruded from the water as the river approached the first in a series of falls that dropped it abruptly into a stonewalled canyon that would prevent any further progress down either of the rivers banks behind the roman line julius took one look at the scene laid out before them and stepped up behind his men taking a deep breath and bellowing his orders spears ready advance the venicone warriors alerted to the presence of their enemy by his voice came bounding forward to the attack their voices raised in a clamour of screamed abuse and swords brandished over their heads front rank throw the front rankers ran swiftly forward and launched their spears across the twentyfiveyard gap between their line and the oncoming warriors the heavybladed missiles slamming into the barbarian charge and dropping dozens of the venicones to the steaming turf screaming in agony rear rank throw the front rank had followed their training and gone down on one knee once their spears were in the air ignoring the oncoming warriors to allow their fellows an unrestricted throw the second volley of spears was thrown lower than the first their trajectories flatter as their targets raced closer and the missiles again took a vicious toll of the attackers who were for the most part unarmoured all along the front of the mass of charging warriors men fell under the thumping impact of the spears the flying blades piercing their limbs and bodies and dropping them helplessly to the ground impeding their fellows who trampled over the fallen in their urgency to get at the romans line the tungrian front rank drew their swords with a massed scrape of iron on scabbard fittings slamming their shields into an unbroken wall that stretched from the riverbank to almost a third of the way up the valleys side with a mighty roar the tribesmen recovered the momentum stolen from them by the volleys of spears and dashed themselves against the roman shields swords flashing as they rose and fell in vicious arcs unlike the selgovae tribesmen that the cohort had fought to a standstill at the battle of lost eagle the venicones were incandescent in their battle fury disdaining any pretence of selfpreservation as they hacked and chopped at the tungrians shields and the helmeted heads that peered over them taking any opportunity to attack the men behind them even if it opened them up to devastating counterattack from the soldiers short thrusting swords julius stalked down the rear of his commands line to find rufius marshalling his centurys defences feeding men into the line as the soldiers to their front suffered under the barbarian swords his brother officer nodded grimly inclining his head to the warriors railing at the shields almost close enough to reach out and touch and shouted over the clamour of their assault this is more like the old days if the lads that faced us at lost eagle had been this fired up i doubt we would have survived long enough for the legions to show up julius nodded grimly one hand gripping his swords hilt tightly and theyve still got men crossing the river behind them unless we can chop that bridge off theyll just wear us down with numbers a soldier to their left went down under a barbarian axeblow that cleaved through the curved iron plate of his helmet staggering blank eyed back from the shield wall before pitching headlong to the bloody grass with the weapon still embedded in his head rufiuss chosen man thrust a rear ranker into the breach the soldier stepping forward to put his sword into the disarmed axemans throat as the man leapt at him with only his teeth and nails for weapons rufius raised an eyebrow ducking momentarily as a spear flashed past the two men clearly aimed at the enticing target of their helmet crests fuck me theyre keen perhaps we should send the bears boys round them to attack the bridge perhaps not little brother they turned to find titus standing behind them surveying the venicones strength beyond their shields with a face equally as grim as their own there must be five hundred of them we wouldnt even get to the bridge before they cut us down like dogs what this little skirmish is crying out for is a flank attack to get them fighting on two sides then id have some chance of succeeding without something to distract them well only hold them off until they get enough men across that bridge to overwhelm us julius started looking over rufiuss shoulder fuck he started running up the tungrian line his sword out of its scabbard and rufius and titus turned to look at what had caught his eye in the shield wall to their right where the valley floor met the steep hillside that rose above it the crested helmet of a centurion rose proudly above the helmets of the men to either side barbarian swords were rising and falling in flashing arcs around the embattled officer clearly drawn to their chance of taking a roman officers head like wasps to honey dubnus even as rufius realised his friends predicament the centurion staggered back out of the line and a mighty roar went up from the men facing the th century pressing forward with the scent of victory in their nostrils antenoch and lupuss afternoon had been relatively noneventful the pair had been kept busy taking rations to the centuries manning the riverbank with each brief visit to their comrades both had taken a moment to stare out between the waiting soldiers at their enemy standing with apparent patience on the opposite bank antenoch pulled the child away from the tungrian line thinned out by the removal of the four centuries the first spear had taken south down the riverbank to the degree that the boy no longer had to duck to stare between the soldiers legs to see the venicone warriors lurking on the far bank theres more of them over there than we can see in this bloody mist that lot are waiting there because their leaders know they keep us here to face them down just by being there the question is where are the rest of them prefect scaurus was asking the same question of himself two or three times on the verge of sending another two centuries down after the first four each time he weakened however one look at his colleagues face was enough to convince him not to do so prefect furius was staring pale faced and trembling down at the massed warriors on the far bank his eyes wide with the same fear that scaurus had seen on his face ten years before he watched antenoch and the boy toil past his perch on the hillside once more and smiled wanly wondering whether a position with such simple responsibilities would be better than the crushing burden of command bearing down on him movement in the mist to the south caught his eye a century or so of weary men marching over the brow of the steep escarpment from the south his first reaction as he recognised the centurion leading the soldiers behind him out of the murk alongside first spear frontinius was a wolfish smile of triumph but the emotion faded quickly as he realised the sheer number of men missing from the ranks marching exhaustedly behind his officers even with what appeared to be another century bringing up the rear the hamians staggered to a halt clearly at the end of their tether most of them bearing the marks of men that had been in a desperate fight their shields scored and notched and their armour black with the drying blood of their enemies many of them were supporting walking wounded as he watched his mens obvious distress with pity and pride scauruss attention was drawn away from what was happening in front of him for a terrible fateful moment antenoch saw them first half a dozen ragged warriors loping down the hill in front of them towards the unguarded supply carts in the tungrian rear their swords gleaming dully in the mist he pushed the child under the cart from which they were unloading the rations snatching up his shield and unsheathing his own blade as he turned to face the barbarians bounding down the slope to attack shouting a warning to the soldiers two hundred paces away on the far side of what remained of the previous nights camp his cry sounded weak and muffled in the mists dampness and the venicone warrior leading the pack grinned in anticipation swinging his sword in a vicious hacking blow at the lone soldier antenoch parried the strike upwards with his gladius stepping in fast to drive his helmets brow guard into the other mans face so hard that he felt bone shatter under the blows force reversing his grip on the swords hilt he ducked under the next mans spearthrust burying the gladiuss length in his side and snatching away the spear leaving the blade sheathed in the crippled barbarians liver the remaining warriors spread out around him wary of the spears long reach but quickly surrounding him with blades and forcing him to twist and turn continually stabbing with the weapons wide blade in a doomed attempt to hold them off one of the warriors slid silently around to his rear stepping close to the cart and landing a slashing blow across the back of the romans thigh dropping him on to one knee with his hamstring severed the warriors howl of victory became a scream of pain as lupus scuttled out from under the cart and dragged the razorsharp blade of his knife across the back of the barbarians ankle the tendon parted with an audible thump and the venicone staggered away on his good leg and fell to his knees waving his sword at the child and screaming with fury antenoch turned to the boy grimacing with pain and muttered a single word between gritted teeth run as lupus watched his eyes wide with the shock of combat another warrior stepped in and butchered the stricken soldier grabbing his helmets broad neck protector and jerking it up to expose the back of his neck slamming his sword through the space between antenochs mail coat and his helmeted head the tribesman speared the swords blade through his throat a fine drizzle of the dying mans blood flicked across the boys face as he stared without comprehension at the horror inches from his face antenochs mouth gaped open but no sound issued other than his croaking death rattle his eyes rolled upwards as he lost consciousness and his body sagged twitching to the ground lupus still frozen to the spot looked up into the face of his protectors killer as the warrior ripped his sword free from antenochs neck then drew back his arm to hack the child down swinging the blade out in a wide arc that held lupus mesmerised as the venicone screamed his rage into the boys face in a sudden blur of motion and with a crunching impact the barbarian was gone punched away by the impact of a shield smashed into his body by a figure sprinting out of the mist the warrior went down with his face wrecked battered out of shape by the impact of the shields heavy bronze boss and with blood pouring from his shattered nose he groaned once put a hand to his ruined cheekbone and collapsed to the grass only partially conscious lupus stared up from his crouch between the carts traces watching numbly as marcus tossed the shield aside flashed out his gladius alongside the longerbladed spatha and turned his ire on the man the child had wounded swinging the cavalry sword at the hobbling warriors throat in a precise arc he dropped the wounded man to the turf with blood sheeting from his opened neck then turned back to the remaining barbarians with a tightlipped snarl that hardened to barely restrained rage as he lined up the blades points he drew in a long breath and allowed it to escape in a slow exhalation as he paced slowly forward eying the three remaining barbarians with cold calculation as they dithered between fight and flight his eyes meeting the childs empty stare and hardening as they flicked back to the venicones for all their numerical advantage the warriors quailed at the sight of a helmetless soldier daubed with mud and blood his eyes flint hard above a mouth slitted with contempt one of them groped on the floor in front of him unable to take his eyes from the romans approach as he picked up the spear that antenoch had dropped the attack delivered after several long seconds of silence was all the more shocking for the speed with which marcus took his iron to the barbarians too fast for the stunned child to follow from his hiding place turning aside the spearmans frantic defence and punching his gladius through the mans ribs he deflected a stabbing sword from his left with an almost absentminded parry with the spatha slanting the long sword to allow the mans attack to slide along its polished surface and extend the attack farther than the barbarian had intended then kicked his legs out from under him and pitched him face first to the ground leaving the short sword in the spearmans chest he feinted momentarily at the last man standing to put him on the back foot then finished the fallen barbarian with brutal speed hacking the spatha deep into his spine before turning away to tackle the last remaining warrior ripping his gladius free as he passed the dying spearman he brutally kicked him face first into the mud the last man turned to run but managed less than five paces before the enraged officer ran him down spearing the long sword through his left thigh and dropping him howling to the ground he waited for the venicone warrior to roll on to his back before finishing the fight batting aside the mans sword with something close to contempt before pushing his spatha into his chest in a slow measured thrust watching the barbarian contort in agony as the irons cold bite pushed through his organs the stink of faeces hung in the air as the dying warriors bowels voided themselves a hard death marcus turned to find scaurus and arminius standing behind him their swords unsheathed both men were breathing hard from their run from the opposite hill marcus twisted the sword and pulled it from the dying mans body inspecting the point for any damage then casually ran the blade through the throat of the concussed warrior he had smashed aside with his shield not hard enough they killed my clerk the prefect nodded simple agreement turning away to look for lupus and finding him staring at the hill above them at least you managed to save the child thats some he turned to look at whatever was holding the childs attention seeing another group of warriors staring down at them from the hills crest nine or ten strong marcus and arminius followed his glance their faces hardening as the barbarians started down the slope towards them if youll allow me prefect this is a job for your man here and me marcus fell silent as the prefect bent to pick up one of the dead venicone warriors swords seeing an amused smile touch arminiuss face scaurus drew his gladius taking up a twohanded fighting stance without ever taking his eyes off the oncoming warriors thank you centurion but ill take my chances alongside the pair of you if its all the same to you the first warriors stormed in to attack the trio before marcus had any chance to reply assaulting the romans in a furious whirl of swords and axes in a second marcus was fighting for his life ducking under a wild swordblow and hacking his gladius deep into his attackers thigh before shouldering the man into the path of another warrior sensing movement behind him he swayed his upper body back out of the path of a spearthrust watching the wickedly sharp iron blade slide past within inches of his face he flicked the spathas blade down into the muddy ground relinquishing the swords hilt and grabbing the spears shaft with his right hand then leaned in to thrust his gladius up under the spearmans jaw leaving the sword embedded in the dying mans throat lifting the spear from the warriors numb fingers he pivoted back to the wounded barbarian and the man into whose path he had pushed him reversing the weapon with a casual flourish and stepping in to plant the butt spike in the wounded barbarians throat in a spectacular shower of blood as the spike tore into the mans neck shifting on to his back foot he flipped the spear lengthwise again to present its razorsharp blade before stamping his right foot forward again thrusting the iron head deep into the other barbarians guts and ripping it free with a savage twist that contorted the warriors face with pain the contents of his bowels gushing down his legs as his eyes rolled up he watched the mans face with savage intent lost to blood rage as the barbarian slumped to the floor ramming the spears blade between his ribs and through his heart arminiuss guttural shout snapped him back into the fight behind you he pivoted ripping the spear free of the fallen warriors body to find a pair of warriors within a halfdozen paces and charging in fast without time either to pull the weapon back for the throw or turn fully enough to use the blade he dived forward beneath their raised swords tripping his attackers with the spears shaft and rolling out from beneath their tumbling bodies to where his spatha waited its point buried in the mud dropping the spear and snatching at the swords hilt he sprinted back into the fight hacking at the closer of the two the swords razorsharp blade opening the mans head up like ripe fruit then kicked the sword loose from the lolling corpse to parry an attack from his companion too slow the mans booted foot hooked his leg and pitched him to the ground with a thump driving the breath from his body and breaking his hold on the spathas hilt the sword fell uselessly to the ground beside him and the barbarian smiled at him in triumph his swords point suddenly at marcuss throat with a cold bite that froze his attempts to regain his feet groping unnoticed at his belt for his dagger he found instead the tribulus given to him on a cold spring hillside far to the south and months before by rufius and tugged the vicious little device free forming a fist around its iron spikes the venico standing astride him laughed down at him lifting his shoulders and taking a firm grip on his swords hilt in readiness to ram the blade home into the romans windpipe marcus was a split second faster slamming his fist up into the mans unprotected groin and spearing the iron barb that protruded from between his fingers between his balls and deep into the root of his penis the barbarian threw his head back and screamed in agony his sword dangling forgotten as he staggered away and marcus rolled to one side scooping up the spatha and surging to his feet to behead the man with a single blow he looked to his comrades fearful of what he might find a mile down the river the fight was slowly but certainly turning against the tungrian detachment sent to cover the defences southern flank julius watched with growing consternation as the number of venico warriors ranged against the three centuries in his defensive line strengthened by the minute a stream of tattooed barbarians crossing the river behind them to add two men to their strength for every one killed by the tungrians his men were tiring now their initial battle fury exhausted and while he knew they would fight on for a good deal longer he could tell that they were no longer battling as hard as before while the tungrians were increasingly huddled behind their shields striking out with their short swords when the opportunity presented itself the venicones bolstered by the flow of fresh warriors from the mass waiting on the other side of the river were gradually gaining the upper hand growing in confidence as their strength increased he looked to the rear peering past the stolid lines of the th centurys axemen waiting for their turn to join the fight in the mist knowing that the rest of the cohort probably had problems enough that reinforcement was unlikely another five minutes of this and well have to start putting the bears lads into the fight julius nodded at rufiuss muttered statement hows the boy the older man glanced down at dubnuss prone form his wound temporarily staunched by the bandage stuffed through the hole in his armour by a bandage carrier who had shaken his head unhappily and moved on to the next casualty with the hardbitten detachment of a man who had seen death and mutilation too many times before to be affected by anything as prosaic as a spear wound still with us id say hell pull through if only we can get him out of here julius snorted pushing another of his centurys rear rank forward as a front ranker went down with an axe buried deeply in his head the heavy blade cleft clean through his helmets bracing bars and deep into his skull the rear rankers to either side grabbed him by the shoulders of his mail coat and threw him backwards past the officers and out from under the soldiers feet to lie wide eyed and spasming intermittently on the wet ground the bandage carrier gave his twitching body a cursory glance before turning back to the task of bandaging a wounded mans arm opened up from wrist to elbow by a venicone sword not much chance of that we stand here and most likely well die like rats in a barrel bear get your boys ready to his head jerked up as he caught movement on the hill above them out of the corner of his eye what the fuck men were mustering on the slope to the barbarian left perfectly positioned for an attack down into their unprotected rear rufius stared up the hill alongside him straining tired eyes to make out the detail masked by the curtains of mist drifting across the battlefield its a century of our lads although they look bloody odd to me scruffy bastards from the look of it julius laughed grimly tucking his vine stick into his belt and drawing his gladius as the men on the hill above gave a guttural war cry and poured down the hill in an undisciplined charge that narrowed rufiuss eyes with bafflement those boys arent ours grandfather you need a new set of peepers thats martos and whats left of his warband wearing our kit and getting stuck into the venicones i might not like the man but ill be buggered if ill let this chance go begging bear get ready to attack to the bridge he elbowed the trumpeter in the ribs blow the advance boy burst your fucking lungs the trumpets call sang out over the riverbank the notes stiffening backs previously bent to huddle into the cover of their shields as standardbearers bellowed encouragement to their comrades julius stepped up to the line motioning with both arms to the three centuries chosen men to put their poles to the soldiers backs and start pushing he took a deep breath and roared his command the bellowed words cutting across the sounds of clashing metal tungrians either we deal with these barbarian arsefuckers now or we die before our time advance as the newcomers burst on to the venicones left flank in a flurry of hacking swords the tungrians took their iron to the distracted tribesmen with renewed vigour spending the last of their strength recklessly as they saw their one chance to snatch victory from the certainty of defeat as they stepped up to the venicones with new purpose hammering at the warriors with their shields before stabbing their swords in drilled unison the th century took their chance trotting around the end of the tungrian line and past the mass of enraged votadini assaulting the enemy flank before breaking into two halves five tent parties assaulted the barbarian rear while the remainder led by titus charged into the venicones still coming across the improvised bridge their already bloodied axes rose and fell in pitiless arcs each blow chopping a venico warrior to the ground in bloodied ruin attacking unprepared and unarmoured warriors from the rear the forty men at the venicones rear killed three times their strength in less than a minute before the barbarians even had time to turn and fight the warband beset from the rear by bloodpainted giants wielding their weapons with terrible ferocity promptly lost all reason and threw themselves at the tungrian line in a desperate attempt to escape their abandon opening them up to vengeful soldiers who only seconds before had been suffering under their swords with a sudden collective shudder of men at the end of their tether the warband broke into a melee of fleeing warriors pursued across the battlefield by soldiers and votadini warriors whose blood was well and truly up and whose only desire was to complete the slaughter of their mutual enemy julius fought his way through the chaos to martos nodding in respect at the panting chieftain well fought votadini can you finish them the other man nodded well hunt them down to the last man i have a score to settle with these bastards julius nodded turning back to his men to the bridge so martos broke the deadlock in that case hes been instrumental in more than one lastminute rescue i thought we were dead men when the barbarians came out of the mist to our front with their swords ready back there on the other side of the river my lads were terrified of course so it was a good thing that it was him and his men and not the real thing or wed all have been dead inside a minute marcus rubbed at his stillwet hair with one bloody hand his eyes blank as he remembered the frantic retreat from the venicone warband he saved us of course led us up the hill to our left took us out of sight of the warband when they came thundering past a few minutes later after that we just walked south until we came to the outcrop and climbed down it to reach the far bank of the red you know the rest and youve seen the mess that the venicones made of the eighth but ill wager when we count the corpses well have killed five men for every one we lost theyve earned their right to be called tungrians id say what happened after the votadini came down the hill in our armour then julius grinned still elated with their victory you should have seen it man the bears lads just ran wild they hacked their way to the bridge those venico bastards had thrown across the river and left a trail of bodies with their heads stove in and arms and legs lopped off the barbarians tried to put them off of course chucked bucketloads of arrows and spears at us from the other side of the red but we put a double line of shields on the riverbank and the tenth took turns chopping at the trees behind them once the tops were off it was easy enough to push the trunks into the river and that was that pretty much if only they hadnt managed to put a spear into dubnus id be counting this as a right result as it is juliuss face darkened marcus shook his head sadly he shouldnt have been in the front rank he kicked my backside hard enough when i did it both men were silent for a moment staring out across the river at the thousands of venicone warriors still waiting in silence the four centuries that julius had led down the riverbank to deny them their last chance of crossing the river were now back in place at the ford the two cohorts massed spears sufficient to deter any further attempt to force the crossing the river itself was running slightly lower than had been the case during their first abortive attempt but still had too much power for the warbands leaders to seriously consider throwing their men across the river to die on the roman defences i heard about antenoch he died defending the child marcus shrugged tiredly he died defending the supplies lupus was an incidental our prefect was a bit of a revelation though julius raised an eyebrow oh yes yes i fought off the first group to come over the hill but then another group followed them in and took the three of us on me arminius and the prefect i suggested that he stand back and let the german and me do the fighting but he just laughed at me and stood his ground and and put down three of them without much difficulty from what i gather i was too busy while it was happening but i had a quick word with arminius after the fight was done while scaurus was busy making sure that they were all dead all this time weve been assuming that the bodyguards the fighter but it turns out hes been taking lessons from the prefect since the day he was taken prisoner tiberius rufius walked up with a weary demeanour squatting down on his haunches opposite the other two who both stared at him with open curiosity he shrugged hell live just as long as the gods keep smiling on him the prefects got half a dozen tents up for the wounded and hes warm enough plus his wounds stopped bleeding for the time being got any water left marcus passed over his water skin waiting until his friend had drunk his fill before speaking again we need to get him back to noisy valley that wound needs to be cleaned out before it closes up in which case thats probably good news julius pointed up the road away from the ford half a mile distant where the track met the skyline the distant silhouettes of roman soldiers were appearing against the bright evening sky he stood up looking back over his shoulder at the venicones still waiting on the other side of the slowly subsiding river its their turn to run now if thats one full legion never mind two theyll not want to be anywhere close to hand when that lot cross to the far side come on lets go and watch them leg it and remember to put on a brave face for the troops they need better from us than the despondency were feeling to show in our faces we faced ten times our strength of the nastiest bastards in this whole shitty country and lived again there are few enough men that have done that once never mind twice in one year the tungrian cohorts marched into noisy valley behind the petriana cavalry wing late the next day having slogged back down the north road that afternoon the surviving wounded had been carried on the carts that usually mounted the cohorts tents and cooking equipment the dead left for burial by the soldiers of the th and th legions scaurus had received his orders from the governor in the quiet of the mans command tent the previous night once the legions had set up camp for the night beside the now quiescent red river youve done a good job here prefect scaurus saved us from being ambushed by those ugly tattooed buggers how many men did you lose scaurus made a show of consulting his tablet although in truth the numbers and their significance were already burned into his brain seventythree men dead and a hundred and twentyone wounded seventysix of them walking the medics expect another dozen of the wounded to die before sunrise the governor waited for a long moment and the second cohort thirteen dead and twentyfive wounded sir only one of their centuries actually saw any real combat the tone of the governors reply made clear the frustration that was taking hold of his superior officer i know i also know that a makeshift century composed mainly of arab archers took more than double that number of casualties in the same action and still managed to frustrate an attempt by the venicones to get over the river i had legatus equitius make discreet enquiries of your first spear and youll be aware of the mutual esteem in which your centurions and their former commander hold each other not to mention the offtherecord comments ive had from tribune licinius after his debriefing of his message riders it seems you were forced to take control of his cohort for fear that he would panic and scare his men into running governor i must no i think not rutilius scaurus i knew you would try to protect that fool furius just as you did ten years ago when he panicked in battle against the quadi although for the life of me the reason for your doing so still eludes me scaurus squared his shoulders i will not condemn a fellow officer sir no matter how great the provocation the governor snorted his amusement perhaps you wont but your fellow officer seems to be carved from less noble material he was in here not fifteen minutes ago protesting at your behaviour today in the most graphic terms apparently i would be well advised to have you relieved of command and sent back to rome it would also seem that his father wields great power in rome although id say hes mistaking affluence for influence he sniffed dismissively taking a seat while scaurus maintained his stiff posture his next comment was made offhandedly in an almost dismissive tone but if the comment was made lightly enough the words themselves rooted the younger man to the spot he was also spouting some nonsense about your cohort playing host to a fugitive from imperial justice he showed me a piece of jewellery a gold cloak pin with an inscription of some kind irrefutable proof he said but by then my patience with the man was exhausted so i threw him out it is nonsense i presume the prefect raised an eyebrow with an apparent lack of concern that he was a long way from feeling yes governor prefect furius has taken it into his head that one of my officers is this man valerius aquila that went missing a few months ago whereas whereas governor as both legatus equitius and tribune licinius will stand witness my mans simply a patriotic son of rome doing his duty for the empire nothing more and nothing less it seems that every young officer with dark hair and brown eyes on the frontier should now be considered as suspicious ulpius marcellus gave him a hard stare then nodded his agreement if licinius will back the man thats good enough for me hes got no axe to grind and nothing that fool furius says can be treated with any sort of respect he would keep insisting that i dismiss you from the service scaurus shrugged keeping his face expressionless in this as in every other matter sir i am your faithful servant if you deem it fit to send me away from here i will accept your judgement the governor snorted again slapping a hand down on the table in front of him not likely young man your cohort has surprised and then held off two venico warbands only for that selfserving fool to tell me that i ought to cashier you no rutilius scaurus you are to take your wounded south to noisy valley using the legions supply wagons get your men into the hospital reequip with whatever you need from the legion stores and then pick up a full load of food and get yourselves back here before dark in two days time no more ill use the legions cavalry and the auxiliary horse to keep the barbarians necks tucked in and well attack their stronghold once were properly positioned i want your men back in the line before that happens theyre too experienced to sit out such a fight and ive got a particular part of the battle plan in mind for them scaurus saluted and turned away his mind already racing around the challenge of getting his wounded across the difficult early stages of the twentymile march to noisy valley one more thing rutilius scaurus the prefect turned back from the tents door to find the governor on his feet and holding out a sealed tablet im sending licinius and the petriana with you they can make sure you make it back down the north road without being harassed and provide a show of force to keep the brigantes quiet when you get to noisy valley hand this tablet to licinius hell know what to do with the tungrians settled into the noisy valley barracks previously occupied by the th legion scaurus sent his officers to organise the loading of the supply carts and his bandage carriers to the hospital to offer any help that might be required by the hardpressed medical staff with no more commands to issue he sought out tribune licinius finding him in the officers mess with a beaker of wine in front of him the grizzled senior officer stood and shook the younger mans hand calling for more wine well cohort prefect scaurus i was hoping to get a moment or two with you you tungrian buggers dont seem to be able to stay out of trouble but then ydont seem to have much of a problem fighting your way out of it either eh i salute you he lifted his beaker taking a slug of the wine and watched scaurus as he sipped his own drink something wrong eh young un scaurus placed the governors tablet still sealed gently on the table in front of him the writing blocks polished case making a soft click as it made contact with the scarred wooden surface there may well be tribune this is a message from the governor i can recognise his seal yknow he split the wax seal with a thumbnail reading the contents of the tablet with an expressionless face that old bastard doesnt muck about when he wants dirty work doing you have no idea whats in this message scaurus shrugged i have a good enough idea who it concerns but no idea as to the precise contents licinius leaned across the table putting out his hand well it seems that congratulations are in order young man youre provisionally promoted to cohort tribune with command of the combined first and second tungrian cohorts i cant make any promises on ulpius marcelluss behalf of course but we both know that the rank is rarely rescinded once granted well done young man scaurus stared back at him disbelievingly but no theres no mention of any buts in this message the governor stresses that you are directed to assume command of the second cohort immediately and furius licinius smiled evenly reaching for his helmet former prefect furius is to be relieved of his command and shipped out to rome as quickly as the act can be made to happen sounds like the governor has about the same opinion of your colleague that i do given the dismal tactical skill and military acumen hes displayed to date not to mention his apparent lack of anything remotely resembling a set of balls were better off without him and youll have a nice big doublestrength cohort to play with he got to his feet heading for the door but turned back after a couple of strides oh yes and why not give whats left of your archers to the hamian cohort while youre here theres a good lad that energetic young centurion of yours has managed to get half of them killed in less than a month so i think the rest of them have earned some time off for good behaviour dont you in the base hospital a disciplined chaos ruled half a dozen of felicias assistants working to put the surviving tungrian wounded on to the doctors table in something like the order of their medical priority marcus and rufius found dubnus dozing uneasily through the racket his face pale from the blood hed lost the previous day he looks dreadful why havent they dealt with him yet rufius waved an arm at the room in response to his friends question look around you every man that goes on to the table before him has a worse wound as they watched a soldier was carried from the surgery on a stretcher his right leg swathed in bandages down to the knee below which the remainder of the limb was missing see that poor bastards lost his leg dubnus has it comparatively easy by comparison easy you come and lie here for a few minutes and then tell me this is easy they turned back to find dubnus lying with his eyes barely open he closed them again after a moment the effort clearly tiring him i feel like ive been beaten with hammers rufius lifted a bottle of water to his lips drink some of this youll be in surgery soon enough get that wound cleaned out and stitched and soon enough youll be scaring the shit out of the recruits like a new man can you remember what happened the young centurion snorted then winced at the pain that the action caused of course i bloody can i got a spear in the guts not through my head some big bastard with an axe set about the front rank killed three men in the time it takes to tell it and i was stupid enough to jump in to deal with him he paused grasping the water bottle and taking another sip he swung at me and buried his axe in my shield actually put the blades edge right through my board and while he was trying to pull it free i gutted the fucker keeping your attention on the men to either side of course dubnus sighed as a matter of fact you superior old bastard yes i was what i wasnt looking out for was a spearthrust from behind their front rankers the bastard must have taken a running jump at me the blade ripped straight through my armour and skewered me like a piece of liver i went down like a sack of shit with the whole warband baying for my head but the rear rank managed to pull me out of the fight while good old cyclops closed the gap and kept them off me remind me to buy that badtempered sod a beer next time i see him rufius nodded sagely id say you owe him a good deal more than that lets have a look at your wound then he lifted the sheet to reveal dubnuss stomach the wound was a fourinchlong gash its edges a livid purple and joined by a crust of dried blood not too bad of course the first thing that our friends wifetobe is going to have to do to you is open that up again and make sure its clean i wonder if shell let us watch licinius found furius in his temporary quarters with a terracotta flask of wine the younger man rose and greeted him lifting the wine in salute tribune licinius welcome join me in a beaker or two of wine to celebrate our escape from certain death yesterday his smile faded as he realised that the senior officer hadnt moved from his place in the barracks entrance his stance formal and a writing tablet held open in one hand cohort prefect gracilus furius i am hereby ordered by governor ulpius marcellus to direct that you relinquish your command with immediate effect i suggest that you accompany me to the commanders residence you can stay the night there and avoid all the awkwardness that goes with sudden changes of command the wine flask dropped from furiuss hand and cracked on the wooden floor his fingers suddenly numb with the shock the wine trickled out across the floorboards unnoticed by either man there must be some theres no mistake liciniuss tone was gentle he knew the enormity of the blow being dealt to the other man i can assure you that the governor is very specific in his instructions but this simply cannot be if anyone should be relieved of command its that jumpedup puppy scaurus not me he the grim look on liciniuss face as he advanced across the room silenced him citizen furius you were to be brutally honest quite the worst commanding officer ive met in several years of service in this province you are a coward which im told youve proved on more than one occasion but worse than that you lack any real aptitude for the command of soldiers in the field if you leave with me now quietly and without making a drama out of your departure you can at least go home with some dignity the governor will send you home with the next set of dispatches to the emperor and you can tell your friends that you took part in a battle with a fearsome tribe from the far north tell them it was a great victory and that you were sent home to report on it as a mark of favour if you kick up a fuss however the story will get home long before you do you dont want that to happen and neither will your father keep the family name proud eh dont embarrass the old man any more than you probably already have come on ill have your gear sorted out and brought over later furius stared at the senior officer for a moment the fight going out of him as he sensed the deep anger underlying the older mans gentle tones in the hard lines of his face ill come with you it wouldnt do to make a scene they walked from the tent and into the cool evening air the sentry snapping to attention and saluting licinius nodded to the man but furius was lost in a world of his own his downcast face a study in misery the sentry waited until the two men were out of sight then whistled to his mate walking a patrol beat along the line of barracks crucifix boy just left with that old bugger from the cavalry and he wasnt looking happy best tip the wink to the first spear as he crossed the fort a pace behind licinius a thought occurred to furius a sudden shocking idea that wormed its way into his mind and sat festering for all of ten seconds before he blurted it out his tone both aggressive and fearful it occurs to me tribune licinius that there are only two options for my immediate replacement either youll put a man of your own choosing into my place or else he looked at the man walking slightly ahead of him finding his face imperturbable or else my former colleague scaurus will command both his own cohort and mine which is it tribune licinius stopped walking and turned to face him his features skulllike in the forts deep shadows his voice was harsher than before as if he were holding on to some last vestige of patience leave it alone furius let go of this failed attempt to regain a life to which youre not suited and turn back to that which you can manage furius put a hand to his head staring up at the stars in genuine amazement so i am removed from my command and replaced by him by him zeus jupiter and mars but ill see someone damned for this indignity my father will he quailed back against a barracks wooden wall as licinius took a handful of his tunic and twisted it harshly your father you think the influence of a moderately successful merchant will be enough to protect you while you spread your poison round rome you bloody fool do you have any idea who cohort tribune scauruss sponsor is he waited for a moment until furius shook his head i had assumed from his slow progression that he was without patronage well then how does this name suit you he leant in close to the wideeyed furius and whispered a single word in his ear no oh yes you heard me correctly i heard your father had to pay a small fortune to get you back into legion service to find a legatus willing to overlook your reputation from the last time you were allowed into uniform and even then you lasted only a matter of months before you gave him the excuse he was waiting for to ship you on to another province once he realised just what a liability you were all those years that you sat on your arse at home whoring drinking and waiting for daddy to buy you another chance your colleague scaurus concentrated on building up his military skills the hard way his backer could snap your familys power with a crook of his little finger but scaurus was never willing to take advantage of that influence quite the opposite as it happens he loved the joy of commanding men in battle far too much to consider promotion away from the sharp end of the spear and so for years he was content to be a legion tribune he might have frustrated his sponsor in the process but the man recognised his quality and never stopped backing him and ill warn you just this once youll spread evil gossip about the man at your peril just a few quiet words in the right ear and youll find yourself robbed buggered and murdered in some roman back alley i advise you to accept your lot and get on with the rest of your life furius nodded slowly his eyes fixed on the older mans licinius relaxed judging that his words had beaten the last resistance from the man come on then lets get you into the residence and away from prying eyes in the hospital felicias assessment of dubnuss condition was delivered to his friends in a quiet tired voice as she leant across the big centurion to look closely at his wound taking a slow long breath in through her nose with her face close to the bloodcrusted gash a spear yes good the wound wont be too deep then it looks like his mail did its job and took most of the force of the blow and theres no smell of infection thats a good sign now we can do this one of two ways centurion i can dose you with something to make you sleepy or we can just get it over with now it will hurt either way but with the tincture the unpleasantness will seem to have happened in a dream whereas youll know every second of the pain without it dubnus closed his eyes with exhaustion shaking his head slowly i already feel like a dead man lady so lets get this done and over with the doctor nodded to her assistants strap his legs down well ill need the smallwound forceps vinegar clean linen swabs and a small drain tube oh yes and the honeycomb and you two gentlemen she smiled wanly at the waiting centurions can help me by putting down those helmets and sticks and coming over here to hold his arms once we get the wound open hes going to be in more pain than when the blade went in by the time julius arrived an hour later dubnus was sleeping exhaustedly in his bed his stomach heavily bandaged and a tiny bronze tube protruding from the wrappings hell live i presume rufius nodded tiredly he will if our colleagues woman has anything to do with it ive not seen a wound cleaned out with such care for many a year nor a man take such torture without even a grunt julius nodded knowing from grim experience what his comrade had been through i did a bloody sight more than grunt when they cleaned mine out its packed with the honeycomb i presume rufius nodded raising his hands crushed it myself so he should be fine thats a relief marcus and rufius exchanged glances what its probably nothing but come on centurion corvus im a big boy i can take bad news marcus frowned fel the doctor told us that theres some damage to his liver just a nick but theres no way of telling what might have been on the blade that creased him well just have to wait and see julius took a deep breath shaking his head slowly and so it goes very well gentlemen orders from the first spear were to get a beaker of wine down our necks get to bed and be ready to march again at dawn we go north again at first light and he wants us as fresh as possible not bleary from a night spent watching a wounded man sleep off his surgery two knives take a moment to say hello to your woman properly and then join us in the officers mess for a quick one youll sleep better with a beaker of halfdecent wine under your ribs marcus nodded agreement tapping fists with both men and making his way cautiously to the surgery door felicia bent over another patient sniffing for decay caught his eye as he put his head around the door frame and smiled standing up from the patient and nodding clean enough if my nose isnt getting tired from all this practice lets make this the last one tonight theres nothing out there that wont wait until ive had a few hours sleep get him ready for cleaning out please she walked to the door and pushed marcus into the ward wrapping her arms around him muttering tiredly into his chest how long have you got in camp he snorted into her hair laughing despite himself about six hours were going back north at dawn she pushed herself away from him holding him out at arms length and looking critically at his blackringed eyes you were in action yesterday from the look of it you were right in the middle of it as usual his eyes were suddenly misty the gentle challenge breaking down defences that hed thought secure against the emotions surging around them we fought off a warband from the far north my archers fought better than i could ever have imagined but i lost so many of them and antenoch a tear escaped from his right eye rolling down his cheek and falling on to his armoured chest felicia pulled his head on to her shoulder holding him close again and biting her lip to suppress her own tears my love my poor poor love they were soldiers marcus pulled away a little and tried to speak but she put a finger to his lips shaking her head no no guilt they may not have been fighting men to match your tungrians but they were still soldiers they knew what they were volunteering for and as for your clerk he died saving the boys life i was too late to do anything other than butcher the men that killed him perhaps thats all im good for rubbish her voice hardened and she took a grip of his mail shirts collar and dragged him close again whispering vehemently in his face youre a fine officer and a good man and i love you so pull yourself together go and get some sleep and come back to me in one piece when this is all over i want a live husband not a dead hero so keep your wits about you he smiled wanly and kissed her gently squeezing her to him for a moment disengaging and moving towards the surgery door she turned back a wry smile on her face and if you want a way to remember your clerk that doesnt involve yesterday just remember all the times he drove you to the point of tearing your hair out he smiled back at her his mood lifted by the thought of better days i threw a copy of commentaries on the gallic war at his head in the hospital at cauldron fort i know he told me i think he was rather proud of the achievement now away with you ive got a patient to deal with and my records to scribble out before i forget what to write marcus gathered up his helmet and followed her to the door his mind already fixed on the thought of a few hours sleep and the next days march furius drained the last of the wine that had been left for him and lifted the flask shaking it to ensure that no drop remained within empty bastards couldnt even leave me enough wine to put me to sleep rising from the chair in which hed been sitting since licinius had left him in the residences comfortable main bedroom with the command to get some sleep the disgruntled exofficer shambled off into the house in search of more wine finding nothing to drink in any of the rooms he pulled his boots back on and went to the front door opening it cautiously to peer into the forts empty street a pair of the petrianas cavalrymen turned to face him their faces stony with dispassionate disapproval and their spears crossed to bar him from exiting the residence closing the door he retreated to the kitchen searching until he found a suitably heavy bladed cooking knife back in the bedroom at the buildings rear he got to work on the locked wooden catch that secured the windows shutter prying it away from the frame until the wood splintered and broke allowing the shutter to open blowing out the lamp that was the rooms only illumination he eased the shutter open a crack and looked cautiously through the thin slit the street between the residence and the forts defensive wall was quiet and he was about to open the shutter properly and climb through it when a helmeted soldier appeared in his restricted field of view having passed by the window without noticing that it was ajar he waited until the guard had turned the corner and then eased himself noiselessly to the ground and pushed the shutter closed again hurrying to the corner of the residence around which the guard had disappeared peeping round the brickwork in trepidation fearing that the man might have reversed his steps and be advancing towards him he saw to his relief that the sentry was just turning the next corner clearly walking a simple path around the residence he had a couple of minutes before the soldier could cover the other two sides of the building and come up behind him taking a moment to calm his breathing he took the only course of action open to him walking boldly across the road and into the cover of the barrack block facing the residence waiting for the sounds of pursuit none came if the guards watching the buildings front door for licinius had spotted him they had failed to connect the apparently confident figure crossing the street with the man held captive within he moved quickly now sticking to the shadows and heading for the barrack block in which his temporary quarters were located the patrolling tungrian guard coughed in the cold evening air standing in his position at the far end of the block there was no sign of the man who would normally be posted in front of the prefects rooms no need given my new status finding what he believed to be the right door he opened it and stepped inside with light feet not sure whether there would be a guard placed inside but the room was empty his sword and dagger were lying on the bed alongside his other effects and he picked them up strapping the belt and baldric over his tunic stepping over to the window he cautiously peered through the shutters at the hospital opposite a group of four orderlies came out of the building the sleeves of their tunics spattered black where their aprons had failed to provide protection from the blood of the wounded men they had been treating throughout the evening they headed off towards the main gates and the forts vicus off to the beer shop are we gentlemen who does that leave minding the patients while youre wetting your whistles i wonder he searched down the buildings row of windows until he found what hed been hoping for oh yes that would make a very acceptable reward for refusing to go quietly in the officers mess crowded with the presence of the centurions of both infantry cohorts and the petrianas decurions first spear frontinius was enjoying a rare moment of leisure with his men the votadini prince martos stood among them selfconsciously with his drinking horn held in one hand he had sought to avoid the invitation at first but frontinius had refused to take no for an answer you pulled our backsides out of the fire yesterday and as far as were concerned youre a brother now no matter what happened before or might happen in the future besides if you refuse im pretty sure that the bear will just come down here and carry you over to the mess so why not make it easy on yourself frontinius lifted his beaker and the cohorts centurions gathered more tightly around their leader to hear his toast his voice rung around the room in the sudden hush as all three groups of officers strained to hear the words brothers we drink to the venicones may they long remember the day that two cohorts of tungrians repelled ten thousand of the bastards he lowered his voice theatrically knowing that he had the whole rooms attention with a little help from jupiter sender of rain he raised his voice to shout out the last few words of the toast and an honourable mention for the red river a cheer rang out every man in the room lifting his drink in salute frontinius turned to julius with a raised eyebrow dubnus should be fine if a small nick to his liver heals clean he raised his beaker to martos speaking in quiet tones that would be heard only by the tight knot of men standing around him to you martos and your warriors without you our brother dubnus would be dead now and likely most of the rest of us too the briton nodded acknowledgement of the honour as the officers raised their cups taking a draught of beer from the drinking horn you may yet have to return the favour centurion but i thank you for your kind words heres my toast if i may frontinius nodded motioning him to continue ill drink to your archers untrained and unready for the fight they may have been but they stood taller than all the rest of us socalled warriors by their deeds yesterday they were the real champions of the fight he lifted the drinking horn and the tungrian officers nodded soberly starkly aware that half of marcuss century had been killed or badly wounded in the battle on the banks of the red the first spear drained his beaker and set it down on the nearest table well said and now my brothers ill bid you goodnight drink up and get yourselves into your racks for a few hours tomorrows march will be just as savage as todays was and ill have you bright eyed and ready for anything if its all the same to you he made his way out of the mess walking past the nd cohorts barracks as he headed towards the main gate and his own cohorts quarters returning the guards respectful salutes as he mused on their marching route for the following day furius watched him from inside the hospitals lobby until he was out of sight waiting another moment in case he turned around for any reason when he was satisfied that there was no risk of the veteran officer discovering him he turned to the hospitals main corridor walking quietly down the passageway off which the wards opened his boots making quiet creaking noises with each step each room was packed with wounded men all oblivious to his presence as a combination of the brutal shock of their treatment and the drugs prescribed for them by the doctor had rendered them senseless at the end of the corridor he stopped and listened hearing his quarrys quiet voice as the doctor talked herself through the notes she was making on each of the surgical cases she had dealt with that evening he opened the door and walked into her cramped office enjoying the warmth of the fire burning in a small hearth on the far wall the woman started at his unexpected presence relaxing as she realised who the newcomer was that he mused with an inward smile would change soon enough good evening prefect furius youve come to see your wounded i suppose theyre furius rode over her tired voice his tone harsh enough to make felicia lean back in her chair no doctor the person ive come to see is you and youre a little out of date with your greeting i am no longer prefect furius but just plain furius now furius the failure the coward furius the dismissed is what i am now but strangely enough my newfound status has finally liberated me from expectations of how a senior officer should behave he closed the door behind him smiling hungrily down at the seated woman you wont be aware of it but my sexual tastes have troubled me for most of my adult life you see my dear i enjoy women the most when they struggle felicia stared up at him in dawning horror then around the office for some way to defend herself the problem is that some of the women ive favoured with my manhood have struggled so hard that ive been accused of rape he sighed shaking his head sadly my father paid off the families the first couple of times but i soon took to strangling the women whose bodies i enjoyed in order to ensure their silence thats how i ended up being moved on from first minervia a pretty young thing that i took a fancy to but who was just a little bit too well connected for the matter to be brushed under the mat nobody could prove anything but there was enough suspicion for the legatus to send me away in my own best interests of course or so he told me the ladys brothers had sworn their revenge on an altar to nemesis apparently he raised an arm and declaimed nemesis winged balancer of life darkfaced goddess daughter of justice he smiled and felicia recoiled again at the blank look in his eyes of course the legatus couldnt tell my new superiors why he was moving me on or they would have refused to accept my onward posting and so here i was with no one any the wiser as to my very particular needs nemesis daughter of justice hah there is no justice he squatted down bringing his face close to hers if there were i would not be locked up safely in the prefects residence waiting for a quiet and ignominious departure tomorrow morning or so everyone else but you and me believes which of course gives me licence to do whatever i please with you my dear and without fear of discovery as long as i cover my tracks well i presume youll be well aware of what i like to do to my partners given that you examined one of my victims once i was done with her the horrified doctor nodded slowly unable to take her eyes from the face in front of her furius smiled slowly then reached out with sudden speed and gripped the collar of her tunic with both hands rending the garment apart with his immense strength he put a hand around her throat and forced her to her feet pushing her up against the wall while using the other hand to tear away the ruined tunic revealing her body to him oh yes exactly what i need you my dear are going to be squealing like a stuck pig in a minute or two he pulled down the linen band restraining her breasts allowing them to bob loose and gripped a nipple with a fierce tweak the abused flesh stiffened in protest as an amused grin played across his face see your body is already betraying you you bitches always enjoy what ive got to offer even if you pretend to resist the door opened behind him with a groan of hinges cornelius felix walked gingerly through the doorway his right arm tightly bound in a sling doctor i good grief what in hades are furius pivoted swiftly driving a bunched fist into his face and catapulting him across the corridor and off the far wall the wounded cavalry officer slumped to the floor already unconscious furius turned back to find the naked woman clawing frantically at the rooms shutter pulling her away from the window and pushing her to the floor with a triumphant laugh he delivered a stinging backhanded slap to her face no you dont lets have those undergarments off shall we open wide in the officers mess marcus drained his beaker putting it down on the table and picking up his helmet looking around for a moment damn rufius raised an eyebrow my vine stick i must have left it in the hospital his friend drank his wine and picked up his own helmet its only round the corner ill come with you itll give us a chance to see how dubnus is doing you coming martos the briton nodded tipping back the contents of his drinking horn and shoving it into his belt julius picked up his helmet shooting marcus a wry smile ill come too someones got to make sure you come back to your barrack nice and promptly or well have a repeat of what happened the last time you were left alone with her cant have you turning up on parade in the morning looking like youve been pulled through a hedge can we the four men made their way to the door stepping out into the cold night air under a blaze of stars and strolling down the street towards the hospital the light of a lamp flickered through the shutters of the doctors office window making marcus shake his head shes still at it so much for you go and get some slee quiet they turned and looked at martos his head cocked the better to listen in the silence they all heard the sound a womans cry of distress rufius made the connection first dashing off along the street with the other men in close pursuit he took the steps into the hospitals lobby two at a time and lunged into the corridor his pace hastened further by the slumped body at its far end drawing his sword he sprinted down the length of the building kicking the office door open to find the helpless felicia pinned to the floor with furius on top of her her legs forced open by his muscular thighs one hand stifling her screams and the other between their bodies his buttocks moving slightly as he readied himself to thrust into her the doctor saw rufius over her attackers shoulder her eyes bulging as he stepped into the office and stooped to put his blades point against her rapists anus furius froze into immobility with the weapons first touch looking over his shoulder in amazement at the furious centurion get off her now or ill put my iron so far up you itll stop your heart without ever disturbing your ribs you piece of shit the other officers appeared in the door behind him julius sizing up the situation in an instant keep him there lady bring yourself out from under him nice and easy felicia struggled out from beneath furiuss weight spitting into his face with shocked anger julius tapped marcus on the shoulder hard seeing his friends ashwhite face and knowing that the man was seconds from taking a blade to the prostrate former officer get your woman out of here centurion and give her some decency well deal with this bastard once shes safely out of the way he stepped into the office and put an ironnailed boot on to furiuss neck crushing the mans face into the hard stone floor tie his hands behind his back with your belt he waited while the older man secured their prisoners wrists good now sheathe your blade rufius this one wont struggle not now hes dealing with fighting men and not trying to violate a defenceless woman and besides im rather looking forward to seeing his face when we scourge his back off and then nail him up tomorrow morning that is your preferred method of punishment i believe furius lay helpless under the centurions booted foot but his snarled response was anything but you wont dare bring me to justice centurion i know things that you cant afford to have made public the boot pinning him to the floor pushed down harder julius turning to his brother centurion go on get whoever that is lying outside sorted out rufius sheathed his sword leaving the room and allowing martos through the door to get his first glimpse of the prostrate furius julius bent and took a handful of furiuss hair pulling his head off the floor despite the foot pinning his neck go on then lets hear these things we dont want to be known furius spat his frustration into the words half choked by the position the angry centurion had forced him into your centurion the boy with the unconvincing name i know hes a fugitive and that youre all hiding him he paused swallowing painfully you put me on display and ill shout that so long and loud the gods will hear it julius laughed wrenching the helpless mans head to one side so that he could see the centurion standing over him very good exprefect youve just earned yourself a private death he pulled a dagger from his belt putting the blade close to furiuss face i might blind you first and then well truss you up and take you out into the woods i fancy staking you out and leaving you for the animals to find you disquietingly the former officer laughed back at him in spite of his discomfort that would be brave of you no i mean it julius had pulled his head back farther threatening to finish the job of choking him to death and he exchanged an uneasy glance with martos brave eh yes anything that brings the corn officers will bring your lies crashing down expose the fugitive crush you all martos tapped julius on the shoulder i think that whats needed here is for this man to die an unremarkable death something to arouse no suspicion perhaps julius nodded raising an eyebrow and you know how to make this happen the briton nodded pulling the drinking horn from his belt and pointing to their captives bare backside julius frowned uncomprehendingly were going to bugger him to death with a drinking horn martos shook his head raising a hand to forestall any more questions ill be back in a moment he leaned in closer bending to slap furiuss ear hard enough to provoke a howl of rage that covered his brief whisper to the centurion make him believe hes won he mustnt struggle for the next few minutes we want no marks on his body just do one thing for me while im gone having explained what he wanted he left the office and went to the surgery looking around for the tool he wanted finding a suitably robust bone saw he worked swiftly cutting off the last inch of the horns tip to reveal a hole as wide as his middle finger perfect he pocketed the horns tip and then went in search of the other centurions he found them both in the main ward watching as the doctor dressed in a spare tunic and apparently recovered from her ordeal fussed over the young man they had found unconscious in the corridor he seems to have nothing worse than a slight concussion poor man i thought that animal had managed to do what the barbarian archers had failed to achieve she looked up as martos approached the small group he nodded to her speaking to the two centurions brothers i need your help with our prisoner rufius and marcus followed the briton to the office door where he stopped them and spoke quickly showing them the horn and explaining what he proposed all three men crowded into the office almost filling the small room with their bulk julius gave them an exasperated stare while furius hearing the rapping of boot nails on the stone floor renewed his harangue of his captors just surrender to the inevitable you fools release me now and i may choose to overlook this stupidity hold me here any longer and ill insist on fucking the doctors lovely tight arse as part of the deal julius stared down at the prone figure clearly at the end of his patience with the mans imprecations whatever it is you have in mind martos could we just get on with it martos nodded showing him the truncated horn with raised eyebrows after a second the realisation dawned on the centurion and a slow smile spread across his face very well prefect furius i suppose youre right you two unbind his wrists marcus and rufius unfastened the belt tying furiuss arms but rather than allowing him up as he expected they each pinned an arm to the floor spreadeagling him across the stone while julius deftly wrapped a powerful arm around his legs preventing him from kicking out with his neck no longer under juliuss boot the disgraced officer craned his head round in amazement what free me now or youll leave me no option but to he went quiet as martos squatted down by his head showing him the ruined drinking horn this was my fathers and his fathers before him i dont appreciate having to destroy it for the sake of a piece of shit like you but i have a man that will attack a woman like that one of his own people does not deserve either to live or to leave this life quietly and so he picked up felicias undergarment from the floor where the disgraced officer had discarded it in his haste to violate the helpless woman wadding the linen into a ball he slapped the mans ear again then deftly pushed the gag into his mouth as he opened it to bellow another protest make the most of that its the last contact with a woman youll have in this life he joined julius taking a strong grip of one of furiuss legs the two men nodded to each other pulling the mans legs apart and revealing the romans genitals and his puckered anus moving quickly the briton pushed the tapered end of the horn into furiuss rectum ignoring the muffled protests the helpless captive was now making hold this passing the leg he was gripping to julius who flexed his powerful shoulders to hold the limbs in place despite furiuss increasingly desperate struggles he picked up the remnants of the doctors torn tunic and wrapped it round his hand before reaching for the poker whose blade julius had plunged deep into the fires coals moments before regarding the redhot metal critically he pushed it deep into the fire again stirring up the coals for maximum heat well roman it seems we have a moment or two to kill so ill tell you a story furius goggled at him his eyes bulging in disbelief you will probably have heard it before its as old as the hills themselves but thats no reason not to spend a moment telling it again there was once my grandmother told me when i was very young a snake whose delight was to bite and kill other creatures even those or perhaps especially those it could not eat the other beasts of the forest hated and feared the snake in equal measure since it killed simply to enjoy the sensation one day at the height of summer there was a fire in the forest and the flames leapt from tree to tree faster than the snake could slither the snake was afraid of being burned to death but just when all seemed lost he saw a fox an intelligent and wily animal running towards him for foxes as i am sure you know can run fast enough to outpace a forest fire and for many miles too so he called to the fox and begged it to carry him away to safety the fox of course was unimpressed with the request he knew of this particular snakes reputation and he feared that to carry the snake on his back would be his death sentence but the snake had one powerful argument that he knew would sway the fox if i bite you he reasoned i will burn to death when i fall from your back why would i do such a stupid thing and so the fox agreed to carry the snake to a safe distance from the fire in return for the reptiles future favour of course halfway across the forest where the trees were at their thickest and the fire threatened to overtake them the snake suddenly sank his fangs into the foxs neck and delivered a dose of poison that was sure to kill him in seconds as the fox was struggling in his death agonies with his sight going dim and his ancestors calling him to join them and as the fire started to rage around them he raised himself up with one last mighty effort and asked the terrified snake the obvious question why have you killed me when it means your own death and the snake sliding off his back and into the flames that would burn him to death hissed the answer with fear and shame but with the certainty of truth and do you know what he said the briton gave the gagged roman a moment to respond furius stared at him mutely his eyes filled with hate no what he said was simply this i cant help it it is in my nature by now of course you will have guessed why i have taken this time to tell you this story apart from the fact the poker needed a little more time to be hot enough for my purposes you although i have not known you for very long clearly have the same lust for death and suffering as the snake in my story you are a man who is dangerous to all around you and you will remain so for as long as you live some people would be filled with curiosity as to what can lead a man to become so debased but i am of a more practical mind i simply want to put you out of this misery you call a life without your evil leading to any more death and now it seems that the means of delivering you to hades without springing these traps of which you speak is ready he hefted the whitehot poker in front of the romans face watching a bead of sweat trickle down the mans forehead then moved to where the horn protruded from between his legs brace yourselves hes going to struggle with the strength of a bear once this starts he slid the poker into the horns conical opening the smell of burning filling the air as the hot metal seared its interior then pushed the metal forcefully through its tip and into the prostrate mans body without the gag furiuss anguished screams would have woken the entire camp and his body thrashed across the floor despite the four men fighting to hold him down as the hot metal blade tore through his internal organs with one last massive shudder the dying man sagged lifelessly to the stone floor his eyes suddenly glassy and empty of life martos withdrew the poker filling the room with the stench of buring offal then pushed it back into the fire to burn off the residue of furiuss organs clinging to its surface and tossed the ruined drinking horn on to the coals julius stared down at the body shaking his head in wonder the perfect murder no signs on the victims body and no trace of the means of death get him dressed brothers tribune licinius summoned from the bed into which he had just gratefully slumped took one look at furiuss corpse laid out on the operating table in his boots and tunic and called for the doctor what can you tell me about this my dear ill have to explain this to more than one very senior officer and id like to get my story straight before the questions begin if he noticed the tense air in the room he chose to ignore it waiting for felicia to make her reply he had come to see his men he was talking to me in my office when he collapsed without any warning clutching his chest and shouting with the pain then passed out i couldnt find a pulse so i called for the officers here to help me and all of you saw this julius answered for the three of them not really tribune we were having a quiet look at our brother officer when we heard the prefect here hit the floor and then the doctor called for help he was as limp as a rag when we picked him up to put him on the table you knew that hed been relieved of command yes sir our first spear told us about it we just thought the prefect might have seen the error of his ways and come to visit his wounded hmmm and not a mark on him eh doctor felicia looked him square in the eye not that i could find tribune licinius not a cut nor a bruise of any significance youre welcome to have a look yourself if you like liciniuss eyes narrowed and he sniffed the rooms air ostentatiously raising an eyebrow at windows opened wide despite the night airs chill no need doctor youre the expert here but thats a nasty bruise youve got coming up round your left eye felicia stared straight back at him her eyes suddenly glassy with barely restrained tears and her answer delivered in a quavering voice a patient managed to get his arm free during surgery prefect it happens sometimes and he managed to catch me a nasty blow on the face before he could be restrained ill live the tribunes face softened im sorry my dear if id known there was a risk of any such thing happening i would have made sure he was restrained more effectively and you gentlemen the centurions waited stiffly pondering their fate while the senior officer paced around the table to stand close to them speaking in a low voice that was intended for their ears alone i have no idea how you managed to achieve this but given what i am guessing has happened here im mightily relieved that this is such an obvious case of death by natural causes he cocked an eyebrow at frontinius and scaurus waiting silently to one side and now gentlemen since were kept from our beds by this unfortunate occurrence we might as well go and get a cup of wine ill drink to your promotion and to this fools timely demise in equal measure the two cohorts paraded at dawn that morning fifteen hundred infantrymen cursing the thought of another long days hard marching morban nudged qadir in the ribs tipping his head towards the petriana wing as they clattered past the parade ground heading for the road north and their main task for the day hunting for any barbarian ambush they wont be sweating all bloody day like we will theyll be sat nice and comfy on their bloody horses giving the bushes an occasional poke with their spears the hamian shrugged muttering his response so quietly that only morban could hear it if you cant take a joke standardbearer you should not have joined the army in the first place morban gave him a dirty look all you need to do is learn to swear and youll be nicely positioned for a vine stick when the next one dies he withered under marcuss stare as the young centurion turned and glared at him qadir looked down his nose at him shaking his head almost imperceptibly not so clever not with his friend still in the camp hospital morban nodded glumly watching as scaurus strode out on to the parade ground with frontinius and neuto flanking him to either side tungrians hear me by the command of ulpius marcellus governor of this province i have been appointed to the command of both the first and second tungrian cohorts with the rank of cohort tribune the parade ground was suddenly deathly quiet as the muchanticipated news became reality scaurus continued walking slowly across the gravel with both hands on his hips for the time being nothing changes your officers before this announcement are still your officers now i will however be reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of both cohorts and making selective changes where i and my first spears feel they are required the new tribune stopped speaking and stared across the ranks of his command allowing time for the last sentence to sink in before speaking again we march north now to rejoin the legions and i expect that once again well have a frontrow seat when the time comes to finish this war by finding and destroying the enemy with that in mind and given the price paid in blood by the first cohorts eighth century i have decided to release the remainder of that century to serve with the first hamian cohort who are currently manning this fort centurion corvus will command the ninth century while their officer is recovering from his wound and the first cohort will carry the eighth as an empty century until sufficient reinforcements are received to reconstitute it so i call upon our hamian brothers to come forward and accept your acclamation before we march north marcus walked from his place in front of the th to one end of their short line beckoning morban and the trumpeter to join him behind the archers extending an arm to qadir he shook his chosen mans hand before pointing to the waiting tribune just march them over to tribune scaurus hell probably want to shake your hand and then id imagine hell appoint you centurion before the hamian prefect gets his hands on your men id say youve earned it the chosen man stared at him in amazement centurion marcus nodded a smile creasing his face yes if scaurus appoints you now then rather than your reverting to temporary status youll get to keep the position no matter how many other good candidates the hamian prefect might have queued up for the job once your wounded have recovered youll have a goodsized century to chase around the hills qadirs mouth opened and closed soundlessly i do not know what to say the words thank you tribune will make a good start and hes still waiting for you so i suggest you get your men out there and take what youve earned the hamian nodded ordering his men to march forward to the spot where the tribune was waiting marcus watched as he stepped through their line and snapped off a smart salute to scaurus then took the offered hand and shook it all the while apparently speaking to the tribune rather than allowing him a chance to say the words he had prepared for the occasion so back to the ninth again itll be good to be in front of the lads with a statue again marcus raised an eyebrow in apparent surprise who said youd be the ninths standardbearer but you they havent got a centurion but theyre not missing a standardbearer the centurion waited for a moment until the trumpeter smirked at morbans back before adding or a trumpeter he turned back to the th noting that scaurus was now speaking the expression on his face earnest and yet not entirely displeased what in hades is keeping them morban sniffed loudly wounded pride dripping from his words qadirs probably turning down the chance to sit out the war here in peace and comfort and asking to be assigned to the ninth with you centurion marcus glanced round at him with an incredulous look before returning his gaze to the scene playing out in front of the cohort nobody standardbearer is that stupid the older mans face stayed perfectly straight and he nudged the trumpeter with his foot unseen by marcus a small wager centurion say ten denarii at five to one marcus answered without even turning round done the discussion seemed to have finished but before marcus had a chance to comment the newly appointed tribune beckoned to him with a raised hand centurion corvus join us please he walked across the parade ground with a sinking feeling snapping off a crisp salute and waiting for the tribune to speak scauruss face was a picture of irritated bemusement it seems that your former chosen man doesnt want to accept the position of centurion ive offered him he seems to prefer serving with you in the ninth century even if that means accepting a lower rank several of his men are of the same opinion it seems perhaps you can talk some sense into him while the positions still on the table qadir turned to face him his face set obdurately qadir as a centurion youll have everything i could possibly desire my friend except the knowledge that i am part of the best infantry cohort in the province a month ago i would have accepted the tribunes offer with joy for my mens future safety today i cannot accept that safety while i know that you and my other brothers will face such risk again not while there is a fight waiting for us over the horizon im sorry to throw this offer back in your faces but i cannot accept it and remain my own man and i am not the only one who feels this way the tribune spoke up his voice no longer employing tones of persuasion but now harsh with his authority very well it seems the eighthcentury do not all wish to join the hamian cohort those men that wish to leave us and serve with their own people step forward three paces of the seventyodd men remaining in the th roughly twothirds stepped forward some with sad glances back at qadir and their remaining comrades those men that wish to remain with the first tungrian cohort step back three paces marcus watched the remaining men as they made the three fateful steps noting that for the most part they were the men who had made tolerable swordsmen and had coped best under the burden of their weapons and armour he turned to scaurus raising a hand if i might speak with these men for a moment tribune scaurus nodded and the young centurion walked out in front of the soldiers who had stepped back to rejoin the tungrians clearing his throat and addressing his comments not just to the hamians before him but to the entire cohort his voice raised to a paradegroundspanning bark hamians you wish to remain with the tungrians with whom you have made your home this last few weeks you have proved your bravery in the battle at the red river where you saved every man here from nearcertain ruin and death but now you seek admission to a brotherhood of arms that can make no further allowances for you when we march at the forced march you will either cope with that pace or you will fall out of the line of march and take your chances you will be expected to carry two spears and to sling them into a mansized target at twenty paces any weaknesses or failings will no longer be tolerated as understandable given your previous training they will be run and practised and if need be beaten out of you you will become tungrians with everything that implies can you accept those terms to your remaining with us the men in front of him answered in ones and twos their abashed faces staring at the ground not good enough not if you want to be tungrians can you accept those terms if you can the only answer is yes centurion the response wasnt perfect delivered as a rolling chorus rather than as one crisp response but it was good enough yes centurion very well under those terms i am happy to recommend to the tribune that we retain you on the cohorts strength and give you a chance to meet our standards one more thing though your bows inwardly amused he kept his expression utterly neutral as their faces lengthened only qadir gazing at him quizzically as if he already knew what was coming youd best keep them and make sure you have a good supply of arrows you might be needing them with the hamians back in their place the prefect dismissed the cohorts to their preparations for the march the centurions and their chosen men busying themselves checking that their men had all their kit and were ready for the imminent command to move in the middle of the bustle of getting the th century now back to full strength with the addition of the hamians ready for the days marching marcus felt a tap on his shoulder he turned to find first spear neuto standing behind him at a respectful distance and saluted smartly can i help you first spear the older man held out a small clothwrapped package to him i found this in prefect furiuss kit last night while i was sorting out his personal effects to send to his family once all this is done with i thought you ought to have it given whats inside it marcus lifted the cloth covering and the gold cloak pin underneath it winked at him in the morning sunlight ah i wondered where that had got to thank you sir neuto inclined his head gravely it was accompanied by a scroll detailing some rather colourful allegations against you and your brother officers i took the liberty of putting it into the night guards brazier he looked around himself for a moment before speaking again the men that fought with you down at the riverbank told me you gave centurion appius his dignity in death and that you helped them to face the bluenoses when all seemed lost all things considered id say your place is here not being carted off to rome to make some bastard in a purple toga feel better about himself he nodded and turned to go then turned back with a final thought one thing though you might find it a good idea to scratch off that inscription marcus saluted returning the first spears level gaze yes first spear i might
