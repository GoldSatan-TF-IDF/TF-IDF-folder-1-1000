jim butcher odd jobs aaaa wizardry this story occurs between small favor and turn coat the first thing i thought looking at the roomful of baby wardens was they all look so darned young the close second was my god am i getting old okay children i said closing the door behind me i had rented an alleged conference center in a little chicago hotel not too far from the airport which amounted to a couple of rooms big enough for twenty or thirty peopleif they were friendlyplus several dozen chairs and a few rickety old folding tables they didnt even provide a cooler of waterjust directions to their vending machines after me and my fellow wardencommander in the united states warden ramirez had gotten done learning the little wardenkind up on their mayhem for the sake of getting them killed in a war as quickly as possible we thought it might be nice to give them a little instruction in other things too ramirez was going to cover the course on relations with mortal authorities which made senseramirez got on just fine with the cops in la and hadnt been shot by nearly as many law enforcement personnel as i had the kids had all come to chicago to learn about independent investigation of supernatural threats from mewhich also made sense because id done more of that relative to my tender years than any other wizard on the planet okay okay i said to the room the young wardens became silent and attentive at once no shock therethe disruptive ones who didnt pay attention during lessons had mostly been killed and maimed in the war with the red court darwin always thought that it paid to be a quick learner the war had simply made the penalty for not learning quite a bit steeper youre here i said to learn about investigating supernatural threats on your own youll learn about finding and hunting warlocks from captain luccio whenever the reds give us enough time for it warlocks our own kind gone bad arent the most common opponent youll find yourself facing far more often youre going to run up against other threats ilyana a young woman with extremely pale skin and eyes of nearly white iceblue raised her hand and spoke in a clipped russian accent when i nodded to her what kinds of threats she asked in the practical sense what foes have you faced i held up my hands and flipped up a finger for each foe demons werewolves ghosts faeries fallen angels black court vampires red court vampires white court vampires cultists necromancers i paused to waggle one foot standing with three limbs in the air zombies specters phobophages halfblood scions jann i waved my hands and foot around a bit more id need to borrow a few people to do the whole list get the picture a few smiles had erupted at my antics but they sobered up after a moments consideration i nodded and stuck my hands into my pockets knowledge is quite literally power and will save your life when you know what youre facing you can deal with it walk into a confrontation blind and youre begging to get your families added to the wardens deathbenefits list i let that sink in for a few seconds before continuing you cant ever be sure what youre going to come up against but you can be sure about how to approach the investigation i turned to the old blackboard on the wall behind me and scribbled on it with the stub of a piece of chalk i call it the four as i said and wrote four as down the left side of the board granted it doesnt translate as neatly to other languages but you can make up your own nativetongue mnemonic devices later i used the first a to spell ascertain ascertain i said firmly before you can deal with the threat youve got to know that it exists and youve got to know who the threats intended target is a lot of times that target is going to cry out for help whatever city youre based in its going to be your responsibility to work out how best to hear that scream but sometimes theres no outcry so keep your eyes and ears open kids ascertain the threat become aware of the problem my car didnt make it all the way to kansas city it broke down about thirty miles short of town and i had to call a wrecker i had planned on being there before dark but between walking eleven miles to find an increasingly rare pay phone and dumping most of my cash into a towtruck drivers pocket and the collapse of an office computer network that delayed picking up a rental car for an extra hour and a half i wound up pulling to the curb of a residential address a couple of minutes before nine in the evening id gotten the address from a contact on the paranetthe organization made up mostly of men and women who didnt have enough magical power to be accepted into the ranks of the white council or to protect themselves from major predators but who had more than enough mojo to make them juicy targets for the past year i and others like me had been working hard to teach them how to defend themselvesand one of the first things they were to do was notify someone upstream in the paranets organization that they were in trouble one such call had been bucked up to me and here i was answering before i had closed the door of the car a spare tenselooking man in his forties came out of the house and walked quickly toward me harry dresden he called yeah i said youre late car trouble i said are you yardly he stopped across the hood of the car from me frowning severely he was average height and wore most of a business suit including the tie his black hair was cut into a short brush he looked like the kind of guy who solved his problems through ferocious focus and mulish determination and who tolerated no nonsense along the way im yardly he said can you show me some id i almost smiled you want to see my american association of wizards card yardly didnt smile your drivers license will do if i was a shapeshifter i said passing him the license this wouldnt help yardly produced a little uv flashlight and shined it onto the license im more concerned about a simple con man he passed me the license back im not really into my sisters group whatever they are but shes had it rough lately and im not going to see her hurt any more do you understand most big brothers stop making threats about their little sisters after high school i must be remedial yardly said if you abuse megan in any way youll answer to me i felt my mouth lift up on one side youre a cop detective lieutenant he said i asked chicago pd for their file on you they think youre a fraud and you dont he grunted megan doesnt i learned a long time ago that a smart man doesnt discount her opinion out of hand he stared at me with hard and opaque eyes and i realized in a flash of insight that the man was tense because he was operating on unfamiliar ground you couldnt read it in his face but it was there if you knew what to look for a certain set of the shoulders a twitch along the jawline as if some part of him was ready to whirl around and sink his teeth into a threat that he could feel creeping up behind him yardly was afraid not for himself maybe but the man was terrified megan says shrinks cant help with this one he said quietly she says maybe you can lets find out i said second a i said to the wardenlets writing on the chalkboard as i did analysis how do you get an ogre to lay down on the couch harry called a young man with the rounded vowels of a northern accent in his speech the room quivered with the laughter of young people thats enough out of you there mckenzie you hoser i shot back in a parody of the same accent give me a break here eh i got a bigger laugh than the heckler which is how you make sure the heckler doesnt steal the show from you pipe down i said and waited for them to settle thank you your second step is always analysis even when you know what youre dealing with youve got to know why its happening if youve got an angry ghost its generally angry for a reason if a new pack of ghouls has moved in down the block theyve generally picked their spot for a reason ilyana raised her hand again and i pointed at her what does it matter she asked ghost or ghoul is causing problem still we are dealing with them yes she pointed her finger like a gun and dropped her thumb like the weapons hammer on the word dealing if youre stupid yeah i said she didnt look pleased at my response i used to have a similar attitude i said i held up my left hand it was a mass of old scars and not the pretty kind it had been burned and badly several years before wizards heal up better than regular folks over the long term i could move it again and i had feeling back in parts of all the fingers but it still wasnt a pretty picture an hour or two of work would have told me enough about the situation i was walking into to let me avoid this i told them it was the truth pretty much learn everything you possibly can ilyana frowned at me mckenzie raised his hand frowning soberly and i nodded at him learn more okay how i spread my hands never let yourself think you know all the ways to learn i said expand your own knowledge base read talk to other wizards hell you might even go to school that got me another laugh i went on before it gathered much momentum warden canuck there was onto something earlier too people are people learn about what makes them tick monsters are the same way find ways to emulate their thinkingi wasnt even going to try a phrase like get into their heads thank youand youll have insight into their actions and their probable intentions informationgathering spells can be darned handy i continued but if youll forgive the expression they arent magic the information you get from them can be easily misread and it will almost never let you see past one of your own blind spots you can seek answers from other planes but if you go bargaining with supernatural beings for knowledge things can get dangerous fast sometimes what you get from them is invaluable most of the time it could be had another way approach that particular well with extreme caution to emphasize those last two words i stared slowly around the room in pure challenge daring anyone to disagree with me the young people dropped their eyes from mine eye contact with a wizard is trickyit can trigger a soulgaze and that isnt the kind of thing you want happening to you casually honestly i said into the silence letting my voice become gentler more conversational the best thing you can do is communicate talk to the people involved your victims if they can speak to you their family witnesses friends most of the time everything you need is something they already know most of the time thats the fastest safest easiest way to get it mckenzie raised his hand again and i nodded most of the time he asked thats the thing about people i said quietly so they would pay attention whether its to you or to everyone or just to themselvespeople lie megan yardly was a single mother of three she was in her early thirties and looked it had gorgeous red hair and bright green eyes she and her children lived in a suburb that was more sub than urb southeast of kc named peculiar peculiar missouri you cant make these things up megan opened the door nodded to her brother looked up at me and said youre him youre the wizard her eyes narrowed your your car broke down and you think the name of our town is a bad joke she nodded like a musician who has picked up on a beat and a chord progression and you think this probably isnt a supernatural problem i lifted my eyebrows youre one hell of a sensitive she nodded you were expecting someone who was good at cold reading a lot of professional psychics are i said i smiled so are you she arched an eyebrow at me theres at least a fair chance that if someone is late to what is perceived as an important appointment that car trouble is to blame particularly if they show up in a rental car most people who hadnt grown up around a town named peculiar would think the name was odd i grinned at her and gosh a lot of professional investigators are just a tad cynical her expression broke and she laughed apparently she turned from me and kissed her brother on the cheek ben meg child services was here again today she said her tone neutral dammit yardly said hows kat she waggled a hand in the air but her face suddenly aged ten years the same meg the doctors not again ben she said closing her eyes briefly she shook her head once and yardly shut his jaws with an audible click megan looked down at the ground for a moment and then up at me so harry dresden high mucketymuck of the white council actually i said im a fairly low mucketymuck or maybe a mucketymuck militant high mucketymucks wouldnt come to peculiar youre really into interruption arent you i said smiling i was going to say they wouldnt have a problem with their car oh god she said i think i like you give it time i said she nodded slowly then she said with gentle emphasis please come into my home she stepped back and i came into the little house crossing over the threshold the curtain of gentle powerful energy that surrounds every home her invitation meant that the curtain parted for me letting me bring my power with me i exhaled slowly tightening my metaphysical muscles and feeling my power put a silent invisible strain on the air around me megan inhaled suddenly sharply and took a step back from me ah i said you are a sensitive she shook her head once and then held up her hand to forestall her brother ben its fine hes she looked at me again her expression pensive fragile hes the real deal we sat down in the little living room it was littered with childrens toys the place didnt look like an animal pitjust busy and wellloved i sat in a comfy chair megan sat perched at the edge of her couch yardly hovered evidently unable to bring himself to sit so i said quietly you think something is tormenting your daughters she nodded how old are they kat is twelve tamara is four uh huh i said tell me about what happens sometimes i seem to have the damnedest sense of timing no sooner had i asked the question than a highpitched scream cut the air joined an instant later by another one oh god megan said and flew up to her feet and out of the room i followed her but more slowly as the screaming continued she hurried down a short hallway to a room with a trio of large cartoon girlfigures i didnt recognize they had freaking huge eyes though megan emerged a moment later carrying a darkhaired moppet in pink and white striped footy pajamas the little girl was clinging to her mother with all four limbs and kept screaming her eyes squeezed tight shut the sound was heartwrenching she was terrified i had to stop short as megan immediately took two quick steps toward me and plunged through the next doorway this one had a poster of a band of young men on it i didnt recognize one looked rebellious and sullen one wacky and lighthearted one sober and stable and one handsomely vogue another monkees reincarnation basically i went to the door and saw megan with her clinging moppet sit down on the bed and start gently shaking the shoulder of a girl with her mothers hair presumably kat she was screaming too but she broke out of it a moment later the instant her eyes fluttered open the moppet presumably tamara stopped screaming too and at exactly the same time then they both burst into lesshysterical tears and clung to their mother megans face was anguished but her voice and her hands were gentle as she touched them spoke to them reassured them if she was an empath as sensitive as her file and her reaction to my test suggested then she had to be in terrible psychic pain she pushed enough of it aside to be there for her kids though dammit i heard yardly breathe from the hall behind me it was a tired oath interesting i said excuse me i turned and paced down the hallway to the younger childs room and nearly tripped over a darkhaired child a boy who might have been eight he was wearing underwear and a tshirt with a cartoon jedi knight on it which raised my opinion of his mother immediately the kids eyes werent even open and he raised his arms blindly i picked him up and carried him with me into the little bedroom it wasnt largenothing about megans house was one of the beds was pink and festooned with the same three bigeyed girls the other was surrounded in the plastic shell of a star wars landspeeder i plopped the young jedi back into it and he promptly curled into a ball and went to sleep i covered him up with a blanket and turned to examine the rest of the room not much to it a lot of toys most of them more or less put away and a dresser which the two kids evidently shared a little table and chairs and a closet a nice shadowy closet i grunted and got on the floor to peer beneath the little pink bed then i squinted at the closet if i was four and lying on the girls bed the closet would be looming right past the ends of my toes i closed my eyes for a moment and reached out with my wizards senses feeling the flow and ebb of energy through the house within the defensive wall of the threshold other energy pulsed and movedemotions from the houses inhabitants random energies sifting in from outdoors the usual but not in the closet there wasnt anything at all in that closet ah hah i said third a i said writing on the board assemble avengers said mckenzie assemble crowed the young wardens in unison theyre good kids that is in fact one potential part of this phase of the investigation i said taking the conversation back in hand as i nodded my approval sometimes once youve figured out whats going on you go and round up reinforcements but what assembling really means for our purposes is putting everything together youve got your information now you need to decide what to do with it you plan what steps you need to take you work out the possible consequences of your actions heres where you use your brain if the foe has a weakness you figure out how to exploit it if youve got an advantage of terrain you figure out how to use it if you need specialized gear or equipment to help heres where you get it i started a stack of papers around the room theres recipes on these handouts for a couple of the most common things youll use an antidote for red court venom which youre familiar with and an ointment for your eyes thatll let you see through most faerie glamour which you may not know about get used to making these i took a deep breath this is also the stage where sometimes you do some math the room was very quiet for a moment yeah i said heres where you decide whose life to risk or whose isnt worth risking heres where you decide who you can save and who is already gone past saving ive been doing this sort of thing for a while some of my seniors in the council would call me foolish or arrogant and they could be rightbut ive never met anyone who was breathing who i thought was too far gone to help youve got a boogeyman i told megan an hour later megan frowned at me a a a boogeyman i said sometimes known as a boggle or a boggart its a weak form of phobophagea feareater mostly insubstantial this one is pretty common feeds on a childs fear yardlys eyebrows tried to climb into his hair that isnt possible megan said id id sense something like that id feel it ive felt things like that before several ghosts once a poltergeist not this one i said youre too old she cocked an eyebrow at me excuse me ahem i mean youre an adult i dont understand she said only kids can sense them i said part of their nature conceals them from older awarenesses the threshold meg said it should keep such things out sometimes they ride in with someone in the family sometimes if a child has a vivid enough dream it can open up a window in the nevernever that the boggart uses to skip in they can use mirrors sometimes too nevernever yardly asked the spirit world i clarified oh what bullshit meg yardly said megan stood up her eyes blazing benjamin the tension between them crackled silently in the air for several seconds crap he snarled finally and stalked out the front door he let it slam behind him megan stared at the door her lips tight then she turned back to me if what you say is true then how can you sense it she asked i cant i said that was the giveaway the rest of your house feels normal the closet in the younger kids room is a black hole jesus megan said turning tamara and joey are asleep in there relax i said theyre safe for now it already ate tonight it isnt going to do it again and it cant physically hurt them all it can do is scare them all it can do megan asked do you have any idea what theyve gone through she says she never even remembers waking up screaming but kats grades are down from straight as to cs she hasnt slept a solid night in six months tamara has stopped talking she doesnt say more than a dozen words a day her eyes shone but she was too proud to let me see tears fall dont tell me that my children arent being hurt i winced and held up my hands placatingly youre right okay im sorry i picked the wrong words i took a deep breath and exhaled the point is that now that we know about it we can do something we it will be better if someone in the family helps with the exorcism yeah exorcism she asked she stared at the doorway yardly had gone out sure i said its your house not the boogeymans if i show you how are you willing to kick that things ass yes she said her voice was hard might be dangerous i said ive got your back but theres always a risk you sure megan turned to face me and her eyes blazed yeah i said thats what i thought last a i said writing act that seems obvious ilyana said sure i said but its where everything gets decided and its always a gamble youre betting that youve seen everything clearly that you know everything thats going on yes ilyana said her tone somewhat exasperated that is the purpose of the first three ahs ays mckenzie corrected her absently eh ilyana speared him with an icy gaze whatever already we are discovering what is happening that was the point of the methodology ah i said lifting a finger but do you know everything are you so sure you know exactly whats happening especially when youre about to put the safety of yourself or others on the line ilyana looked confused why would i not be sure i smiled faintly the next evening the children went to bed at nine they stopped asking for drinks searching for the next days clothing waving glowinthedark light sabers in the air and otherwise acting like children by ninethirty they were all sleeping by nine thirtyfive megan a surly yardly and i immediately got ready to ambush the boogeyman while megan collected clipped hairs from her childrens heads yardly and i cleared off enough carpet for me to take a container of salt and pour it out into a circle on the carpet you can use just about anything to make a magic circle but salt is often the most practical its a symbol of the earth and of purity and it doesnt draw ants you only use sugar to make a circle on the carpet once let me tell you meg returned and i nodded toward the circle in there she went over to the circle being careful not to disturb it and dropped the locks of hair from her children bound together by long strands of her own coppery curls into the center of the circle right i said meg stand in the circle with them she took a deep breath and then did it turning to face the open darkened closet her breathing was slow but not steady she was smart enough to be scared remember what i said i told her quietly when you feel it on you close that circle and think of your children she nodded tightly im right here i told her it gets bad ill step in you can do this right she said in a very thin voice i nodded to her trying to look calm and confident she needed that then i stepped back out into the hallway yardly came with me and closed the door behind him leaving megan and her children in the dark i dont get it he said in a low quiet voice hows it supposed to help the kids if theyre asleep i gave him a look by destroying the creature thats attacking them his lips twisted sourly its a prophylactic effect thing right placebo effect i sighed and no it isnt because theres a real monster he said i nodded sure he eyed me for a while youre serious you believe it yep yardly looked like he wanted to sidle a few more feet away from me he didnt hows this supposed to work he asked the kids hair is going to substitute for them i said as far as the boogeyman is concerned the hairs are the children like using a set of clothes youve worn to leave a false scent trail for something following your scent yardly frowned okay your sisters hair is bound around them i said binding her to the kids shes close to them obviously loves them thats got a kind of power in it shes going to be indistinguishable from the children to the boogeyman shes a decoy shes a damned land mine i said boogeymen go after children because theyre weak too weak to stand up to an adult mind and will so once this thing gets into the circle she closes it and tears it to shreds then why is she afraid he asked because the boogeyman has power its going to tear at her mind itll hurt if she falters it might be able to hurt her bad yardly just stared at me for a long silent moment then he said you arent a con man you believe it yeah i said and leaned back against the wall it might be a long wait i dont know whats scarier yardly said if youre crazy or if youre not kids are sensitive i said theyll take the lead from their mom if mom is scared and worried they will be too if it helps think of this as my way of giving the kids a magic feather yardly frowned and then nodded like dumbo yep i said couple months from now that will be the easiest way to understand it he let out a short bitter bark of laughter yeah definitely you do this a lot yep we waited in silence for about half an hour then yardly said i work violent crimes i turned my head to look at him i helped get my sister set up out here in peculiar to get her away from the city make sure her kids are safe you know i hear you ive seen bad things yardly said quietly i dont it scares the hell out of me to think of my nieces my nephew becoming another one of the pictures in my head i nodded and listened i worked this case last week yardly said a moment later wife and kids got beaten a lot our hands were tied couldnt put this guy away one night he goes too far with a knife kills the wife one of the kids leaves the other one with scars all over her face his own face turned pale and now this is happening the kids are falling apart child services is going to take them away if something doesnt change i grunted i grew up in the system i said orphan he nodded somethings going to change i said he nodded again and we went silent once more sometime between eleven thirty and midnight a scream erupted from the older childs room yardly and i both looked up blinking kat he said what the hell i muttered a few seconds later the little girl started screaming too that same painfully highpitched tone id heard the night before and then megan started screaming too dammit yardly said he drew his gun and was a step behind me as i pushed open the door to joey and tamaras room megan was crouched in the circle of salt swaying the lights were flickering on and off as i came in joey sat up with a wail obviously tired and frightened i could see something in the circle with megan a shadow that fled an instant after the lights came up slower than the rest it was about the size of a chimpanzee and it clung to her shoulders and waist with indistinct limbs its head moving as if ripping with fangs at her face megans expression was twisted in pain and fear i didnt blame her holy crap that was the biggest boogeyman id ever seen they usually werent much bigger than a raccoon meg yardly screamed and started forward i caught his arm dont break the circle i shouted get the kids out of here get the kids he only hesitated for a second before he seized tamara and joey and hauled them out of the room one under each arm i went to the edge of the circle and debated what to do dammit what had this thing been eating if i broke the circle it would be free to escapeand it was freaking supercharged on the dark spiritual equivalent of adrenaline it would fight like hell to escape and come back the next night bigger and hungrier than ever nasty as the thing was megan still ought to be able to beat it she was a sensitive feeling the emotions and pieces of the thoughts of others thanks to a naturally developed talent something that would manifest as simple intuition it would mean that she would have developed a certain amount of defensive ability just to keep from going nuts in a crowd megan i said you can beat this thing think of your kids theyre hurting she screamed i can feel them your brother has them theyre fine i called back thats a lie its trying to push on you dont let it trick you megan glanced up at me desperate and i saw her face harden she turned her face back into the shadowy assault of the flailing boggart and her lips peeled back from her teeth with a snarl theyre mine she spat the words sizzling with vitriol my babies and you cant touch them anymore begone i called to her tell it to begone begone megan screamed begone begone there was a surge of sound a thunderous nonexplosion as if all the air in the room had suddenly rushed into a ball just in front of megans paintwisted face then there was a flash of light a hollowsounding scream and a shockwave lashed out scattering the salt of the circle rattling toys and pushing against my chest i staggered back against the wall and turned my face away as a fine cloud of salt blasted out and rattled against the walls with a hiss megan fell to her knees and started sobbing i reached out around me with my senses but felt no inexplicable absence in the aura of the house the boogeyman was gone i went to megans side at once and crouched down to touch her shoulder she flung herself against me still sobbing ben yardly appeared in the doorway to the room a few moments later he had joey in one arm and tamara in the other kat stood so close she was practically in his pocket holding onto the hem of his jacket as if he was her own personal teddy bear okay i said quietly its okay the thing is gone your mom stopped it kat stared at me for a moment tears in her eyes and then ran to megan and flung herself against her mother that drove joey and tamara into motion and they both squirmed out of yardlys arms and ran to their mother thank you megan said she freed one hand from her children long enough to touch my arm wizard thank you i felt a little bit sick but i gave her my best modest smile i finished the recounting for the young wardens and let the silence fall what was my mistake i asked no one said anything i trusted the process too much i said i thought i had already analyzed the whole situation found the problem identified the source of the danger but i was wrong you all know what i did what happened no one said anything the boggart id identified wasnt the source of the attacks it was just feeding on the fear they generated in the kids it hadnt needed to expend any energy at all to generate nightmares and fear in them all it had to do was feed thats why it was so large the source of the attacks wasnt an attack at all i said ben yardlys job had exposed him to some pretty bad thingsmemories and images that wouldnt go away some of you who fought in the war know what im talking about mckenzie ilyana and a few others gave me sober nods kat yardly was the eldest daughter of her mother a fairly gifted sensitive she was twelve years old damn mckenzie said his eyes widening in realization yes of course ilyana said the other students turned to look at her the eldest daughter was a sensitive tooperhaps a skilled one she had picked up on those images in her uncles mind and was having nightmares about them what about the little girl i asked mckenzie took over kat must have been a pusher too he said using the slang for someone who could broadcast thoughts or emotions to others she was old enough to be a surrogate mother to the younger daughter they were probably linked somehow exactly warden mckenzie i said quietly all the pieces were in front of me and i just didnt put them together i figured the situation for a simple boogeyman infestation i set up megan to do the heavy lifting because i thought it would be relatively safe and would work out the best for the family i was wrong but it did work out ilyana said something tentative in her voice for the first time that day you kidding i asked that big boggart inflicted mental trauma on megan that took her most of a year to recover from she had her own nightmares for a while i sighed i went back to her and gave her and her daughter some exercises to do that would help insulate them both kats problems improved and everything worked out finebut it almost didnt if yardly had panicked and used his gun if someone had broken the circle or if megan yardly hadnt bought my lie about the boggart pushing a falsehood on her it might have ripped out her sanity altogether i might have put three kids into the foster care system arrogance i said quietly and wrote it on the board beneath the rest thats the fifth a we carry it around with us its natural we know a lot more than most people we can do a lot more than most people theres a natural and understandable pride in that but when we let that pride get in the way and take the place of truly seeing what is around us there can be horrible consequences watch out for that fifth a children the yardlys turned out all right mostly out of pure luck they deserve better from me and from you always keep your eyes open learn all that you canand then try to learn some more i took a deep breath and then nodded okay well break for lunch and then well look at another case i didnt screw up quite as badly back here in an hour dismissed the young wardens got up and dispersedexcept for mckenzie and ilyana the two came down to stand beside me commander mckenzie said this girl kat most of the talented mortals only demonstrate a single talent she demonstrated at least two im aware i said this girl ilyana said her talents were born in trauma and fear this is one of the warning signs of a potential warlock yeah i said my talents had started in a similar fashion i heard that once so she is under surveillance ilyana asked i drop in on her once in a while i said that poor kid mckenzie said what do we do i spread my hands its an imperfect world wardens we do what we always do i smiled at them lopsidedly whatever we can they both looked down frowning concernedconcerned for a little girl who had no idea of what might be waiting for her excellent the lesson hadnt been wasted okay guys i said burger king that perked them both up though ilyana benighted soul that she was didnt react with joy at the utterance of the holy name of the mount olympus of fast food we left together you do whatever you can boggarts these things flee when confronted unless theyre trapped theyre spirit form creatures with incite emotion feeding dependency on fear a constant high quality veil that adults cant see through but kids can and a physical immunity not much of a catch on that eitheryou have to confront them psychically using conviction or discipline to attack but once theyre seen theyre vulnerable to those attacks from nearly anyone even hand this story occurs between aaaa wizardry and changes a successful murder is like a successful restaurant ninety percent of it is about location location location three men in black hoods knelt on the waterfront warehouse floor their wrists and ankles trussed with heavy plastic quickties there were few lights they knelt over a large faded stain on the concrete floor left behind by the hypocritically named white council of wizards during their last execution i nodded to hendricks who took the hood off the first man then stood clear the man was young and goodlooking he wore an expensive yet illfitting suit and even more expensive yet tasteless jewelry where are you from i asked him he sneered at me whats it to y i shot him in the head as soon as i heard the bravado in his voice the body fell heavily to the floor the other two jumped and cursed their voices angry and terrified i took the hood off the second man his suit was a close cousin of the dead mans and i thought i recognized its cut boston i asked him you cant do this to us he said more angry than frightened do you know who we are once i heard the nasal quality of the word are i shot him i took off the third mans hood he screamed and fell away from me boston i said nodding and put the barrel of my against the third mans forehead he stared at me showing the whites of his eyes you know who i am i run drugs in chicago i run the numbers the books i run the whores its my town do you understand his body jittered in what might have been a nod his lips formed the word yes though no sound came out im glad you can answer a simple question i told him and lowered the gun i want you to tell mr morelli that i wont be this lenient the next time his people try to clip the edges of my territory i looked at hendricks put the three of them in a sealed trailer and railfreight them back to boston care of mr morelli hendricks was a large trustworthy man his red hair cropped in a crew cut he twitched his chin in the slight motion that he used for a nod when he disapproved of my actions but intended to obey me anyway hendricks and the cleaners on my staff would handle the matter from here i passed him the gun and the gloves on my hands both would see the bottom of lake michigan before i was halfway home along with the two slugs the cleaners would remove from the site when they were done there would be nothing left of the two dead men but a slight variation on the outline of the stain in the old warehouse floor where no one would look twice in any case location location location obviously i am not harry dresden my name is something i rarely trouble to remember but for most of my adult life i have been called john marcone i am a professional monster it sounds pretentious after all im not a fleshdevouring ghoul hiding behind a human mask until it is time to gorge im no vampire to drain the blood or soul from my victim no ogre no demon no cursed beast from

to be what they are i made a choice i walked outside of the warehouse and was met by my consultant garda tall blond woman without makeup whose eyes continually swept her surroundings she fell into step beside me as we walked to the car two they couldnt be bothered to answer a question in a civil manner she opened the back door for me and i got in i picked up my personal weapon and slipped it into the holster beneath my left arm while she settled down behind the wheel she started driving and then said no that wasnt it it was business and the fact that one of them was pushing heroin to thirteenyearold girls and the other was pimping them out had nothing to do with it gard said it was business i said enunciating morelli can find pushers and pimps anywhere a decent accountant is invaluable i sent his bookkeeper back as a gesture of respect you dont respect morelli i almost smiled perhaps not then why i did not answer she didnt push the issue and we rode in silence back to the office as she put the car in park i said they were in my territory they broke my rule no children she said no children i said i do not tolerate challenges ms gard theyre bad for business she looked at me in the mirror her blue eyes oddly intent and nodded there was a knock at my office door and gard thrust her head in her phones earpiece conspicuous theres a problem hendricks frowned from his seat at a nearby desk he was hunched over a laptop that looked too small for him plugging away at his thesis what kind of problem an accords matter gard said hendricks sat up straight and looked at me i didnt look up from one of my lawyers letters which i receive too frequently to let slide well i said we knew it would happen eventually bring the car i dont have to gard said the situation came to us i set aside the finished letter and looked up resting my fingertips together interesting gard brought the problem in the problem was young and attractive in my experience the latter two frequently lead to the former in this particular case it was a young woman holding a child she was remarkablethick rich silver white hair dark eyes pale skin she had very little makeup which was fortunate in her case since she looked as if she had recently been drenched she wore what was left of a gray business skirtsuit had a towel from one of my health clubs wrapped around her shoulders and was shivering the child she held was too young to be in school and was also appealing with rosy features white blond hair and blue eyes male or female it hardly mattered at that age theyre all beautiful the child clung to the girl as if it would not be separated and was also wrapped in a towel the girls body language was definitely protective she had the kind of beauty that looked natural and true her features and her bearing both spoke of gentleness and kindness i felt an immediate instinct to protect and comfort her i quashed it thoroughly i am not made of stone but i have found it is generally best to behave as if i am i looked across the desk at her and said my people tell me you have asked for sanctuary under the terms of the unseelie accords but that you have not identified yourself i apologize sir she answered i was already being indiscreet enough just by coming here indeed i said calmly i make it a point not to advertise the location of my business headquarters i didnt want to add names to the issue she said casting her eyes down in a gesture of submission that did not entirely convince me i wasnt sure how many of your people were permitted access to this sort of information i glanced past the young woman to gard who gave me a slow cautious nod had the girl or the child been other than they appeared gard would have indicated in the negative gard costs me a fortune and is worth every penny even so i didnt signal either her or hendricks to stand down both of them watched the girl ready to kill her if she made an aggressive move trust but verifythat the person being trusted will be dead if she attempts betrayal that was most considerate of you justine the girl blinked at me several times yyou know me you are a sometimes associate of harry dresden i said given his proclivities about those he considers to be held under his aegis it is sensible to identify as many of them as possible for the sake of my insurance rates if nothing else gard justine no last name youll admit to gard said calmly currently employed as lara raiths secretary and personal aide you are the sometimes lover of thomas raith a frequent ally of dresdens i spread my hands slightly i assume the j notation at the bottom of ms raiths typed correspondence refers to you yes justine said she had regained her composure quicklynot something i would have expected of the servitor of a vampire of the white court many of the people i suppose id seen there had made lotuseaters look selfmotivated yes exactly i nodded given your patron one is curious as to why you have come to me seeking protection time sir she replied quietly i lacked any other alternative someone screamed at the front of the building my headquarters shifts position irregularly as i acquire new buildings much of my considerable wealth is invested in real estate i own more of the town than any other single investor in chicago there is always money to be had by purchasing and renovating aging buildings i do much of my daytoday work out of one of my most recent renovation projects once they have been modified to be suitable places to welcome guests then renovation of the building begins and the place is generally crowded with contractors who have proven their ability to see and hear nothing gards head snapped up she shook it as if to rid herself of a buzzing fly and said a presence a strong one her blue eyes snapped to justine who the young woman shuddered and wrapped the towel more tightly about herself mag a cantrev lord of the fomor gard spat something in a scandinavian tongue that was probably a curse precis please i said the fomor are an ancient folk she said water dwellers cousins of the jotuns extremely formidable sorcerers shape changers seers and signatories i noted yes she said she crossed to the other side of the room opened a closet and withdrew an athletic bag she produced a simple rather crudelooking broadsword from it and tossed it toward hendricks the big man caught it by the handle and took his gun into his left hand gard took a broadbladed axe out of the bag and shouldered the weapon but rarely involved in mortal affairs ms raith sent me to the fomor king with documents justine said her voice coming out quietly and rapidly her shivering had increased mag made me his prisoner i escaped with the child there wasnt time to reach one of my ladys strongholds i came to you sir i beg your protection as a favor to ms raith i dont grant favors i said calmly mag entered in the manner so many of these selfabsorbed supernatural cretins seem to adore he blasted the door into a cloud of flying splinters with what i presumed was magic for gods sake at least the vampires would call for an appointment the blast amounted to little debris after a few visits from dresden and his ilk i had invested in cheap light doors at dramatic as opposed to tactical entry points the fomor was a pale repellent humanoid seven feet tall give or take and distinctly froglike in appearance he had a bloated belly legs several inches too long to be proportionately human and huge feet and hands he wore a tunic of something that resembled seaweed beneath a long flapping blue robe covered in the most intricate embroidery i had ever seen a coronet of coral was bound about his head his right hand was extended dramatically he carried a twisted length of wood in his left his eyes bulged jaundice yellow around septic green and his teeth were rotted and filthy you cannot run from me he said his wide mouth made the words seem somehow slurred you are mine justine looked up at me evidently too frightened to turn her head her eyes wide with fear a sharper contrast would have been hard to manage sir please i touched a button on the undersurface of my desk a motion of less than two inches and then made a steeple of my hands again as i eyed mag and said excuse me sir this is a private office mag surged forward half a step his eyes focused on the girl hold your tongue mortal if you would keep it i narrowed my eyes is it so much to ask for civility justine i said calmly if you would stand aside please justine quickly silently moved out from between us i focused on mag and said they are under my protection mag gave me a contemptuous look and raised the staff darkness lashed at me as if he had simply reached into the floorboards and cracks in the wall and drawn it into a sizzling sphere the size of a bowling ball it flickered away to nothingness about a foot in front of my steepled hands i lifted a finger and hendricks shot mag in the back repeatedly the fomor went down with a sound like a bubbling teakettle whipped onto his back as if the bullets had been a minor inconvenience and raised the stick to point at hendricks gards axe smashed it out of his grip swooped back up to guard and began to descend again stop i said gards muscles froze just before she would have brought down the axe onto mags head mag had one hand uplifted surrounded in a kind of negative haze his long fingers crooked at odd anglespresumably some kind of mystic defense as a freeholding lord of the unseelie accords i said it would be considered an act of war if i killed you out of hand despite your militant intrusion into my territory i narrowed my eyes however your behavior gives me ample latitude to invoke the defense of property and self clause i will leave the decision to you continue this asinine behavior and i will kill you and offer a weregild to your lord king corb in accordance with the conflict resolution guidelines of section two paragraph four as i told you my lawyers send me endless letters i speak their language mag seemed to take that in for a moment he looked at me then gard his eyes narrowed they tracked back to hendricks his head hardly moving and he seemed to freeze when he saw the sword in hendrickss hand his eyes flicked to justine and the child and burned for a momentnot with adoration or even simple lust there was a pure and possessive hunger there coupled with a need to destroy that which he desired i have spent my entire life around hard men i know that form of madness when i see it so mag said his eyes traveled back to me and were suddenly heavylidded and calculating you are the new mortal lord we half believed that you must be imaginary that no one could be as foolish as that you are incorrect i said moreover you cant have them get out mag stood up the movement was slow liquid his limbs didnt seem to bend the proper way lord marcone he said this affair is no concern of yours i only wish to take the slaves you cant have them get out i warn you mag said there was an ugly tone in his voice if you make me return for herfor themyou will not enjoy what follows i do not require enjoyment to thrive leave my domain i wont ask again hendricks shuffled his feet a little settling his balance mag gathered himself up slowly he extended his hand and the twisted stick leapt from the floor and into his fingers he gave gard a slow and wellpracticed sneer and said anon mortal lordling it is time you learned the truth of the world it will please me to be your instructor then he turned slow and haughty and walked out his shoulders hunching in an odd unsettling motion as he moved make sure he leaves i said quietly gard and hendricks followed mag from the room i turned my eyes to justine and the child mag i said is not the sort of man who is used to disappointment justine looked after the vanished fomor and then back at me confusion in her eyes that was sorcery how did you i stood up from behind my desk and stepped out of the copper circle set into the floor around my chair it was powered by the sorcerous equivalent of a ninevolt battery connected to the control on the underside of my desk basic magical defense gard said it had seemed like nonsense to meit clearly was not i took my gun from its holster and set it on my desk justine took note of my reply of course i wouldnt give the personal aide of the most dangerous woman in chicago information about my magical defenses there was something hard and not at all submissive in her eyes thank you sir for for what i said very calmly you understand do you not what you have done by asking for my help under the accords sir the accords govern relations between supernatural powers i said the signatories of the accords and their named vassals are granted certain rights and obligationssuch as offering a warning to a signatory who has trespassed upon anothers territory unwittingly before killing him i know sir justine said then you should also know that you are most definitely not a signatory of the accords at best you qualify in the category of servitors and chattel at worst you are considered to be a food animal she drew in a sharp breath her eyes wideningnot in any sense of outrage or offense but in realization good she grasped the realities of the situation in either case i continued you are property you have no rights in the current situation in the eyes of the accordsand more to the point i have no right to withhold anothers rightful property mags behavior provided me with an excuse to kill him if he did not depart he will not give me such an opening a second time justine swallowed and stared at me for a moment then she glanced down at the child in her arms the child clung harder to her and seemed to lean somewhat away from me one must admire such acute instincts you have drawn me into a conflict which has nothing to do with me i said quietly i suggest candor otherwise i will have mr hendricks and ms gard show you to the door you cant she began but her voice trailed off i can i said i am not a humanitarian when i offer charity it is for tax purposes the room became silent i was content with that the child began to whimper quietly i was delivering documents to the court of king corb on behalf of my lady justine said she stroked the childs hair absently its in the sea theres a gate there in lake michigan not far from here i lifted an eyebrow you swam i was under the protection of their courier going there justine said its like walking in a bubble of air she hitched the child up a little higher on her hip mag saw me he drove the courier away as i was leaving and took me to his home there were many other prisoners there including the child i guessed though it probably didnt sound that way justine nodded i arranged for several prisoners to flee mags home i took the child when i left i swam out so you are in effect stolen property in possession of stolen property i said novel gard and hendricks came back into the office i looked at hendricks my people tulanes got a broken arm he said standing in that assholes way hes on the way to the doc thank you ms gard mag is off the property she said he didnt go far hes summoning support now how much of a threat is he i asked the question was legitimate gard and hendricks had blindsided the inhuman while he was focused upon justine and the child and while he wasted his leading magical strike against my protective circle a headon confrontation against a prepared foe could be a totally different proposition gard tested the edge of her axe with her thumb and drew a smooth stone from her pocket mag is a fomor sorcerer lord of the first rank hes deadlyand connected the fomor could crush you without a serious loss of resources confrontation would be unwise the stone made a steely slithery sound as it glided over the axes blade there seems little profit to be had then i said its nothing personal justine merely business i am obliged to return stolen property to signatory members of the accords hendricks looked at me sharply he didnt say anything he didnt have to i already knew the tone of whatever he would say are there no prisons perhaps or no man is an island entire of itself it tolls for thee on and on hendricks has no head for business gard watched me waiting sir justine said her tone measured and oddly formal may i speak i nodded she isnt property justine said and her voice was low and intense her eyes direct she was trapped in a den of living nightmares and there was no one to come save her she would have died there and i am not letting anyone take her back to that hellhole i will die first the young woman set her jaw she is not property mr marcone shes a child i met justines eyes for a long moment i glanced aside at hendricks he waited for my decision gard watched me as ever gard watched me i looked down at my hands my fingertips resting together with my elbows propped on the desk business came first always but i have rules i looked up at justine shes a child i said quietly the air in the room snapped tight with tension ms gard i said please dismiss the contractors for the day at pay then raise the defenses she pocketed the whetstone and strode quickly out her teeth showing a bounce in her step mr hendricks please scramble our troubleshooters theyre to take positions across the street suppressed weapons only i dont need patrolmen stumbling around in this then ready the panic room hendricks nodded and got out his cell phone as he left his huge stubby fingers flew over its touchscreen as he sent the activation text message looking at him one would not think him capable of such a thing but that is hendricks generally i looked at justine as i rose and walked to my closet you will go with the child into the panic room it is with the possible exception of dresdens home the most secure location in the city thank you she said quietly i took off my coat and hung it up in the closet i took off my tie and slipped it over the same hanger i put my cuff links in my coat pocket rolled up my sleeves and skinned out of my guns holster then i slipped on the armored vest made of heavy scales of composite materials joined to sleeves of quite oldfashioned mail i pulled an old field jacket olive drab over the armor belted it holstered my sidearm at my side opposite a combat knife and took a militarygrade assault shotguna weapon every bit as illegal as my pistol in the city of chicagofrom its rack i am not doing it for you young lady i said nor am i doing it for the child then why are you doing it she asked because i have rules i said she shook her head gently but youre a criminal criminals dont have rules they break them i stopped and looked at her justine blanched and slid a step farther away from me along the wall the child made a soft distressed sound i beckoned curtly for her to follow me as i walked past her it took her a moment to do so honestly someone in the service of a vampire ought to have a bit more fortitude this panic room looked like every other one ive had built fluorescent lights plain tile floor plain dry wall two double bunks occupied one end of the room a business desk and several chairs took up the rest a miniature kitchen nestled into one corner opposite the miniature medical station in another there was a door to a halfbath and a bank of security monitors on the wall between them i flicked one switch that activated the entire bank displaying a dozen views from hidden security cameras i gestured for justine to enter the room she came in and immediately took a seat on the lower bunk of the nearest bed still holding the child mag can find her gard told me when we all rendezvoused outside the panic room once hes inside the building and gets past the forward area hell be able to track her hell head straight for her then we know which way hell be moving i said what did you find out about his support theyre creatures gard said actual mortal beings though like none youve seen before the fomor twist flesh to their liking and sell the results for favors and influence it was probably the fomor who created those catthings the knights of the blackened denarius used i twisted my mouth in displeasure at the name if theyre mortal we can kill them theyll die hard gard warned me what doesnt i looked up and down the hallway outside the panic room i think the primary defense plan will do gard nodded she had attired herself in an armored vest not unlike my own over a long mail shirt medieval looking but then modern armorers havent aimed their craft at stopping claws of late hendricks standing watch at the end of the hall had on an armored vest but was otherwise covered in modified motorcyclists armor he carried an assault shotgun like mine several hand grenades and that same broadsword stay here i said to justine watch the door if anyone but one of us comes down the stairs shut it she nodded i turned and started walking toward the stairway i glanced at gard what can we expect from mag pain hendricks grunted skeptically hes ancient devious and wicked gard clarified there is an effectively unlimited spectrum of ways in which he might do harm i nodded can you offer any specific knowledge he wont be easy to get to she said the fomor practice entropy magic they make the antitechnology effect dresden puts off look like mild sunspot activity modern systems are going to experience problems near him we started up the stairs how long before he arrives from upstairs there was the crash of breaking plate glass no alarm went off but there was a buzzing sizzling sound and a screamgards outer defenses hendricks hit a button on his cell phone and then came with me as i rushed up the remaining stairs to the ground floor the lights went out as we went and hendrickss phone sputtered out a few sparks batterypowered emergency lights flicked on an instant later only about half of them functioned and most of those were behind us mag had waited for nightfall to begin his attack and then crippled our lights quite possibly he assumed that the darkness would give him an overwhelming advantage the hubris of some members of the supernatural community is astonishing the nightvision scopes mounted on my weapon and hendrickss had been custommade based off of designs dating back to world war ii before nightvision devices had married themselves to the electronics revolution they were heavy and far inferior to modern systemsbut they would function in situations where electronic goggles would be rendered into useless junk we raised the weapons to our shoulders lined an eye up with the scopes and kept moving we reached the first defensive position folded out the reinforced composite barriers mounted there and knelt behind them the ambient light from the city outside and the emergency lights below us was enough for the scopes to do their jobs i could make out the outline of the hallway and the room beyond sounds of quiet movement came closer my heart rate had gone up but not alarmingly so my hands were steady my mouth felt dry and my bodys reaction to the prospect of mortal danger sent ripples of sensation up and down my spine i embraced the fear and waited the fomors creatures exploded into the hallway on a storm of frenzied roars i couldnt make out many details they seemed to have been put together on the chassis of a gorilla their heads were squashed uglylooking things with widegaping mouths full of sharklike teeth the sounds they made were deep with a frenzied edge of madness and they piled into the corridor in a wave of massive muscle steady i murmured the creatures lurched as they moved like cheap toys that had not been assembled properly but they were fast for all of that more and more of them flooded into the hallway and their charge was gaining mass and momentum steady i murmured hendricks grunted there were no words in it but he meant i know the wave of fomorian beings got close enough that i could see the patches of mold clumping their fur and tendrils of mildew growing upon their exposed skin fire i said hendricks and i opened up the new military aa automatic shotguns are not the hunting weapons i first handled in my patriotically delusional youth they are fully automatic weapons with large circular drums that rather resembled the old tommy guns made iconic by my business predecessors in chicago one pulls the trigger and shell after shell slams through the weapon a steel target hit by bursts from an aa very rapidly comes to resemble a screen door and we had two of them the slaughter was indescribable it swept like a great broom down that hallway tearing and shredding flesh splattering blood on the walls and painting them most of the way to the ceiling behind me gard stood ready with a heavycaliber biggame rifle calmly gunning down any creature that seemed to be reluctant to die before it could reach our defensive point we piled the bodies so deep that the corpses formed a barrier to our weapons hendricks i said the big man was already reaching for the grenades on his belt he took one pulled the pin cooked it for a slow two count and then flung it down the hall we all crouched behind the barriers as the grenade went off with a deafening crunch of shockwavedriven air hendricks threw another one he might disapprove of killing but he did it thoroughly when the ringing began to fade from my ears i heard a sound like raindrops it wasnt raining of coursethe gunmen in the building across the street had opened fire with silenced weaponry bullets whispered in through the windows and hit the floor and walls of the headquarters with innocuoussounding thumps evidently mags servitors had been routed and were trying to flee an object the size of hendrickss fist appeared from nowhere and arced cleanly through the air it landed on the floor precisely between the two sheltering panels a lump of pinkandgray coral gard hit me with a shoulder and drove me to the ground even as she shouted down the piece of coral didnt explode there was a whispering sound and hundreds of tiny holes appeared in the bloodstained walls and ceiling gard let out a pained grunt my left calf jerked as something pierced it and burned as though the wound had been filled with salt i checked hendricks one side of his face was covered in a sheet of blood small tears were visible in his leathers and he was beginning to bleed through the holes get him i said to gard rising as another coral spheroid rose into the air before it could get close enough to be a threat i blew it to powder with my shotgun and the next and the next while gard dropped her rifle got a shoulder under one of hendrickss and helped him to his feet as if hed been her weight instead of two hundred and seventy pounds of muscle she started down the stairs a fourth sphere came accompanied by mocking laughter and when i pulled the trigger again the weapon didnt function empty i slapped the coral device out of the air with the shotguns barrel and flung myself backward hoping to clear the level of the floor on the stairwell before the pseudogrenade detonated i did not quite make it several objects struck my chest and arms and a hot blade slipped across my unscarred ear but the armor turned the truly dangerous projectiles i broke my arm tumbling backward down the stairs more laughter followed me down but at least the fomor wasnt spouting some kind of ridiculous monologue i did my best came mags voice i gave you a chance to return what was mine but no you couldnt keep yourself from interfering in my affairs from stealing my property and so now you will reap the consequences of your foolishness little mortal there was more but there is hardly a need to go into details given a choice between that egocentric drivel and a broken arm i prefer the latter its considerably less excruciating gard hauled me to my feet by my coat with her spare hand i got under the stunned hendrickss other arm and helped them both down the rest of the stairs justine stood in the doorway of the safe room at the end of the hallway of flickering lights her face whitelipped but calm gard helped me get hendricks to the door of the room and turned around close the door i may be able to discourage him out here your home office would be annoyed with me if i wasted your life on such a lowpercentage proposition i said we stick to the plan the valkyrie eyed me your arm is broken i was aware thank you i said is there any reason the countermeasure shouldnt work mag was going on about something coming down the steps one at a time making a production of every footfall i ignored the ass none that i know of gard admitted which is not the same answer as no sir justine said we planned for thisor something very like it we dont split up now end of discussion help me with hendricks sir justine said i looked up to see mag standing on the landing cloaked in random shadows smiling the emergency lights on the stairwell blew out with a melodramatic shower of dying sparks ah i said i reached inside the saferoom door found the purely mechanical pullcord wrapped unobtrusively around a nail head on the wall and gave it a sharp jerk it set off the antipersonnel mines built into the wall of the landing there were four of them which meant that a wash of fire and just under threethousandround shot acquainted themselves with the immediate vicinity of the landing and with mag a cloud of flame and flying steel enveloped the fomor but at the last instant the swirling blackness around him rose up like a living thing forming a shield between mag and the oncoming flood of destruction the sound of the explosions was so loud that it demolished my hearing for a moment it began to return to me as the cloud of smoke and dust on the landing began to clear i could hear a fire alarm going off mag smudged and blackened with residue but otherwise untouched made an irritated gesture and the fire alarm sparked and fizzledbut not before setting off the automatic sprinklers water began pouring down from spigots in the ceiling mag looked up at the water and then down at me and his toowide smile widened even more really he asked water did you actually think water would be a barrier to the magic of a fomor lord running water was highly detrimental to mortal magic or so gard informed me whether it was naturally occurring or not the important element was quantity enough water would ground magic just as it could conduct electricity and shortcircuit electronics evidently mag played by different rules mag made a point to continue down the stairs at exactly the same pace he was somewhat hampered in that several of the stairs had been torn up rather badly in the explosion but he made it to the hallway gard took up a position in the middle of the hallway her axe held straight up beside her in both arms like a baseball players bat i helped hendricks into the safe room and dumped him on a bunk out of any line of fire from the hallway justine took one look at his face and hurried over to the medical station where she grabbed a firstaid kit she rushed back to hendrickss side she broke open the kit and started laying out the proper gear for getting a clear look at a bloody wound and getting the bleeding stopped her hands flew with precise speed shed had some form of training from the opposite bunk the child watched justine with wide blue eyes she was naked and had been crying the tears were still on her little cheeks even now her lower lip had begun to tremble but so far as anyone else knew i was made of stone i turned and crossed the room i sat down at the desk a copy of the one in my main office i put my handgun squarely in front of me the desk was positioned directly in line with the door to the panic room from behind the desk i could see the entire hallway clearly mag stepped forward and moved a hand as though throwing something i saw nothing but gard raised her axe in a blocking movement and there was a flash of light and the image of a norse rune or something like it was burned onto my retina the outer edge of gards mail sleeve on her right arm abruptly turned black and fell to dust so that the sleeve split and dangled open gard took a grim step back as mag narrowed his jaundiced eyes and lifted the crooked stick something that looked like the blend of a lightning bolt and an eel lashed through the air toward gard but she caught it on the broad blade of her axe and there was another flash of light another eyesearing rune i heard her cry out though and saw that the edges of her fingernails had been burned black step by step she fell back while mag hammered at her with things that made no sense many of which i could not even see each time the runemagic of that axe defeated the attackand each time it seemed to cost her something a lightly singed face here a long shallow cut upon her newly bared arm there and the runes i saw were each in different places on the axe being burned out one by one gard had a finite number of them as gards heels touched the threshold of the safe room mag let out a howl and threw both hands out ahead of him an unseen force lifted gard from her feet and flung her violently across the room over my desk and into the wall she hit with bonecrushing force and slid down limply i faced the inhuman sorcerer alone mag walked slowly and confidently into my safe room and stared at me across my desk he was breathing heavily from exertion or excitement or both he smiled slowly and waved his hand again an unpleasant shimmer went through the air and i glanced down to see rust forming on the exposed metal of my gun while cracking began to spread through the plastic grip go ahead mortal mag said drawing out the words pick up the gun try it the crafting of the weapon is fine mortal but you are not the masters of the world that you believe yourselves to be even todays cleverest smiths are no match for the magic of the fomor i inclined my head in agreement then i suppose i said that well just have to do this old school i drew the eighteenthcentury german dragoon pistol from the open drawer beside my left hand aimed and fired the ancient flintlock snapped forward ignited the powder in the pan and roared a wash of unnatural blue white fire blazing forth from the antique weapon i almost fancied that i could see the bullet spinning and tumbling blazing with its own tiny rune though mags shadows leapt up to defend him he had expended enormous energy moving through the building hurling attack after attack at us more energy had to be used to overcome the tremendous force of the claymores that had exploded virtually in his face perhaps at his full strength at the height of his endurance his powers would have been enough to turn even the single potent attack that had been designed to defeat them from the beginning the plan had been to wear him down the blue bolt of lead and power from the heavy old flintlock pierced mags defenses and body in the same instant and with the same contemptuous energy mag blinked at me then lowered his head to goggle at the smoking hole in his chest as wide as my thumb his mouth moved as he tried to gabble something but no sound came out idiot i said coldly it will be well worth the weregild to be rid of you mag lurched toward me for a moment intent upon saying something but the fates spared me from having to endure any more of him he collapsed to the floor before he could finish speaking i eyed my modern pistol crusted with rust and residue and decided not to try it i kept a spare in the downstairs desk in any case i took it from another drawer checked it awkwardly onehanded and then emptied the weapon into mags head and chest i am the one who taught hendricks to be thorough i looked up from mags ruined form to find justine staring at me frozen in the middle of wrapping a bandage around my seconds head how is he i asked calmly justine swallowed she said he mmay need stitches for this scalp wound i think he has a concussion the other wounds arent bad his armor stopped most of the fragments from going in gard i asked without looking over my shoulder the valkyrie had an incredible ability to resist and recover from injury be sore for a while she said the words slurred give me a few minutes justine perhaps you will set my arm and splint it i said we will need to abandon this renovation im afraid gard wheres the thermite in your upstairs office closet right where you left it she said in a very slightly aggrieved tone be a dear and burn down the building i said she appeared beside my desk looking bruised exhausted and functional she lifted both eyebrows was that a joke apparently i said doubtless the result of triumph and adrenaline my word she said she looked startled get moving i told her make the fire look accidental i need to contact the young ladys patron so that she can be delivered safely back into her hands call dr schulman as well tell him that mr hendricks and i will be visiting him shortly i pursed my lips and steak i think i could use a good steak the pump room should do for the three of us eh ask them to stay open an extra half an hour gard showed me her teeth in a flash well she said its no mead hall but it will do i put my house in order in the end it took less than half an hour the troubleshooters made sure the fomorian creatures were dragged inside then vanished mags body had been bagged and transferred to be returned to his watery kin along with approximately a quarter of a million dollars in bullion the price required in the accords for the weregild of a person of mags stature justine was ready to meet a car that was coming to pick her up and hendricks was already on the way to schulmans attentions hed seemed fine by the time he left growling at gard as she fussed over him i looked around the office and nodded we know the defense plan has some merit i said i hefted the dragoon pistol ill need more of those bullets i was unconscious for three weeks after scribing the rune for that one gard replied to say nothing of the fact that the bullets themselves are rare that one killed a man named nelson at trafalgar how do you know i took it out of him she said men of his caliber are few and far between ill see what i can do she glanced at justine sir not just yet i said i will speak with her alone for a moment please she nodded giving justine a look that was equal parts curiosity and warning then she departed i got up and walked over to the girl she was holding the child against her again the little girl had dropped into an exhausted sleep so i said quietly lara raith sent you to mags people he happened to abduct you you happened to escape from himdespite the fact that he seemed to be holding other prisoners perfectly adequatelyand you left carrying the child and upon emerging from lake michigan you happened to be nearby so you came straight here yes justine said quietly coincidences coincidences i said put the child down her eyes widened in alarm i stared at her until she obeyed my right arm was splinted and in a sling with my left hand i reached out and flipped open her suit jacket over her left hip where shed been clutching the child all evening there was an envelope in a plastic bag protruding from the jackets interior pocket i took it she made a small sound of protest and aborted it partway i opened the bag and the envelope and scanned over the paper inside these are account numbers i said quietly security passwords stolen from mags home i suppose she looked up at me with very wide eyes dear child i said i am a criminal one very good way to cover up one crime is to commit another more obvious one i glanced down at the sleeping child again using a child to cover your part of the scheme quite coldblooded justine i freed all of mags prisoners to cover up the theft of his records at my ladys bidding she said quietly the child was not part of the plan children frequently arent i said i took her out on my own she said shes free of that place she will stay that way to be raised among the vampires i asked such a lovely child will surely go far justine grimaced and looked away she was too small to swim out on her own i couldnt leave her i stared at the young woman for a long moment then i said you might consider speaking to father forthill at st mary of the angels the church appears to have some sort of program to place those endangered by the supernatural into hiding i do not recommend you mention my name as a reference but perhaps he could be convinced to help the child she blinked at me several times then she said quietly you sir are not very much like i thought you were nor are you agent justine i took a deep breath and regarded the child again at least we accomplished something today i smiled at justine your ride should be here by now you may go she opened her mouth and reached for the envelope i slipped it into my pocket do give lara my regards and tell her that the next time she sends you out to steal honey she should find someone else to kill the bees i gave her a faint smile that will be all justine looked at me then her lips quivered up into a tiny amused smile she bowed her head to me collected the child and walked out her steps light i debated putting a bullet in her head but decided against it she had information about my defenses that could leave them vulnerableand more to the point she knew that they were effective if she should speak of todays events to dresden well the wizard would immediately recognize that the claymores the running water and the magicdefensepiercing bullet had not been put into place to counter mag or his odd folk at all they were there to kill harry dresden and they worked mag had proven that an eventual confrontation with dresden was inevitablebut murdering justine would guarantee it happened immediately and i wasnt ready for that not until i had rebuilt the defenses in the new location besides the young woman had rules of her own i could respect that i would test myself against dresden in earnest one dayor he against me until then i had to gather as many resources to myself as possible and when the day of reckoning came i had to make sure it happened in a place where despite his powers he would no longer have the upper hand like everything else
