iain m banks surface detail a book in the culture series for seth and lara with thanks to ad√®le one this one might be trouble she heard one of them say this only ten or so metres away in the darkness even over her fear the sheer naked terror of being hunted she felt a shiver of excitement of something like triumph when she realised they were talking about her yes she thought she would be trouble she already was trouble and they were worried too the hunters experienced their own fears during the chase well at least one of them did the man whod spoken was jasken veppers principal bodyguard and chief of security jasken of course who else you think so do you said a second man that was veppers himself it felt as though something curdled inside her when she heard his deep perfectly modulated voice right now attenuated to something just above a whisper but then theyre all trouble he sounded out of breath cant you see anything with those he must be talking about jaskens enhancing oculenses a fabulously expensive piece of hardware like heavyduty sunglasses they turned night to day made heat visible and could see radio waves allegedly jasken tended to wear them all the time which she had always thought was just showing off or betrayed some deep insecurity wonderful though they might be they had yet to deliver her into veppers exquisitely manicured hands she was standing flattened against a flat scenery in the gloom a moment before she had spread herself against the enormous backdrop she had been able to make out that it was just painted canvas with great sweeps of dark and light paint but she had been too close to it to see what it actually portrayed she angled her head out a little and risked a quick look down and to the left to where the two men were standing on a gantry cantilevered out from the side of the fly towers north wall she glimpsed a pair of shadowy figures one holding something that might have been a rifle she couldnt be sure unlike jasken she had only her own eyes to see with she brought her head back in again quickly but smoothly scared that she might be seen and tried to breathe deeply evenly silently she twisted her neck this way and that clenched and unclenched her fists flexed her already aching legs she was standing on a narrow wooden ledge at the bottom of the flat it was slightly narrower than her shoes she had to keep her feet splayed toes pointing outwards in opposite directions to stop herself from falling beneath unseen in the darkness the wide rear stage of the opera house was twenty metres further down if she fell there were probably other crossgantries or scenery towers in the way for her to hit on the way down above her unseen in the gloom was the rest of the fly tower and the gigantic carousel that sat over the rear of the opera houses stage and stored all the multifarious sets its elaborate productions required she started to edge very slowly along the ledge away from where the two men stood on the wall gantry her left heel still hurt where shed dug out a tracer device days earlier sulbazghi she heard veppers say voice low he and jasken had been talking quietly to each other now they were probably using a radio or something similar she didnt hear any answer from dr sulbazghi probably jasken was wearing an earpiece maybe veppers too though he rarely carried a phone or any other comms gear veppers jasken and dr s she wondered how many were chasing her as well as these three veppers had guards to command a whole retinue of servants aides helpers and other employees who might be pressed into service to help in a pursuit like this the opera houses own security would help too if called on the place belonged to veppers after all and no doubt veppers good friend the city chief of police would lend any forces requested of him in the highly unlikely event veppers couldnt muster enough of his own she kept on sliding her way along the ledge on the north side wall she heard veppers say after a few moments gazing up at varied bucolic backdrops and scenic scenes no sign of our little illustrated girl he sighed theatrically she thought which was at least appropriate lededje he called out suddenly she was startled to hear her own name she trembled and felt the painted flat at her back wobble her left hand flew to one of the two knives shed stolen the double sheath looped onto the belt of the workmans trousers she was wearing she started to tip forward felt herself about to fall she brought her hand back steadied herself again lededje his voice her name echoed inside the great dark depths of the fly carousel she shuffled further along the narrow ledge was it starting to bend she thought she felt it flexing beneath her feet lededje veppers called again come on now this is becoming boring i have a terribly important reception to attend in a couple of hours and you know how long it takes to get me properly dressed and ready youll have astil fretting you wouldnt want that now would you she indulged a sneer she didnt give a damn what astil veppers pompous butler thought or felt youve had your few days of freedom but thats over now accept it veppers deep voice said echoing come out like a good girl and i promise you wont be hurt not much anyway a slap perhaps a minor addition to your bodymark just possibly small a detail obviously and exquisitely done of course id have it no other way she thought she could hear him smiling as he spoke but no more i swear seriously dear child come out now while i can still persuade myself this is merely charming high spirits and attractive rebelliousness rather than gross treachery and outright insult fuck you lededje said very very quietly she took another couple of shuffling sliding steps along the thin wooden band at the foot of the flat she heard what might have been a creak beneath her she swallowed and kept on going lededje come on veppers voice boomed out im trying terribly hard to be reasonable here i am being reasonable arent i jasken she heard jasken mutter something then veppers voice pealed out again yes indeed there you are even jasken thinks im being reasonable and hes been making so many excuses for you hes practically on your side what more can you ask for so now its your turn this is your last chance show yourself young lady im becoming impatient this is no longer funny do you hear me oh very clearly she thought how he liked the sound of his own voice joiler veppers had never been one to fight shy of letting the world know exactly what he thought about anything and thanks to his wealth influence and extensive media interests the world indeed the system the entire enablement had never really had much choice but to listen i am serious lededje this is not a game this stops now by your choice if youve any sense or i make it stop and trust me scribblechild you do not want me to make it stop another sliding step another creak from beneath her feet well at least his voice might cover any noise she might be making five beats lededje he called then we do it the hard way her feet slid slowly along the thin strip of wood all right veppers said she could hear the anger in his voice and despite her hate her utter contempt for him something about that tone still had the effect of sending a chill of fear through her suddenly there was a noise like a slap and for an instant she thought hed struck jasken across the face then realised it was just a handclap one he shouted a pause then another clap two her right hand tightly gloved was extended as far as she could reach feeling for the thin strip of wood that formed the edge of the scenery flat beyond that should lie the wall and ladders steps gantries even just ropes anything to let her make her escape another even louder clap echoing in the dark lost spaces of the carousel fly tower three she tried to remember the size of the opera stage she had been here a handful of times with veppers and the rest of his extended entourage brought along as a trophy a walking medal denoting his commercial victories she ought to be able to remember all she could recall was being sourly impressed by the scale of everything the brightness depth and working complexity of the scenery the physical effects produced by trapdoors hidden wires smoke machines and fireworks the sheer amount of noise the hidden orchestra and the strutting overdressed singers and their embedded microphones could create it had been like watching a very convincing supersize holoscreen but one comically limited to just this particular width and depth and height of set and incapable of the sudden cuts and instant changes of scene and scale possible in a screen there were hidden cameras focused on the principal players and side screens at the edge of the stage showing them in d closeup but it was still perhaps just because of the obviously prodigious amount of effort time and money spent on it all a bit pathetic really it was as though being fabulously rich and powerful meant not being able to enjoy a film or at least not being able to admit to enjoying one but still you had to try to recreate films on stage she hadnt seen the point veppers had loved it four only afterwards mingling paraded socialising exhibited had she realised it was really just an excuse and the opera itself a sideshow the true spectacle of the evening was always played out inside the sumptuous foyer upon the glittering staircases within the curved sweep of dazzlingly lit highceilinged corridors beneath the towering chandeliers in the palatial anterooms around fabulously laden tables in resplendently decorated saloons in the absurdly grand rest rooms and in the boxes front rows and elected seats of the auditorium rather than on the stage itself the superrich and ultrapowerful regarded themselves as the true stars and their entrances and exits gossip approaches advances suggestions proposals and prompts within the public spaces of this massive building constituted the proper business of the event enough of this melodrama lady veppers shouted if it was just the three of them veppers jasken and sulbazghi and if it stayed just the three of them she might have a chance she had embarrassed veppers and he wouldnt want any more people to know about that than absolutely had to jasken and dr s didnt count they could be relied upon they would never talk others might others would if outsiders had to be involved they would surely know she had disobeyed him and bested him even temporarily he would feel the shame of that magnified by his grotesque vanity it was that overweening selfregard that inability to suffer even the thought of shame that might let her get away five she paused felt herself swallow as the final clap resounded in the darkness around her so thats what you want veppers shouted again she could hear the anger in his voice you had your chance lededje now we sir she shouted not too loudly still looking away from him in the direction she was shuffling what was that her led jasken shouted sir she yelled keeping her voice lower than a full shout but trying to make it sound as though she was putting all her effort into it im here im done with this my apologies sir ill accept whatever punishment you choose indeed you will she heard veppers mutter then he raised his voice where is here he called where are you she raised her head projecting her voice into the great dark spaces above where vast sets like stacked cards loomed in the tower sir near the top i think shes up there jasken said sounding incredulous can you see her no sir can you show yourself little lededje veppers shouted let us see where you are have you a light um ah wait a moment sir she said in her halfshout angling her head upwards again she shuffled a little faster along the ledge now she had an image in her head of the size of the stage the sets and flats that came down to produce backgrounds for the action they were vast enormously wide she probably wasnt halfway across yet i have she began then let her voice fade away this might buy her a little extra time might keep veppers from going crazy the general manager is with dr sulbazghi now sir she heard jasken say is he now veppers sounded exasperated the general manager is upset sir apparently he wishes to know what is going on in his opera house its my fucking opera house veppers said loudly oh all right tell him were looking for a stray and have sulbazghi turn on the lights we might as well now there was a pause then he said testily yes of course all the lights shit lededje breathed she tried to move even faster felt the wooden ledge beneath her feet bounce lededje veppers shouted can you hear me she didnt reply lededje stay where you are dont risk moving were going to turn on the lights the lights came on there were fewer than shed expected and it became dimly lit around her rather than dazzlingly bright of course most of the lights would be directed at the stage itself not up into the scenery inside the fly tower carousel still there was enough light to gain a better impression of her surroundings she could see the greys blues blacks and whites of the painted flat she was pressed against though she still had no idea what the enormous painting represented and could see the dozens of massive hanging backgrounds some threedimensional metres thick sculpted to resemble port scenes town squares peasant villages mountain crags forest canopies hanging above her they bowed out as they ascended held inside the barrel depths of the carousel like vast pages in some colossal illustrated book she was about halfway along the flat almost directly above the middle of the stage fifteen metres or more still to go it was too far she would never make it she could see down too the brightly shining stage was over twenty metres below she tore her gaze away the creaking sound beneath her desperately shuffling feet had taken on a rhythm now what could she do what other way out was there she thought of the knives i still cant veppers said sir that bit of scenery its moving look shit shit shit she breathed trying to move still faster lededje are you she heard steps then sir shes there i can see her buggering fuck she had time to say then heard the creaking noise beneath her turn into a splitting splintering sound and felt herself sinking being lowered gently at first she brought her hands in unsheathed both knives then there was a noise like a gunshot the wooden ledge beneath her gave way and she started to fall she heard jasken shout something she twisted turned stabbed both knives into the plasticised canvas of the flat holding on grimly to each handle as she pulled herself in as close as she could her gloved fists at her shoulders hearing the canvas tear and watching it split in front of her eyes the twin blades slicing quickly down to the foot of the enormous painting where the jagged remains of the wooden ledge sagged and fell the knives were going to cut right through the bottom of the canvas she was sure shed seen something like this done in a film and it had all looked a lot easier hissing she twisted both knives turning each blade from vertical to horizontal she stopped falling and hung there bouncing gently on the torn straining canvas her legs swung in space beneath her shit this wasnt going to work her arms were getting sore and starting to shake already whats she she heard veppers say then oh my god shes have them rotate the carousel sir jasken said quickly once its in the right position they can lower her to the stage of course sulbazghi she could hardly hear what they were saying she was breathing so hard and her blood was pounding in her ears she glanced to one side the now broken length of wood shed been sidling along had been attached to the bottom of the scenery flat by big staples sunk into the doublefolded hem of the giant painting to her right just under a bodylength away from her some of these still held she started swinging herself from side to side her breath whooshing and hissing out of her as she forced her arms to stay locked in position while her legs and lower body pendulumed she thought she heard the two men shouting at her but she couldnt be sure she swung wildly to and fro moving the whole rippling extent of the scenery flat nearly there she hooked her right leg onto the ledge found purchase and detached one knife hooking and stabbing at the canvas above her keeping the blade horizontal flat angled down behind the canvas the knife held she hauled herself up until she was about midway between prone and upright she brought the other knife out and swung it up too still higher now whats she lededje jasken yelled stop youll kill yourself she was upright hanging by the two embedded knives she swung up and out stuck a blade in still further up her arm muscles felt as though they were on fire but she was pulling herself upwards shed had no idea that she possessed such strength her pursuers controlled the machinery of course they could rotate the whole vast apparatus and could lower her as they wished but shed resist them to the last veppers had no idea he was the one who still thought this was a game she knew it was to the death then there was a deep humming sound and with a low moaning noise the whole scenery flat and all the others around above and below it started to move upwards hauling the scenery flat up into the dim heights of the enormous carousel upwards she wanted to laugh but had no breath for it she was feeling for the knife holes beneath with her feet now finding them using them as footholds taking some of the strain off her protesting arm muscles thats the wrong fucking way veppers screamed she heard jasken shouting something too thats the wrong fucking way veppers bellowed again make it stop other way other way sulbazghi what are you playing at sulbazghi the gigantic carousel continued to turn rotating the sets and flats like a vast spitroast she glanced over her shoulder and saw that as the whole assemblage rotated lifting the backdrop that she was climbing away from above the stage itself it was getting closer to the next flat all of the stacked sets pressing in towards each other as they came to the horizontal limit of the space the set closing in on her back looked plain and smooth and lacking in features just another painted scene with a few thin supporting crossbeams and as hard to climb as this one above she could see more complicated threedimensional sets some boasting lights that must have come on when theyd turned on all the rest she put her face against the canvas stared through the knife hole shed just made a very convincing oldeworlde rooftop scene greeted her oddly angled gutters quaintly tiny dormer windows steeppitched slate roofs wonky chimney pots some with real pretend smoke just starting to come out of them and a net a tracery of tiny blue lights strung right across the width of the set and for twenty metres or more above the chimneys and ridge tiles impersonating stars the whole thing was sliding gradually closer edging slowly downwards as the carousel continued to revolve she ignored the stillshouting men slit a hole in the canvas big enough for her to slip through and once on the far side launched herself at the rooftop set the canvas flat shed thrown herself from moved away as she kicked back at it she started to fall heard herself scream then half her body from the waist up thudded into the fake slates winded she found both her knives had gone and she was holding on with both hands to a set of flimsyfeeling railings in front of a tall set of windows something clattered far beneath her the knives she guessed the two men below were still shouting it sounded like half at her and half at dr sulbazghi she wasnt listening to either of them veppers and jasken couldnt see her now part of the rooftop set was hiding her from them she hauled herself up on the phoney wroughtiron railings the plastic bending in her grip and threatening to break she found more handholds on hoax gutters dummy window ledges and counterfeit chimneys she was at the top trying to make her way along the ridge through the cold fake smoke issuing from the chimney pots when the carousel came grinding to a stop making the whole set judder she lost her footing slipped and fell down the far side screaming the tracery of tiny lights the pretend star field of a clear night sky caught her entangling her in their chilly blue embrace the net bowing and stretching but not breaking the hard wires conjoining the lights seeming to wrap themselves around her and tighten as she struggled now she heard veppers shout there was a single crack of rifle fire an instant later she felt a blindingly sharp pain on her right hip and then moments after that the little fake blue stars and the drifting smoke that wasnt real smoke and the whole insane edifice all just drifted away from her manhandled she was being manhandled now she was being laid down on a hard surface her limbs flopped around her feeling somehow disconnected if shed had to guess shed have hazarded that she had been gently placed here rather than just thrown down that was a good sign she hoped it was anyway her head felt okay not nearly as sore as the last occasion she wondered how much time had passed they had probably taken her back to the town house just a few city segments away from the opera house she might even be back in espersium runaways were usually returned to the great estate to await veppers pleasure sometimes you had to wait days or even weeks to discover the full extent of your punishment one of jaskens tranquilliser rounds usually knocked you out for a good few hours there would have been time to get her anywhere on the planet or off it it struck her as she lay there hearing muffled words spoken around her that she was thinking a lot more clearly than shed have expected she found she could control her eyes and opened them as narrowly as she could peering through the lashes to see whatever was around her town house the estate interesting to find out the surroundings were dim veppers was standing over her all perfect teeth radiantly elegant face white mane golden skin wide shoulders and dramatic cloak there was somebody else there more felt than seen doing something at her hip dr sulbazghi grizzled brown square of face and frame walked into view handing veppers something your knives sir he said veppers took them inspected them he shook his head little bitch he breathed taking these they were your grandfathers sulbazghi said voice rumbling yes we know little bitch veppers said and almost chuckled mind you they were her great grandfathers before that so you can see but still he slid both knives into his waistband dr sulbazghi was squatting down now to her left looking at her he put a hand to her face wiping away some of the pale millimetrethick makeup shed applied he wiped the hand on his jacket leaving a pale streak it was very dim around her dim above dr s too and their voices hardly echoed at all as though they were standing in some enormous space something didnt feel right there was a tug at her hip no pain at all jaskens pale lean face came into view made insectile by the oculenses he was squatting by her right side still holding the rifle the tranq dart in his other hand it was hard to tell in the dim light with the lenses obscuring half the mans face but it looked like he was frowning at the dart behind him a scaffolding tower reached up to an enormous roofscape hanging in the dimness its roofs oddly angled and foreshortened its comically askew chimneys still leaking pretend smoke great god she was still in the opera house and quickly coming to almost undrugged by some miracle i think her eye just flickered veppers said and started to lower himself towards her cloak belling out around him she closed her eyes quickly shutting out the view she felt a tremor run through her body she halfflexed her hand and fingers and sensed that she would be able to move now if she wanted to cant have the doctor said she ought to be out for hours shouldnt she jasken wait jasken said this round hit the bone might not have fully what absurd beauty veppers said quietly his deep infinitely seductive voice very very near to her she felt him wipe at her face as well removing the makeup she had applied to hide her markings isnt it odd i rarely just look at her this close as a rule that is because she thought calmly when you rape me sir you choose to take me from behind she sensed his breath a wave of warmth on her cheek sulbazghi took her wrist in his chubby hand gently probing for a pulse sir she might not jasken began her eyes flicked open she was staring into veppers face immediately over hers filling her field of vision his eyes started to widen and an expression of alarm began to form on his fabulously smooth and perfect features she pushed herself up and twisted her head opening her mouth baring her teeth and aiming for his throat she must have closed her eyes at the last instant but sensed him pulling up and away her teeth crunched closed on something and veppers shrieked her head was shaken back and forth as her teeth remained tight around whatever she had bitten and he tried desperately to pull himself free get her off me he screeched his voice strangled and nasal she bit harder with the last of her strength and forced another anguished scream from veppers as something tore free then her jaw was clamped from beneath an iron grip causing astounding pain and she had to let go she could taste blood her head was forced back down to the floor with a painful thud and she opened her eyes to see veppers staggering away clutching his nose and mouth blood coursed down over his chin and shirt jasken was holding her head down hands still clamped round her jaw and neck dr sulbazghi was rising from her side to go to his master there was something hard and grisly in her mouth something almost too big to swallow she forced it down all the same gagging and sputtering whatever it was it hesitated as it passed down her throat beneath jaskens clamping hands and he might have thought to stop her swallowing but didnt she grabbed a tight wheezing breath has she veppers sobbed as sulbazghi came up to him teasing the taller mans hands away from his face veppers staring down crosseyed took a sudden breath too she fucking has shes bitten my fucking nose off he howled veppers pushed sulbazghi away sending the older man staggering then took two steps to where she lay held down by jasken she saw the knives in veppers hands sir jasken said taking one hand away from her throat and raising it towards his master veppers kicked jasken aside and straddled lededje before she could even start to rise pinning her arms to the floor blood was flowing freely from his nose and spattering all over her face neck and shirt oh not even the whole nose she had time to think just the tip a fine ragged mess though try laughing that off at your next diplomatic reception prime executive veppers he plunged the first knife into her throat and slashed sideways the second into her chest the second knife hit off a rib bouncing away upper arms trapped she tried as best she could to put her hands up as her breath bubbled out of her neck the taste of blood was very strong and she needed to breathe and to cough but could do neither veppers batted her hands away as he looked down and carefully aimed his next thrust a fingerwidth further down from the one that had been deflected he briefly lowered his face to hers you little cunt he screamed some of his blood fell into her slackly open mouth i was supposed to appear in public this evening he pushed hard and the blade slid between her ribs and into her heart she looked up into the darkness as her heart thrashed and jerked around the blade as though trying to clutch it then her heart spasmed one last time and fell back to a sort of faintly trembling pulseless calm for a moment when veppers jerked the knife out even that ceased a weight infinitely greater than that of just one man seemed to settle on her she felt too tired to breathe now her last breath fluttered from her tornopen windpipe like a departing lover somehow everything seemed to have gone very quiet and still around her even though she was aware of shouting and could feel veppers rise up and off her though not without giving her a final slap across the face just for good measure she could sense the other two men were moving quickly to her side once again touching feeling trying to staunch to find a pulse to plug her wounds too late now she thought meant nothing the darkness was moving in remorselessly from the edges of her field of vision she stared up into it unable even to blink she waited for some profound insight or thought but none came high above her the simulated sceneries and architectures stacked within the giant carousel swung slowly back and forth all slowly going dim in front of the hanging roofscape above her she could see a flat tatteredlooking mountain scene all soaring snowy peaks and ruggedly romantic crags beneath a clouddotted sky of blue the effect somewhat spoiled by rips and tears in the fabric and a broken lower frame so that was what shed been pressed up against mountains sky perspective she thought woozily slowly as she died what a wonderful thing two conscript vatueil late of their highnesses first cavalry now reduced to the third expeditionary sappers wiped his sweating brow with a grimy calloused hand he worked his knees forward a few centimetres across the stony floor of the tunnel sending fresh darts of pain up his legs and plunged the shorthandle spade into the shadowy face of the pebbledotted wall of dirt immediately ahead of him the exertion set off further stabs of pain which ran up his back and across his straining shoulders the worn spade bit into the compacted earth and stones its tip connecting with a larger rock hidden within the collision jarred his hands arms and shoulders setting his teeth on edge and ringing his aching back as though it was a bell he almost cried out but instead just sucked in a breath of stale warm humid air pungently scented with his own bodily odours and those of the other sweating straining miners around him he worked the embedded spade to one side within the dirt and tried to sense the edge of the buried rock pulling the spade out and heaving it back in again a little to the side in an attempt to find the edge of the obstruction and lever it out the spade bit into solidity on both sides making his arms and back ache again each time he let the breath out putting the spade down by his right thigh and feeling behind him for his pickaxe he had moved too far forward since hed last used it and had to look round back muscles protesting to find it he turned carefully anxious not to get in the way of the man to his right who was already swinging hard with his own pickaxe cursing under his breath all the time the new kid on his other side whose name hed already forgotten was still stabbing weakly at the face with his spade producing little he was a big powerfullooking lad but still faceweak hed need to be relieved soon if they were to keep up to target though hed pay for such deemed lack of application behind vatueil in the flickering lamplit gloom the tunnel stretched back into darkness halfnaked men on their knees or walking bent over at the waist shuffled about the confined space loaded with spades and shovels picks and pry bars somewhere behind them over their coughs and wheezed bittenoff exchanges he heard the irregular hollow rumble of an empty rubble wagon approaching he saw it thud into the buffers at the end of the line feeling delicate again vatueil the junior captain said walking over to him back bent the junior captain was the only man at the face still wearing the top half of his uniform he was sneering and had tried to put some sarcasm into his voice though he was so young vatueil still thought of him as a child and found it hard to take him seriously the delicacy the junior captain was referring to had occurred an hour earlier just after the start of vatueils shift when hed felt and then been sick sending an extra unwanted shovelful of waste back to the surface in a rubble wagon hed felt ill since just after breakfast back at the surface and on the walk to the face the last part especially doubled over had been a nightmarish slog of increasing nausea that was always a bad bit for him anyway he was tall and his back hit more of the roof support beams than the other mens he was developing what the longserving sappers called back buttons raised welts of hardened skin above each bone in his spine like giant warts ever since hed thrown up his stomach had been rumbling and hed had a raging thirst that the single meagre hourly water ration had done little to alleviate there was a chorus of shouting starting further back in the tunnel and another rumbling sound for a moment he thought it was the start of a cavein and felt a sickening pulse of fear run through him even as another part of his mind thought at least it might be quick and that would be an end to it then another rubble wagon came hurtling out of the darkness and slammed into the rear of the first one sending dust bursting out from both wagons and knocking the leading wheels of the front wagon off the track just in front of the buffers there was much more shouting and swearing as the track layers were blamed for unsettling the track behind the surface wagon emptiers were cursed for not fully emptying the wagon in the first place and everybody else further up was shouted at for not giving them more warning the junior captain ordered everybody away from the face to help get the wagon back on the rails then added not you vatueil keep working sir he said lifting the pickaxe at least with nobody around him he could get a proper swing at the obstruction he turned back and heaved the pick at a spot to the side of where the spade had baulked briefly imagining that he was swinging it at the back of the young captains head he hauled the pick out twisted it to present the flat blade rather than the spike towards the face found a slightly different position and swung hard again you developed a feel for what was going on at the end of a shovel or a pick you started to gain an insight into the justhidden depths in front of you after a while there was another jarring strike to add to all the others that had run up through his hands into his arms and back over the year hed been down here but he sensed the slightly flattened blade make a sort of double strike inside the face sliding between two rocks or into a cleft in a single more massive rock that felt hollow he thought but dismissed the idea he had leverage now a degree of purchase he strained at the wornsmooth handle of the pick something grated inside the face and the weak light from his helmet lamp showed a stretch of dirt face as long as his forearm and tall as his head hinging out towards him dirt and pebbles slumped about his knees what fell out of the hole was a piece of dressed stonework and beyond was a rectangular hole and a damp darkness a dirtfree inky absence from which a thin cold wind issued smelling of old cold stone the great castle the besieged fortress stood over the broad plain on a carpet of groundhugging mist like something unreal vatueil remembered his dreams in his dreams the castle truly was not real or not there or genuinely did float above the plain by magic or some technology unknown to him and so they burrowed on for ever never finding its base tunnelling on without cease through the killing muggy warmth and sweatmist of their own exhalations in an eternal agony of purposeless striving he had never mentioned these dreams to anybody unsure who amongst his comrades he could really trust and judging that if word of these nightmares got back to his superiors they might be deemed treacherous implying that their labours were pointless doomed to failure the castle sat on a spur of rock an island of stone jutting above the flood plain of the great meandering river the castle itself was formidable enough the cliffs that surrounded it made it close to impregnable still it had to be taken theyd been told after nearly a year of trying to starve the garrison into surrender it had been judged two years or more ago that the only way to take the stronghold was to get a great siege engine close in to the rocky outcrop enormous machines had been constructed of wood and metal and manoeuvred towards the castle on a specially built road the machines could hurl rocks or fizzing metal bombs the weight of ten men many hundreds of strides across the plain but there was a problem to get them close enough to the castle meant coming within range of the fortresss own great war machine a giant trebuchet mounted on the single massive circular tower dominating the citadel with its own range increased by virtue of its elevation the castles engine dominated the plain for nearly two thousand strides about the base of the rock all attempts to move siege engines to within range had been met with a hail of rocks from the fortresss trebuchet resulting in smashed machines and dead men the engineers had been forced to concede that constructing a machine of their own powerful enough to remain out of range of the castles war engine while still being able to hit the fortress was probably impossible so they would tunnel to near the castle rock open a pit and construct a small but powerful siege engine there under the noses of the castles garrison and supposedly under the angle at which the castles trebuchet could fire there were rumours that this absurd machine would be a sort of selffiring bomb device some sort of explosive contraption that would throw itself into the air up past the cliff and against the castle walls detonating there nobody really believed these rumours though the slightly more plausible idea of constructing a sufficiently powerful wooden catapult or trebuchet in a pit excavated at the end of a tunnel seemed just as fanciful and idiotic perhaps they were expected to tunnel up inside the castle rock when they got to it burrowing up through solid stone or maybe they were meant to place a gigantic bomb against the base of the rock these seemed no less absurd and pointless as tactics maybe the high command immeasurably distant from this far and if rumour was to believed increasingly irrelevant front had been misinformed regarding the nature of the castles foundations and thinking that the fortresss walls rested on the plain itself had ordered the mining as a matter of course imagining that the walls could be sapped conventionally and nobody nearer to the reality of the situation had thought or dared to tell them that this was impossible but then who knew how the high commanders thought vatueil put one fist to the small of his back as he stood looking out to the distant fortress he was trying to stand up straight it was getting harder to do so each day which was unfortunate as slouching was looked on unfavourably by officers especially by the young junior captain who seemed to have taken such a dislike to him vatueil looked about at the litter of greybrown tents which made up the camp above the clouds looked washed out the sun hidden behind a grey dully glowing patch over the more distant of the two ranges of hills that defined the broad plain stand up straight vatueil the junior captain told him emerging from the majors tent the junior captain was dressed in his best uniform hed had vatueil put on his best gear too not that his best was very good well dont malinger here all day get in there and dont take for ever about it this doesnt get you off anything you know dont go thinking that youve still got a shift to finish hurry up the junior captain clouted vatueil about the ear dislodging his forage cap vatueil bent to retrieve it and the young captain kicked his behind propelling him through the flap and into the tent inside he collected himself straightened and was shown where to stand in front of the board of officers conscript vatueil number he began we dont need to know your number conscript one of the two majors told him there were three senior captains and a colonel present too an important gathering just tell us what happened he briefly related prising the rock away from the face sticking his head through the hole and smelling that strange cavelike darkness hearing and seeing the water running in the channel beneath then wriggling back to tell the junior captain and the others he kept his gaze fixed somewhere above the colonels head looking down only once the officers nodded looked bored a subaltern took notes on a writing pad dismissed the more senior major told vatueil he half turned to go then turned back permission to speak further sir he said glancing at the colonel and then the major whod just spoken the major looked at him what he straightened as best he could stared above the colonels head again it occurred to me the conduit might contribute to the castles water supply sir youre not here to think conscript the major said though not unkindly no the colonel said speaking for the first time that occurred to me too its still a long way sir the junior major said weve poisoned all the nearer sources the colonel told him to no obvious effect and it is from the direction of the nearer hills vatueil risked nodding at this to show he had thought this too with their many springs the senior major said to the colonel apparently sharing some private joke the colonel looked at vatueil through narrowed eyes you were with the cavalry once werent you conscript yes sir rank captain of mount sir there was a pause the colonel filled it himself and insubordination sir down to conscript tunneller you must have been spectacularly insubordinate so it was adjudged sir there was a grunt that might have been laughter at the colonels instigation the offisorial heads were brought together there was some muttering then the more senior major said there will shortly be a small exploratory force sent along the water tunnel conscript perhaps you might care to be on it ill do as ordered sir the men will be handpicked though volunteers vatueil drew himself up as straight as he could his back complaining i volunteer sir good man you might need a crossbow as well as a shovel i can handle both sir report to the senior duty officer dismissed the calfdeep water was cold swirling round his boots and seeping into them he was fourth man back from the lead lamp extinguished only the lead man had a lit lamp and that was turned down as low as it would go the water tunnel was oval shaped just too broad to touch both sides at the same time with outstretched arms it was nearly as tall as a man you had to walk with head lowered but it was easy enough after so long being bent double the air was good better than in the mining tunnel it had flowed gently into their faces as theyd stood in the water ready to move off from the breach leading from the mining tunnel the twenty men in the detail moved down the partially filled pipe as quietly as they could wary of traps or guards they were led by a fairly old sensibleseeming captain and a very keen young subaltern there were two other tunnellers as well as himself both more powerful than he though with less combat experience like him they carried picks spades bows and short swords the larger of the two also carried a pry bar slung across his broad back these two men had been chosen by the young junior captain he had not been happy that vatueil was being allowed to go on the exploration of the water tunnel while he himself was not vatueil expected further unsubtle persecution when he returned if he returned they came to a place where the tunnel narrowed and horizontal iron bars ran across the channel set at heights that meant they had to clamber over them one at a time then came a section where the floor of the tunnel angled down and they had to brace themselves twobytwo each with a hand on one wall to stop themselves from slipping on the slimy surface under the water the tunnel all but levelled out again after that then another set of bars in a narrow section appeared out of the gloom again followed by another downward sloped section he had not dreamed this he realised as he walked this was easier than anything he had imagined in his nightmares or as it felt that they had imagined for him they might stroll all the rest of the way to the castle without having to dig another spadeful though of course the way might be blocked or guarded or might not lead to the castle after all and yet the water was here in this carefully constructed tunnel and where else would it be going on this otherwise near deserted plain if not to the castle guards or traps were more likely though even then the castle was so old that perhaps those within just drew the water unthinkingly from a deep seemingly unpoisonable well and knew nothing of the system that brought it to them better to assume that they did know though and that they or the water tunnels original designers and builders would have set up some sort of defence against enemies making their way down it he started to think about what he would put in place if he had been in charge of such matters his thoughts were interrupted when he collided softly with the back of the man in front the man behind him piled into his back too and so on down the line as they came to a halt almost without a sound a gate the subaltern whispered looking ahead over the shoulder of the man in front vatueil could just make out a broad grating filling the tunnel ahead the single lamp was turned up a little the water sieved itself between thick bars of what appeared to be iron there was more whispering between the captain and the subaltern the tunnellers were called forward and were confronted by the grating it was locked shut against a stout vertical iron stanchion immediately behind it looked like it was designed to hinge back towards them and then up towards the ceiling a strange arrangement vatueil thought all three tunnellers were ordered to light their lamps the better to inspect the lock it was about the size of a clenched fist the chain securing it made of links thick as a little finger it looked rusted but only slightly one of the other tunnellers lifted his pickaxe testing his swing and where the point might strike to break the lock that will be noisy sir vatueil whispered the sound will travel a long way down the tunnel what do you suggest bite it the younger officer asked him try to lever it off with the pry bar sir he said the senior officer nodded all right the tunneller with the pry bar brought it over his shoulder and wedged it under the lock while vatueil and the other miner held it out from the grating angling it just so to increase the effect then once their comrade had taken the strain joining him to pull hard on the end of the bar they strained for a few moments to no effect beyond a faint creaking sound they relaxed then pulled again with a dull snap and a loud clank the lock gave way sending the three of them falling backwards into the water in a clattering tangle the chain rattled down into the water to join them scarcely quiet the subaltern muttered they picked themselves up sorted themselves out no sticks or branches or anything against it one of the other men said nodding at the foot of the grating settling pool further back another suggested through the grating vatueil could see what looked like stony blocks in the path the water took beyond like square narrow stepping stones filling the base of the tunnel why would you put those there he wondered ready to raise it the captain said sir the two tunnellers said together taking a side each arms thrust into the dark water to pull at the foot of the grating heave lads the officer told them they pulled and with a dull scraping noise the grating hinged slowly up they shifted their grip as it rose and pushed it towards the ceiling vatueil saw something move on the ceiling just behind the slowly moving grille wait a moment he said perhaps too quietly in any event nobody seemed to take any notice something some things each big as a mans head fell one glinting in the lamp light from the ceiling they smashed on the edges of the raised blocks beneath and dark liquid came pouring out of them as their jagged remains vanished into the moving water it was only then that the men hauling up the grating stopped too late what was that somebody asked the water around the blocks where the liquid had entered was bubbling and fuming sending great grey bubbles of gas to the surface of the water where they burst producing thick white fumes the gas was rising quickly into the air starting to obscure what view there might have been down the tunnel beyond its just somebody started then their voice trailed away back lads the captain said as the fumes drifted closer that might be back lads back vatueil heard water sloshing as some of them started to move away the pale fog now almost filled the place where the grating had been the men nearest it the two tunnellers stood back letting go of the grille it crashed down into the water one of them took a step back the other seemed transfixed by the sight remaining close enough to sniff the milky grey cloud he started coughing immediately doubling up hands on knees his lowered head met a long silky strand of the gas at waist level and he wheezed suddenly standing up and coughing again and again he turned and waved down the tunnel then seemed to have a seizure he fell to his knees clutching at his throat eyes wide his breath rattled in his throat the other tunneller moved towards him but was waved away the fellow slumped back against the wall of the tunnel eyes closing a couple of the other men also now near to the advancing cloud started to cough as well almost as one they started to run suddenly pounding down the tunnel slipping and sliding and falling the surface underfoot that had supported slow and steady steps with barely a slip turning to something like ice as they tried to run through the calfdeep water a couple of them pushed past vatueil who had not yet moved we will never get past the narrow places with the bars he thought we wont even make it up the slopes before them he realised the cloud was flowing up the tunnel at a moderate walking pace it was already at his knees rising to his groin he had taken a deep breath as soon as hed seen the dirty looking bubbles rising out of the water he let it out took another one now some of the others were shouting and screaming as they ran away up the tunnel though the principal noise was a frenzied splashing the cloud of gas enveloped vatueil he clamped his hand over his mouth and nose even so he could smell something sharp choking his eyes began to sting his nose to run the grating would be too heavy he thought he stooped felt for it then with an effort he would not have believed himself capable of lifted it in one movement and swung himself beneath it stumbling through the water beyond as he let the grille go his boots crunched on shattered pieces of glass under the surface of the water he remembered to lift his feet for the blocks the bottles had smashed on the grey cloud was all around him like a cloak his eyes were stinging and starting to close up seemingly of their own volition he stepped quickly over the blocks staggered into the water on the far side then ran as fast as he could into clear air beyond his lungs feeling as though they were about to burst somehow he managed to delay breathing until he could see no trace of the grey mist either in the air or rising in bubbles from the water he could hardly see and the first deep heaving breath he took stung first his mouth and then his throat all the way down to his lungs even the exhalation seemed to sting his nose he took more deep deep breaths standing doubled over with his hands on his knees each breath hurt but stung less than the one before from up the tunnel he could hear nothing eventually he was able to breathe sufficiently freely to move without gasping he looked back into the darkness and tried to imagine the scenes he might find walking back to the breach once the gas had cleared he wondered how long that would take he turned and made his way in the other direction towards the castle guards found him hollering at the far end where a vertical well shaft descended to a deep pool taken before the castle authorities he informed them that he would tell them anything they wanted to know he was just a humble tunneller whod been lucky and resourceful enough to evade the trap which had claimed the lives of his fellows but he knew of the scheme to tunnel to near the castle and set up some sort of compact but powerful siege engine and additionally he would tell all that he could about the little he knew of the disposition numbers and quality of the forces besieging the castle if they would but spare his life they took him away and asked him many questions all of which he answered truthfully then they tortured him to make sure hed been telling the truth finally uncertain where his loyalties might lie unwilling to support yet another mouth to feed and judging his tormentbroken body of little practical use they trussed him and fired him from the giant trebuchet in the great tower by chance he fell to earth not far from the tunnel he had helped dig landing with a thump that some of his old comrades heard above them as they tramped back to camp after another backbreaking shift stopping up one tunnel and continuing with their own his last thought was that he had once dreamed of flying three it was some time before yime nsokyi realised she was the last one left firing the orbitals hub had been the first thing to go blitzed in an instant by a staggeringly bright cam burst before there had been any warning whatsoever then the hundred or so major ships moored beneath the os outer surface contained within bulkhead range docks or approaching or leaving the orbital had been destroyed in a single synchronised scattergun blaze minds precisely obliterated by exquisitely focused linegun loci their already crampacked substrates collapsing into particles more dense than neutron star material all that prized wit intelligence and knowledgealmostbeyondmeasuring snuffed in every case to a barely visible ultradense cinder almost before they had time to realise what was happening to them while the shock waves from the gravitypoint collapses were still propagating through the victim vessels internal structures and hulls they were slammed with meticulously graded degrees of further destruction the craft within or very close to the o targeted with small nukes and thermonuclear charges sufficient to destroy the ships themselves without compromising the strategic structure of the orbital itself while those further out were simply smithereened with antimatter warheads their megatonne bodies slashed across the outboard skies in blinding pulses of energy that threw jagged shadows across the vast internal surfaces of the world all of this in a handful of seconds a heartbeat later the independent highai defensive nodes overseeing each of the os original plates had been knocked out with pinpoint plasma displacements and simultaneously the few thousand nearby interstellarclass ships were attacked meeting their fates in a grotesque parody of size seniority first the larger more capable craft vanishing in nuclear or thermonuclear explosions then the secondrank ships moments later followed by smaller and smaller vessels until all those were gone and the blossoming waves of annihilation moved on to target the slowest insystem craft finally the semislaved ais dotted at random throughout the fabric of the entire bracelet world had stopped communicating all at once the weapon systems that they had fallen heir to as the higherlevel control processes had been destroyed either subsiding to dormancy or actively starting to attack whatever defensive capability there was left drones and humans taking command of independently controllable weapon and munition delivery systems made up what was left the few machines and people in the right place at the right time scrabbling to take over from the blitzed machines even as they were struggling to comprehend what was happening to their world its end yime nsokyi thought as shed careened down a drop shaft from the traveltube interchange shed been in as the attack began shed bounced into the little blowndiamond bubble of the ancient plasma cannons backup control blister in time to be almost blinded by a detonating insystem clipper ship less than a millisecond away the diamonds outer protective film barely having time to switch to mirror and her own eyes reacting late leaving her with dots dancing in her eyes as well as the blush of an instant radiation tan warming her face not the end of the world though she thought as she settled into the seat and felt the restraints close around her not destroying the o itself just everything about it probably the end of my world though this doesnt look survivable she tried to remember when shed last backed up months ago she wasnt even sure sloppy she kicked the guns systems out of network and into local control dumbing its systems down to minimally interferablewith hardened optic communication with atomechanical backup readied and mirroring then flicked antiquely solid switches on a control panel creating a great hum and buzz all around her as the thirtymetre turret woke up screens bright controls alive she brought the bulky helmet over her head checked it was working on visual and audio and that there was air in the mask component then left it in place for added protection as much as anything while the guns ancient control comms established direct links with her neural lace systems designed and code written millennia apart met made sense and established rules and parameters it was a strange invasively unpleasant feeling like a spreading itch inside her skull she could not scratch she felt the lace using her drug glands to jink her already quickened senses and reactions up to one of her preagreed maxima felt like the setting was deterioration within minutes and burnout in less than a quarter of an hour ah the very quickest the allout emergency mode that wasnt encouraging her own lace was giving her just a handful of minutes to be of use as a fully functioning component of the orbitals lastditch defence outside grippings and pressings all over her body like being nuzzled by a few dozen small but powerful animals confirmed that the gun control blisters protective armour had enfolded her she and the gun were as ready as theyd ever be for what came next she stared out into the darkness senses enhanced to the point of nearly painful distraction as she searched for anything that wasnt basically culture stuff getting wasted nothing visible appreciable at all she established hardened comms links with a few other people and drones all of them within the limit of this sections original plate boundary her fellow warriors were shown as a line of blue telltale lights on a screen at the lower limit of her field of vision they quickly determined that none of them knew what was happening and nobody could see anything to fire at almost immediately there was a hoarse scream quickly cut off and one light turned from blue to red as a compromised highkinetic cannon picked off another plasma turret a thousand kilometres away five hundred klicks spinward a drone controlling a linegun with links to a skeinsensing field reported nothing happening on the skein either save for the fallback waves following the initial pulses that had wrecked the ship minds whoever it is they want the o one of the humans said as they watched the spread of detonating sparks that were just a few of the nearby insystem craft meeting their ends the ships deaths outshone the stars replacing the familiar constellations with bright but fading patterns of their own her lace stepped her awareness speed down to a level where something like normal speech was possible grunts on the ground another agreed maybe theyll just drop into the surface displace onto the interior yime suggested maybe edgewall stuff emplaced for that anybody in touch with any edgewall firepower nobody was they had no contact with the os interior at all or with any independent craft or with anybody manning the defences anywhere else they busied themselves with scanning with what senses they had access to checking and readying their own weaponry and trying to establish contact with survivors further afield in the darkness the wrecks of the last insystem craft winked out brief fires exhausted around yimes position a few traveltube cars dropped away into the night as people tried to save themselves by using the cars as lifeboats on average they got about ten klicks out before they were picked off too quick tiny eruptions of light pinpricking the black anything somebody began got something the drone with the skein sense sent too quick for speech her lace kicked her awareness speed up to maximum so quickly the last syllable of the previous speakers word went on for many seconds providing an impromptu soundtrack to what was happening in the skies beyond the ships were popping into existence just a few thousand klicks out travelling at between one and eight per cent of lightspeed no beaconry iff or any signal at all not even trying to pretend they were anything else but hostile thinking these are targets somebody communicated over the stillopen voice comm channels came a highpitched whine like something charging a first glance indicated hundreds of the ships a second thousands they filled the sky darting like demented fireworks in as many different directions as there were craft some accelerated hard some slowed to almost stationary seemingly within seconds those incoming zipped in and were a few tens of klicks out and closing fast before there was time to get more than a few shots off the drones yime thought the drones will be reacting fastest firing first she swung the ancient plasma turret directly outwards found a target and felt the antique machines senses and hers agree lock and fire in the same instant the old turret trembled and twin pulses of light lanced out missing whatever it was they were aiming at plenty more targets she thought as she and the gun swung fractionally retargeted set for a wider beamspread and fired again something blazed within the cone of beam filaments but there was no time to celebrate as she and the gun swung again and again flicking minutely from side to side and up and down like something trembling uncertain there were more bursts of fire within the targeting focus and there was a certain desperate exultation in just firing firing firing but in some stillcalm part of her mind she knew they werent getting more than a per cent of the attacking craft and the rest were still closing or had arrived something at the lower limit of her vision attracted her attention she watched the last of the little blue telltale lights turn red all gone so quickly she was the last one she realised the last one left firing the view hazed quivered started to die she killed the link systems swept the helmet back over her head as its screens went blank and staring out into the night through her own eyes and the invisible diamond blister yanked the manual controls from the arm squabs and hauled the turret round to fire at a fastapproaching bright dot just starting to take on substance there was a thump that somehow felt nearby back here by the turret not out there where she was aiming and the impression of something just outside the diamond bubble she clicked a switch to let the guns atomechanical brain do its own targeting and turned her head the things scrabbling towards the turret across the os outer surface looked like metallic versions of a human ribcage plus skull running and bouncing on six multiply jointed legs bizarrely they appeared to be racing across the surface as though they were experiencing the equivalent of gravity drawing them down against it rather than its exact opposite she was still reaching for the control seats hand weapon when one of the creatures launched itself at the bubble smashed through it and landed where her lap would have been had she not been swaddled in the turrets control blister armour the air in the diamond bubble left in a burst of white vapour that disappeared almost instantly as the skullfaced creature a machine she saw stuck its face up to hers and despite the lack of atmosphere and no visible method of producing the sound said very clearly drill over she sighed sat back somewhere else entirely as the shattered control blister the crippled plasma turret itself and the doomed orbital dissipated like mist around her it was unpleasant distressing and of little practical use yime nsokyi told her drill supervisor sternly it was a punishment drill a simulation for masochists i saw little point to it granted it is about as extreme as they get her supervisor said cheerfully allout equivtech complete surprise attack just short of total orbital destruction hvel costrile was an elderlylooking gent with dark skin long blond hair and a bare chest he was talking to her in her apartment via a wall screen it looked like he was on a sea vessel somewhere as there was a large expanse of water in the background and his immediate surroundings a plush seat some railings kept tipping slightly this way and that the screen display was in d by her choice yime nsokyi didnt hold with things looking too much like whatever they were not instructive though dont you think no she told him i fail to see the instructional element implicit in being subject to a completely unstoppable attack and thus being utterly overwhelmed in a matter of minutes worse things happen in real wars yime costrile told her with a grin faster more complete destruction i imagine simulations of those would have even less to teach apart from the wisdom of avoiding such initial condition sets in the first place she told him and i might add that i also fail to see the utility of causing me to experience a simulation in which i harbour a neural lace given that i have never possessed one and have no intentions of ever having one costrile nodded that was propaganda neural laces are just useful in that sort of extremity until they too are corrupted and possibly the person invested by the device as well he shrugged by that time the games pretty much up anyway youd imagine yime shook her head one might equally well imagine otherwise whatever they let you backup really easily he said reasonably that is not a lifechoice i have chosen to make yime informed him frostily oh well costrile sighed then accepted a long drink from somebody just out of shot he raised it to her till next time something more practical i promise till then she agreed strength in depth but the screen was already blank she said close screen anyway telling the relatively dumb house computer to kill any link at her end yime was entirely untroubled by intelligent house systems but did not wish to be subject to one she was happy to admit to feeling a degree of satisfaction that she was by some orders of magnitude the most intelligent entity within her immediate surroundings in general and her own living space in particular it was not a claim one could convincingly make in very many culture dwellings prebeignfrultesa yime leutze nsokyi dam volsh much preferred to be known only as yime nsokyi she had moved away from her home orbital and so her name now lacked utility no longer working as even an approximate address worse bearing the name of one location while living in another felt to her like something close to deceit she walked over to the window picked up a plain but functional brush from a small table and continued to brush her long hair which was what she had been doing meticulously when the emergency militia drill alert had come through on her personal terminal and she had reluctantly had to submit to the induction collar and the resulting horribly realistic sim of the orbital even if it wasnt this orbital but a more standard less militarily prepared orbital being so thoroughly savaged and so easily taken over outside the oval of window she stood at only very slightly distorted by the sheer thickness of the crystal and other materials forming the glazing the view was of rolling grassy countryside punctuated with numerous lakes and strewn with forests woods copses and individual trees all the windows in yimes apartment looked out in roughly the same direction but had she been looking from any other apartment on this level the view would have been much the same plus or minus hazy views of mountains inland seas and oceans with no other buildings visible at all beyond the occasional distant lakeside villa or drifting houseboat despite this yime lived in a city and although the construction she lived in was fairly substantial a kilometre tall and perhaps a tenth of that across it itself was not the totality of the metropolis forming only a small part of it and being nowhere near the most impressive of its buildings but then it was nowhere near any of the other buildings of the city the building was part of a distributed city which to the naive or uninformed eye looked remarkably like no city whatsoever most culture cities where they existed at all resembled giant snowflakes with greenery or at least countryside in whatever colour or form penetrating almost to the heart of the conurbation had its major buildings been gathered together on the same patch of ground this city irwal on the orbital called dinyolhei would have looked more like some vision of the far future from sometime in the enormously distant past it was almost entirely composed of great soaring sleek skyscrapers hundreds or thousands of metres tall generally slimly conical or ellipsoid in appearance and looking uncannily like ships or starships as they had once been called fittingly the buildings were exactly that ships fully capable of existing and making their way in space between stars should the need ever arise all the thousand or so major cities on dinyolhei were composed in the same way from hundreds of giant buildings that could happily double as spacecraft it was a truism that as a scientific society progressed its ships gradually ceased to be strictly utilitarian designs in which almost every part was in some way vital to the running of the craft normally they went through an intermediate stage where the overall conception was still limited by the necessities imposed by the environment in which the vessels travelled but within which there was considerable opportunity for the designers crew and passengersinhabitants to fashion them pretty much as they pleased before usually some centuries after the gross vulgarity of rocket power simple space travel became so mature a technology it was almost trivial at this point practically anything not messily joined to lots of other important stuff could be quite easily turned into a spacecapable craft able to transport humans or any other species spectacularly maladapted to hard vacuum and the somewhat industrial radiation environment generally associated with it to at the very least different parts of the same stellar system a standalone building was almost laughably easy to convert a bit of strengthening and rigidising some only semiscrupulous sealant work throw a gel coat over the whole thing as well just to be doubly sure strap on an engine unit or two somewhere and you were away in the culture you could even dispense with sensory and navigation systems stay within a light year or two of the nearest orbital and you could navigate with your own neural lace even an antique pen terminal it was diy space travel and people did exactly that though always to the surprise of those just on the brink of contributing to the relevant statistics the results made it one of the more dangerous hobbies pursued with any enthusiasm within the culture the means then were readily to hand the motive behind the sort of building yime now stood in was simply survival should some catastrophe befall the orbital itself its inhabitants could escape the place in what were essentially giant lifeboats the principle had swung in and out of fashion at one point very early in the cultures history many thousands of years ago such highredundancy safety consciousness had been the fairly strictly followed rule it fell from favour as habitat and especially orbital design construction and protection rose to levels that pretty much guaranteed that those who lived in them had nothing catastrophic to worry about then came very rapidly back into fashion when the idiran war had gone from being an almost unthinkable absurdity through being an unlikely joke to seemingly without warning becoming a terrifyingly tangible reality suddenly whole systems full of orbitals and their vast populations had found themselves in a firing line they had never even imagined might exist nevertheless almost all the humans most at risk and even a few deeply wise machines convinced themselves that no sentient spacefaring species would actually attack a habitat the size of an orbital certainly not with the intention of destroying it by universal agreement almost completely irrelevant militarily an o was simply a beautiful place for lots of people to live as well as being an elegantly devised and artistically detailed cultural achievement why would anybody attack one developing civilisations and barbarian underachievers aside things had been acutely civilised and agreeably quiet in the greater galaxy for centiaeons a working consensus regarding acceptable behaviour between the involved had long since been arrived at intercultural conflict resolution was a mature technology panspecies morality had quite entirely moved on from the unfortunate lapses of days gone by and outright destruction of major civilisational assets was rightly seen by all as inelegant wasteful counterproductive and apart from anything else simply shrieking of shamefully deep societal insecurity this entirely civilised and not unreasonable assumption proved illfounded when the idirans thinking to make it very clear to all concerned who were the fanatical invincible ultrawarriors in the matter and who represented the hopelessly decadent simpering irredeemably civilian bunch of martial nohopers merely playing at war attempted to traumatise the culture straight back out of their newly begun war by attacking and attempting to destroy every orbital its warfleets could reach an orbital was just a fabulously thin bracelet of matter three million kilometres in circumference orbiting a sun the apparent gravity on its interior surface provided by the same spin that gave it its daynight cycle break one anywhere around its ten million kilometres circumference and some were only a few thousand kilometres across and it tore itself apart unwinding like a released spring dumping landscape atmosphere and inhabitants unceremoniously into space all this came as something of a surprise natural disasters occurring to an orbital were almost unheard of the systems they inhabited having generally been cleared of wandering debris to form the material from which the o itself had been constructed and even the most carefree socially relaxed orbitals packed a healthy variety of defensive systems easily able to pick off any remaining rocks and ice lumps that might have the temerity to approach however against the sort of weaponry the idirans amongst many others possessed orbitals were both effectively defenceless and hopelessly vulnerable when the idiran ships fell upon the orbitals the culture was still mostly reminding itself how to build warships the few war craft and militarised contact ships it was able to put in the way of the attacks were swept aside tens upon tens of billions died and all for nothing even from the idiran point of view the culture insufficiently traumatised perhaps conspicuously failed to retreat from the war orders obeyed damage duly inflicted the idiran warfleets fell back to more martially relevant not to say honourable duties meanwhile the culture arguably to its own amazement as much as anybody elses had hunkered down gritted what needed to be gritted did the same regarding girding and to the chorus of umpteen trillion people telling each other stoically its going to be a long war got grimly on with putting itself onto a proper war footing in the immediate aftermath of the attacks many orbitals generally those closest to the action were simply evacuated some were militarised to the extent this made sense given they were so enormous and patently as had just been proved fragile in the face of modern weaponry many were just left to revolve empty effectively mothballed some were destroyed by the culture itself orbitals could be moved and some were but it was an excruciatingly longwinded business there was even for this whole shiftingoutofdanger procedure what was effectively a thing called a waiting list a term and concept many devoutly pampered culture citizens had some trouble getting entirely to grips with regardless having lots of pleasantly fittedout buildings which could double as luxury lifeboats suddenly made unimpeachable sense even orbitals almost certainly unreachably far away from the conflict took up the new construction trend and giant skyscrapers usually reassuringly sleek and shiplike in form blossomed like colossal suddenly fashionable plants across the cultures orbitals distributed cities came about when it was realised that even having the buildingsships physically close to each other on the surface of an o was unwise should an attack take place keeping them far apart from each other made the enemys targeting similarly distributed and confused fast dedicated traveltube lines in hard vacuum under the os outer surface connected the buildings of any city cluster preferentially and directly making the average journey time between buildings of any given city as quick or quicker than walking a conventional city block the absolute need to live in such cities or even such buildings had long since passed unless you were cautious to the point of neuroticism even paranoia but the fashion still ebbed and flowed a little and throughout the fifty trillion people and many millions of orbitals in the culture there would always be enough people and orbitals who still liked the idea for it never entirely to disappear some people just felt safer in a building that could casually survive even the destruction of an orbital yime was one such person it was why she lived in this building and on this orbital she combed her hair slowly thoughtfully looking out of the porthole window but not really seeing the view she thought costrile was not a particularly good supervisor for even a part of an orbitals emergency militia force ineffective altogether too lackadaisical it was disgraceful that hardly anybody on most orbitals even knew that such organisations existed even here on staid careful buttonedup backedup fasteneddown and just plain cautious dinyolhei almost nobody was interested in such things they were all too busy having fun attempts had been made before to get people more involved in lastditch orbital defence techniques but to little avail it was as though people just didnt want to think about such things when it was obviously so important odd perhaps the problem was that it had been so long since there had been a proper thoroughgoing war it had been fifteen hundred years since the idiran conflict within living human memory for only the most determinedly socalled immortalists of whom there were surpassing few and who were anyway usually too obsessed with themselves to care about warning others what real warfare was like minds and drones whod been involved were also surprisingly reluctant to share their experiences still there had to be a way the whole approach needed shaking up and she might be just the person to make it happen she doubted costrile was up to it why he hadnt even bothered to reply in kind when shed signed off with strength in depth how rude she decided she would have to see about deposing mr costrile from his post and having herself elected in his place one hundred and twentyfive one hundred and twentysix she had almost reached her set number of morning hairbrushings yime had thick lustrous brown hair which she kept in what was called an eye cut every hair on her head kept at a length such that when it was pulled round towards either eye it was just too short either to obstruct her field of vision or otherwise cause annoyance a chime from her terminal in the shape of a slim pen lying on another table interrupted her reverie of power she realised with an undignified lurch in her insides that the particular tone the terminal had used meant it was a call from quietus she might actually be going to work even so she completed the last two hairbrushing strokes before answering one had to have rules four in valley which was part of the thrice flayed footprint district of the pavulean hell level three there was an oldfashioned mill with a tall external overshot wheel powered by blood it was part of the punishment of some of the virtual souls in that place that each day they be profusely bled for as long as they could without falling unconscious there were many thousands of such unfortunates to be bled during each session and they were duly dragged screaming from their nearby pens by grotesquely formed irresistibly powerful demons and strapped to canted iron tables with drains at their foot these tables were arranged in serried ranks on the steep banks of the arid valley which had one been able to look at it from far enough above would have been revealed as a ridge forming part of a truly gigantic footprint hence the districts name the once very important person to whom the flayed hand belonged was still in some sense alive and suffered every moment from having had their skin removed they suffered in a magnified sense too concomitant with their pelt having been so grotesquely scaleexaggerated that a single ridge on one of their feet or paws there being some fairly irrelevant disagreement concerning the correct terminology was now vast enough to form part of the landscape on which so many others lived their postdeath lives and suffered the multitudinous torments which had been prescribed them the released blood from the iron tables ran glutinously down pipes and runnels to the stream bed where it collected flowed downhill as liquids are prone to do even in entirely virtual environments and ran with increasing vigour and force as the blood of more and more sufferers paid tribute to the stream down to a deep wide pool even there bound by the synthetic rules of the hell it resolutely refused to coagulate from the header pool a broad channel directed it to the summit of the mills wheel the wheel was constructed of many many ancient bones long bleached white by the action of the acid or alkali rains that fell every few days and caused such torment to the people held in the pens upstream the wheel turned on bearings made of cartilage laced with the nerves of yet more of the condemned whose bodies had been woven into the fabric of the building each creaking groaning revolution of the wheel producing seemingly unbearable agony other sufferers made up the roof slates with their oversized painfully sensitised nails they too dreaded the harrowing rains which stung with every drop or the mills thin walls with their painfully stretched skins or its supporting beams with their protesting bones or its creaking gears and cogs every tooth of which hurt as though riddled with disease every stressed and straining bone bar and shaft of which would have screamed had they possessed voices far beyond beneath boiling dark skies the stream gave out onto a great blood marsh where sufferers planted and rooted like stunted trees drowned again and again with every acidic rain and each fresh wash of blood much of the time the mill didnt even use the flow of blood collecting in its upstream pool the fluid simply went on down the overflow and back to the stream bed on its way to the dark swamp in the distance beneath the darkly livid lowering skies and besides the mill powered nothing the little energy it produced when it did deign to function went entirely to waste its whole purpose and point was to add to the excruciation of those unfortunate enough to find themselves within hell this was what people were generally told anyway some were told the mill did power something they were told it held great stone wheels which ground the bodies and bones of those guilty of crimes committed within hell those so punished suffered even greater agonies than those whose bodies still in some sense resembled those they had inhabited before death for those who had sinned even within hell the rules always entirely flexible were changed so that they could suffer with every sinew cell and structure of their body no matter how atomised it might have become and how impossible such suffering would have been with an utterly shredded nervous central system in the real the truth was different however the truth was that the mill had a quite specific purpose and the energy it produced did not go to waste it operated one of the small number of gates that led out of hell and that was why the two small pavuleans sheltering on the far side of the valley were there no we are lost entirely lost prin we are where we are my love look the way out is right there in front of us we are not lost and we shall shortly escape soon well be home you know that is not true that is a dream just a dream a treacherous dream this is what is real not anything we might think we remember from before that memory is itself part of the torment something to increase our pain we should forget what we think we remember of a life before this there was no life before this this is all there is all there ever was all there ever will be eternity this is eternity only this is eternity surrender to that thought and at least the agony of hope that can never be fulfilled will disappear they were crouching together hidden within the lower part of a cheval de frise its giant x of crossed spikes laden with impaled halfdecayed bodies those bodies and the bodies all around them littering this section of hillside indeed the seemingly living or apparently dead bodies of everybody within the hell including their own were pavulean in form metreandhalflong quadrupeds with large round heads from which issued small twin trunks highly prehensile probosces with little lobes at the tip resembling stubby fingers agony of hope listen to yourself chay hope is all we have my love hope drives us on hope is not treachery hope is not cruel and insane like this perversion of existence it is reasonable right only what we might expect what we have every right to expect we must escape we must not just for selfish reasons to escape the torments weve been subject to here but to take the news the truth of what weve experienced here back to the real back to where somehow some day something might be done about it the two pavuleans presently hiding under the covering of rotting corpses were called in the familiar form they used with each other prin and chay and they had journeyed together across several regions of this hell over a subjective period of several months always heading for this place now finally they were within sight of it neither resembled pavuleans in the peak of health only prins left trunk was intact the other was just a stillragged stump after a casual swipe from the sword of a passing demon some weeks ago the poisoned sword had left a wound that would not heal or stop hurting his intact left trunk had been nicked in the same strike and made him wince with every movement around both their necks was a twist of tightened barbed wire like a depraved version of a necklace the barbs biting through their skin raising welts that seeped blood and left itching flaking scabs chay limped because both her hind legs had been broken just days after theyd entered the hell she had been run over by one of an endless line of boneandiron juggernauts transporting mangled bodies from one part of the hell to another the juggernauts moved along a road whose every cobble was the warted calloused back of screaming unfortunates buried beneath prin had carried her on his back for weeks afterwards while she healed though the bones in her legs had never set properly in hell bones never did you are wrong prin there is no real there is no outside reality there is only this you may need this delusion to make the pain of being here less for you but in the end you will be better off accepting the true reality that this all there is all there ever has been and all there ever will be no chay he told her at this moment we are code we are ghosts in the substrate we are both real and unreal never forget that we exist here for now but we had and have another life other bodies to return to back in the real real prin we are real fools fools to have come if what you say is true and we came from somewhere else fools to think we could do anything of use here and most certainly fools to think we can ever leave this ghastly filthy sickening place this is our life now even if there was another one before it accept it and it may not be so terrible this is the real this that you see and feel and smell around you chay reached out with her right trunk and its tip almost touched the partially rotted face of a young female impaled face down on the spikes above her emptied eye sockets staring blankly in at the two people cowering beneath though terrible it is so so terrible such a terrible place she looked at her mate why make it worse with the lie of hope prin reached out with his surviving trunk and wrapped it around both of hers as best he could chayeleze hifornsdaughter it is your despair that is the lie the bloodgate across this valley opens within the hour to let out those whove been allowed a halfday glimpse of hell in the hope of making them behave better back in the real and we have the means to leave with them we shall we will go back we will leave this place we will return to our home and we will tell of what weve seen here well let the truth of it out for ever free into the real to do whatever damage to thisoutrage upon kindness and sentience it is possible to do this vast obscenity around us was made my love it can be unmade we can help we can begin that unmaking we can we will do this but i will not do it alone i cant and wont leave without you we go together or not at all just one last effort please my love stay at my side come with me escape with me help me save you and help me save myself he hugged her to his chest as hard as he was able here come osteophagers she said looking out over his shoulder he let her go and looked round peeking under hanging rotting limbs to the uphill entrance to their impromptu shelter she was right a detail of half a dozen osteophagers were moving down and across the barren hillside dragging bodies off the chevaux de frise and the other spiked and barbed barriers that littered the slope the osteophagers were specialist demons flesh and boneeating scavengers who lived off the carcasses of those rekilled either in hells neverending war or just in the normal course of its perpetual round of mutilation and pain the souls of those they ate would already have been recycled into fresh mostly whole if never entirely healthy bodies better able to appreciate the torments in store for them like almost all the demons in the pavulean hell the osteophagers resembled predator beasts from the pavulean evolutionary past the osteophagers moving down the hillside towards where the two small pavuleans were hiding looked like glossily powerful versions of animals that had once preyed upon chay and prins ancestors millions of years earlier fourlegged twice the size of a pavulean with big forwardfacing eyes and again like most demons perversely sporting two more muscular versions of pavulean trunks from the sides of their massive crushing jaws their shining pelts of bright red and yellow stripes looked lacquered polished the colours were as much a hellish amendment as the trunks that the original animals had never possessed it gave them the bizarre look of having been coloured in by children they moved hulkingly from barbed barrier to barbed barrier along the hillside lifting the hooked bodies off with their trunks or tearing them free with viciouslooking teeth nearly half a trunk long they sucked down what were obviously the more prized parts crunching on some smaller bones on occasion but most of the bodies they collected were thrown onto illmade bone carts pulled by blinded detrunked pavuleans following them along the valley side they will find us chay said dully they will find us and kill us all over again or part eat us and leave us here to suffer or impale us upon these hideous works and come back for us later or break our legs and throw us up onto one of their carts and take us to more senior demons for more refined and terrible punishment prin stared out at the advancing ragged line of demons mutilated pavuleans and giant carts for a few moments he was unable to think properly unable to take stock of their suddenly changed situation and allowed chay to mutter on letting her words leech away the hope he had been trying to fill her with letting her fill him instead with the despair he was constantly trying to hold at bay and which he could never admit to her was for ever threatening to overwhelm him the detail of osteophagers and their grisly retinue had come close enough now to hear the crunch of bones in massive jaws and the whimper of the bridled pavuleans he turned and looked in the opposite direction towards the mill with its dark pool and the thick unsplashing stream of blood that was now powering the giant creaking wheel the mill was working it had started up the gate it controlled must be about to open and the way out of hell would present itself to them at last chay look prin told her using his trunk to turn her away from the view of the advancing line of osteophagers and towards the mill i see it i see it another flying death machine he wondered what she was talking about then saw the moving shape dark grey upon the still darker grey of the low restlessly moving clouds i meant the mill its working but the flier too it must be bringing the ones whore meant to get out were saved dont you see dont you get it he turned her towards him again tenderly using his trunk to bring her round to him this is our chance chay we can we will get out of here he gently touched the barbed wire necklaces they each wore first hers then his own we have the means chay our lucky charms our little kernels of saving code we brought these with us remember they did not put these on us this is our chance we must be ready no youre still a fool we have nothing they will find us give us to the superiors in the machine the flier was in the shape of a giant beetle it buzzed furiously towards the mill on a blur of iridescent wings its legs extending as it approached a shavedlevel patch of ground by the buildings side ha chay youre wrong my love we are destined to get out of here youre coming with me keep a hold of your horrible necklace this barb this one right here here can you feel it he directed two of her stillperfect stillunscarred undamaged trunk fingers to the control barb i feel it when i say so you pull hard on that do you understand of course i understand do you think me a fool only when i say pull hard we shall look like demons to those who are demons themselves and have their power the effect will not last long but long enough to get us through the gate the great beetleshaped flier was settling on the patch of ground by the mill a pair of demons yellow and black striped emerged from the mill to watch it land the beetles fuselage body was about half the size of the mill lower longer darkly sleek its wings settled folded into its carapace the rear of its abdomen hinged down and a small group of sturdy grinning demons and quivering obviously terrified pavuleans in roughlooking clothes came out the pavuleans clothes alone marked them out as different here in hell all suffered naked and any who tried to cover their nudity only ensured themselves further torments as punishment for having had the effrontery to imagine they could exercise any control whatsoever over their suffering the eight pavuleans exiting the giant beetle were also distinguished from the damned around them by being whole carrying no scars or obvious injuries seeping wounds or signs of disease they looked well fed too though even from this distance prin could see a sort of hungry desperation in their movements and their facial expressions a petrifying sense of probably being about to escape this landscape of pain and terror but with the realisation dawning on at least some of them that perhaps they had been lied to perhaps this was not the end of a brief warning tour of hell designed to keep them on the straight and narrow back in the real but rather a taste of what was about to become their settled and already inescapable fate a cruel trick that would be just the first of innumerable cruel tricks perhaps they were not getting out at all perhaps they were here to stay and to suffer from what prin knew for at least one of their number this would be brutally true such groups were inevitably traumatised in the course of what they were forced to witness during these tours and utterly unable to establish any rapport with the rapaciously forbidding and utterly disdainful demons who escorted them quickly drew together bonding like a tiny herd finding a rough but real companionship amongst their equally horrorstruck companions no matter how various their personalities situations and histories might have been back in the real to then have one of your number cut out of your little group somebody you knew and felt some camaraderie towards made the experience all the more vivid it was just about possible to experience one of these horrific excursions and convince yourself that the unfortunates you saw suffering were quite different from you just because of the extremity of their degradation they appeared subpavulean little more perhaps no more than animals but to watch one of your group having all of his or her worst fears confirmed consigned to everlasting torment just at the point when they thought they were about to be allowed to resume their life in the real made the lesson the tour was meant to teach stick much more thoroughly in the mind theyre about to go in be ready prin glanced back to see the nearest osteophager alarmingly close to their hideout we have to go now my love hed hoped to be closer when they made their approach but there was no choice pull on the barb now chay so still you seek to deceive me but ive seen through your shallow hope chay we have no time for this i cant do it for you it only works at our own touch pull the fucking barb i will not i press it instead see she winced as she pressed the barb further into her own neck the other end impaling the tip of her trunk finger prin sucked in his breath so hard and fast he saw the nearby osteophager turn its massive head in the direction of their shelter ears twitching gaze flicking this way and that then settling on them shit right prin pulled on his own necklaces barb the contraband code it symbolised started running instantly he had the body of one of the grinning demons and the biggest and most impressive type at that a giant sixlimbed predator long extinct in the real trunkless but with trefoilfingered forelimbs that doubled as trunks the rationalising rules of the hell immediately caused the bodyladen cheval de frise to rear up to accommodate his suddenly increased bulk so that he wore it on his broad green and yellow back like some monstrous piece of armour chay cowered at his feet suddenly small she voided her bladder and bowels and curled into a rigid ball with one forelimb he picked her up by both of her trunks the way he had seen demons do to his kind countless times before and with a roar shrugged the cheval de frise off his back letting it thunk down to one side bodies and parts of bodies flopping and falling from its spikes there was a shrill scream one of the carts carrying the corpses had been almost alongside hidden by the weight of bodies on that side of the device and when it had fallen one of its spikes had pierced the foot of the pavulean hauling the cart pinning the creature to the ground the osteophager who had been looking suspiciously in their direction took a step back its ears suddenly bolt upright an emotion between surprise and fear evident in its stance prin snarled at it the creature took another halfstep back its fellows across the hillside had stopped and now stood motionless looking on they would wait and see which way this was going to go before deciding either to join in with leavesomeforme bravado or pretend it had been nothing to do with them in the first place prin shook the stillcatatonicallyinert chay towards the osteophager shes mine i saw first the osteophager blinked looked round with apparent unconcern checking to see what the rest of its detail was doing not coming bounding to its side to face down this sudden interloper steadfastly and together clearly the creature looked down brushed at the ground in front of it with the back of one paw claws mostly retracted take it it said in a grumbling seemingly unconcerned voice consider it yours with our blessing we have plenty it shrugged lowered its head to sniff at the patch of ground it had scuffed apparently having lost interest in the whole exchange prin snarled again clutched chay to his chest turned and bounded down the hillside past decaying corpses and spikes pennanted with ragged strips of flesh he splashed through the dark stream of blood and went springing diagonally up the slope towards the mill the group from the giant beetle had disappeared inside the building the beetle itself had closed its abdomen and was unpacking its wings from beneath its gleaming wing covers prin was close enough to see demons moving inside its enormous faceted eyes pilots he thought for an assemblage of code that might as well have been kept aloft through the wielding of an enchanted feather or a magic anvil for that matter he leapt on up the hillside towards the mill five from somewhere came the idea that there were many different levels of sleeping of unconsciousness and therefore of awakening in the midst of this pleasant woozy calm warm pleasantly swaddled selfhuggingly curled up a sort of ruddy darkness behind the eyelids it was an easy and comforting thing to contemplate the many ways one might be away and then come back you fell asleep just for an instant sometimes that sudden nod and jerk awake again lasting a moment or you had short naps often selftimed limited by knowing you had a few minutes or a halfhour or whatever of course you had your classic good nights sleep however much things like shift systems and allnight facilities and drugs and city lighting might sometimes interfere then there was the deeper unconsciousness of being knocked out put carefully under for some medical procedure or randomly banging your head and briefly not even knowing your own name also people still lapsed into comas and came out of those very gradually that must be an odd feeling and for a while there for the last few centuries though not so often these days because things had moved on there was the subsleep of deep space travel when you were put into a sort of deep longterm hibernation for years or decades at a time kept frigidly cold and barely alive to be revived when your destination approached some people had been kept like this back at home too awaiting medical advances waking up from something like that must be quite a strange thing she thought she felt an urge to turn over as though she was nestled in a fabulously comfortable bed but now had spent enough time on this side and needed to shift to lie the other way she felt very light she realised though even as she thought this she seemed to feel very slightly reassuringly heavier she felt herself take a deep satisfying breath and duly turned over eyes still tightly closed she had a vague feeling that she didnt entirely know where she was but it didnt bother her usually that was a slightly disturbing sensation occasionally even a very disturbing frightening experience but not this time somehow she knew that wherever she was she was safe cared for and in no danger she felt good really good in fact when she thought about it she realised that she couldnt remember ever having felt so good so secure so happy she felt a tiny frown form on her face oh come on she told herself she must have felt like this before to her slight but undeniable irritation she had only a vague memory of when she had last felt anything like this untroubled and happy probably in her mothers arms as a little girl she knew that if she woke up fully she would remember properly but much as a part of her wanted to be completely awake to answer this question and sort all this out another part of her was too happy just lying here wherever she was drowsy secure and happy she knew this feeling this was often the best bit of any day before she had to wake and fully face the realities of the world and the responsibilities she had fallen heir to if you were lucky you really did sleep like a baby completely soundly and without care then it would be only as you awoke that you were reminded of all the things you had to worry about all the resentments you harboured all the injustices and cruelties you were subject to still even the thought of that grim process somehow couldnt destroy her mood of ease and happiness she sighed a long deep satisfying sigh though still with an element of regret as she felt her sleepiness drift away like mist under a gentle breeze the sheets covering her felt outrageously fine almost liquidly soft they moved about her naked body as she completed the sigh and stirred a little under the warm material she was not sure that even himself possessed such fine she felt herself spasm and jerk a terrifying image the face of someone hateful started to form before her then as though some other part of her mind came to soothe her fears the fear subsided and the anxiety seemed to be brushed away like dust whatever she had once feared she didnt need to fear it now well that was nice she supposed she supposed too that she really ought to wake up she opened her eyes she had the vague impression of a wide bed pale sheets and a large highceilinged room with tall open windows from which gauzy softly billowing white curtains waved out a warm flowerscented breeze stirred around her sunlight leant in golden shafts against the window apertures she noticed that there was some sort of fuzzy glow at the foot of the bed it swam into focus and spelled out the word simulation simulation she thought sitting up and rubbing her eyes the room swam properly into focus when she reopened them the place looked perfectly entirely real but she was no longer really paying attention to the room her jaw had dropped and her mouth hung open as she took in what she had glimpsed as shed casually raised her arms and hands to her eyes a moment earlier she dropped her head very slowly and brought her hands up in front of her face again staring at the backs then at the palms of her hands then at her forearms then down at what she could see of her chest and breasts she leapt back upwards to the headboard of the bed throwing the sheet off her as she did so and stared down at her naked body she brought her hands up yet again stared hard at them inspecting her fingers her fingernails peering at them as though trying to see something which was almost but not quite too small to see finally she looked up her gaze darting round the room she threw herself out of the bed the word simulation stayed where it was just visible at the bottom of her field of vision and ran to a fulllength mirror between two of the tall windows with their softly billowing curtains nothing on her face either she stared at herself first of all she was entirely the wrong colour she ought to be almost soot black instead she was she wasnt even sure what you called this colour dirty gold mud polluted sunset that was bad enough but there was worse where the fuck is my intaglia she heard herself say simulation said the word now hovering around her feet as she took in the view of a beautiful but entirely unbodymarked paleskinned young woman standing naked in front of her it looked something like her she supposed in bone structure and general bodily proportions but that was being generous her featureless skin was a sort of wan reddishgold and her hair was entirely wrong far too long and much too dark simulation the word still said she slammed one fist into the side frame of the mirror felt pretty much exactly the amount of pain shed have anticipated and sucked warm fragrant air through her teeth her teeth were also unmarked too uniformly white as were the whites of her eyes when shed hit it the mirror frame had wobbled and the whole mirror and its base had shifted a few millimetres along the polished wooden floor slightly altering the angle it presented to her ow ow ow she muttered shaking her tingling hand as she stepped to the nearest window and ducking a little armed away the delicate translucence of a curtain she looked out from a bowed balustraded stone balcony a floor above ground gazing across a sunny landscape of elegantly sculpted green and blue trees pale yellowgreen grass and some mist foregrounding a soft tumult of wooded hills the furthest ridges distanceblued against high faraway mountains summits glitteringly white a river sparkled in the yellowwhite sunlight off to one side beyond a meadow where a herd of small darkcoated animals were grazing she stared hard at the view she stepped back snatched at the floating expanse of the wispy curtain bringing a section of it up to her nose frowning at it as she inspected the precision of its near microscopic weave a set of shutters and glass windows lay open behind she caught another glimpse of herself in the windows she shook her head how strange the hair on her head made the movement feel then went down on one knee by the stone balcony rail rubbing two fingers along its ruddy broad top feeling the slight graininess of sandstone under her fingertips a little of which remained when she lifted her fingers away and rubbed them against each other she put her nose to it she could smell the stone still simulation the word said she let out another sigh of exasperation this time and inspected the sky with its many little puffy white clouds she had experienced simulations before she had been in virtual environments but even the ones that relied on you being dosed with just the right drugs so that you did a lot of the detailfilling yourself were nothing like as perfectly convincing as this the simulations she had experienced were closer to dreams than reality convincing at the time but pretty much the moment you started looking for the pixels or the grain or the fractals or whatever they were or just the processing short cuts and inconsistencies you found them what she was looking at here and feeling and smelling was effectively uncannily flawless she almost felt faint for an instant head briefly swimming before quickly clearing again before she even started to sway or stagger nevertheless the sky was too blue the sunlight too golden the hills and especially the mountains didnt quite fade and drop away like they did on a real planet and while she still felt entirely like herself within herself as it were she was inside a body which was perfectly flawlessly unmarked causing her to feel more naked than she had ever felt in her life no intaglia no tattoo no markage whatsoever that was the biggest clue of all that this could not be real well the second biggest there was that word floating in red always at the lower limit of her vision simulation that was about as unambiguous as you got she supposed from the balcony she took a look around what she could see of the building just a big rather ornate red sandstone house with lots of tall windows some stickyout bits a few turrets a pathway of small stones around the base listening carefully she could hear what might be the breeze in the nearest treetops some high slightly plaintive calls that probably represented birdsong and a faint lowing from the herd of fourlegged grazing animals in the meadow she walked back into the bedroom and stood in its relative silence she cleared her throat all right its a simulation anybody here i can talk to no answer she drew in the breath to say something else but then there came a polite knocking from one of the rooms two broad wooden doors whos there she called my name is sensia a pleasantsounding female voice said shed have guessed it belonged to a relatively elderly woman and one who was smiling as she spoke shed had a favourite aunt whod sounded like this person though perhaps not quite as wellspoken one moment she looked down at herself she imagined wearing a plain white dressing gown nope her body remained stubbornly naked what looked like a tall wooden wardrobe stood near the door she swung open the doors wondering why she was doing so even as she did it she was in a simulation this didnt even look like her own body anyway and she had never been especially selfconscious about her physical form how could she be as an intagliate the notion would have been hilarious if not so intimately connected with bitterness still she did feel exceptionally naked with no markings and the general feel and polite highly monied ambience of this sim would appear to demand a certain decorum there were lots of rather gorgeous clothes inside the wardrobe she threw on a plain dark blue robe of what felt like the same material the liquidsoft sheet had been made of she stood before the broad door cleared her throat again drew herself up and pulled on the fistsized handle hello said the rather plain but very amiablelooking lady of late middle age standing outside behind her was a broad hallway with more doors leading off on one side and balustrades giving out onto a doublelevel hall on the other may i come in she had bunned white hair sparkling green eyes and was dressed in a plain dark suit unadorned please do she said sensia looked around softly clapping her fraillooking hands once shall we sit outside ive sent for some drinks they dragged a couple of heavy brocaded seats out through the middle window onto the most generous of the rooms balconies and sat down her eyes stay too wide she found herself thinking shes facing into the sunlight a real person would be squinting by now wouldnt they on a ledge above two small blue birds appeared to be fighting rising at each other on a furious flutter of wings and almost touching breasts in midair before falling back again all of this accompanied by a great deal of highpitched twittering sensia smiled warmly clasping her hands so she said we are in a simulation i gathered she said the word itself seemingly printed across the legs of the woman opposite well remove that sensia said the word disappeared from her field of vision that felt briefly scary though presumably she was always going to be under somebodys control in a sim sensia sat forward now this might sound a little odd but would you mind terribly telling me your name she stared at the other woman just for the merest instant she had to think what was her name lededje ybreq she said almost blurted of course thank you i see sensia looked up towards the mad tweeting coming from the little birds above the noise stopped suddenly a moment later both birds flew down settled briefly on one of sensias fingers and then darted off in different directions and you are from where exactly another nearly imperceptible delay well i im of the veppers retinue she said veppers she thought how odd to think of him without fear it was as though all that was in another life and one that she would not have to go back to even as she thought about it turning it over in her mind the idea still held no terror she started trying to remember where she had been last before she ended up here it felt like something shed been hiding from herself like something that some other part of her had been keeping from her i was born in ubruater city and brought up in the mansion house of the estate of espersium she told sensia lately i still generally live either in ubruater espersium or sometimes just wherever mr veppers might be sensia was nodding gaze distant ahhah she said sitting back smiling ubruater city sichult quyn system ruprine cluster arm oneone neartip lededje recognised quyn as the name the sun went by in the rest of the galaxy and she had heard the term ruprine cluster before she had no idea what arm oneone neartip was this bit of the galaxy she supposed where am i she asked as a small thickbottomed tray arrived floating out from the room it held glasses and a pitcher of pale green liquid with ice in it the device lowered between them so that it effectively became a table sensia poured their drinks presently literally she said settling back again swirling her drink youre in a computational substrate node of the general systems vehicle sense amid madness wit amidst folly which is currently travelling through the liavitzian blister in the region called gods ear rotational rather than fully catching all this lededje had been thinking vehicle she said is that a wheel or she took a drink the pale green liquid was delicious though probably nonalcoholic sensia smiled uncertainly a wheel you know a wheel lededje said and became aware they were now staring at the other with mutual incomprehension how could this woman not know what a wheel was then sensias face brightened ah a wheel a specific thing with a capital letter and so on i see yes sorry got you now she looked away seemingly distracted oh yes fascinating things she shook her head but no not a wheel bit bigger than that plateclass general systems vehicle getting on for a hundred kilometres long if you go tiptotip of the outer field structure and four klicks high measuring just the naked hull roughly six trillion tonnes though the mass assay gets fiendishly complicated with so much exotic matter making up the engines about a fifth of a billion people aboard right now she flashed a smile not counting those in virtual environments whats it called again the sense amid madness wit amidst folly sensia shrugged where i take my name from sensia im a ships avatoid that sounds like a culture ship lededje said feeling her skin warm suddenly sensia stared at her looking genuinely surprised good gracious she said you mean you didnt even know you were on a culture ship even within the culture at all im surprised youre not more disoriented where did you think you might be lededje shrugged she was still trying to recall where shed been last before she woke up here no idea she said ive never been in a sim this good im not sure we have them to this standard i dont think even veppers has them this detailed sensia nodded where am i really lededje asked how do you mean wheres my real self my physical body sensia stared at her again she put the drink down on the floating tray her expression unreadable ah she said she made an o with her mouth and sucked air in turning her head to look out at the parkland surrounding the house she turned back to look at lededje what is the last thing you remember before you woke up here lededje shook her head i cant remember ive been trying well dont try too hard from what i can gather its traumatic lededje wanted to say something to that but couldnt think what traumatic she thought with a sudden shiver of fear what the hell did that mean sensia took a deep breath let me start by explaining that i have never had to ask for somebodys name in these circumstances i mean someone you suddenly popping into existence un announced she shook her head doesnt happen mindstates souls dynamic fullbrain process inventories whatever you call them they always come with copious notes you didnt sensia smiled again lededje formed the uncomfortable impression that the other woman was trying hard to be reassuring this had never proved to be a good sign in lededjes past and she seriously doubted the pattern was about to change now you just immaterialised here my dear sensia told her in a onetime oneway emergencyentanglement vicariously inherited legacy system event of what us minds would generally call laughably high unexpectancy and most bizarrely of all you came with what one might call no paperwork zero documentation absolutely without accompanying context material docketless is that unusual sensia laughed she had a surprisingly deep almost raucous laugh lededje found herself smiling despite the apparent gravity of the subject not so much unusual sensia said more entirely without precedent in roughly the last fifteen hundred busy years frankly im finding that hard to believe myself and trust me i have lots and lots of other avatars avatoids agents feelers and just plain old requests out at the moment asking if anybody else has heard of such a thing all without positive reply so far so you had to ask me my name quite as a ship mind as any kind of mind or even ai im sort of constitutionally forbidden from looking too deeply into you but even so i had to do a bit of delving just to get a matchable body profile for you to wake up in without causing you further trauma here in the virtual didnt entirely work lededje thought im a negative of my real selfs colour and wheres my damn tat sensia continued plus theres the language protocols obviously theyre actually quite involved but highly localised across panhumanity so easy enough to pinpoint could have gone deeper and got your name and other details but that would have been invasively rude however following some ancient guidelines so obscure that i had to actively dig them out and consult them designed to cover situations like this i did what is called an immediate posttraumatic emergency entanglement transfer psychological profile evaluation another smile so that whatever suddenly caused you to need an entanglement event in the first place back wherever you came from didnt compromise your safe transfer into virtuality sensia raised her glass again she looked at it then put it back down again and what i discovered was that youve had a traumatic experience she said quite quickly her gaze not meeting lededjes which ive sort of held back edited from your transferred memories just for now while you settle in get yourself sorted out until youre ready you know lededje stared at her really you can do such a thing oh trivially easy technically sensia said sounding relieved the constraints are entirely moral rulebased and it is obviously up to you when you come fully up to speed with yourself if you know what i mean though frankly if i were you i wouldnt be in too great a hurry lededje tried very hard to recall what had happened before she came here she remembered being at espersium walking down a treelined avenue in the estate alone thinking that it was time to escape hmm she thought that was interesting was that what had happened had she finally found a practical veppersproof method of getting away from the bastard and all his money power and influence using this entanglement thing but that still left the question where was her real self not to mention why could she remember so little and what exactly was this trauma sensia kept talking about she drained her glass sat up straight tell me everything she demanded sensia looked at her she looked worried concerned compassionate lededje she began slowly carefully would you say that youre a psychologically strong person oh fuck thought lededje when she had been very young there had been a time she could still remember when she had felt nothing but loved privileged and special it was something more than the usual feeling of blessed distinction that all good parents naturally communicate to their children there was that that feeling of being at the focus of unquestioning regard and care but for a while she had been just about sufficiently mature to realise that she was lucky enough to have even more than that first of all she lived in a great and beautiful house within a vast rural estate of extraordinary even unique grandeur and secondly she looked utterly different from the other children just as her mother looked quite different from the other adults in the great household she had been born an intagliate she was certainly a human and a sichultian you learned early on there were other types of human but it was taken for granted that sichultians were the best sort but more than just a sichultian an intagliate somebody whose skin whose entire body whose every internal organ and part of their external physical appearance was different markedly different from that of everybody else intagliates looked like ordinary people only in silhouette or in lighting conditions so poor you could hardly see them at all turn on a lamp come out into the daylight and they were revealed as the fabulous creatures they were an intagliate was covered head to foot in what was called a congenitally administered tattoo lededje had been born tattooed emerging from the womb with the most fabulously intricate patterns indelibly encoded at a cellular level onto her skin and throughout her body usually a true indented intagliate as fully recognised by the sichultian judicial and administrative system was born with mistwhite skin the better to display the classically inkdark designs imprinted on them their teeth bore similar designs the whites of their eyes were similarly ornamented their translucent fingernails held one design while another was just visible on the nailpad beneath the pores on their skin were arranged in a precisely formulated nonrandom way and even the minute tracery of their capillary system was patterned just so according to design not developmental chance cut them open and you would find similar designs on the surfaces of their internal organs their designated motif carried into their heart and guts bleach their bones the design would be stamped on the pale surface of their very skeleton suck out their marrow and break those bones open the ornamentation continued at every possible level of their being they bore the mark that distinguished them from the blank sheets that were other people as well as from those who had merely chosen to have themselves in some way marked some especially over the last century or so were born almost night black rather than nearly snow white their skins especially laced with even more exotic and colourful designs that could usefully include iridescence fluorescence and the effect of mercurial silver all of which were held to show up better on black skin lededje had been one of these even more flamboyantly marked creatures the elite of the elite as shed thought and felt at the time her mother who carried her own marks on her much paler skin though hers were simple conventional ink cared for lededje and made her feel exceptionally fortunate to be what and who she was the girl was proud that she was even more fabulously tattooed than her mother and fascinated both by her mothers wildly swirling patterns and her own even then when she was just little less than half her mothers height she could see that for all the greater area of her mothers body surface and the fabulous artistry of the designs on her skin her own flesh was the more intricately patterned the more precisely and minutely marked she noticed this but didnt like to say anything feeling slightly sorry for her mother maybe one day shed thought her mother too could have skin as beautifully intagliated as her own lededje decided she would grow up rich and famous and would give her mother the money to make this happen this made her feel very grownup when she began to mix with them the other toddlers and younger children from the estate seemed in awe of her for one thing they were each a mixture of colours and many of them were rather pale and wanlooking she was pure more importantly though the other children had no markings they boasted no astounding design upon their skins or anywhere else obvious or hidden slowly growing gradually maturing subtly changing and for ever becoming more complicated they deferred to her prioritised her own needs and wants over their own seemed practically to worship her she was their princess their queen almost their sacred goddess it had changed gradually she suspected her mother had used all the influence she possessed to protect her only child from the demeaning truth for as long as shed been able probably to the detriment of her own position and standing within the household for the truth was that the intagliate were more than just human exotica they were both more and less than extravagant ornamentations in the household and retinue of the rich and powerful to be displayed like walking living jewellery at important social events and within the halls of financial social and political power though they were most certainly that they were trophies they were the surrendered banners of defeated enemies the capitulation papers signed by the vanquished the heads of fierce beasts adorning the walls of those who owned them intagliates recorded with their very being the fall of their families the shame of their parents and grandparents to be so marked was to bear witness to an inherited debt which your very existence was part of the payingoff it was a feature of sichultian law carried over from the practices of the particular nationcaste that had emerged victorious in the fight to stamp their way of doing things on the coalescing world state two centuries earlier that if a commercial debt could not be fully settled or if the terms in some deal were deemed not entirely sufficient due to shortage of funds or other nego tiables by one of the parties then the defaulting or inadequately provisioned side could compensate by undertaking to have a generation or two of their progeny made intagliate signing over at least some of their children and grandchildren usually though not always for life to the care and control indeed the ownership of those to whom they were either indebted or at a fiscal disadvantage sichultians on encountering the rest of the galactic community following their contact by a species called the flekke were generally quite indignantly insistent that their rich and powerful loved their children just as much as the rich and powerful of any other decently civilised species and that they simply had an elevated respect for the letter of the law and the honour involved in paying ones debts on time rather than a reduced regard for the rights of minors or those who were otherwise innocent but indebtedbyinheritance in general the rights and wellbeing of the intagliate they would point out were protected by an entire network of strictly applied laws to ensure that they could not be neglected or mistreated by those who effectively owned them and indeed those who were marked could even be regarded as being amongst the most privileged people in society in a sense being raised in the absolute lap of luxury mixing with the very cream of society attending all the most important social events and formal court occasions and never being expected to have to work for their keep most people would happily surrender their socalled freedom to live like that they were esteemed precious and almost though not quite beyond price what more could somebody who would otherwise have been born into grinding poverty ask for like many societies finding their hitherto unquestioned customs and ethical assumptions impacting squarely with the breath takingly sophisticated summed morality of a metacivilisation inestimably older vaster and by implication wiser than themselves the sichultia became highly protective of their developmental foibles and refused to mandate away what some of them at least claimed to regard as one of their defining social characteristics and a vital and vibrant part of their culture not all sichultians agreed with this of course there had always been opposition to the very idea of indented intagliation as well as to the very notion of a politicaleconomic system configured to allow such options a few deranged ruffians and degenerate troublemakers even took issue with the primacy of private ownership and the unfettered accumulation of capital itself but most sichultians accepted the practice and some were genuinely proud of it as far as other species and civilisations were concerned it was just another one of those little quirks you always encountered when you discovered a new member of the community a rough edge that would probably get rubbed off like the rest as the sichultia gradually found and settled into their place at the great galactic banquet table of panspecies revelry lededje could still remember the dawning of the realisation that her markings were not glorious after all but somehow shameful she was imprinted as she was not to distinguish her as someone more important and privileged than others but to mark her as a chattel to make it clear to others that she was less than them an owned bonded thing a trophy an admission of familial defeat and shame it had been it still was the most important defining and humiliating stage of her life she had immediately tried to run away fleeing the nursery where one of the other children a little older than she had finally and categorically informed her about all this but got no further than the base of one of the dozens of small satellite domes that surrounded the mansion barely a kilometre from where shed started she howled and screamed at her mother for not telling her the truth about her tattoo she threw herself into her bed and didnt emerge for days hunkered under the bedclothes shed heard her mother weeping in the next room and been briefly glad of it later she hated herself for hating her mother and they wept together hugging but nothing would ever be the same again either between them or between lededje and the other children whose deposed queen she now felt she was it would be years before shed be able to acknowledge all that her mother had done to protect her how even that first deceit that absurd concocted dream of privilege had been a way of trying to strengthen her for the vicissitudes she would inevitably encounter in her later life according to her mother the reason that she had been forcibly tattooed and lededje had been born intagliate as would be the one or two children she was contractually and honourbound to produce was that her late husband grautze lededjes father had been too trusting grautze and veppers had been best friends since their school days and had been in business together since the beginning of their commercial careers both of them came from very powerful rich and renowned families and both became even more powerful rich and famous as individuals making deals and making money they had made some enemies too certainly but that was only to be expected in business they were rivals but it was a friendly rivalry and they had many joint ventures and equal partnerships then there came the prospect of a single great deal more lucrative and important than any they had ever taken part in before a momentous reputationsecuring historymaking worldchanging deal they took a solemn pledge that they would work together on this equal partners they even became blood brothers to seal the agreement and signify the importance of the deal to both of them they used a paired set of antique knives that lededjes greatgrandfather had presented to veppers grandfather decades earlier to cut the palms of the hands they then clasped nothing had been signed between them but then the two had always behaved like honourable men to each other and taken the others word as being good enough the details of the betrayal and the slow devastating unwinding of that pledge were such that whole teams of lawyers had struggled to come to terms with them but the gist was that lededjes father had lost everything and veppers had gained it all and more her fathers family lost almost everything too the financial damage rippling out to brothers sisters parents aunts uncles and cousins veppers had made a great show of pretending to be supportive in the complexity of the unravelling deal much of the most immediate damage had been at the hands of other business rivals and veppers was assiduous in buying up the debts they accumulated from lededjes father but always his support stopped short of preventing the damage in the first place the final betrayal was the requirement when all other ways of paying had been exhausted that grautze consent to his wife being marked and his next child and any children that that child had being an indented intagliate veppers gave every sign of being devastated it had come to this but said he could see no other way out there was no other honourable course and if they had not honour what did they have he received considerable sympathy for having to watch his best friend and his family suffer so but was adamant that despite the personal anguish it caused him it was the right thing to do the rich could not be and did not want to be above the law the first part of the sentence approved by sichults highest court was duly carried out lededjes mother was taken put into something resembling a coma and tattooed the night of the day they had taken her away her husband slit his own throat with one of the two knives the original disastrous agreement had been solemnised by they found grautzes body quite quickly the medics were able to take a viable sample of his seed from him brought together with an egg taken from his widow while she was still under from the tattooing procedure the resulting embryo was altered changed to become that of an intagliate and then implanted back into his widow many of the team who had overseen the designing and patterning of the embryo felt it was their finest work the result was lededje the basis for the fabulous scroll work wrapping every square centimetre of her skin was that of the letter v for veppers and the veprine corporation he commanded other elements included twin crossed knives and images of the object the fateful deal had been about in the first place sichults soletta the giant spacemounted fabrication which shielded the world from some of the light of the sun lededje tried running away a lot as she grew up she never got very far around about the time she started to think of herself as a young woman rather than a girl when her intaglia was revealing itself in its true mature astoundingly intricate and colourful glory she began to realise just how fabulously rich her master mr veppers was and how far his power and influence reached she gave up trying to run away it wasnt until some years later when veppers started raping her that she discovered that the richer the alleged perpetrator was the more all those strictly enforced statutes regarding the rights of the intagliate became well more like aspirations general guidelines rather than properly enforced laws that was when she started trying to run away again the first time shed got to the edge of the estate ninety kilometres from the house after travelling down one of the great forested trackways that led to the estate perimeter the day before lededje was caught and brought back her mother despairing had thrown herself from one of the towers in the part of the estate near the house lededje and her friends called the water maze lededje had never confided to her mother that veppers was raping her hed told her after the first time that if she did hed make sure she never saw her mother again simple as that she thought that her mother had suspected though that might have been the real reason she took her own life lededje felt she understood why death had seemed like an easier course for her mother she even thought about doing the same thing herself but couldnt bring herself to go through with it part of her wanted to deprive veppers of the most monetarily precious person in his household but a more important part of her refused to let herself be ground down to the point of suicide by him losing her mother hadnt been enough apparently shed been physically punished for her attempt to escape too a relatively unadorned patch of her flesh at the base of her back had been retromarked with a beautifully drawn exquisitely detailed though to her still inestimably crude etching of a blackskinned girl flitting through a forest even the applying of it had hurt and now as sensia slowly let the memories filter back she knew that the second time shed escaped had been in the city in the capital in ubruater shed got away for longer that time five days rather than four though shed only travelled a couple of kilometres across ubruater the adventure ending in the opera house that veppers himself had funded she winced as she remembered the knife entering her chest sliding between her ribs plunging into her heart the taste of his blood the grisly feel of the tip of his nose as shed chewed once and swallowed it the shrieked obscenity and the final slap across the face when she was already as good as dead they were somewhere else now shed had sensia turn her skin from reddishgold too much like veppers own flesh tone to a dark glossy black the house and landscape had been altered at her request too all in an instant now they stood outside a more modest singlestorey dwelling of whitepainted mud brick whose prospect was of a leafy little oasis in a great duned desert of sable sand spreading as far as the eye could see colourful tents stood around pools and little streams shadowed by tall redleafed trees make there be children shed said and there they were a dozen or so all laughing and splashing in one of the shallow pools oblivious to the two women watching them from the mud brick house on its slight rise sensia had suggested they sit down before she opened up lededjes memories of the last few days and hours of her life they had sat on a rug on a wooden platform in front of the house while she recalled with mounting horror the events leading up to her death there had been the usual flier journey from the estate to the capital full of stomachchurning swoops and zooms as veppers enjoyed himself then on arrival she had settled into her room in the town house another mansion in all but name in the centre of the city then shed slipped away from a visit to a couturier gouging from her left heel the tracer implant shed discovered was there some months ago shed picked up some preprepared clothes makeup and effects and gone on the run within the city streets and alleys finally finding herself cornered in the opera house the way sensia had let her experience it it was more like watching it all happen to somebody else on a stage or in a film she had been spared the outright immediacy of it all in that first runthrough though she could choose to go back and inspect the detail of it if she wanted she had chosen to do this she was doing it again now she winced once more lededje had stood again the shock of it over sensia stood at her side so im dead she said still not fully comprehending well sensia said obviously not so dead you cant ask that question but technically yes how did i get here was it via this entanglement thing yes there must have been a sort of neural lace inside your head entangled with the legacy system i inherited from the relevant ship what relevant ship lets come back to that and what fucking neural lace inside my head she demanded i didnt have one you must have the only alternative would have been somebody positioning some sort of neural induction device round your head and reading your mindstate that way as you slipped away but thats very doubtful not the sort of tech you have yourselves we have aliens lededje protested especially in ubruater its the capital of the planet the whole system the whole enablement alien embassies aliens running around all over the place theyd have the tech indeed they might but why would they code your brain state and transmit it across three and a half thousand light years to a culture ship without documentation also just plopping an induction helmet no matter how sophisticated onto a dying person in the last few seconds of their life could never record a mind state as detailed and internally consistent as yours even in a prime equivtech medical environment with plenty of prep time and a stable subject youd never capture the fine detail youve come equipped with a full backupcapable neural lace grows with the brain its part of it beds in over the years gets very adept at mirroring every detail of the mind it interpenetrates and co exists with thats what you pretty much must have had plus it had an entanglement facility built into it obviously she glared at sensia so im complete a perfect copy impossible to be absolutely sure but i strongly suspect so there is almost certainly less of a difference between the you that died and the you that you are now than there would be between your selves at one end of a nights sleep and the other and thats thanks to this entanglement thing too partly the copies at either end of the process should be absolutely identical assuming the nonoriginating part of the pair collapses at all what entanglement is great when it works but more than two per cent of the time it doesnt work in fact it fails utterly thats why its almost never used hideously risky you use it in wartime when its better than nothing and possibly a few sc agents have been subject to the process but otherwise never still the odds were in my favour assuredly and its better than being dead sensia paused though this still doesnt answer the question regarding how you ended up with a full backupcapable neural lace in your head complete with an entanglement facility targeted to a long passedon legacy subsystem which all concerned had quite thoroughly forgotten about sensia turned looked at lededje youre frowning i just thought of something she had met him met it as it turned out at a reception on the third equatower in the space station port of one of sichults five equatorial space elevators a jhlupian cultural and trade mission ship had recently docked disgorging various notables of the jhlupe a highlevel civilisation with which veppers had commercial links the carousel space where the reception was held was one of a number of giant sliding tori for ever revolving underneath the rotund bulk of the stations docks canted windows providing an everchanging view of the planet beneath the jhlupe she recalled thinking gave the impression that they were all elbows or maybe knees they were awkwardlooking twelvelimbed creatures like giant softshelled land crabs their skin or carapace a bright lustrous green a trio of eyes on short stalks protruded from their main bodies which were a little larger than a human who had rolled themselves into a ball rather than use their many spindly legs they floated on what looked like metallic cushions their translated voices issued from the same source this had happened ten years ago lededje had been sixteen at the time just coming to terms with the fact she was a woman and that her now almost fully matured intagliation would make her an object of fascination wherever she went indeed that this was the whole of her purpose in life as far as veppers and the rest of the world were concerned she had just started being brought along to events like this expected to accompany veppers as part of his retinue it was in its full pomp a sizeable retinue too as well as his assorted bagcarriers and various bodyguards jasken being the last line of defence veppers was the sort of oligarch who seemed to feel slightly naked without his media relations advisor and his loyaltician around she still wasnt entirely sure what a loyaltician actually did but at least they had some sort of purpose and utility she she had come to realise was no more than an ornament something to be admired to be stared at and cooed over an object of fascin ation and astonishment her duty being to exemplify and magnify the magnificence and sheer wealth of mr joiler veppers president and prime executive officer of the veprine corporation the richest man in the world in the whole enablement in charge of the most powerful and profitable company that had ever existed the man looking at her appeared terribly old he was either a muchaltered sichultian or a panhuman alien the human type had proved to be one of the galaxys more repetitively common lifeforms probably an alien making yourself look as skeletally creakingly old as that would just be perverse weird and creepy nowadays even poor people could afford the sort of treatment that let you stay younglooking pretty much until you died it kind of meant you rotted from the inside shed heard but that was a small price to pay for not having to look decrepit until right at the end and there wouldnt be any poor people up here anyway this was an exclusive little party for all that there were a couple of hundred people present there were only ten of the jhlupe in attendance the rest were sichultian business chiefs politicians bureaucrats and media people plus their various servants aides and hangerson she supposed she counted as a hangeron she was generally expected to hang around near veppers impressing all with the fabulousness of the human exotica he could afford but he and his inner negotiating circle had peeled off to talk with two of the giant crab people in a sort of bay window section of the reception room perimeter guarded by three of the zei veppers massive highly enhanced clone bodyguards lededje had come to understand that often the principal part of her worth lay in providing a distraction a chattel to be wielded when veppers required dazzling and beguiling those he wished dazzled and beguiled often so that he could slip something past them or just get them in a generally agreeable frame of mind the jhlupe might be able to appreciate that she looked significantly different to everybody else around her darker and extravagantly tattooed but the sichultians were so alien to them anyway it made little extra difference which meant she was not required to be present when veppers was talking with them on matters of any great seriousness she had hardly been abandoned though being minded by one of the other zei and in the company of dr sulbazghi that man is looking at you sulbazghi said nodding towards the slightly stooped extremely bald human a few metres away the man looked wrong too thin and even stooped too tall to be normal his face and head appeared vaguely cadaverous even his clothes were strange too tight plain and dull to be remotely fashionable everybody looks at me dr sulbazghi she told him dr sulbazghi was a blockylooking man with dark yellow skin quite lined on his face and scant thin brown hair characteristics that marked him as either coming from or having ancestors whod come from keratiy first amongst sichults subcontinents he could easily have had himself altered to look more handsome or at least vaguely acceptable but had chosen not to lededje thought this was very strange even freaky the zei towering nearby soberly dressed eyes always moving flicking his gaze all around the room as though watching some ball game invisible to everybody else was quite goodlooking in comparison and even he was kind of scarily muscleblown looking like he was about to burst out of both his suit and skin yes but hes looking at you differently to everybody else the doctor said he nodded to a waiter had his glass replaced took a drink and look now hes coming over maam the zei rumbled deep dark eyes looking down at her from a face at least half a metre above her own the zei made her feel like a child she sighed nodded and the zei let the funnylooking man approach her veppers would not expect her to be standoffish with anybody at an event as exclusive as this good day i believe you are lededje ybreq the old man said smiling at her and nodding briefly at dr sulbazghi his voice was real not synthesised by a translation device even more surprising was that his voice was so deep veppers had had his voice surgically improved over the years making it deeper more mellifluous and rich in a series of small operations and other treatments but this mans voice eclipsed even veppers succulent tones bit of a shock in someone so patently an old geezer and looking like he was on his last legs maybe age went differently with aliens she thought yes i am she said smiling suitably and carefully pitching her voice into the middle of the zone of elegance that her elocution tutor kept wittering on about how do you do and you are how do you do my name is himerance he smiled swivelled from the waist in a slightly unnatural way and looked over to where veppers was talking to the two crablike aliens im with the jhlupian delegation a panhuman cultural translator making sure nobody commits some terrible faux pas how interesting she said happy not to be committing one herself by yawning in the geriatrics face he smiled again looked down to her feet and then back up to her face yes just you give me a good long inspection you old perv she thought she supposed it was partly the dress of which it had to be said there was not much she was destined to spend her life in revealing clothes she had long since decided to be proud of how she looked she would have been a beauty even without the intagliation and if she was to bear the mark of her familys shame then she would do that too with all the dignity she could however she was still growing into this new role and sometimes men looked at her in ways she didnt appreciate even veppers had begun to gaze at her as though he was somehow seeing her for the first time and in a way that made her uncomfortable i confess himerance said i am quite fascinated by the intagliate and you are if i may say so remarkable even within that exceptional category how kind she said oh i am not kind himerance said at that point the zei watching over them stiffened fractionally and rumbled something that might have been excuse me before swinging away into the crowd of people with surprising litheness and grace at the same time dr sulbazghi swayed a little and frowning inspected the contents of his glass his eyes looked a little odd dont know what theyre putting in this stuff these days think ill sit down if you excuse me he sidled off too heading for some seats there we are himerance said smoothly he had kept his eyes focused on her while both the zei and dr s had made their excuses and left she was alone with him now the truth dawned you just did that she asked glancing first at the broad retreating back of the zei and then in the direction dr s had disappeared she was not trying to keep her voice politely modulated any more she was aware her eyes had widened well done himerance said with an appreciative smile a concocted semiurgent message on the bodyguards comms and a temporary feeling of dizziness afflicting the good doctor neither will detain them for long however it allows me the chance to beg a favour of you himerance smiled again i would like to talk to you privately ms ybreq may i now she asked she glanced about it would be a short conversation you were well she was never left alone for more than a minute or so at gatherings like this later himerance said tonight in your chamber at mr veppers town house in ubruater city she almost laughed think youll get invited she knew there was nothing planned that evening beyond a meal out with the whole entourage somewhere and then for her music and deportment lessons then to bed after getting to watch half an hour of screen if she was lucky she wasnt allowed out without bodyguards and escorts and the idea that shed be allowed to entertain a man in her private bedroom ancient and alien or not was frankly hilarious himerance smiled his easy smile no he said i can arrange my own access however i wouldnt want you to be alarmed so i thought it best to ask permission first she regained some control what is this about mr himerance she asked voice polite and measured again i have a modest proposition to make it will cause you no inconvenience or harm it would take nothing from you that youd miss she changed tack again trying to unsettle this weird old guy dropping the toopolite tone and asking sharply and whats in it for me perhaps some satisfaction once ive explained what it is i am looking for though some other payment could certainly be arranged still without taking his gaze away from her eyes he said im afraid i must hurry you for an answer one of mr veppers bodyguards is making his way towards us rather smartly having realised we have been left alone she felt excited slightly scared her life was too controlled whens good for you she asked shed fallen asleep she hadnt meant to and she would never have thought shed be able to anyway just too fired up by the vague illicit thrill of it all then when she awoke she knew he was there her room was on the secondtop floor of the tall town house which was better guarded than most military bases she had a big room with a dressing room and bathroom ensuite its two large windows looked out over the gently lit parterres and formal sculp tings of the garden by the windows part illuminated in the spill of cloudreflected city light the shutters admitted there was a sitting area with a low table a couch and two seats she levered herself up from her pillows with her elbows he was sitting in one of the seats she saw his head turn ms ybreq he said softly hello again she shook her head put a finger to her lips pointed round the room there was just enough light for her to see him smile no he said gently the various surveillance devices will not trouble us okay she thought so the alarm probably wouldnt work either shed kind of been relying on that as her last line of defence if things got iffy well secondlast line of defence she could always just scream though if the guy could interfere with the zeis comms make dr s feel suddenly dizzy and somehow get himself into veppers town house without being detected maybe even screaming wouldnt be on the agenda if he set his mind against it she started to get a little frightened again a light came slowly on near the seat he sat in revealing him to be dressed just as he had been at the reception earlier in the day please he said gesturing to the other seat join me she put a robe over her nightgown turning away from him so that he wouldnt see her hands shake she sat by him he looked different still the same man but not quite so old less skeletal about the face body no longer stooped thank you for allowing me this opportunity to talk with you in private he said formally thats okay she said drawing her feet up beneath her and hugging her knees so what is it all about i would like to take an image of you an image she felt vaguely disappointed was that all though probably he meant a fullbody image a photograph of her in the nude so he was just an old perv after all funny how things that started out exciting and maybe even romanticseeming degenerated into the crude mundanity of lust it would be an image of your entire body not just both inside and out but of its every single cell indeed its every atom and taken in effect from outside the three dimensions one normally deals with she stared at him like from hyperspace she asked lededje had generally paid attention in science lessons himerance smiled broadly precisely why he shrugged for my own private collection of images which i find pleasing uhhuh for whatever it might be worth ms ybreq i can assure you that my motivation is absolutely not sexual right himerance sighed you are a remarkable work if i may say so ms ybreq he told her i realise that you are a person and a very intelligent pleasant and to those of your own kind of course an attractive one however i shant pretend that my interest in you is anything other than purely due to the intagliation you have suffered suffered undergone i did think about the exact word to employ no you were right the first time i suffered it she said not something i got to have any choice about anyway quite what do you do with these images i contemplate them they are works of art to me got any other ones you can show me himerance sat forward would you really like to see some he appeared genuinely keen do we have the time we do so show me a bright d image appeared in the air in front of her it showed well she wasnt sure it was an insane swirl of lines black against yelloworange bewilderingly complex levels of implied detail disappearing into enfolded spaces it was not quite possible to see this is just the threedimensional view one would have of a stellar fieldliner entity he told her though with the horizontal scale reduced to make it look roughly spherical really they look more like this the image suddenly stretched teasing out until the assemblage of dark lines shed been looking at became a single line maybe a metre long and less than a millimetre across a tiny symbol looking like a sort of microscopic shoe box with the edges chamfered off was probably meant to indicate scale though as she had no idea what it was meant to represent it didnt really help the vanishingly thin line was shown silhouetted against what looked like a detail of the surface of a star then the line plumped up to become an absurdly complicated collection of lines once more its hard to give an impression of the effect in d with all the internals shown himerance said apologetically but its something like this whatever he did with the image it left her feeling glad she was sitting down the image seemed to peel off into a million different slices sections flickering blurringly past her like snowflakes in a blizzard she blinked looked away feeling disoriented are you all right himerance asked sounding concerned it can be a bit intense im fine she told him what exactly was that a particularly fine specimen of a stellar field liner creatures who live within the magnetic lines of force in mostly the photospheres of suns that thing was alive yes and it still is i expect they live for a very long time she looked at the old man his face illuminated by the glow coming from the image of the creature that was mostly black lines and somehow lived on the surfaces of suns can you see it in proper d yes he said turning to look at her he sounded proud and coy at once face glowing enthusiasm seemingly pouring out of him he suddenly looked about six how is that possible she asked because i am not really a man or any sort of human he told her still smiling i am an avatar of a ship it is the ship you are really addressing and the ship which is able to take and appreciate images in d the ships name my true name is the me im counting once fully part of the culture now an independent vessel within what is sometimes known as the ulterior i am a wanderer an explorer if you will and it is my pleasure on occasion to offer my services as a cultural translator a facilitator of smooth relations between profoundly different species and civilisations to whoever might feel the need for such assistance and as i say i am also a collector of images of whatever i consider to be the most exquisite beings wherever my travels take me couldnt you just take one of these images without me knowing in the practical sense yes nothing would be easier but you wanted to ask permission first it would be rude dishonourable not to dont you think she looked at him for a moment i suppose she said eventually so would you be sharing this image with anybody no until now showing you this one of the fieldliner creature i have never shared one of these images with anybody i have many more would you like to no she said smiling and holding up one hand thats all right the image disappeared dimming the room again i give you my word that in the unlikely event i do decide i want to share your image i would not do so without your express permission in each case in each case with a similar precondition applying to and if you do it if you take the image will i feel anything nothing hmm still hugging her shins she lowered her face to her robed knees stuck her tongue out to touch the soft material then bit at it taking a tiny fold of it into her mouth himerance watched her for a few moments then said lededje may i have your permission to take the image she spat out the fold of material raised her head i asked you before whats in it for me what may i offer get me out of here take me with you help me escape rescue me from this life i cant do that lededje im sorry himerance sounded regretful why not there would be consequences she let her head drop again she stared at the rug at the foot of the shuttered windows because veppers is the richest man in the world in the whole sichultian enablement and the most powerful himerance sighed there are limits to what i can do anyway you have your own way of living here on this world and within the hegemony you call the enablement your own rules mores customs and laws it is not regarded as good form to go interfering in the societies of others unless one has a very good reason and an agreedon strategic plan however much we might wish to we cannot simply indulge our own sentimental urges i am genuinely sorry but sadly what you ask is not within my gift so nothing in it for me she said and knew that she sounded bitter im sure i could set up a bank account with a sum in it that might help you like veppers will ever let me have any sort of independent life she said shaking her head well perhaps oh just do it she said she hugged her legs tighter looked at him do i need to stand up or anything no are you sure just do it she repeated fiercely i might still be able to suggest some kind of compensatory yes yes whatever you think fit surprise me surprise you you heard you are sure about this im sure im sure have you done it yet ahha sensia purred nodding her head slowly that does sound like it that ship put the neural lace thing in my head yes well it would have planted the seed of one they grow i didnt feel anything at the time well you wouldnt sensia looked out towards the desert yes the me im counting she said and lededje got the impression sensia was really talking to herself hooliganclass lou declared as an eccentric and ulteriored itself over a millennium ago dropped out of view completely a couple of years back probably on a retreat lededje sighed heavily my own fault for saying surprise me i guess inside though she was elated the mystery was solved almost certainly and it had been a good bargain she had been saved from death in a sense at least but what is to become of me she thought she looked at sensia still staring out into the shimmering warmth of distance where dust devils danced and the horizon quivered in a mirage of lake or sea what is to become of me she wondered did she depend upon the charity of this virtual woman was she subject to some legal agreement between the culture and the enablement was she now somebody or something elses possession or plaything she might as well ask she supposed she immediately found herself preparing to use what she thought of as her little voice the meek low soft childlike tone she used when she was trying to make her own vulnerability and powerlessness known when she was trying to play upon somebodys sympathies make them feel sorry for her and so less likely to hurt or demean her and perhaps even let her have something she wanted it was a technique she had used on everyone from her mother to veppers mostly with a lot more success than failure but she hesitated it had never been a ruse she had been very proud of and here the rules had changed everything was different for her own pride for the sake of what might be a fresh start she would ask it straight without deliberate inflection so she said looking not at sensia but out at the desert what is to become of me sensia the older woman looked at her become of you you mean what happens now where do you go still not daring to meet the other womans gaze she nodded yes what a strange almost absurd situation to be in she thought to be in this perfect but selfconfessed simulation talking to a glorified computer about her fate her life from this point on what would happen next would she be left free to wander and somehow make a life within this virtual world would she be in some sense returned to sichult even to veppers could she simply be turned off as just a program nothing genuinely alive at all the following few seconds the next sentence out of sensias unreal virtually modelled mouth would like as not turn her life one way or the other to despair to triumph to outright annihilation it all came down unless she was already being deeply deceived about where she was and who she was really talking to to what was said in the next moment sensia blew her cheeks out largely up to you lededje youre in a nearly unique situation so theres no particular precedent but zero documentation or not youre essentially a fully functioning viable independent mindstate and incontrovertibly sentient with all that that implies regarding rights and so on what does that imply lededje asked she was already feeling relieved but she wanted to be sure sensia grinned only good things really the first thing i imagine you might want to do is to be revented what does that mean technical term for being brought back to life in a physical body back in the real for all that she had no real heart or mouth that all this was a simulation she felt her heart leap her mouth start to go dry that is possible possible advisable kind of standard in such situations sensia gave a sort of throttledback laugh and waved out at the desert as she swept her arm across the view lededje caught brief glimpses of what she guessed were other virtual worlds within or alongside this one great gleaming cities a mountain range at night crisscrossed with a tangle of tubes and lights a vast ship or mobile city sailing on a creamy white sea beneath a cerulean sky a limitlesslooking vista of nothing but air full of vast striped trees like greenblue curlicues and views and structures that she saw but could hardly have described which she guessed were possible in a virtual reality but impractical in what sensia blithely called the real then the desert resumed you could stay here of course sensia told lededje in whatever environment or mix of them you find congenial but id expect you might want a real physical body lededje nodded her mouth was still dry could it really be this easy i think she said i would sensible there are believe me innumerable other things you could be revented into in theory but if i were you id stick with the form youre used to at first at least context is everything and the first context we find ourselves in is that of our own body she looked lededje down and up you happy with the way you look now lededje opened the blue robe she still wore looked down at herself she closed the robe again its hems fluttered in the hot breeze yes she hesitated i cant decide if i want some form of tattoo or not easy to add later though not at the genetic level youve been used to cant really sort you out with that that info didnt travel sensia shrugged ill leave you with an image you can manipulate until youre happy with it take a spec from that youll grow a body for me complete a suspended one how long will that take here as little or as much time as you like in the real about eight days sensia shrugged again my standard stock of mindless bods doesnt include the sichultian form sorry is there a body i could be put into now without waiting sensia smiled cant wait eh lededje shook her head felt her skin grow warm the truth was that if this was some cruel joke she wanted to know as quickly as possible if it was all genuine then she didnt want to wait to have a real body to take her back to sichult itll still take about a day or so sensia said she nodded at a female human figure suddenly suspended in the air in front of them naked eyes closed it looked vaguely sichultian its skin was a sort of muddy grey then it changed to pure black then to near white then shifted through a modest spectrum of different colours at the same time the girth and height of the figure increased and then decreased the shape of the head and the facial features changed a little too thats the parameters you can play with given the time available sensia told her lededje was thinking she recalled veppers own skin tone how long might it take to make it look properly sichultian and not black but sort of reddishgold sensias eyes might have narrowed a fraction a few hours more a full day in total perhaps youd look sichultian but you wouldnt really be so all the way through not inside a blood test tissue sample or almost any invasive medical procedure would quickly reveal that thats all right i think thats what id like lededje said she looked sensia in the eye i have no money to pay for this she had heard that the culture survived without money but hadnt believed a word of it thats as well sensia said reasonably i have no charge to levy you would do this out of kindness or for my obligation lets call it kindness but its my pleasure then thank you lededje said she bowed formally sensia smiled i would also lededje said need to work my passage back to sichult sensia nodded im sure that can be arranged though the word work doesnt really mean quite the same in the culture as it does in the enablement sensia paused may i ask what you intend to do when you get back kill mr joiler fucking veppers of course lededje thought grimly and but there were some things some thoughts which were so secret so potentially dangerous she had learned in effect to keep them even from herself she smiled wondered if this friendlyseeming virtual creature could read her thoughts in here i have business to conclude there she said smoothly sensia nodded expressionless they both looked out towards the desert again six prin ignored the departing air vehicle the giant black beetle ignored him in return its great wings unfolded to their full extent a grinning deaths head pattern was displayed on each and then blurred into motion the giant beetle lumbered upwards the storm of air its wings produced kicked up dust and tiny shards of bone as prin still holding the tiny petrified form of chay against his massive chest with one of his forelimbs reached the flat landing area and dashed across it for the door of the bloodpowered mill he threw open the door then had to duck and squeeze though the doorway to get inside he straightened up roaring the wind and dust from the departing aircrafts wings blowing a stormy haze about him and before him sweeping over the dark uneven floorboards to where the group of grinning demons and terrified pavuleans were standing before a tall glowing doorway of cool blue set into the boneandsinew machinery of the mills creaking quietly shrieking interior somebody said three caught in the double whirlwind produced by the beetles wings the door behind prin slammed shut shaking the mill and reducing by half the little light that came from outside prin paused taking stock chay remained stiff in his forelimb he thought he could feel her trembling against his chest and hear her whimpering the demons and the pavuleans presented a static tableau a shallow ramp led down from the floor of the mill to the blue haze of the tall doorway which trembled light level fluctuating as though it was made up of mist inside prin thought he caught a glimpse of movement beyond it but it was impossible to be sure there were six demons before him they were of the smaller fourlegged kind no match for him individually but capable of overwhelming him en masse two of them were the ones who had come out of the mill to watch the beetleshaped flier land the other four each holding one of the pavuleans had come in on the beetle itself four pavuleans left four must already have gone through the gateway back to the real and what is it you might want one of the mill demons said to prin as the other nodded to a pair of demons from the flier these two released their hold on the pavuleans they were clutching the two male pavuleans landed on all fours and scuttled soundlessly down the ramp vanishing into the blue mist of the doorway the other mill demon said one no no no one of the two remaining pavuleans wailed struggling in the grasp of the demon who held him shush now the demon holding him said shaking him might not be you whos staying brother the mill demon whod spoken to prin took a step towards him prin felt a tiny sharp barb penetrate the skin at his neck the contraband code was about to run out four pulses warning thats what hed been told four pulses and then hed be back to his earlier self just another coded pavulean as helpless and hopeless as chay here held tight and trembling against his chest another barb so that was four three he didnt even try to roar again waste of breath he just charged leaping forward at the group of demons and pavuleans he thudded into the approaching mill demon while surprise was still registering on its face and it was just starting to raise its trunks to fend him off he halfheaded it halfshouldered it out of the way sending it crashing to the floor it was all happening very slowly he wondered if this really was the speed that such moments of action seemed to happen at for predators in the real one reason they were so good at bringing down their prey perhaps or if this was an extra effect introduced just for the demons in hell to allow them an even greater advantage over their victims or just to let them savour the moment all the more fully the four demons from the flier were all facing him now the two holding pavuleans did not worry him so much he realised he was thinking like a predator like one of these bastards because they didnt want to let go of their charges at least not yet by the time they thought the better of this he knew it would all be over one way or the other one of the remaining demons was faster to react than the other opening its mouth into a snarl and starting to rise up on its hind legs while it brought its forelegs up towards him he was aware of being slightly encumbered by the small hard weight he was carrying against his great furred chest chay could he just throw her through the doorway from here probably not hed have to stop take aim lob her it would take too long and the way the angles worked one of the demons would only need to raise one forelimb to catch her or knock her off course by the time that happened hed have lost all his temporary power and be no more strong than she was now no match at all for even a single demon he could use his slight lopsidedness to his advantage he realised as he took his next swinging galloping step the demon facing him ready to tackle him was allowing for how he was moving offkilter unconsciously preparing to intercept prin a couple of metres ahead according to the already set rhythm evident in the way he was moving prin threw chay from one forelimb to the other and pressed her hard into the other side of his chest the gesture cost him a small amount of momentum but gave him the greater advantage of throwing off the reckoning of the demon preparing to bring him down prin opened his jaws as the third barb made itself felt in his neck one pulse left the fourth barb would signal his instant return to the small broken body hed been trapped within for the last few months the demon didnt even have time to look surprised prin crunched his jaws closed on the smaller demon he felt his fangs penetrate furred skin flesh sinew and tendon and then bite into the giving hardness of bone he was already turning his head an instinctive reaction giving his jaws time to fully close the demon was starting to turn too now pulled round by his attackers greater weight prin went with the motion keeping his jaws tight feeling bone snap and crumple inside his mouth he pivoted with the demon using their combined mass to swivel even as he kept on charging forward bringing the body of the bitten demon swinging round legs flailing to connect with the body of the second pouncing demon knocking it aside in a snarling ball prin let his jaws open the first demon was flung from them and went slithering along the floor already bleeding narrowly missing the legs of one of the other two demons still holding the pavuleans he was almost at the start of the slope to the blue glowing door he made one last bound launching himself through the air as he did so he knew he had made it that they would get through the doorway it floated up towards him as he rose in the air still propelled by the last great thrust of his hind legs one he thought the way the mill demon had said one after the last two pavuleans had gone through and just as hed burst into the mill a voice the same voice he realised now had said three three then the two little pavuleans had gone skittering through the blue glowing gate one hed been counting down of course the gate could count the gate or people operating it at this side or more likely the other side in the real knew how many to expect how many they were allowed to let through just one more person would be allowed to make the transition from the hell to the real he reached the top of his last pouncing leap the doorway spread before him a glowing bank of blue mist filled with shadows he wondered if the fact that he and chay were so close together would allow them both to make it through if the gateway would be somehow fooled by this or perhaps the fact she was catatonic semiconscious at best would mean that she could make it through as well as him he was starting to fall through the air the gateway only a bodylength away now he brought chay out from the side of his chest moving her to a more central position grasping her with both forelimbs as he pushed her in front of him if there was really only one more person one more coded consciousness allowed through let it be her he would have to take his chances here accept whatever extra punishment these fiends could devise she might be in no state to tell what had befallen them of course she might forget or deny all they had experienced she might not believe it had happened at all she had denied the existence of the real while she was here surrendering all too easily to the grinding actuality of the horror around her why would she not likewise deny the unbelievable gruesomeness of hell once she was safely back in the real if she was even able to remember it properly what if she remained catatonic on the other side what if she really had gone mad and no return to reality would change that was he to be gallant to the point of stupidity or hardheaded to the point of selfishness just wanting to save his own skin he tucked himself in balling up and tumbling somersaulting through the air as the blueglowing doorway rushed towards him he would go through first holding chay out behind him he would never abandon her she might abandon him at that point the contraband codes runtime reached its end he changed back immediately an instant before the two little pavulean bodies flew into the blue glowing mist seven the halo rolled magisterially across the misty plain its stately progress marked by little lofted tufts and wisps of vapour which seemed to cling longingly to its tubes and spars as though reluctant to let go the giant wheel left a temporarily cleared track through the mist behind it like a wake affording glimpses of the land beneath before the silent grey presence flowed slowly back in veppers floated in the pool looking out over the misted landscape to where some high rounded hills rose out of the grey maybe twenty or more kilometres away the water around him trembled and pulsed as the pool cars shock absorbers struggled to iron out the halo s trundling progress across the mistswaddled terrain the halo was a wheel a vehicle built to navigate the great plains rolling hills and shallow inland seas of obrech sichults principal continent one hundred and fifty metres in diameter by twenty across the halo looked entirely like a giant fairground wheel which had broken free from its supports and gone rolling across the land the veprine corporations planetary heavy industries division sichult constructed several standard sizes and types of wheel most were mobile hotels taking the rich on cruises across the continent the halo veppers own privately owned vehicle was the grandest and most impressive of the largest spokeless class being no greater in diameter than the rest but possessing thirtythree rather than thirtytwo gondolas the halo s separate cars held sumptuous bedroom suites banqueting halls reception rooms two separate pool and bath complexes gyms flowerfilled terraces kitchens kitchen gardens a command and communication pod power and services units garages for ground vehicles hangars for fliers boathouses for speedboats sailboats and minisubs and quarters for crew and servants much more than a mode of transport the halo was a mobile mansion rather than being fixed to the wheels rims the thirtythree cars could alter position either at veppers whim or according to the dictates of the landscape beneath negotiating and especially traversing a steep slope where there was no readymade wheel road all the heavier pods could be brought down close to the ground preventing the device from becoming dangerously topheavy and so allowing it take on angles of lean that looked both unlikely and alarming perched at the top in a gimballed observation gondola during such a manoeuvre veppers had been known to take great delight in terrifying guests with that trick getting from one pod to another could mean as little as a single step if the cars had been brought up against each other or a ride in one of several circumferential elevator units that moved round a smallerdiameter ring fixed inside the wheels principal structure veppers gazed out at the distant blue hills trying to remember if he owned them or not are we still within the estate he asked jasken was standing at the poolside keeping politely out of his masters view jasken was scanning the misty landscape the enhancing oculenses covering his eyes zooming in on details revealing the grounds mostly chilly heat signature and showing him any radio sources ill ask he said and muttered something putting a finger to the comms bud attached to his ear as he listened yes sir he told veppers captain bousser informs us we are about thirty kilometres inside the estates boundaries jasken used a small keypad on the back of the cast covering his left arm to call up the requisite overlay on the view the oculenses were presenting thirty klicks was about right the halo s commander captain bousser was female jasken suspected she had been hired for her pleasing looks rather than on merit so where possible he checked any assertions she made waiting so far unsuccessfully for a mistake he could use to convince veppers of her unfitness for the post hmm veppers said now he thought about it he didnt really care whether he owned the hills or not his right hand went to his face without him thinking about it his fingers very gently tracing the prosthetic covering that had replaced the tip of his nose while the flesh and cartilage regrew beneath it was a pretty good fake especially with a bit of makeup on top but he was still selfconscious about it hed cancelled a few engagements and postponed many more in the days since the debacle in the opera house what a mess that had been they hadnt been able to keep it completely quiet of course especially as hed had to cancel that evenings engagement at such short notice dr sulbazghi had come up with their cover story which was that jasken had accidentally sliced the tip of his masters nose off while they were fencing thatll have to do veppers agreed as he lay on the treatment couch in the clinic suite deep within the ubruater town house less than an hour after the girl had attacked him he was painfully aware that his voice sounded strange strangled and nasal sulbazghi was bandaging his nose and prepping it with coagulant antiseptic and a stabilising preparatory gel a specialist plastic surgeon had been summoned and was on his way the girls body had already been bagged and placed in a mortuary freezer dr sulbazghi would see to its disposal later veppers was still shaking a little despite whatever sulbazghi had given him for the shock he lay there thinking as the doctor fussed about him he was waiting for jasken to return he was on his way back from the opera house having made sure everything had been squared away and everybody had their stories straight he shouldnt have killed the girl it had been stupid impetuous on the rare occasion that sort of thing was necessary you just never got involved directly that was what delegation was for what people like jasken and whoever he employed specifically for such tasks was for always keep it deniable always at a remove always have a true alibi but hed been too excited by the chase by the knowledge that the runaway was still so close and so trapped within the opera house practically waiting to be caught of course hed wanted to be part of the hunt the capture still he shouldnt have killed her it wasnt just how much shed been worth how much wasted effort and money she represented it was the embarrassment of having lost her people would notice her continued absence the cover story after shed run off from the couturiers had been that she was ill the pr people had hinted at some rare ailment that only the intagliated suffered from now they would either have to claim shed died of it meaning problems with the surgeons guild the insurance people and possibly lawyers for the clinic that had overseen her intagliation in the first place or go with the even more humiliating though partially true narrative that shed run away hed already entertained the idea that they might claim shed been kidnapped or allowed to join a nunnery or whatever but both would lead to too many complications at least hed got the knives back they were still tucked into the waistband of his trews he touched their hilts again reassuring himself they were still there jasken had wanted to dispose of them the idiot no need to dispose of the murder weapon when you were going to dispose of the body properly stealing the knives the sheer fucking effrontery of it in the end shed been nothing more than an ungrateful little thief and biting him maybe even trying to bite his throat out and kill him how dare the little bitch do that how dare she put him in this situation he was glad hed killed her and it was a first for him he realised directly taking a life was one of the few things hed never done when this had all calmed down when his nose had regrown and things had gone back to normal hed still have that he supposed he remembered that until hed first taken her against her will maybe ten years or so ago hed never raped anybody before either there had been no need so hed got two firsts from her if he was being generous he would reluctantly concede that that was some sort of compensation for all the pain and inconvenience she was putting him through quite a thing though doing something like that actually plunging a knife into somebody and feeling them die it shook you no matter how strong you were he could still see the look in the girls eyes as shed died jasken came in then removing his oculenses and nodding to the two zei guarding the clinic suites door youll have to be injured too jasken veppers told him immediately glaring at his chief of security as though it really had all been his fault which now he thought about it was true as it had ultimately been jaskens responsibility to keep an eye on the scribblechild and make sure she didnt go running off anywhere were going to say you took my nose off while we were fencing but we cant have people thinking you actually bested me youll have to have an eye out jaskens face already pale went paler ah but sir or a broken arm something serious dr sulbazghi nodded i think the broken arm he looked at jaskens forearms perhaps choosing on veppers behalf jasken glared at sulbazghi sir please he said to veppers you could make it a clean break couldnt you sulbazghi veppers asked quick to heal easily sulbazghi said smiling at jasken sir jasken said drawing himself up such an action would compromise my ability to protect you in the event that our other layers of security were disabled and i was all that stood between you and an assailant hmm i suppose so veppers said still we need something he frowned thinking how would you like a duelling scar on the cheek where everybody would see it it would have to be a very big very deep scar dr sulbazghi said reasonably probably permanent he shrugged as jasken glared at him again to be proportionate he protested might i suggest a fake cast for a couple of weeks jasken said tapping his left arm the brokenarm story would still hold but i would not be truly disabled he smiled thinly at the doctor i might even conceal additional weaponry within the cast for any emergency veppers liked that good idea he nodded lets go with that now floating in the pool at the summit of the halo his fingers feeling tentatively around the strange warm surface of the prosthetic veppers smiled at the memory jaskens compromise had been sensible but seeing the look on his face when hed thought they were going to put out one of his eyes or actually break his arm had been one of the few truly bright spots in a dreadful evening he gazed out at the mountains again hed ordered the gondola containing the pool to be kept at the summit of the great vehicle while he had his early morning swim he turned round and struck out for the other side of the pool where one of his harem troupe had fallen asleep wrapped in a thick robe and lying on a sunbed veppers had what he honestly believed was the bestlooking tengirl harem troupe in the enablement this girl pleur was special even within that august selection one of his two impressionist girls able to take on the appearance and mannerisms of whatever female public figure he had taken a shine to recently of course hed had his share much more than his fair share as he was the first to acknowledge of superfamous screen stars singers dancers screen presenters athletes and the very occasional hot politician and so on but such pursuits could be terribly timeconsuming the truly famous even when they were available not committed expected to be wooed over time even by the richest man in the enablement and it was usually a lot simpler just to have one of the impressionist girls alter herself and have herself altered surgically where the change would take too long otherwise to look like the relevant beauty it wasnt as though he really wanted them for their minds after all and this way also had the advantage of letting you compensate for any bodily deficiencies in the original as he swam veppers looked over at jasken and nodded towards the sleeping girl who currently looked identical to unusually for veppers an academic pleur had recently taken on the appearance of a severely beautiful doctor of eugenics from lombe whom veppers had first glimpsed at a ball in ubruater city earlier in the year but who had proved annoyingly determined to remain faithful to her husband even in the face of the sort of blandishments and gifts that were guaranteed to turn almost anybodys head husbands included where it merely meant turning a blind eye jasken walked over towards pleurs sleeping form as veppers arrived at the side of the pool then trod water and mimed what jasken was to do jasken nodded went to the back of the sunbed gripped its lower frame and only slightly hindered by the fake cast on his arm swiftly hoisted the rear of the sunbed up to head height tipping the girl into the pool with a splash and a spluttering scream veppers was still laughing and fending off pleurs flapping blows while pulling her robe off when jasken frowned put one finger to his ear then got down on both knees at the pool side and started waving urgently what veppers shouted at jasken exasperated a near miss from one of pleurs hands skiffed one cheek and splashed water into his eyes not on the nose you dumb bitch its sulbazghi jasken told him highest urgency veppers was much bigger and stronger than pleur he gripped her turned her round and held her tightly while she cursed at both him and jasken coughing and spitting water all the while what something happening in ubruater veppers asked no hes in a flier on his way here four minutes out wont say what but insists its highest urgency shall i tell bousser to summit the landing platform veppers sighed i suppose he got pleurs robe off at last she had mostly stopped struggling and coughing go and meet them he told jasken who nodded once and walked off veppers pushed the naked girl towards the side of the pool as for you young lady he said biting her neck hard enough to produce a yelp youve been terribly illmannered i have havent i pleur agreed she knew just what veppers liked to hear i need to be taught a lesson wouldnt you say yes i would assume the position he shoved the floating weight of the robe out of the way as pleur braced herself against the edge of the pool with both hands wont be long he called after jaskens retreating back still a little breathless still with the pleasant glow of satiation about him and still dripping from inside his fluffy robe veppers sat forward and looked at the thing lying in dr sulbazghis broad pale yellow palm he sulbazghi still wearing his lab coat which was an unusual sight jasken and astil veppers butler were the only people in the lavishly furnished lounge outside beyond plump brocade bolsters waggling tassels gently clinking chandeliers and trembling goldthread window fringes the view was of the slowly clearing mists before and behind the wheel as it continued on its journey through the spreading pastel light of dawn thank you astil veppers said accepting a cup of chilled infusion from his butler thats all sir astil said bowing and exiting veppers waited until he whatever it was it looked like a small bunch of very fine wires their colour a sort of dull matt silver with a hint of blue scrunch it up he thought and youd have something like a pebble something so small you could probably swallow it sulbazghi looked tired frazzled almost ill it was found in the furnace he told veppers and ran a hand through his thin unkempt hair what furnace he asked hed come into this thinking it was going to prove to be one of those matters that seemed terribly important and momentous to those around him but which he could having cast his eye over it happily leave for them to worry about and sort out if possible that was after all what he paid them for now just from the feel in the room he was starting to think there might be a real problem here there shouldnt have been anything left jasken said what temperature the furnace in the veppers memorial hospital sulbazghi said rubbing his face with his hands not looking veppers in the eye our little friend from the other night great god the girl veppers realised with a disturbing feeling in his belly now what was the fractious bitch to pursue him from beyond the grave okay he said slowly and all very unfortunate im sure we can agree but what has he waved at the silveryblue wires still displayed in sulbazghis hand what has whatever this is got to do with that its what was left of her body sulbazghi said there shouldnt have been anything left jasken said not if the furnace was the fucking furnace was at the right fucking temperature sulbazghi shouted shrilly jasken whipped off his oculenses his expression furious he looked ready to start a fight gentlemen please veppers said calmly before jasken could reply he looked at the doctor as simply as you can sulbazghi for the nontechnically minded what the hell is this thing its a neural lace the doctor said sounding exhausted a neural lace veppers repeated hed heard of these things they were the sort of device that highly advanced aliens whod started out squidgy and biochemical as squidgy and biochemical as sichultians for example and who had not wanted to upload themselves into nirvana or oblivion or wherever used when they wanted to interface with machine minds or record their thoughts or even when they wanted to save their souls their mindstates veppers looked at sulbazghi are you saying he said slowly that the girl had a neural lace in her head that shouldnt be possible neural laces were illegal for sichultians great god fucking drug glands were illegal for sichultians kind of looks like it sulbazghi said and it never showed up veppers asked he stared at the doctor sulbazghi you must have scanned that girl a hundred times they dont show up using the equipment weve got to look with sulbazghi said he stared down at the thing in his hand gave a tiny despairing laugh minor miracle we can see it with the naked eye who put it in her veppers asked the clinicians sulbazghi shook his head impossible then who ive done a quick bit of investigating since the doctor told me about this jasken said we need help here sir somebody who properly knows about this sort of thing xingre sulbazghi said hell know or know better how to find out xingre veppers said frowning the jhlupian trader and honorary consul was his principal contact with the alien civilisation the enablement was closest to jasken had a sour look on his face that veppers recognised it meant he was having to agree with sulbazghi both men knew this had to be kept as quiet as possible why were they suggesting bringing the alien into this he she or it might know jasken said the point is itll be able to find out if this thing really is what it looks like and what the fuck does it look like veppers asked jasken took a deep breath well like a a neural lace device the sort of thing the socalled culture uses he grimaced veppers saw the man grind his teeth for a moment its hard to tell it could be a fake with our technology why would anyone go to this trouble to fake it sulbazghi said angrily veppers held up one hand to quiet him jasken glared at the doctor but went on it isnt possible to be sure which is why we might need xingre and the sort of analysis and diagnostic equipment he has access to but it looks like this thing is one of their devices a culture device veppers looked at them both in turn its a culture device he asked he held out his hand and let sulbazghi tip the thing into his palm the closer he looked the more tiny still finer filaments he could see branching and rebranching off the main already very thin wires it felt amazingly soft it weighed next to nothing looks very likely the doctor agreed veppers bounced the thing up and down in his hand a couple of times a handful of hair would have weighed more okay he said but what does this mean i mean she wasnt a culture citizen or anything was she no sulbazghi said and she didnt seem to be able to interface with any equipment veppers looked from the doctor to jasken who was now standing with his oculenses dangling the arm in the cast folded across his chest his other arm resting on it hand stroking the skin around his mouth repeatedly he was still frowning no sulbazghi said again she might not even have known the thing was in there what veppers said but how these things grow inside you jasken said if it really is one then itll have started as a seed and grown all around and into her brain fully developed these things link with just about every brain cell every synapse why didnt she have a head the size of a basket fruit veppers asked he grinned but neither man responded that was very unusual and not a good sign these things add less than half a per cent to the bulk of the brain jasken said he nodded at the thing lying in veppers palm even what you see there is mostly hollow in the brain itd be filled with fluid or bits of the brain itself the tiniest filaments are so thin theyre invisible to the naked eye and theyll probably have been burned off in the furnace anyway veppers stared at the strange insignificantlooking device but what was it in her brain to do he asked both men what was it for given that weve established it didnt seem to give her any super powers or anything these things are used to record a persons mindstate jasken said their soul for want of a better word sulbazghi said its so culture people can be reincarnated if they die unexpectedly jasken said i know veppers said patiently ive looked into the technology myself dont think im not jealous he tried another smile still no response this must be serious well jasken said its not impossible that such information her mindstate was transmitted somewhere else at the point of death its what these things are for after all transmitted veppers said where not far jasken began i cant see how sulbazghi shook his head glancing at jasken ive done my own research it takes time and a full clinical setup its a persons entire personality were talking about here their every memory you dont squirt that out in a beat or two like a fucking text message we are dealing with what the aliens call level eight technology jasken said contemptuously you dont know what it might be capable of were like prewheel primitives looking at a screen and saying it cant work because nobody can redraw a cavepainting that quickly there are still limits sulbazghi insisted doubtless jasken said but we have no idea what they are sulbazghi drew breath to speak but veppers just talked over the start of whatever he had been about to say well in any event bad news perhaps gentlemen he reached out let sulbazghi take the device back the doctor bagged it put it in a pocket of his lab coat sealed it so veppers said if this stored her mindstate i suppose it would know everything up to the moment of her death sulbazghi said veppers nodded jasken he said ask yarbethile what our relations are with the culture would you sir jasken said turning away for a moment while he contacted veppers private secretary doubtless already at his desk in the halo s executive office pod jasken listened muttered something turned back mr yarbethile characterises our relations with the culture as nebulous jasken said drily he shrugged im not sure if hes trying to be funny or not well veppers said we dont really have much to do with them with the culture do we veppers looked at the other two men not really jasken shook his head sulbazghi clenched his jaw and looked away to one side all three experienced a momentarily disquieting lurch as the halo which had been quietly and suitably reconfiguring itself for the last couple of minutes left the land precisely as scheduled and crunched down a long broad beach in two giant troughs of pebbles to meet the misty torpid waters of the oligyne inland sea turning itself into a giant paddle wheel as it ploughed on through the banks of mist its pace only slightly reduced we need to look into this obviously veppers said jasken use any resources required keep me informed daily jasken nodded veppers stood up nodded to sulbazghi thank you doctor i trust youll stay for breakfast if theres nothing more for now though i think ill go and get dressed excuse me he walked towards the link leading to his bedroom currently joined with the lounge gondola as sometimes happened veppers found that the giant wheels faint bobbing motion as it rolled through waters was giving him a feeling of nausea he felt sure it would pass eight the planet outside was very big and blue and white and bright it was revolving like planets usually did but you couldnt really see that on normaltime sight it only seemed to move because the place where he was was moving the place where he was was separate from the planet and it was moving it was above the planet and it was moving the place where he was was called an abandoned space factory and he was here to wait for the enemy to come and when they came he would fight them that was what he did he fought he had been built to fight what he was the thing that he was inside that had been built to fight the thing he was in was a thing an it but he was not an it he was a he he was a man or he had been at least he was still who he was but he was also inside the thing the machine that was designed and built to fight and perhaps get destroyed but not him he wouldnt be destroyed he was still who he was he was somewhere else as well and that was where he would wake up if this thing he was in was destroyed that was how it worked vatueil captain vatueil they were talking to him again were losing he thought reviewing the latest schematics you hardly needed the schematics just step back far enough from the whole thing replay what had happened since the war had broken out and you could see it writing itself out in front of you theyd had some early disasters then successes then theyd been beaten back consistently then theyd consolidated and subsequently seemed to achieve the upper hand across almost every front making steady progress everywhere then found that the fronts were not true fronts the fronts or at least the places where his side was strongest and was prevailing were like stubborn tatters of a balloon that it turned out had already burst some time ago there just hadnt been time to hear the bang they were making forward progress the way the torn strips of the exploded balloon made forward progress flailing hopelessly uselessly outwards like soft shrapnel he sat or floated or whatever you wanted to call it in the primary strategic situation overview space as it was rather grandly called surrounded by the other members of the grand war council the council was mostly composed of people who were his comrades friends colleagues and respected rivals there was only the barest minimum of contrarians awkwardistas and outright defeatists and even they argued their points well and arguably contributed to the working consensus human alien whatever he knew all of them about as well as was possible by now and yet still he felt quite alone he looked round them there was no perfect real analogy for the situation he and the rest were currently in it was as though they all hovered around some modest spherical space maybe a handful of metres across from the outside the spheres surface appeared solid and opaque but you could stick your head through it from the outside if you had the right clearance and a sufficient degree of military seniority you stuck your head through and there you were one bodiless head sticking through protruding into this dimly lit spherical space with lots of other bodiless heads only a minority of them in any sense human usually a spherical display hovered in the centre of the space right now the display was showing some detail of the general battle space an antique fauxreal volume in which small rocket ships armed with nuclear missiles particle beam guns and crews went skating around a few billion asteroids spread in a ring round a sun blasting and zapping each other he had seen such battle environments many times before versions of him had invested the simmed humans fighting in these or invested the machines most of his colleagues seemed to be discussing some pseudostrategic detail of this particular environment that had long since ceased to interest him he left them to it retreating to his own musings and internalised visualisation were losing he thought again there is a war in heaven and we are losing it the war was amongst the heavens between the afterlives if you wanted to be pedantic about it and it was over the hells vatueil captain vatueil that was his name but he wasnt going to say anything back to them because hed been told not to hed been ordered not to and orders meant you had to do what you were told can you hear me yes he could but he still wouldnt say anything vatueil report thats a direct order that made him feel strange if that was an order then he had to obey it but then he had been ordered not to do anything that somebody else told him not for now not until a superior got here who had the right codes so that meant that what he had just heard wasnt really an order at all it was confusing he wanted just not to listen to what they said he could do that he could shut off comms but he needed to listen so he could track where they were the confusion made a sort of hurt in him he made the thing that he was in check its weapons again counting rounds measuring battery status listening to the energy cells steady reassuring hum and doing a systemsreadiness check that was better doing these things made him feel better doing these things made him feel good he cant hear you that was a different voice saying that the techs say he probably can and he can probably hear you too so watch what you say cant we private channel the different voice no we have to assume he can access them all too so unless you want to bump helmets or use two cups and a string or something watch what you say sheesh the different voice he did not know what sheesh meant listen vatueil this is major qnaywa you know me come on now vatueil you remember me he didnt remember any major qnaywa he didnt remember very much he guessed there was a lot of stuff he felt ought to be there somewhere but which wasnt it gave him a feeling of emptiness like a magazine that should have been full of rounds because it was at the start of a deployment and it was supposed to be full but which wasnt vatueil listen son youve got a problem your download didnt complete youre in the unit but not all of you is in there can you understand that come on son talk to me part of him wanted to talk to the voice of major qnaywa but he wasnt going to major qnaywa did not qualify as a superior because his signal did not come with the codes that would tell him he really was talking to a superior some sort of sign son come on anything he didnt know what the codes were that would tell him he really was talking to a superior which seemed like an odd thing but he was guessing that when he heard them he would know vatueil we know you transferred but we know it didnt work properly thats why youre firing on your own side on us you need to stop doing that do you understand he didnt really understand he sort of understood what they were saying because he knew each of the words and how they went together but it didnt make sense he had to ignore it anyway because the people speaking the words did not have the right codes to be superiors he checked his weapons again he satfloated back maintaining just enough embodiment to ensure longterm sanity ignoring the shared display and instead watching the whole war blossom expand and develop inside his mind seeing it happen in fastforward time after time his attention zooming in on different aspects of its progression with each iteration it looked just like the sims of course except at any given point after it had all started to go wrong the sims had always developed differently better more optimistically wars simmed in the real did the same thing naturally but ultimately they were played out in the real in messy physical reality and so didnt seem to carry the same irony that this war did because it the real war the conflict that actually mattered here the war that would have continual and in a sense everlasting consequences was itself a sim but a sim that was itself easily as complicated and messy as anything in the real still a sim though like the ones theyd used and were still using to plan the war just a bigger one a bigger one that all concerned had agreed to treat as settling matters hence as real as these things ever got that was the war they were losing and that meant that if they were serious about what they had been trying to do and were still trying to do then they were going to have to think about cheating and if cheating didnt work then despite all the accords and laws and customs and regulations despite all the agreements and solemn treaties there was always the truly last resort the real the ultimate cheatinghow the hell did we get into this he asked himself though of course he already knew the answer he knew all the answers everybody did everybody knew everything and everybody knew all the answers it was just that the enemy seemed to know better ones nobody knew who had first developed the ability to transcribe a naturally evolved creatures mindstate various species asserted that they or their ancestors had been the ones responsible but few of the claims were credible and none convincing it was a technology that had been around in some form for billions of years and it was continually being reinvented somewhere out amongst the everchurning stew of matter energy information and life that was the greater galaxy and continually being forgotten too of course lost when ing√©nue civs were in the wrong place at the wrong time and copped a nearby gamma ray buster or a sudden visit from advanced unfriendlies other hopefuls accidentally or by demented design blew themselves up or poisoned themselves or their birthplace or contrived some other usually highly avoidable catastrophe for themselves no matter whether you made it up all by yourself or got the makings from somebody else once it was possible to copy a creatures mindstate you could as a rule if you had the relevant background and the motivation start to make at least part of your religion real vatueil were running out of time here son we need to come in there you need to stand down do you understand you need to offline your let me just see here your aggressive response target acquisition and weapon deployment modules do you think you can do that we dont want to have to come in there and we dont want to have to come in there and treat you like an enemy sir a different different voice it was going to be easier to number them couldnt be dead could it different voice yeah maybe xagao got it different voice with his itsy carbine with one from the halfclip he got off before it blew his fucking arm and both legs off have you seen the specs on this thing different voice it isnt dead he isnt dead hes there and hes listening to everything were saying sir different voice what xagaos dead sir different voice shit okay vatueil listen weve got one man dead out here you understand that you killed him vatueil you dropped our tt and now youve killed one of us tt stood for troop transport now nobodys going to punish you for this we know it wasnt your fault but you have to stand down now before somebody else gets hurt we dont want to have to come in there and disable you ourselves what are you fucking crazy were seven suits against a fucking monster robot space tank piece of shit we wont have a hope in different voice will you shut the fuck up im not telling you again one more word and youre on a fucking charge in fact you are on a fucking charge that thing can hear you you fucking moron and you just gave it our whole fucking status if we do pile in youre now officially leading the fucking charge genius fuck different voice genius shut up vatueil seven there were seven of them that was useful to know almost every developing species had a creation myth buried somewhere in its past even if by the time theyd become spacefaring it was no more than a quaint and dusty irrelevance though granted some were downright embarrassing talking utter drivel about thunderclouds having sex with the sun lonely old sadists inventing something to amuse themselves with a big fish spawning the stars planets moons and your own eversospecial people or whatever other nonsense had wandered into the most likely feverish mind of the enthusiast who had come up with the idea in the first place at least showed you were interested in trying provide an explanation for the world around you and so was generally held to be a promising first step towards coming up with the belief system that provably worked and genuinely did produce miracles reason science and technology the majority of species too could scrape together some sort of metaphysical framework a form of earlier speculation semideranged or otherwise regarding the way things worked at a fundamental level which could later be held up as a philosophy liferule system or genuine religion especially if one used the excuse that it was really only a metaphor no matter how literally true it had declared itself to be originally the harder the haul up the developmental ladder a species had suffered rising from the usual primordial slime of justdawned sentience with only for example the wheel to their name to the dizzy heights and endless cheery sunshine of easy space flight limitless energy amusingly cooperative ais antiageing antigravity the end of disease and other cool tech the more likely it was that that species would have entertained the idea of an immortal soul at some important point in its history and still be carrying the legacy of it now they had escaped the muck and had hit civilisational cruise phase most species capable of forming an opinion on the subject had a pretty high opinion of themselves and most individuals in such species tended to think it was a matter of some considerable importance whether they personally survived or not faced with the inevitable struggles and iniquities attendant upon a primitive life it could be argued that it was an either very gloomy unimaginative breathtakingly stoic or just plain dim species that didnt come up with the idea that what could feel like an appallingly short brutal and terrifying life was somehow not all there was to existence and that a better one awaited them personally and collectively allowing for certain eligibility requirements after death so the idea of a soul usually though not always immortal in its posited nature was a relatively common piece of the doctrinal baggage accompanying a people just making their debut on the great galactic stage even if your civilisation had somehow grown up without the concept it was kind of forced upon you once you had the means of recording the precise dynamic state of someones mind and either placing it directly into the brain of another body or storing it as some sort of scalereduced but still full abstract inside an artificial substrate vatueil captain vatueil im ordering you to reply vatueil report status immediately he was listening but not paying attention he kept checking his weapons and systems each time the voice that called itself major qnaywa said something that made him feel bad or confused okay were running out of time here and i sure as fuck am running out of patience what also made him feel good was looking out through the big curved entrance to the place where he was the place where he was where the thing that he was in was measured metres and was open to vacuum through the big curved entrance which formed one of the short walls it was cluttered with machinery and pieces of equipment that he did not recognise but which he had quickly decided were no threat just useful for cover if he needed it were going to have to go in and do this the hard way oh fuck different voice beautiful perfect day for it different voice were going to fucking die genius sir cant we wait for different voice were not going to fucking die we havent the time to wait for any other fucker control yourselves all of you we do this ourselves remember all that training this is what it was for wasnt that much training sir genius im not even in the right sort of unit im supposed to be in something called an ncme i dont even know what that means frankly different voice oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck different voice maneen shut up son all of you shut up sir different voice maneen gulton that thing of yours delete this motherfucker assuredly sir thought youd never ask sir different voice gulton the unknowns treat as enemy he could hear talking were all on the outside of the abandoned space factory the first one who had come in through the big curved entrance to the place where he was must have been xagao the one who was now dead okay we need a plan here all of you undeploy back towards me until were los and we can use laser to talk without this piece of shit listening in los meant line of sight xagao had silhouetted himself against the bit of the big bright blue and white planet visible beyond the curved entrance vatueil had targeted the silhouetted figure within a millisecond of the initial visual field anomalous movement impulse but he hadnt readied to fire until the figure moving slowly had swept his weapon in his direction then he had sent an identification friendfoe burst towards the figure and simultaneously flicked it with a laser ranging pulse the figure had fired straight at him smallcalibre kinetic rounds approximately nine bullets had clanged into the unidentified highsolidity object use as cover he was hunkered down behind two had hit his own upper weapon nacelle without significant damage and four or five flew overhead to hit the bulkhead behind him producing more clangs he heard through his feet he had fired back a sixburst from his right upper light laser rifle unit registering a direct hit on the weapon he had been targeted by and two more on the lower body of the figure which mostly flipped backwards into cover though one part of it identifiable as a human armoured suit leg had gone spinning away by itself spraying fluid somersaulting rapidly as it headed out towards the bright blue and white planet visible through the big curved entrance xagao get a tlf on the fucker different voice tlf meant target location fix yeah post it when we get los different voice he had felt good firing and hitting and removing a threat made him feel good and something about the spinning leg unit the way it sailed away its trajectory curving gradually as it went before it eventually disappeared made him feel good too hey it ping xagao fore it tanked him anybody know genius hold on yup different voice shut up and get back here if i can hear you so can it sir different voice thats good though the pinging we can use that genius iffed him too different voice really chirpy genius he reviewed the brief engagement with xagao and made two indeployment tactical environment operating behaviour modification immediate instigation memoranda deselect automatic iff challenge deselect initial laser ranging pulse especially once a species or civilisation started swapping ideas and tips with its galactic peers it became fairly easy to do this mind copying and pasting stuff as a result an individual always one favoured in some way either revered or just welloff once the tech was safely past the developmental stage might serially or even concurrently inhabit several or indeed many different bodies some civs tried to use the technology purely as a backup going for full biological immortality with the soulsaving stuff just there in case something went badly wrong and you had to be transferred into a spare body however that tended to lead to shortterm trouble if they kept on breeding as theyd been used to or to more subtle longterm problems if they kept their population growth so curtailed their society basically became stagnant there was always the evertempting profoundly illusory ideal which every intelligent species seemed to think that only it had ever been clever enough to invent of unlimited growth for ever but any attempt to implement such a regime very rapidly ran into the awkward fact that the surrounding material in the galaxy and presumably the universe was already inhabited used claimed protected treasured or even by general agreement owned the longestablished result of this was the irritatingly strict rules the galactic communitys major players and elders had come up with regarding the reasonable allotments of matter and living space a new species might expect it boiled down to you cant have other peoples but it always felt grossly unfair at the time the seemingly wizard wheeze of turning the rest of the universe into teeny little copies of yourself was by no means a nonstarter ignorant people and vainglorious machines started doing it all the time but it was invariably a quicklybroughttoaconclusioner normally especially given how much amazingly rich experience could be crammed into vrs in general and afterlives in particular people went with more modest and neighbourly growth plans in the real and an extensive though still ultimately limited expansion program in the virtual because particularly for those just developing the relevant soulsaving tech that life in virtual environments beckoned seductively deeply immersive and impressive vr was an effectively inevitable adjunct to mindstate transcription technology even if bizarrely it hadnt come into existence before each led to and complemented the other only a few species didnt bother with the soultransference side at all some because thanks to their heritage and development they already had something as good or which they judged made it irrelevant some for specifically religious or philosophical reasons and some most because they were more interested in going for full immortality in the real and regarded mindstate transcription as a distraction or even an admission of defeat of course in any society using this soultranscription gizmology there was usually a diehard strand of true believers who insisted that the only afterlife worth bothering about still happened somewhere else in the true heaven or hell that had always been believed in before all this fangling technology came along but that was a tough position to hold when at the back of your mind was the niggling doubt that you really might not be saved when the time came while at the back of everybody elses mind was a little device that was guaranteed to do precisely that the result was that many many civilisations in the greater galaxy had their own afterlives virtual realities maintained in computational or other substrates to which their dead could go and in some sense at least live on i can see you now sir maneen well space biscuits for you marine switch to los sir sorry i mean maneen there was silence for a while vatueil watched the big section of bright blue and white planet he could see beyond the curved entrance the unknowns treat as enemy were keeping quiet the bit of the planet he could see was changing very slowly all the time he went back and replayed how it had changed since hed taken up position here he subtracted the motion component of the place where he was the place where he was was revolving too but it was revolving slowly and steadily and that made it easy to subtract now he could see that the planet was slowly revolving also the white streaks and whorls which overlay the blue were changing too even more slowly some of the streaks were widening and some were narrowing and the whorls were spinning about their axes and also shifting across the face of the planet even allowing for its revolving he watched the replay of all this movement many times it made him feel good it was different from the way checking his weapons made him feel good it was like the way watching xagaos leg going tumbling off towards the planet had made him feel good especially the way its trajectory had curved it was beautiful beautiful he thought about this word and decided that it was the right word some afterlives simply offered everlasting fun for the postdead infinite holiday resorts featuring boundless sex adventure sport games study exploration shopping hunting or whatever other activities especially tickled that particular species fancy others were as much for the benefit of those still living as the dead themselves providing societies that had inherited or recently come up with the idea of consulting the ancestors with a practical way of doing just that a few were of a more contemplative and philosophic nature than those fixated on general hilarity some and the majority of the more longestablished afterlives featured a sort of gradual fadingaway rather than genuine postdeath vr immortality with the personality of the deceased individual slowly usually over many generations of time in the real dissolving into the general mass of information and civilisational ethos held within the virtual environment in some the dead lived much more quickly than those in the real in others they lived at the same rate and in others far more slowly some even incorporated ways to bring favoured dead individuals back to life again and many still featured death a second final absolute death even within the virtual because as it turned out it was quite a rare species that naturally generated individuals capable of being able or wanting to live indefinitely and those who had lived for a really long time in afterlives were prone to becoming profoundly gravely bored or going catatonically or screaming mad civs new to the game often went into a sort of shock when the first desperate pleas for true real death started to emerge from their expensively created painstakingly maintained assiduously protected and carefully backedup afterlives the trick was to treat such entreaties as perfectly natural and to let the dead have their way he wanted to stay and watch the view of the planet beyond the curved entrance for much longer so that he could see how the whorls and streaks continued to change then he could replay the recording again and again seeing even more of the planet would be good too it would be better seeing all of the planet would be better still it would be best he realised that he was starting to feel uncomfortable he wasnt sure what the cause was at first then understood that it was because he had stayed too long in the one place after a recent combat event he thought about what to do nothing had changed or moved recently it should be safe to move he tried asking his outboard remote sensingengagement units what they could sense but he still didnt have any of these units he was supposed to have these things whatever they were but he didnt it was like another empty magazine that was supposed to be full so proceed otherwise he rose silently on his three articulated legs senses sweeping all around as his upper sensory dome rose into the space beneath the ceiling clearance overhead duly reduced from to metres and gave him an increased field of view he kept both main weapon nacelles targeted at the curved entrance all six secondary weapon pods deployed to cover the rest of the area about him without him needing to tell them to he rotated the upper weapon collar to point nacelle directly behind him where he judged the least risk was as it had expended some energy and taken some damage however nominal still nothing threatening to be sensed he stepped over the unidentified highsolidity object and moved right and forward towards the side of the curved entrance that showed the bright blue and white planet he was moving quietly at less than optimum speed so that when his feet connected with the deck they produced minimal vibration a tipped section of the floor near a long ragged tear in the thick deck material meant that he had to use his weapon pods to balance himself some of the unidentified mediumsolidity objects in the space about him resolved into space and atmospherecapable craft this meant that the place where he was was a hangar most of the craft looked chaotically asymmetric damaged nonviable he could see another unidentified highsolidity object nearer the curved entrance he moved towards it the view of the planet became more extensive and made him feel good beautiful it was still beautiful suddenly something moved against the bright white and blue of the planet nobody knew either what bright little soul had first hit on the idea of linking up two afterlives but given that emerging civilisations were generally quite keen to establish permanent highcapacity highquality and preferably free links with the dataspheres and informational environments of those around them especially those around them with better tech than they possessed it had always been going to happen by accident if not by design it even benefited the dead of both civilisations opening up additional new vistas of exciting postdeath exper ience the better for the deceased to resist the regrettable attraction of a second properly terminal event linking up all amenable and compatible afterlives had become something of a craze almost before the relevant academics could come up with a decent provisional analysis of the phenomenons true cultural meaning and implications practically every corner of the civilised galaxy was linked to every other part by afterlife connections as well as by all the other more usual ties of diplomacy tourism trade general nosiness and so on so for many millions of years there had been a network of afterlives throughout the galaxy semiindependent from the real and constantly changing just as the galactic community in the real changed with civilisations appearing developing steadystating or disappearing either changing beyond recognition relapsing in some way or going for semigodhood sidestepping the material life altogether by opting for the careless indifference that was subliming mostly nobody mentioned the hells the moving thing was tiny too small to be a person in a suit or even an outboard remote sensingengagement unit either his or anybody elses it was moving at metres per second and so was far too slow to be considered kinetic ordinance it was approximately cm by cm round in section conical aspect to the leading quarter spinning he deemed it to be a mm mortar shell he had a lot of highreliability information on such ordnance maximum capability a five kiloton micronuke many variants it was going to fly directly above where he had been positioned and impact on the bulkhead which had been behind him now his hightelescopic vision apparatus had acquired it he could see tiny sensory pits on the thing blurring round as it rotated rps it flew past him five metres away and started to glitter giving off range and combat space topographysensing laser pulses none hit him this was because it had gone past before it activated he was still moving taking one more quiet step as the projectile sailed through the dark space of the hangar he judged that the ingress of the round meant that an attack might be about to start and that his best choice had become to hunker down here still five steps away from the unidentified highsolidity object hed been heading for opting instead for the partial cover of the nearest unidentified mediumsolidity object an additional advantage accruing from the fact that a subroutine assured him his scale and overall shape in hunkered mode would make him look similar to the now identified mediumsolidity object concerned which was a small intact but deactivated highatmosphericlow orbit planetary surface bombardment unit an additional advantage accruing definitely sounded like a good thing it was almost like an order from inside himself hed choose that option he started hunkering down an expert subsystem suggested that should the mortar round detonate where he had been further additional advantage might be accrued that sounded good too the mortar round was travelling so slowly there was plenty of time to work out exactly where he had been to target his left upper light laser rifle unit on the spinning projectile and set himself up for minimal blastfront damage from the direction the round was heading should it prove to be a micronuke when it was directly above where hed been he landed four direct lowpower hits on its rear zero misses or outsplash which made him feel very good he whipped the rifle unit back into the armoured nacelle the mortar round detonated micronuke the hells existed because some faiths insisted on them and some societies too even without the excuse of overindulged religiosity whether as a result of perhaps too faithful a transcription from scriptural assertion to provable actuality or simply an abiding secular need to continue persecuting those thought worthy of punishment even after they were dead a number of civilisations some otherwise quite respectable had built up impressively ghastly hells over the eons these were only rarely linked with other afterlives hellish or otherwise and even then only under strict superveillance and usually only with the aim of heightening the anguish of the sufferers by subjecting them to torments their own people somehow hadnt thought of or the same old ones but inflicted by extragruesome alien demons rather than the more familiar homegrown variety very gradually though perhaps just due to the exact nature of the chance mix the contemporary crop of inplay civilisations represented a sort of network of hells still only partial and remaining strictly controlled in their interactions did emerge and news of their existence and the conditions within them became more widely known this led to trouble in time many species and civilisations objected profoundly to the very idea of hells no matter whose they were a lot objected profoundly to the very idea of torture in any event and the practice of setting up virtual environments traditionally such dazzlingly fabulous realms of unmitigated pleasure devoted to inflicting pain and suffering on sentient creatures seemed not just wrong but perverse sadistic genuinely evil and shamefully disgracefully cruel uncivilised in fact and that was not a word such societies bandied about without having thought carefully about its deployment the culture took a particularly dim view of torture either in the real or in a virtuality and was quite prepared to damage its short and even at least seemingly longterm interests to stop it happening such a devoutly censorious nonpragmatic approach confused people used to dealing with the culture but it was a characteristic that had been there since the civilisations inception so there was little point in treating it as just a temporary moral fad and waiting for it to pass as a result over the millennia the cultures atypically inflexible attitude probably had shifted the whole metacivilisational moral debate on such matters slightly but significantly to the liberal altruistic end of the ethical spectrum that definitive identification of torture with barbarism being perhaps its most obvious mimetic achievement there was a predictable mix of responses a few of the civs hosting hells simply had a think took the point and closed them down generally these were species who had never shown any great enthusiasm for the concept in the first place their number including some who had only adopted the idea at all because theyd got the erroneous impression it was what all upandcoming societies did and they hadnt wanted to appear backward some civilisations just ignored the fuss and said it had nothing to do with anybody else others generally those constitutionally unable to look past any opportunity to go spasming into full high dudgeon mode reacted with hysterical bluster complaining loudly of bullying ethical imperialism grossly unwarranted cultural interference and persecution bordering on outright hostility some of those having made their point and after a decent interval still proved persuadable that hells were un acceptable but not all the hells remained as did the discord they engendered even so now and again a civ was effectively bribed out of continuing to host hells usually with tech that was a bit beyond it in the normal course of development though that was a tricky precedent to set in case it encouraged others to try the same trick just to get their hands on the relevant toys so it remained a strategy that had to be used sparingly a few of the more militantly altruistic civs tried to hack into the hells belonging to those they saw as their more barbaric peers to free or destroy the tormented souls within but that carried its own dangers and a couple of small wars had resulted eventually though a war was agreed upon as the best way to settle the whole dispute the vast majority of protagonists on both sides agreed they would fight within a controlled virtuality overseen by impartial arbiters and the winner would accept the result if the prohell side won there would be no more sanctions or sanctimoniousness from the antihell faction and if the antihellists triumphed then the hells of the participating adversaries would be shut down both sides thought they would win the antihell side because they were generally more advanced an advantage that would be partially reflected in the simmed war and the prohell side because they were convinced they were the less decadent more intrinsically warlike side they also had a couple of hidden assets in the shape of civs who nobody knew had been hosting hells but who had been persuaded to come on board and who just about it was decided after a lengthy legal case qualified due to the way the relevant agreement had been worded naturally also both sides were convinced they had right on their side not that either was remotely naive enough to think that that had any possible bearing on the outcome whatsoever battle was joined it duly raged to and fro across the vast virtual conflict spaces within the scrupulously and multiply policed substrates allotted to it overseen by a people called the ishlorsinami a species long notorious for their absolute incorruptibility spartan lifestyles near complete lack of humour and a sense of fairness that struck most other normal civs as positively pathological but now the war was nearing its end and to vatueil it looked like his side was going to lose it was a micronuke but lowyield disposable sensor units deployed on his armoured main weapon nacelles his upper sensory dome was retracted beneath its armour clamshell watched what happened three submunitions had deployed an instant before the main warhead had exploded fanning downwards towards the floor where hed been hunkered earlier it was hard to be sure but he thought that he the thing he was in would have survived had he still been there the floor beneath him thudded there was much damage where he had been the bulkhead behind was holed the ceiling above perforated bulging upwards now dipping back down glowing white and yellow hot as heated supporting elements gave in to the apparent gravity the abandoned space factorys rotation provided the unidentified highsolidity object hed been hiding behind earlier had been partially vaporiseddestroyed and shifted across the floor of the hangar until it had impacted with the section of tipped alreadydamaged floor still there different voice hit it gulton a bright yellowwhite line lanced down from where the ceiling had been smashing into the hangar deck where vatueil had been positioned earlier and creating an exploding white ball of plasma this blew outward in a boiling cloud behind a wavefront of condensing particles of molten metals metrescale yellowglowing fragments of the floor went tumbling everywhere at various speeds mostly high he saw one piece somersaulting towards him bouncing once off the floor and once off the ceiling he did not have enough time to move perhaps if he had not been hunkered down he might have been able to avoid it the piece of wreckage impacted hard on the armoured body of the thing he was inside it impacted badly too not a flat side or even an edge hit first but a jagged point it smacked into his top off centre so that it halfspun him and sent the piece of wreckage spinning into the shoulder section of his left main weapon pod everything shook damage control screenspreads filled his field of vision there was a further impact from above it was relatively slow implicitly high inertia crushing fuck you motherfucker fuck you fuck you fuck you genius sir ordnance discharged sir gulton fuck me i think my anal plug just exited my fucking suit different voice oh thats spatted that is one spatted shitfuck of an armoured combat unit different voice got to have done it got to have fucking done it take fucking that you miserable threelegged space tank motherfucker genius last one ins an officer no offence sir different voice steady just hold those things are tough he was injured the machine he was in was now suboptimal it was called an armoured combat unit the protective clamshell had taken a serious kinetic hit and was refusing to open disabling the upper sensory dome his left main weapon nacelle had been torn off by the same piece of wreckage four secondary weapon pods were nonoperational and the upper secondary weapon collar had jammed something had damaged his main power distribution unit too he didnt know how that had happened but it had now he couldnt move his legs properly some secondary power left in his number one leg that was all difficult to estimate how much power or leverage was available some piece of heavy equipment from the ceiling above the source of the earlier highinertia impact appeared to be pinning him to the deck additionally the condensing metals from the plasma event seemed to have spotwelded some parts of himself to some other parts of himself and some parts of himself to the hangar floor he rotated another set of disposable sensors into place on the right shoulder this would be all he had to work with for now he would have to stay where he was he could still turn though there was a grinding sensation when he did and he could not turn smoothly which contraindicated trackingfiring he couldnt see much the lower sensory dome was obstructed by the squat cage of his immobile legs okay trooper drueser you have the honour i believe sir genius drueser the figure came in through the curved entrance bouncing on all fours and keeping very low to the hangar deck a medium kinetic rifle tripodded on its back barrel sweeping back and forth vatueil let it go well past him almost to the tipped torn part of the hangar floor then quietly lobbed a superblack snowflake grenade just behind it the magnetic launcher produced no exhaust the superblack coating kept the projectile stealthed and it was too dark for the trooper to have much chance of seeing the round curving towards him through the vacuum he launched a second round aimed to fall right on top of the suited figure if it stopped about now the first grenade hit the deck two metres behind the trooper then detonated with a flash and a floorthud the figure had stopped and spun round the trooper was caught inside the hail of millimetre and centimetrescale fragments there was a shriek drueser the backmounted gun fired twice at where the first grenade had detonated then the second grenade landed it was supposed to fall right on top of the figure but landed half a metre to its left side and half a metre in front it because of his own sensorcompromised aiming and the fact that the trooper had been blown backwards by the fragment shower from the first grenade the second grenade had been set to detonate on contact the detonation caused the figures head to kick back it also tore off and then disintegrated druesers helmet visor causing an obvious pressureloss event the figure collapsed to the floor without further movement or transmitted sound drueser fuck different voice drueser sir i think he triggered something a suckertrap that things still dead must be different voice sir the real bad guys are due to get here awful soon now we need to be in there even if its just to hide gulton aware of that gulton you want to be next sir me and koviuk thought we might favour the skirmish space below with our twin presences sir gulton bmg gulton he didnt know what bmg meant the two figures dropped through the hole in the ceiling their dark suits were made briefly bright by the orange glow still coming from the slagged materials of what had been the hangar ceiling and the floor of the deck above vatneil could have hit both of them but he had heard what they had said and he thought that what it meant was that they thought he was dead if that was true then it was better to let them think that and to bring them all into the same immediate tactical environment as he was in the better to attack and destroy them trapeze came the call it was not a surprise vatueil had been thinking of making it himself he left a shell presence of himself in the primary strategic situation overview space and navigated to the trapeze space scattering passcodes and decoys like petals there were five of them they sat on what looked like trapezes hanging in utter darkness the wires vanished upwards into the black and there was no sign or implication of any floor below or wall to any side it was meant to symbolise the isolation of the secret space or something he had no idea what theyd have chosen had one of their number had a highgravity heritage and been congenitally terrified of any drop more than a few millimetres theyd all taken up different appearances to be here but he knew who the other four were and trusted them completely just as he hoped they trusted him he had shown up as a furred quadruped with big eyes and three powerful fingers at the end of each of his four limbs they all tended to present as the sort of multilimbed creature which had evolved in gravity in trees he knew how strange this must feel to the two water worlders he knew were present but it was the sort of thing you got used to in vr they took on colours to distinguish themselves he was red as usual he looked round at all of them were losing he announced you always say that said yellow i didnt when we werent he replied when i realised we were i started saying so depressing yellow said looking away losing often is green said it is starting to look kind of nongetoutable purple agreed with a sigh purple held onto the supporting sidewires and started rocking back and forth making its trapeze oscillate slowly so next level said green their exchanges had become terse over the last few meetings theyd talked exhaustively about the situation and the choices it left them with it was just a question of waiting for the voting balance to change or for some of their number to become so frustrated with the process and the whole trapeze setup that they formed another even more exclusive subcommittee and took matters into their own hands they had all pledged not to do this but you never entirely knew they all looked at blue blue was the waverer blue had been voting no to going to what they usually called the next level until now but had made no secret of being the one of the three naysayers who was most likely to change his her or its mind as circumstances altered blue scratched itself about the groin with one longfingered hand then sniffed at its fingers they had each made their own choices about how closely their treedwelling images stuck to the sort of behaviour the real thing got up to back in the jungle blue sighed as soon as he saw just how blue sighed vatueil knew they had won blue looked regretfully at yellow and purple im sorry it told them truly i am purple shook its head started picking at its fur looking for who knew what yellow let out an exasperated whoop and did a backward circle dismount falling silently into the darkness beneath becoming a yellow scrap which quickly disappeared entirely its abandoned trapeze swung in a wild jerking dance green reached out and steadied it with one hand and looked down into the abyss not bothering with a formal vote then it said quietly for what its worth purple said disconsolately i agree too it looked round them while each was still watching for the reactions of the others but i do so not in protest but mainly in a spirit of solidarity and out of despair i think well come to regret this decision it looked down again none of us does this lightly green said so he said we go to the next level yes blue said we cheat we hack we infiltrate we sabotage green said those are war skills too lets not make excuses for ourselves purple muttered were still breaking an oath wed all rather have achieved victory with our honour fully intact green said sternly but our options now are either an honourable defeat or the sacrifice of our honour for at least a chance of victory however achieved the outcome justifies the sacrifice if it works there are no guarantees in war green said oh there are blue said quietly looking away into the darkness its just that they guarantee death destruction suffering heartache and remorse they were all silent for a moment alone with their own thoughts then green rattled the wires of its trapeze enough we must plan to the details they hadnt seen him two were where the plasma event had taken place one was at the body of the trooper drueser one was somewhere he couldnt see and the other two knelt just ten metres away almost in front of him twelve metres in from the curved entrance bit of the fucker over here one of his armweapon pods different voice the two kneeling in front of him looked round almost at him that was helpful telling him where trooper different voice might currently be fuck all over here sir gulton one of the two kneeling figures had continued to look in his direction after the other had turned away again he appeared to be looking straight at him is that another bit under that it was the one who had said he was major qnaywa his gun had started to level pointing straight at him he fired both his available laser rifles at the two kneeling men achieving multiple hits with high outsplash but minimal reflectivity and several observedpiercing hits though the major qnaywa figure was partially shielding the one behind who was probably different voice he followed up with a couple of antiarmoured personnellight armoured vehicle minimissiles at the same time he swung his remaining main weapon nacelle round to target the part of the hangar where hed been earlier and where gulton and koviuk were now he used the railgun set to scatter tiny hyperkinetic rounds made a disintegrating haze out of the tipped section of floor the bulkheads and ceiling as the main weapon nacelle had deployed it had roughly tracked across the location of the trooper kneeling by the body of trooper drueser so hed loosed a trio of general purpose high explosivefragmentation subscale missiles towards them then he lobbed five more subscales towards the centre of the railguns targeting area cutting their engines off almost as soon as they exited the weapon nacelle so that they fell into the part of the target area he couldnt see from the start he had been pumping round after round of snowflake heatseeker emissionhoming and movementprimed grenades overhead guessing at where different voice might be behind him in the hangar some of the grenades ricocheted off the ceiling but that did not really matter the trooper major qnaywa and the figure behind him disappeared in the twin explosions of the minimissiles unidentifiable gurgling screams might have been gulton and koviuk they cut off quickly as the railgun rounds continued to eat away at the bulkheads floor and ceiling the subscales erupted in the centre of the hangar creating a billowing cloud of gasses and debris the two troopers one of them drueser who was already dead vanished in the fireballs the lobbed subscales landed in a spread in what was left of the hangars rear corner filling it with a brief haze of plasma gas and shrapnel he stopped firing railgun magazine depleted by per cent debris trajectoried impacted ricocheted fell back tumbled slid became still the gasses dissipated mostly through the wide curved entrance that framed the view of the big bright blue and white planet outside no transmissions the only traces of the troopers he could see were ambiguous in nature and quite small after nearly nine minutes he used what power he had in his single operational leg trying to lift himself free from whatever was pinning him the attempt failed and he knew he was trapped he thought there was a high likelihood he had not killed the trooper whod been somewhere in the hangar behind him but his attempt to rise which had caused some movement of the wreckage around and over him attracted no further hostile attention he sat there and waited wishing he could see the beautiful planet better others arrived half an hour later they were different troopers with different suits and weapons they didnt have the correct iff codes either so he fought them too by the time he was blown out of the hangar entrance in a cloud of plasma he was completely blind almost without any senses only his internal heat sensors and a feeling that he was experiencing a faint but gradually increasing force from one particular direction once he allowed for the fact he was tumbling told him he was falling into the atmosphere of the beautiful bright white and blue planet the heat increased rapidly and started to leak into his power and processing core through piercingdamage channels sustained in the engagement just passed his processor suite would shut down or melt in eighteen no eleven no nine seconds eight seven no three two one his last thought was that it would have been nice to have seen the beautiful he returned to the simulation within a simulation that was the primary strategic situation overview space in trapeze they had discussed the initial details of plans that might end the war one way or the other here they were still reviewing and rereviewing the same old territory they had been fretting over when hed left one of your old stamping grounds isnt it vatueil one of the others in the high command said as they watched the irrelevancy of the war amongst these tumbling rocks and lumps of ice replay itself rocket exhausts plumed in the darkness amongst the billions of orbiting fragments munitions blazed forces swept back and forth is it he said then he recognised it he had been many things in this war he had died within the simulations many times some failing of character or application on his part occasionally contributing to his end more usually the mistakes of those above him in the command structure or just the need for sacrifice providing all of the cause how many lifetimes had he spent waging war he had lost count long ago of course here in the kingdom of the dead engaged in a seemingly neverending fight over the fate of the souls of the departed further deaths were no barrier to continuance after each death in service the soldiers achievements were reviewed by panels of his peers and other expert minds had he been brave cool under fire resourceful according to the answers lessons were learned soldiers reincarnated to fight again rose fell or maintained their position in the ranks depending on how well they were judged to have done and military practice itself changed gradually in response to the same adjudication gradually at first vatueil had worked his way up through the hierarchy even where his contribution ended in death failure and defeat he was found to have done the best he could have done with what resources and advantages hed started with and most especially to have shown imagination in his decisions his very first incarnation in the war effort had given every indication of being a disaster not even knowing that he was in a simulation having no idea what he was really fighting for he had been a military tunneller who had turned traitor been tortured and then died still he had thought to walk through the poison gas rather than try to outrun it which had counted in his favour and the fact that such a previously stalwart and dependable soul had chosen to take his chances with the enemy rather than immediately try to get back to his own side had counted more against those in charge of that aspect of the battle space than it had against him and helped convince those then running the war at a higher level that much of it was being waged too harshly and with too great an emphasis on secrecy and yes here in this open maze of broken moons drifting rocks abandoned facilities and empty factories many generations of combatants ago he had been part of the struggle again even though he had ended up fighting all too successfully against his own people that had not been his fault he had not even been his complete self in that instance some alltoobelievable glitch within the recreated scenario meaning that his download into the combat unit had been only partial leaving it crippled inside not knowing who was friend and who was foe still even reduced his essence had fought well displayed imagination and shown some glimmerings of trying to develop that had been worth another promotion yet here was that same place still disputed not all the subsequent battles throughout and amongst the somersaulting cascade of rocky debris and the orbiting industrial wasteland of deserted infrastructure wheeling round the systems planets had produced a decisive victory for either side he looked at it remembering wondering what other troopers like his old self still laboured fought and died there we need a decision the group leader for this watch said pursue hold abandon her disembodied head looked round all the others at once fixing her gaze on each simultaneously because in the sim of course you could do this he voted abandon though he was not convinced abandon was the decision by just the one vote he felt a sort of despairing elation and wondered if that contradictory mix was also something only possible in a sim it had been so long since hed been properly alive he was no longer sure it didnt matter they would abandon the battle for the simulated asteroids and the simulated orbiting facilities in this particular simulated system in this particular simulated version of this particular simulated era in this particular simulated galaxy he felt that he should feel bad about this but did not what was one more betrayal amongst so many nine to build on such a scale would have been spectacular enough she thought that this thing was not unique that it was not that special that it was one of a class was moderately astounding that it was some way from being one of the largest class was completely astounding that it could move bewilderingly un really quickly in a realm hidden at right angles to everything she had ever known or experienced was beyond belief she sat with her legs dangling over the edge of a thousandmetre cliff and watched the various craft at play fliers of too many shapes and types to be sure they were not each unique the smallest carrying only one man woman or child buzzed and fussed above below before and on each side larger craft floated with a stately grace their appearance varied motley and near chaotic with masts pennants exposed decks and bulbously glittering excrescences but their general structure approaching a sort of bloated uniformity the greater in size they were they drifted on the unhurried breezes the vast crafts internal meteorology created true ships spacecraft generally more sober in form if not in decoration moved with still greater deliberation often accompanied by small squatlooking tugcraft that looked hewn from solid the canyon in front of her was fifteen kilometres long its laserstraight edges softened by the multicoloured mass of climbing hanging and floating foliage draped spilling like gaudy icefalls from the tops of the two great strakes on either side the sheer walls were diced with a breathtaking complexity of variously sized mostly brightly lit apertures from or into a few of which on occasion the various air and spacecraft issued or disappeared the whole staggering intricate network of docks and hangars graphed onto each colossal escarpment representing a mere detail on the surface of this truly gigantic vessel the floor of the great canyon was near tableflat grassland strung all about with meandering streams making their way to a hazy plain kilometres ahead above beyond filmy layers of pale cloud a single bright yellowwhite line provided light and warmth looping dayslow across the sky in place of a sun it disappeared into the misty distance of the view in front of her it was almost noon by the ships own time and so the sunline stood near directly overhead at her back behind a low wall in the parkland that covered the vessels topmost surface people passed tumbling waters could be heard and tall distant trees stood on gentle rolling hills dotted amongst the trees long vertical bands of pale almost transparent vegetation rose into the air each soaring to two or three times the height of the tallest trees and surmounted by a dark ovoid the size of the crowns of the trees beneath dozens of these strange shapes swayed to and fro in the breeze oscillating together like some vast seaweed forest lededje and sensia were sitting on the naturallooking cliff edge of dark red rock their backs to the low wall of undressed stone looking straight down lededje could just about make out the filaments of a sort of gauzy net five or six metres down that would catch you if you fell it didnt really look up to the job she thought but shed been prepared to trust sensia when shed suggested sitting here ten metres to her right a stream launched out into the air from a spur of rock its separating whitening spray fell only fifty metres or so before it was unceremoniously gathered up by half of a giant inverted cone of what looked like glass and funnelled into a transparent pipe that plunged straight down towards the valley floor it was almost a relief to see that like so many other seemingly exotic extraordinary and fabulous things at least part of the gsvs functional glamour ended up expressing itself as plumbing this was the culture general systems vehicle sense amid madness wit amongst folly the ship whose avatoid sensia she had addressed when shed first woken up within its near infinite substrate of thinking material another version of sensia small thin spry bronzeskinned and barely clothed sat by her side this personification of the ship was properly called an avatar she had brought lededje here to give her an idea of the size of the ship that she represented that she in some sense was shortly they would board one of the small aircraft gliding buzzing and blattering about them presumably so that any tiny remaining fragment of lededje that was not dumbfounded beyond imagining at the mindboggling scale of the ship she was on a labyrinth within a jungled threedimensional maze without could join all the other parts of her that already most profoundly were lededje dragged her gaze away from the sight and stared down at her own hand and arm so well here she was revented as they called it her soul the very essence of her being rehoused as of only an hour or so ago in a new body and a fresh new body she was relieved to know not one that had belonged to anybody else she had originally imagined that such bodies were the result of people guilty of terrible crimes being punished by having their personalities removed from the brains such bodies housed leaving them free to host anothers mind she inspected the tiny almost transparent hairs on her forearm and the pores on the goldenbrown skin beneath this was a humanbasic body roughly though very convincingly amended to look like that of a sichultian looking closely at individual hairs and pores she suspected that her eyesight was better than it had been originally there was a level of detail visible that made her head swim she supposed that it was always possible she had been lied to and she was still within a virtual reality where such zoomingin was almost easier to do than it was to limit she flicked her gaze out again to the kilometres of dazzling view in front of her of course even this might exist within a simulated environment modelling such a vast ship within even the most detailed image of reality must be easier than actually building one and certainly any people capable of constructing such a vessel could command the relatively trivial computational resources necessary to create an utterly convincing simulation of what she could see and hear and feel and smell before her now it could always all be unreal how could you ever tell otherwise you took it on trust in part because what would be the point of doing anything else when the fake behaved exactly like the real why treat it as anything different you gave it the benefit of the doubt until something proved otherwise waking in this real body had been similar to waking up within the fake body imagined in the great ships substrate she had experienced a slow pleasant comingto the warm fuzziness of what had felt like deep satisfying sleep changing slowly to the clarity and sharpness of a wakefulness informed by the knowledge that something had profoundly changed embodied shed thought embodiment was all sensia had told her ironically while they were talking in the virtual an intelligence completely dissociated from the physical or at least an impression of it was a strange curiously limited and almost perverse thing and the precise form that your physicality took had a profound in some ways defining influence on your personality she had opened her eyes and found herself in a bed of what looked like snowflakes felt like feathers and behaved like particularly obedient and welldisposed insects white as snow but nearly as warm as her skin the material had seemed unconstrained by any enveloping cover and yet the apparently freefloating individual elements had refused to get in her eyes up her nose or to leave the confines of the bed and the few centimetres around both it and her pyjamaclad body beyond the bed had been a modest sparsely furnished room three or four metres to a side with one windowwall looking out onto a brightly lit balcony where she could see sensia sitting in one of two chairs the avatar had gazed out at the view for a few more moments before turning to her and smiling welcome to the land of the living shed said waving one hand get dressed well have some lunch and then well go exploring so now here they sat with lededje trying to take in what she was seeing she looked back at her arm again she had chosen pale purple blouson pants cuffed tight at the ankle and a filmy but opaque longsleeved top of the same colour sleeves rolled back to the elbows she looked pretty good allinall she thought the average culture human from what she could gather having seen a few hundred of them now in passing and disregarding the outlandish outliers as it were was hardly taller than a wellfed sichultian but illproportioned legs too short back too long and emaciatedlooking bellies and behinds uncomfortably flat shoulders and upper back looking almost broken she supposed to them she looked humpbacked potbellied and bigbottomed but no matter to her she looked exactly almost perfectly right and a beauty which was what she had always been and had always been destined to be with or without the celllevel markings that had invested her body down to the bone and beyond she had no more false modesty she realised than sensia than the ship itself lededje looked up from her arm i think id like some form of tat she told sensia tattooing the avatar said easily done though we can definitely do better than just permanently marking your skin unless thats what you specifically want what for example take a look sensia waved one arm and in front of them and hanging over the thousandmetre drop a series of images appeared of culture humans displaying tattoos even more fabulous than her own had been at least at skin level here were tattoos that genuinely shone rather than just glowed a little or could reflect tattoos that moved that lased that could loop out to create real or hologramatic structures beyond the surface of the skin itself tattoos that were not just works of art but ongoing performances have a think sensia said lededje nodded thank you i shall she looked out at the view again behind them on the path on the far side of the low wall a small group of people passed they were talking the cultures own language marain which lededje too could now speak and understand though not without a certain deliberation sichultian formal was still what came naturally to her and was what she and sensia were speaking now you know that i need to get back to sichult she said business to conclude sensia said nodding when would i be able to leave how about tomorrow she looked at the avatars brazen skin it looked false as though she was made of metal not genuine flesh and bone lededje supposed that was the idea her own skin was not so different in tone from a distance she and sensia might have looked quite similar in colour but from close up hers would appear natural both to a sichultian and even she was sure this motley assortment of strangelooking people that would be possible well you could make a start youre some distance away itll take a while how long sensia shrugged depends on a lot of things many tens of days id guess less than a hundred though id hope she made a gesture with her hands lededje guessed was meant to signal regret or apology cant take you myself way off my course schedule in fact at the moment were heading sort of tangentially away from the enablement space oh lededje hadnt realised this then the sooner i get started the better ill put the word out to the ships see whos interested sensia said however there is a condition a condition she wondered if there was after all some form of payment expected let me be honest with you lededje sensia said with a quick smile please she said we i strongly suspect that you may be returning to sichult with murder in your heart lededje said nothing for as long as it took for her to realise that the longer she left it to respond the more like agreement that silence seemed why do you think that she asked trying to imitate sensias level friendly matteroffact tone oh come now lededje the avatar chided ive done a little research the man murdered you she waved one hand casually perhaps not in cold blood but certainly when you were completely helpless this is a man who has had complete control over you since before you were born who forced your family into servitude and had you marked for ever as a chattel engraved like a highdenomination banknote made out specifically to him you were his slave you tried to run he hunted you like an animal caught you and when you resisted he killed you now you are free of him and free of the marks that identified you as his but with a free pass back to where he probably imagining that you are entirely dead still is quite unsuspecting sensia turned to lededje at this point swivelling not just her head but her shoulders and upper body so that the younger woman could not pretend not to have noticed lededje turned too less gracefully as sensia still smiling lowered and slowed her voice ever so slightly and said my child you would not be human panhuman sichultian or anything else if you didnt positively ache for revenge lededje heard all this but did not immediately react there is more she wanted to say there is more it is not just about revenge but she couldnt say that she looked away kept staring at the view what would the condition be then she asked sensia shrugged we have these things called slapdrones oh yes she had vaguely heard of drones they were the cultures equivalent of robots though they looked more like items of luggage than anything else some of the tinier things floating in the great hazy view in front of them were probably drones she already didnt like the idea of a variety with the word slap in its title theyre things that stop people doing something they probably ought not to do sensia told her they just accompany you she shrugged sort of an escort if it thinks youre about to do something objectionable like hit somebody or try to kill them or something itll stop you stop how sensia laughed well just shout at you at first probably but if you persist itll physically get in the way deflect a blow or push aside a gun barrel or whatever ultimately though theyre entirely entitled to zap you drop you unconscious if need be no pain or damage of course but who decides on this what court lededje asked she felt suddenly hot and was acutely aware that on her new paler skin a flush might show as a visible blush the court of me lededje sensia said quietly with a small smile lededje glanced at then looked away from really on whose authority she could hear the smile in the avatars voice on the authority of me being part of the culture and my judgement on such matters being accepted by other parts specifically other minds of the culture immediately because i can ultimately so even in the culture might is right lededje said bitterly she started rolling her sleeves down feeling suddenly chilled intellectual might i suppose sensia said gently as i was about to say though ultimately my right to impose a slapdrone on you comes down to the principle that it is what any set of morally responsible conscious entities machine or human would choose to do were they in possession of the same set of facts as i am however part of my moral responsibility to you is to point out that you are free to publicise your case there are specialist news services whod certainly be interested and you being relatively exotic and from somewhere we have few dealings with even the general news services might be interested too then there are specialist legal procedural jurisdictional behavioural diplomatic she shrugged again and probably even philosophical interest groups whod love to hear about something like this youd definitely find somebody whod argue your case and whod i be appealing to you the court of informed public opinion sensia said this is the culture kid thats the court of last resort if i was convinced id made a mistake or even if i thought i was right but everybody else appeared to think otherwise i guess id reluctantly have to abandon the slapdrone thing being a ship mind id take more notice of what other ship minds thought then other minds in general then ais humans drones and others though of course as this would be a dispute ultimately about a humans rights id have to give more than usual weight to the human vote it sounds a little complicated but there are all sorts of wellknown precedents and muchused highly respected processes involved sensia dipped forward and looked round at lededje trying to get her to look at her though lededje refused look lededje i dont mean to make it sound offputting at all the whole process would seem incredibly quick and informal to somebody with your background and understanding of the way courts and legal systems work and you wouldnt have to stay aboard me to see it through you could start back for home and see how things turn out while youre en route i say it would seem informal but itd be extremely thorough and frankly much less likely to produce an unjust result than a similar case going through the courts you have back home if youd like to do this please feel free at any time its your right personally i dont think youd have a hope in hell of getting off the slapdrone thing but one never entirely knows with such matters and continually having seemingly obvious judgements challenged is pretty much how the system works lededje thought about this how secret has me being brought back to life been until now right now its just between you and me given that i cant find the me im counting the ship that were assuming put the neural lace into your head in the first place only after shed done it did lededje realise shed put one hand to the back of her head as soon as sensia had mentioned a lace her fingertips moved through the soft short fair hair covering her scalp tracing the contours of her own skull shed been offered another neural lace before shed been woken up in this new body shed said no and was still unsure why shed made that choice anyway one could be installed later even if the process required time to come to fully functioning fruition that was what had happened with the last one after all what might have happened to the ship she asked she had a sudden recollection of himerance sitting in the seat in her bedroom dimly lit talking quietly to her ten years earlier happened to it sensia sounded surprised oh itll be off on a retreat probably or wandering aimlessly tramping the galaxy or doggedly pursuing some weird obsession all of its own either way all it needs is to stop telling people where it is and it disappears off the screens ships do that especially old ships she snorted especially old ships that saw active service in the idiran war theyre very prone to going eccentric so ships dont get slapdroned she tried to sound sarcastic oh but they do if theyre especially strange or of a certain capital substance a major ship sensia leaned in close and said ship like me went eccentric once or seemed to can you imagine she said pretending horror as she nodded out at the view something this size went totally off the rails in a crisis and shook off the ship detailed to be its slapdrone and how did that end sensia shrugged not too badly could have been a bit better could have been an awful lot worse lededje thought a little more then i think ill just have to accept your judgement she turned and smiled smoothly at the avatar i dont accept that its necessary but ill acquiesce sensia wore an expression of regret and a small frown though you should know lededje said fighting to keep her voice under control that there is no possibility of the man who killed me being brought to justice for what he did to me let alone suffering any punishment for it he is a very charming very powerful but completely evil man he is utterly selfish and selfcentred and due to his position he can and does get away with anything anything at all he deserves to die it would absolutely be the correct moral thing to do to kill joiler veppers my personal grievance against him set entirely aside if i am going back to my home with murder in my heart as you put it then you are making exactly the wrong moral choice in deciding to protect him i understand how you feel lededje the avatar said i doubt it well i certainly understand the force of what youre saying please accept that at least its just not my place to pass judgement at such a remove on somebody i have no conceivable moral jurisdiction over the culture never interferes in other societies lededje said trying to sound scornful it was one of the few things she could recall having heard about the culture back in sichult its people were hopelessly effeminate or unnaturally aggressive females the story changed according to exactly which aspect of the cultures alleged demeanour the sichultian press and establishment wanted to portray as shocking depraved or despicable it didnt use money and it was ruled by its giant robot ships that interfered in other civilisations despite herself she could feel tears welling up behind her eyes good grief yes were interfering all the time the avatar admitted but its all carefully thought out longterm managed and theres always got to be some strategic goal thatll benefit the people being interfered with sensia looked away for a moment well usually thats not to say things dont go awry on occasion she looked back at lededje but thats all the more reason to take care especially when this is a person of such importance with such a degree of fame notoriety or whatever and with control over so much of your civilisations productive so his position his money protects him even here lededje protested trying hard not to cry now im sorry sensia said thats the reality of the situation we dont make your rules as an alien being he has as much right as anybody else has not to have me collude in any plot against his life as a focus of power within your society anything that happens to him matters more than it does to almost anybody else it would be irresponsible not to take that into account even if i did share your desire to kill him what chance would i have anyway lededje said sniffing and looking away im no assassin i could happily kill him but ive no particular skill in such matters my only advantage is i know something of his estates and houses and the people who surround him she raised her hand studied its back and front and i dont look like i used to look so i might have a chance of getting close to him i imagine hes well protected sensia said she paused for a moment yes i see that he is your news services seem most taken with these cloned people the zei lededje thought to say something to the effect that jasken was the real bodyguard veppers true last line of defence but then thought the better of it best not be seen to be thinking in such terms she sniffed some more wiping her nose on her hand you dont have to go back lededje sensia said gently you could stay here make a new life in the culture lededje used the heels of her hands to dry round her eyes you know for almost as long as i can remember that was the one thing i wanted she said she glanced at sensia who looked puzzled all those years all those times i tried to run away the one thing nobody ever asked me was where i might be running to she smiled a small thin smile at the avatar who looked surprised now if they had asked lededje told her i might even have told them i was running away to the culture because id heard theyd escaped the tyranny of money and individual power and that all people were equal here men and women alike with no riches or poverty to put one person above or beneath another but now youre here sensia offered sounding sad but now im here i find joiler veppers is still deferred to because he is a rich and powerful man she took a deep shuddering breath and i find i need to return because that is my home like it or not and i must make my peace with it somehow she looked sharply at sensia then i might come back would i be allowed to come back youd be allowed lededje nodded once and looked away they were both silent for a few moments then sensia said slapdrones can be quite useful companions anyway willing and obedient servants bodyguards too so long as you dont try to kill or injure somebody ill choose you a good one im sure well get on just fine lededje said she wondered how easy it would be to lose a slapdrone or to kill it too yime nsokyi stood in the main room of her apartment her stance upright her booted feet together her head slightly back her hands clasped behind her back she was dressed formally in long dark grey boots grey trousers a light blouse and a plain grey jacket with a stiff high collar she had a pen terminal in the breast pocket of the jacket and a backup terminal in the shape of an earbud attached to the lobe of her left ear her hair was very neatly combed ms nsokyi hello good day you look very poised wouldnt you rather sit i prefer to stand okay the avatar of the gcu bodhisattva oaqs had appeared displaced apparently in front of her a moment earlier its coming heralded half an hour before by the call shed received she had had time to dress and compose herself the avatar took the form of an oldlooking drone nearly a metre long half that across and a quartermetre in height it floated at eye level i shall take it we may dispense with any pleasantries it said that would be my choice yime agreed i see in that case are you ready to yime flexed her knees picked up a small soft bag at her feet and stood again fully she said okay then the avatar and the human female disappeared inside two silver ellipsoids which had hardly appeared before they shrank to two points and vanished not quite fast enough to create two tiny claps of thunder but sufficiently quickly to cause a draught that ruffled the leaves of nearby plants prin awoke from the long and terrible real nightmare of his time in hell and found chay his true love gazing over at him as he lay blinking on the clinic bed he was on his side looking at her she was on her other side on a bed a metre away facing him her eyes blinked slowly it had taken a while for him to register where he was who this person looking over at him was even who he himself was at first all he knew was that he was somewhere vaguely medical that he felt something very sweet and special for the female lying opposite and that he had done something important and terrifying hell he had been in hell they had been in hell he and chay they had gone in there to prove that it was real not a myth and that it was a vile perverted version of an afterlife a place of unredeemed cruelty impossible to defend in any civilised society they had sought to witness this and then to bring the evidence back and do what they could to make it public get it disseminated as widely as possible defying the state the government the politicalcommercial establishment and all the various vested interests which wanted their hell all the hells to continue now here they were back in the real the two of them he couldnt quite speak yet he was lying on this bed in what certainly looked like the clinic they had left from with chay on the bed opposite his they had transferred their personalities into electronic or photonic form or whatever it was he had never been interested in the technical details and they had set out together for hell he could hear faint beeping noises and see various pieces of medical equipment and communications gear stationed around their two beds prin youre back a voice said he recognised the voice or at least knew that he ought to know who the speaker was a male came into view he did recognise him irkun he was called irkun and he was the mediccumcommswizard who had been overseeing the transfer of their personalities their beings from their own bodies through the communications network to wherever the staterun link to hell was and then on to the hell itself and back of course that was the point they had to come back and so theyd been sent with lengths of code attached that would let them come back in the hell these had been disguised as necklaces of barbed wire they gave the wearer one brief spell to impersonate one of the more powerful and privileged demons within the hell and one chance to get back out of the virtual world back to the real he remembered the blue glowing gate and the mill and the valley side with the xshaped devices bearing the rotting corpses blue glowing gate and his desperate leap holding her tumbling in the air somersaulting so that he went through first her in his limbs immediately afterwards if possible you made it irkun said clapping both trunks together he was dressed like a medic white waistcoat tail bunned and pinned hooves in little white bootees youre back you made it and chay is she irkun turned to look at chay she was still staring straight ahead prin had thought she was gazing at him but of course she wasnt she blinked slowly again exactly as she had a little earlier right behind you irkun asked voice trailing away a little as he looked at the medical units and comms gear gathered around her bed he pulled out a tablet remote and started tapping at it trunkfingers dancing over the icons letters and numbers is she he said falling silent he stopped tapping at the remote and looked stricken at prin irkun chay the bed she was lying on and the whole small clinic room on a houseboat in a lagoon off a shallow sea all started to waver and dissolve as tears began to fill prins eyes there were three others besides prin and irkun they had kept the core team as small as they possibly could to avoid the prohell people finding out they lay on couches on a deck looking out over the lagoon towards the distant dunes and the sea birds flew across the reflection of a livid sunset dark shapes against the long rips and tearings of the cloudstreaked sky there were no other boats or houseboats visible the one they were on looked innocent enough though it concealed some very hitech gear and a buried optic cable linking them to a satellite array in the nearest small town kilometres distant prin had been awake for about half a day now they needed to decide what to do next especially about chay if we leave her under we can reintegrate her fine whenever she comes back biath said he was their mindstate expert even with a broken mind prin asked certainly biath said as though this was some sort of accomplishment so we take a perfectly healthy sleeping mind and plonk a broken one into it and its the broken one that wins that emerges yolerre said she was their main programmer the whiz that had come up with the barbedwire code to let them escape from the hell biath shrugged the newer writes over the older he told her thats just normal but if we wake her prin began if we wake her shell be just as she was before the two of you went under sulte said he was their mission controller their main exgovernment source and another comms expert but the longer shes awake and living any sort of normal life the harder it gets to reintegrate her two personalities the unconscious one here that doesnt include her experiences in the hell and the virtually conscious one wherever it is that does he looked at biath who nodded to this which given that the latter will probably leave her out of her mind irkun said may be for the best she could be treated irkun said there are techniques these techniques ever been tried on somebody carrying all the nightmares of hell in their head yolerre asked irkun just shook his head and made a sucking noise how long before any reintegration becomes impossible prin asked at worst problematic within hours biath said few days probably week at the most overwrite would be brutal could leave her catatonic at best only humane course would be trying to prise the hell memories in piecemeal he shook his head very likely her continuance personality would just reject the memories completely nightmares would need watching you really dont think shes likely to pop out soon irkun asked prin irkun had his tablet remote propped up in front of him monitoring chays condition in the clinic room just a few metres away prin shook his head i dont think theres any chance he said shed forgotten what the emergency code was what it was for how you operated it like i keep saying she even denied that there was any real and those bastard demons would have been on her in seconds after i barged through if she didnt follow me in a few heartbeats she isnt following me for months he started crying again the others saw huddled closer made soothing noises and those closest reached out to touch him with their trunks he looked round them all i think we have to wake her he told them what happens if we do get her back yolerre asked she can be given some sort of existence in a virtual world sulte said fact is itll be easier to treat her there yes he said glancing at biath who nodded do we need to take a vote irkun asked i think its prins call sulte said the others nodded made noises of assent youll have her back prin yolerre said reaching out to stroke him gently with one trunk prin looked away no i wont he said when they did wake her the following morning he had already left he didnt want to see her he didnt want to abandon the one he loved and who was still in hell by accepting the love of the one who had never been there no matter how whole perfect and untraumatised she might be no doubt this chay this one who had never seen hell would feel injured by his actions and not understand how he could be so cruel to her but then he had seen what real hurt and real cruelty was and the person that he was now could never pretend that what had happened to the two of them in hell had somehow not taken place and changed who he was for ever the room where lededje had woken to see sensia sitting outside on the balcony was hers for as long as she stayed on the ship after their tour in a small very quiet aircraft the gsv was appropriately mindboggling from every external angle and internal corridor sensia had dropped lededje off nearby where one of the kilometreslong internal corridors abutted one of the little stepped valleys of accommodation units given her a long silvery and elaborate ring a thing called a terminal that let her talk to the ship then left her to find her own way back to the room and otherwise sort herself out sensia said shed be a call away happy to be a guide companion or whatever in the meantime she imagined lededje might want to rest or just have some time to herself the ring fitted itself to lededjes longest finger and gave spoken directions back to her room one wall of the room acted as a screen and allowed apparently unrestricted access to the ships equivalent of the sichultian datasphere she sat started asking questions welcome aboard said the avatar drone of the bodhisattva may i take your bag yime nodded instead of the avatar taking it from her the bag simply disappeared from her hand leaving the skin on her fingers with a tingling feeling she wobbled on her feet and almost staggered as the bags weight was suddenly removed from that side of her body leaving her unbalanced youll find it in your cabin the avatar said thank you yime looked down she was standing on nothing it felt like a very hard nothing but just looking there didnt seem to be anything beneath her feet except stars arranged in familiarlooking wispy sprays and whorls stars to the sides too above her a vast dark presence a ceiling of polished black reflecting the stars shining beneath her feet looking straight up she saw a ghostpale version of herself looking straight back down beneath she recognised the patterns of the stars as those visible from her home orbital of dinyolhei though given that she had just left her apartment in the later afternoon these were not the stars shed have expected to see if theyd simply moved straight down from her apartment to the part of the orbital beneath where she lived the ship was obviously some distance further away she felt pleased with herself to have worked this out so quickly do you need time to freshen up adjust orientate yourself or otherwise the drone began no yime said she stood as she had before though with feet spread a little may we begin yes your full attention please the bodhisattva said your full attention yime felt mildly insulted still this was quietus it was known for its air of formal austerity and a degree of implicit asceticism if you didnt like the discipline involved in most things quietudinal you shouldnt have signed up in the first place there was a spiteful rumour seemingly incapable of being entirely laid to rest that the more recently manifested specialist divisions of the cultures contact section were only there to provide substitute employment niches for those desperate but unable to make the cut and get into special circumstances itself contact was the part of the culture that handled more or less every aspect of the cultures interactions with everything and everybody that wasnt the culture from the investigation of unexplored star systems to relations with the entire panoply of other civilisations at every developmental level from those still unable to scrape together the plan for a world government or a functioning space elevator to the elegantly otiose but nevertheless potentially deeply powerful elders and the still more detachedfromreality sublimed where any vestige or trace of such exotic entities remained special circumstances was in effect the contact sections espionage wing there had always been specialist subdivisions within the organisational behemoth that was contact special circumstances was only the most obvious and uniquely it had been formally separate almost since its inception largely because it sometimes did the sort of things the people who were proud to be part of contact would have been horrified to have been remotely associated with as time had passed though especially over the last halfthousand years or so contact itself had seen fit to introduce various re organisations and rationalisations which had resulted in the creation of three other specialist divisions of which the quietudinal service was one the quietudinal service quietus as it was usually called dealt with the dead the dead outnumbered the living in the greater galaxy by some distance if you added up all those individuals existing in the various afterlives the many different civilisations had created over the millennia happily mercifully the dead generally tended to keep themselves to themselves and caused relatively little trouble compared to those for whom the real was still the place to exist within and try to exploit however the sheer scale of their numbers ensured that important issues involving the deceased still arose now and again the dead quietus dealt with might be technically departed but they were sometimes far from quiet a lot of the time such matters were effectively about legality even about definitions in a lot of societies the principal difference between a live virtual person possibly just passing through as it were between bodies back in the real and a dead virtual person was that the latter had no right to property or any other kind of ownership outside of their own simulated realm perhaps not unnaturally there were those amongst the dead who found such a distinction unfair this sort of thing could lead to trouble but quietus was skilled in dealing with the results relatively small in terms of ships and personnel quietus could nevertheless call on whole catalogued suites of dead but preserved experts and expert systems not all of which were even panhuman in origin to help them deal with such matters bringing them back from their funfilled retirement or out of suspended animation where they had left instructions that they were ready to be revived if they could be of use when circumstances required slanged as probate by some of those in sc quietus had links with special circumstances but regarded itself as a more specialised service than its much older and larger sibling utility most of the humans within quietus regarded any links with sc as deplorable in essence and only very occasionally necessary if ever some just plain looked down on special circumstances theirs they felt was a higher more refined calling and their demeanour behaviour appearance and even dress reflected this quietus ships added the letters oaqs for on active quietudinal service to their names while they were so employed and usually took on a monochrome outer guise either pure shining white in appearance or glossily black they even moved quietly adjusting the configuration of their engine fields to produce the minimum amount of disturbance both on the subuniversal energy grid and the d skein of real space normal culture ships either went for maximum efficiency or the always popular letsseewhatwecansqueezeoutofthesebabies approach similarly the human and other biological operatives of quietus were expected to be sober serious people while they were on duty and to dress appropriately it was to this division of contact that yime belonged your full attention indeed oh well rather than reply yime just nodded suddenly she was surrounded waist deep in stars the drone the fardistant stars beneath her feet and their reflections had all disappeared this is the ruprine cluster in arm oneone neartip the ships voice said all around her arm oneone neartip was a little under three hundred light years distant from the region of space where the orbital dinyolhei lay circling around the sun etchilbieth in galactic terms this was practically next door these stars the ship said as a few dozen of the suns shown turned from their natural colours to green represent the extent of a small civilisation called the sichultian enablement a level fourfive society originating here one of the green stars blazed brightly then reduced in brilliance the quyn system home of the planet sichult where the panhuman sichultians evolved a pair of panhumans were shown standing just outside the ball of stars surrounding yime curious physical proportions yime thought two sexes each a little oddlooking to her eyes just as she would have been to theirs she supposed their skin colours changed as she looked at them from dark to pale then back to dark with yellow red and olive tones exhibited en route the two naked beings were replaced by one clothed one he appeared tall powerfully built and had long white hair this is a man called joiler veppers the ship told her he is the richest individual in the entire civilisation and by some margin he is also the most powerful individual in the entire civilisation though unofficially through his wealth and connections rather than due to formal political position the image of the stellar cluster with its artificially green stars and the tall whitehaired man both vanished to be replaced by the earlier image of the stars constituting the sichultian enablement with the quyn systems sun still shown as the brightest ms nsokyi the ship said are you aware of the current longrunning confliction over the future of the afterlives known as hells yes yime said confliction was the technically correct term for a formal conflict within a virtual reality ie one where the outcome mattered beyond the confines of the virtual battle environment itself but mostly people just called this one the war in heaven it had been running now for nearly three decades and had yet to produce a result shed heard reports recently that it was finally coming close to a conclusion but then there had been similar reports almost every hundred days since it had started so she had taken no more notice than anybody else most people had long since lost interest good the ship said mr veppers controls the largest part of the enablements productive capacity and through one of his interests in particular has access to this a star near the outer limit of the enablements volume blazed too attracting attention the view zoomed in vertiginously until it showed a singleringed gas giant planet between its broad duncoloured polar regions the planet displayed seven horizontal bands coloured various shades of yellow red and brown this the ship said as the entirety of the single equatorial ring surrounding the planet flashed green once is the artificial planetary nebula of the tsungarial disk around the planet razhir in the tsung system the disk comprises over three hundred million separate habitats and mostly manufacturies usually called fabricaria the disk was abandoned two million years ago by the then subliming meyeurne and has been a galactic protectorate since shortly after their disappearance the protectorate status was agreed to be necessary due to a chaotic dangerously uncontrolled war both over and enabled by the very considerable shipandweaponsystemmanufacturing capacity left behind at least irresponsibly possibly mischievously and arguably maliciously by the meyeurne the civilisations involved were the hreptazyle and the yelve the ship didnt bother to display any images of the meyeurne hreptazyle or yelve certainly yime had never heard of any of them which meant they were either long gone or just irrelevant shortly following the idiran war the bodhisattva said the culture became the latest in a long line of trusted level eights to be given protectorate custody of the disk however as part of what were in effect war reparations after the chel debacle six hundred years ago we ceded overarching control of the disk to the nauptre reliquaria and their junior partners the gfcf yime most certainly had heard of the nauptre reliquaria and the gfcf like the culture the reliquaria was a level eight civilisation technologically the societies were equals originally a species of giant furred gliding marsupials for the last couple of millennia they had expressed themselves almost exclusively as their machines gsvsized constructor ships smaller though still substantial space vessels lesser independent spacefaring units and a multifarious variety of metrescale individuals roughly equivalent to drones though with no standard model each design was unique or close to it their presence then extended down through the centimetre and millimetre scales to collectivised nanobots the furry marsupials still existed but theyd retreated to their home planets and habitats to lives of cheerfully selfish indolence leaving their machines to represent them in the galactic community generally reckoned to be well on the slippery if confusingly by convention upward slope to subliming the reliquarias relations with the culture were formal perhaps even frosty rather than friendly largely due to the nauptrians robust attitude to punishment in their artificial afterlife basically they were very much for it unlike the culture which despite being firmly of a mind with the antihell side of the confliction had thought it politic to take no active part in the virtual war the nauptrians had made themselves an enthusiastic part of the prohell war effort the geseptianfardesile cultural federacy was a level seven civilisation panhuman smaller and more delicate than the average but generally reckoned to be quite beautiful with large heads and large eyes they had a strange relationship with the culture professing to love it they had even chosen their name partly in honour of the culture but often seeming to want to criticise it and even work against it as though they so much wanted to be of help they needed the culture reduced to a level of neediness that would make such aid something it would genuinely be grateful for the mention of chel was randomly appropriate yime thought before that particular stain on the cultures reputation people had seemed reticent to talk about the whole issue of afterlives after it for a while at least theyd appeared to talk of little else the components of the tsungarial disk have mostly been mothballed for all this time the ship continued left as a kind of monument or mausoleum over the last few decades however as the sichultia have expanded their sphere of influence out to and around it they have been granted limited lowlevel control over the disk and allowed in the shape of veppers veprine corporation to use a handful of the orbital manufacturies to construct trading and exploratory ships all of this supervised by the nauptre reliquaria and the gfcf veppers and the sichultia have long sought greater operational control over the disk and its manufacturing capacity to aid their commercial military and civilisational expansion they are now on the verge of achieving their goal due to the changing attitudes not to say connivance of the gfcf and the reliquaria this is because the gfcf covets at least some of that capacity as well their mediumterm aim is to step up a civilisational level and control of the reactivated disks productive capacity would go some way to securing it while the nauptre reliquaria are prohell in the short term wanting the proantihell confliction ended and with what they see as the right result as well as in the long term and assuming they do not sublime in the meantime by their own admission planning to combine all afterlives with their own and others sublimed that nobody else thinks this is even possible does not seem to trouble them and is anyway beside the point why does the reliquaria being prohell have anything to do with control of the disk yime asked because the disks productive or possibly computational capacity may come into play in an outbreak from the confliction into the real an outbreak yime felt genuinely shocked conflictions virtual wars were there specifically to stop people warring in the real the proantihell confliction may be about to end the ship said in victory for the prohell side that was a blow for the culture yime thought even though it had seemingly stood aside from the war there had never been any doubt which side it believed in it was all just bad timing in a way at the point when the war began the culture had been in one of its cyclic eras of trying not to be seen to be throwing its weight around too many others of the inplay level eights had objected to the culture being involved with the war in heaven for it to be able to do so without looking arrogant even belligerent the assumption had somehow always been that the prohell forces were going to be fighting a losing battle anyway and their defeat was probably inevitable no matter who did or didnt join in seemingly the more the inplay and the elders thought about it the more obvious it became that the whole idea of afterlives dedicated to extended torture was indeed barbaric unnecessary and outdated and the course of the confliction over the continued existence of the hells was expected to follow this slow but decisive shift in opinion at the time the prospect of the culture getting involved seemed likely to most people to make the conflict less fair its outcome effectively fixed before it even began for a virtual war to work people had to accept the outcome the losing side in particular had to abide by the result rather than cry foul revoke the solemn pledges they had made in the war conduct agreement drawn up before the conflict began and continue as things had been before the consensus had been that the culture taking part would give the prohell side the excuse to do just that if and when they lost the antihell side the ship continued was the first to attempt to hack the others conflictdirection processing substrates the opposing side retaliated the antihell side has additionally attempted direct hacking attacks on some of the hells themselves seeking either to release the inmates or to destroy the virtual environments completely the various hacking attacks by both sides have almost all failed those that succeeded did little damage and the vast majority of those by both sides were detected by those targeted leading to multiple judging and arbitration disputes all of which are currently being kept sub judice successfully so far though probably not for much longer extensive legal and diplomatic disputes are anticipated and almost certainly being prepared for there are certain sofar unsubstantiated reports that some of the secret substrates within which several major hells are running are located not where one might expect to find them essentially within the volumes of influence of their parent civilisations but instead within the tsungarial disk or elsewhere within the sichultian enablement the worry is that an outbreak of the confliction into the real may involve the tsungarial disk especially the untilnow dormant majority of the fabricaria and the hidden substrates that may also lie there if this is truly the case then the potential for a substantial war in the real would seem high thus the sichultian enablement suddenly and unexpectedly finds itself in a position of power well beyond that which its developmental level would lead one to expect it is poised to contribute significantly possibly decisively to a situation of extreme importance the outcome of which might lead directly to a significant conflict in the real involving several highlevel players given that mr veppers is so powerful within the sichultian enablement what he thinks and does therefore becomes of profound importance yime thought about this why would we why would quietus be involved there is a complication the ship told her i thought there might be in fact there are two that i did not anticipate yime admitted the first concerns this person a figure appeared hmm yime said after a moment the figure was of a panhuman a sichultian yime would have guessed from the rather odd bodily proportions this one was female bald or shavenheaded and dressed in a short sleeveless tunic which displayed extensive and intricate multicoloured abstract markings on her nightblack skin she was smiling looking closely yime could see further markings on the females teeth and the whites of her eyes the two naked figures shed been shown earlier hadnt had anything like that those though had been generalised textbook figures the person shown here like the image of veppers was an individual sichultian she asked yes the markings arent natural correct are they real they were real and permanent they continued within her body she was an intagliate one of a subset of humans within the sichultian enablement who are tattooed throughout their physical being the practice began as an art form though later also became a form of punishment especially for matters regarding private civil debt yime nodded what a bizarre thing to do she thought her name is lededje ybreq the ship told her she was an intagliate but her name is yime noticed ship minds didnt make mistakes like that she suspected she already knew where this was going ms ybreq died between five and ten days ago in ubruater the capital city of the sichultian enablements originating planet sichult the ship told her she may have been murdered if so then the murderer may have been joiler veppers or somebody controlled by him somebody in his employ the sichultia do not possess or as far as we know have even limited access to mindstate transcription or soulkeeper technology however there is an unconfirmed report that ms ybreqs personality was somehow retrieved from her when she died and that she was revented aboard the gsv sense amid madness wit amidst folly oh it was nearby it was nowhere near nearby it was over three thousand light years distant from the nearest part of the sichultian enablement at the time and no ships or other entities representing or associated with the vessel were closer than approximately nine hundred years away at the time either nor had the ship or any of its known associates ever had any recorded dealings with the sichultian enablement how mysterious there is a possible link however between these seemingly unrelated components ahhah well come to that shortly the salient point to be made here is that it is believed that ms ybreq may be on her way back to the sichultian enablement revented within a quite different body probably still sichultian in form though for all we know male and bearing the intention of doing some violence likely fatal to mr veppers in revenge for her earlier murder so what am i supposed to do stop her help her as things stand simply finding her and keeping in touch would be sufficient achievement you would then await further orders so shes our excuse yime suggested i beg your pardon ms nsokyi this girl being revented shes our excuse for getting involved in all this her revention is one reason to get involved im not sure that characterising it as an excuse is entirely helpful the ships voice sounded frosty also this entire confliction is specifically about the fate of the dead it is entirely within the remit of quietus but isnt this more of an sc thing yime suggested in fact hasnt this got special circumstances written all over it she waited for a reply but one did not appear to be immediately forthcoming she went on this does sound like it involves tangling with equivtech galactic players with the intention of stopping a proper shipsandeverything fullscale shooting war im not sure how much more hardcore sc than that a situation can get thats an interesting observation is sc involved in this not that we know of who would we be within this context let me rephrase that last reply not that i know of this was mildly illuminating quietus had a deliberately flat organisational structure in theory perfectly so at ship level all the minds concerned having equal knowledge and an equal say in practice there was a degree of legislativeexecutive strategic tactical distinction some minds and ships doing the planning while others subsequently undertook the execution shouldnt we tell sc she asked im sure that is being considered my immediate task is to brief and transport you yours ms nsokyi is to attend to this briefing and assuming you are agreeable take part in this mission i see yime nodded that was her told whats the other complication the projection of the brown red and yellow gas giant with its artificial ring system returned replacing the image of the sichultian female approximately two hundred and eight thousand years ago a proportion of the dormant fabricaria in the tsungarial disk suffered a smatter infection in the shape of the remains of a hegemonising swarm outbreak which took refuge there the hegswarm was duly dealt with in the usual manner and annihilated by the cooperative of civilisations then responsible for overseeing that volume of space the smatter infection was assumed to have been expunged from the disk components at the same time however isolated recurrences of it have taken place over random intervals ever since due to its earlier success in dealing rapidly and effectively with these sporadic flareups a small specialist culture presence was allowed to remain even after the culture lost the mandate for the disks protection yime nodded ah pest control the specialist culture contingent in the tsungarial disk is indeed part of the restoria section restoria was the part of contact charged with taking care of hegemonising swarm outbreaks when by accident or design a set of selfreplicating entities ran out of control somewhere and started trying to turn the totality of the galaxys matter into nothing but copies of themselves it was a problem as old as life in the galaxy and arguably hegswarms were just that another legitimate if rather overenthusiastic galactic lifeform type even the most urbanely sophisticated scrupulously empathic and excruciatingly polite civilisation it had been suggested was just a hegswarm with a sense of proportion equally then those same sophisticated civilisations could be seen as the galaxys way of retaining a sort of balance between raw and refined between wilderness and complexity as well as ensuring that there was both always room for new intelligent life to evolve and that there was something wild unexplored and interesting for it to gaze upon when it did the restoria section was the cultures current specialist contribution to this ageold struggle as often known as pest control as by its official title it was made up of experts in the management amelioration and if necessary obliteration of hegswarms quietus and restoria worked together closely on occasion and both felt that they did so with mutual respect and on equal terms restorias approach to its task and hence general demeanour was less punctilious than quietus but then the ships systems and humans in pest control generally spent their working lives rushing from hegswarm eruption to hegswarm eruption rather than communing with the honoured dead so a buccaneering rather than considered and respectful bearing was only to be expected the restoria mission at the tsungarial disk has been kept informed regarding the potential for the fabricaria to come into play should the confliction spill over into the real and has requested any help that might be available so long as it draws no extra external attention to the mission or the disk we are happy to provide and are lucky to have had assets including but not limited to myself and you close by given that the situation may become one of extreme urgency very quickly whether restoria has also made such a request to special circumstances is not known to us it is worth noting that the smatter infestation within the disk has been in abatement for the last few decades and will it is hoped not enter into the equation smatter was the name given to the bitty remains of a hegswarm after it had been stamped out as any coherent threat usually it didnt last significantly longer than the outbreak itself and just got mopped up if some bits did persist then while you could never afford to ignore the stuff you didnt really need to fear it on the other hand some of it getting into a mothballed system of a few hundred million ancient mothballed manufacturies did sound like awfully bad luck yime thought actually it sounded like the kind of thing that woke restoria people up at night sweating and screaming the image of the gas giant planet and its glittering artificial disk rotated slowly and silently in front of yime what was the possible link between the components you mentioned earlier she asked it is a potential link between the gsv sense amid madness wit amidst folly and the sichultian enablement in the shape of this vessel the ringed gas giant disappeared to be replaced by the slim but chunky image of a hooliganclass limited offensive unit it looked like a long quite substantial bolt with various smoothedoff washers nuts and longer collars screwed onto it this is the me im counting an exlou now of the culture ulterior the ship told her it was constructed by the sense amid madness wit amidst folly shortly before the idiran war and is thought to remain in sporadic contact with it it is a selfdeclared peripatetic eccentric a wanderer a tramp vessel it was last heard of with any formal degree of certitude some eight years ago when it declared it might go into a retreat it is thought to have been present in the sichultian enablement two years earlier and so may constitute the mentioned link between it and the sense amid madness wit amidst folly there are indications that it accumulates images of strange and exotic creatures or devices and it may have chosen to collect such an image of lededje ybreq that would be a very comprehensive image it would and one which would be ten years younger than the female when she died she wouldnt know shed been murdered if she was she might simply have been told yime nodded i suppose she might we think we know to a degree the ship said a note of caution in its voice where the me im counting is do we it may well be with the gsv total internal reflection and where is it that is not known it is one of the forgotten the what ah ten a what a hymen there were things to do lededje had decided and she might only have one night on the gsv to get them done getting laid was not the most important item on her list but it didnt feel like the least important either the attractive young man looked puzzled how would i know at least she thought that was what hed just said the music was very loud there were these zones scattered throughout the space that were called sound fields where the music magically dropped away to nothing she saw the vague blue glow in the air that betrayed the presence of one a couple of metres away and rather daringly she felt putting her hand on the attractive young mans puffy sleeve part encouraged and part dragged him in that direction maybe it was her she thought she was talking marain the cultures own language and while it felt bizarrely natural to just launch out and express herself in it every time she stopped to think about what she was doing she sort of tripped over herself and stuttered to a stop sometimes specific wordchoice had her stumbling too there seemed to be an awful lot of notquite synonyms in marain the very loud insistently beaty music it was called chug apparently though she had yet to establish whether this was the title of the composition the name of the performers or the musical form itself faded almost to nothing the attractive young man still looked puzzled you look puzzled she told him cant you just look the word up in your neural lace i dont have a lace he said running his hand over one side of his face and through some of his long dark curly hair right now i dont even have a terminal on me im out to play he looked up to where the cone of the noisereducing sound field seemed to be emanating from the ceiling of the space unseen in the darkness above ship whats a hayman a hymen she corrected a hymen is a thin membrane partially obstructing the vagina of a mammal especially a human the ship said from the long silver ring on her finger it is found in approximately twentyeight per cent of the panhuman metaspecies and its presence is often taken as signifying the individual concerned has yet to be subject to penetrative sex however thanks the attractive young man curled his fingers round the ring on her finger muffling the ships voice and causing it to stop lededje smiled as he took his fingers away it had been quite an intimate act she felt promising she lowered her head to her hand a little do i have a hymen she asked quietly no the ring said please hold me up to one of your ears excuse me lededje said to the attractive young man he shrugged drank his drink looked away lededje sensia here the ring said the body blank i used didnt come with defined genitalia at all it was told to become female at the same time as the basic sichultian characteristics were programmed in the default setting is no hymen why do you want one she brought the ring round to her mouth no she whispered she frowned watching the attractive young man smile and nod to somebody nearby he didnt look sichultian of course but he looked different a bit the way she looked different when she had come up with her general plan of action hours earlier sitting in front of the wall screen in her room after sensia had left her she had asked about and quickly found various scheduled social gatherings of those amongst the ships notquite quarter of a billion population who did not look like the average culture human in a ship with that many people aboard there were always going to be plenty of individuals who didnt conform to the culture norm the way to think of the ships living space shed decided was as a single giant city fifty kilometres long by twenty across and a uniform kilometre in height with a perfect free and rapid public transport system composed of what she thought of as small luxurious onecarriage ultrafast underground trains crossed with elevator cars she was used to the idea of cities attracting the eccentric and the strange the people who would be ostracised or even attacked in the countryside or smaller towns and villages if they behaved as they really wanted to behave but who could become themselves amongst others of whatever kind they were when they came to the city shed known she would find some people somewhere who would find her attractive there was still the matter of finding what she was coming to think of as the alternative ship though and that did take priority this place divinity in extremis was some sort of combination of semiregular social event performance space and drug bar it had a reputation when shed started asking the screen about it sensia had butted in the avatars voice suddenly coming out of the screen in place of the more neutral ship voice shed just been getting used to advising her that divinity in extremis wasnt the sort of place somebody new to the culture necessarily wanted to get involved with lededje had bit back her annoyance thanked sensia for her advice and politely asked her not to interrupt again so divinity in extremis ship avatars were known to come here youre interrupting again she whispered into the ring she smiled at the attractive young man as he frowned into his now empty glass i could have pretended i was just the ship sensias voice replied reasonably sounding annoyingly unannoyed i assumed you wanted more detail on the physical process that led to your current incarnation sorry dear girl if youre worried about whether your body was somehow sexually interfered with while in the grow tank i can assure you it wasnt the attractive young man reached out to a passing tray as it floated past depositing his empty glass and scooping up a fuming drug bowl he brought it up to his face and inhaled deeply never mind lededje said sensia what please go away now duly gone one tip though dont you think its time you asked him his name goodbye talk to you later lededje looked up still smiling the attractive young man went to hand her the drug bowl she was about to take it with her right hand but he pulled it away again gesturing to her left hand she took the bowl with her left hand instead and raised it tentatively towards her face the attractive young man took her right hand and curled his fingers round the ring again while she was still sucking in the fragrant grey smoke from the bowl he pulled the terminal ring off her finger and threw it high over his shoulder that was mine she protested she looked in the direction the ring had gone but it must have landed ten metres away over the mass of people in the place and there was no sign of anybody catching it and bringing it back why did you do that he shrugged i felt like it do you do everything you feel like doing he shrugged again pretty much how am i supposed to speak to the ship now he looked even more puzzled he inhaled from the drug bowl she hadnt realised hed taken it back shout he suggested talk to the air ask somebody else he shook his head looked at her critically youre really not from around here are you she thought about this yes she said she wasnt sure she approved of somebody who just assumed it was all right to manhandle her remove something that wasnt his and just throw it away like it was something worthless his name was admile she told him her name was led because she thought lededje was too much of a mouthful i am looking for a ships avatar she told him oh he said i thought you were you know cruising cruising for sex possibly that too she said well definitely though she had been going to say definitely but possibly not with him but then thought that might be too blunt you want to have sex with a ships avatar not necessarily the two quests are separate hmm admile said follow me she frowned then followed him the place was busy packed with people of a variety of body shapes though mostly panhuman outside the sound fields it was very noisy with chug which she was starting to suspect was the type of music rather than anything more specific knots of people got in their way and they pushed through clouds of fragrant fumes created smokescreens across the space she nearly lost admile twice they passed one cleared circle where two naked men hobbled by short ropes tied round their ankles were bareknuckle fighting then another where a man and a woman both wearing only masks were fighting with long curved swords they came to a sort of deep sunken wide alcove where amongst a plethora of cushions bolsters and other paddedlooking bits of furniture a startling variety of people perhaps twenty in all were indulging in enthusiastic sex a semicircle of people were gathered around the perimeter laughing clapping shouting comments and offering advice one couple amongst those looking on were just getting undressed apparently about to start taking part lededje was not especially shocked she had witnessed and been obliged to take part in orgies back on sichult veppers had gone through a stage of enjoying them she had not appreciated the experience though she supposed that might have been more to do with the lack of choice involved than the surfeit of numbers she hoped admile wasnt about to suggest that they or even just she ought to join in the group sex she felt that a rather more romantic setting might be more appropriate for this bodys first sexual experience there he is admile said probably it was noisy again she followed him to the far side of the semicircle of voyeurs where a fat little man stood surrounded by mostly young people he was dressed in what looked like a shiny highly patterned dressing gown his hair was thin and lank and his face was jowly and covered in sweat he was she realised when she thought about it the fattest person she had seen since shed been here by some margin the fat little man was repeatedly spinning a coin in the air and catching it each time the coin landed on his pudgy palm its top surface flashed red its skill he kept saying as the people around him shouted and called out its skill thats all look ill make it green this time this time when the coin landed it flashed green instead of red see skill muscle control concentration skill thats all he looked up admile tell these people this is just skill wont you anything riding on this admile asked any bets been taken nothing the little fat man said tossing the coin again red okay admile said its just skill he told the people see the little fat man said red that doesnt make it fair though admile added oh youre no use the little fat man tutted red again led this is jolicci hes an avatar youre an avatar arent you jolicci im an avatar red of the good ship armchair traveller red a more than averagely peripatetic gcu of the red mountain class red an avatar who i swear is using nothing red but muscular skill to make this coin come up red red every red single red time green oh fuck there was jeering he bowed sarcastically lededje thought if such a thing was possible he tossed the coin one last time watched it flip in the air and then held open the breast pocket of his extravagantly decorated dressing gown the coin dropped into the pocket he extracted a kerchief from it and mopped his face as some of the people whod been watching started to drift away led he said nodding to her pleased to meet you he looked at her toe to top she had dressed very conservatively at first then changed her mind and opted for a short sleeveless dress deciding to revel in the freedom to do so without displaying her legally approved veppersdesigned tattoo jolicci shook his head you dont look like anything i have stored up here he said tapping his head excuse me while i consult my better half oh youre sichultian is that right yes she said she wants to have sex with a ships avatar admile told him jolicci looked surprised really he asked no she told him i am looking for a disreputable ship disreputable jolicci looked even more surprised i think so you think so perhaps she thought avatar or not he was just one of those people who thought it the height of wit to constantly ask questions when they werent called for would you know of one she asked many why do you want a disreputable ship because i think the sense amid madness wit amidst folly means to send me away on one that will be too well behaved jolicci scrunched up one eye as though this answer had hit him with the force of a spit she had been flicking through various documents and presentations she had discovered through her rooms screen looking at what the culture knew about and thought of the enablement when the ship had called back lededje ive found you a ship the vessels neutral voice had told her straight out of the screen oh thank you the image of what she supposed must be a culture spaceship had appeared on the screen pasted over what shed been looking at it resembled a rather featureless skyscraper lying on its side its called the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory is it dont worry about the name the point is its heading in your direction and its agreed to take you its setting off late tomorrow afternoon it will take me to sichult most of the way itll drop you at a place called bohme a transfer station and dock complex just outside the enablement itself ill arrange local transport from there while youre en route wont i need money to pay for that leave that to me would you like to talk to the ship arrange when to board okay shed talked to the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory it had sounded cheery but boring shed thanked it thanked the gsv again and then had sat frowning at the screen once control of it was returned to her shed started looking for document sites about culture spaceships they appeared to be almost without number there were millions of ships each seemed to have what was in effect its own public log book and its own fan club often more than one and there were innumerable documentspresentations on particular types and classes of ships or those which had been constructed by specific manufacturies or other ships it was bewildering she could understand why culture people just asked their local ai or mind for whatever information they wanted trying to work your way down through all the detail yourself was daunting perhaps she should just ask that seemed to be the way you did things in the culture on sichult you had to think about what subjects and people it was safe to ask certain things about but not here apparently on the other hand doing it yourself felt more secure she was already fairly au fait with how you did all this it wasnt vastly different from the way the enablement arranged access to the data it was prepared to share with the general public plus shed had practice while shed still been in the ships virtual environment before shed be revented into this body here in the real using the screen she knew how to monitor the level of machine intelligence she was talking to a side bar at the edge of the screen changed according to whether she was talking to or just using a completely dumb program a smart but witless set of algorithms one of three different levels of ai an intelligent outside entity or was linked directly to the main personality of the gsv itself the bar had ascended to its maximum when sensia had broken in earlier with her warning about divinity in extremis shed asked the levelone ai to bring up sites which rated ships and soon found one run by a small collective of ship fans which gave both the sense amid madness wit amidst folly and the me im counting what she thought sounded like fair assessments she asked about the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory boring obedient well behaved possibly with ambitions of being chosen for more exotic service though if it thought it was ever going to get into sc it was deceiving itself she wasnt sure what sc was maybe shed come back to that shed called up a list of ships currently on the gsv shed shaken her head there were nearly ten thousand named vessels aboard right now including two of a smaller class of gsv themselves containing other ships the exact number changed as she watched it the final digit flickering up and down presumably as vessels arrived and departed in real time four gsvs under construction less than per cent bay occupancy rate she was still assuming that she was under some form of surveillance and had noticed that the more complicated was the question you asked the further up the smartnessbar you went towards the ships own personality she wanted to avoid that so rather than just ask which are the badboy ships she found short cuts that let her sort the ships currently aboard according to the dubiousness of their reputations a handful of the ships aboard had worked for or been plausibly associated with something called special circumstances they didnt publish their ships logs or course schedules shed noticed sc again whatever special circumstances was it seemed to be closely linked with the kind of qualities she was looking for shed looked up special circumstances military intelligence espionage deep interference dirty tricks this shed thought sounded promising it seemed to have almost as many people interested in it a lot of them profoundly critical as all the ships did put together shed looked a little closer at some of the antisc sites profoundly critical say that kind of thing about similar organisations within the enablement and youd be on a sharp end of a visit from them and quite probably never heard of again none of the handful of ships shed wanted to talk to had been immediately available shed found out how to leave messages with them and had done so over there to your left further left straight on for about five metres said a neutral voice rapidly coming closer to where she stood with admile and the fat little avatar thats her talking to the rotund gentleman lededje turned and saw a crosslooking lady walking smartly towards her holding something small and silver in her fingers she marched up to lededje this thing she said brandishing the ring in lededjes face will not shut up even in a sound field thats her the ring said primly admile waved some drug fumes out of the way and peered at the ring before turning to lededje want me to throw it away again further no thank you lededje said taking the ring from the woman thank she began but the woman was already walking away lededje held the ring in her hand hello again the ships neutral voice said hello i was thinking of going body surfing jolicci announced anybody want to go body surfing admile shook his head good lededje said slipping the ring onto one of his fingers perhaps ill see you later body surfing meant taking off most of your clothes and throwing yourself down a great curved slope of upwardcharging water either on your back front behind or if you were especially skilled feet this all happened in a great halfdark hall full of whoops and happy screams overlooked by bars and party spaces some people did it naked others donned swimwear jolicci fitted with what looked like a pair of eyewateringly tight trunks was spectacularly bad at it he found it hard to exercise any control even when he was flat on his back with all four limbs extended lededje discovered she was quite good as long as she didnt try to stand up she was coasting on her behind in a tidy spray of water holding on to joliccis left ankle with her right hand to stop him spinning out of control and keep them within talking distance of each other so you want to go somewhere you wont reveal for reasons you want to keep secret but you dont want to take the ship the gsvs suggested thats broadly it she agreed also i would like to talk to the ships aboard here which have or had links to special circumstances really jolicci wobbled spraying his face with water are you sure he wiped his face with one hand oscillating to and fro until he placed the hand back on the watery slide i mean really sure yes she told him youre not the avatar of one of them are you hed said he was the avatar of the armchair traveller that hadnt been a name shed recognised but for all she knew these ships changed their names or had several different names they used as it suited them no he said humble general contact unit me going about standard contact business honest nothing to do with sc he squinted at her she thought it might just have been the water you sure you want to talk to sc yes they pirouetted slowly caught by a localised rush of uphillheaded water jolicci looked thoughtful he nodded to the side it seems i have no skill in this enough lets try another sort of surfing what is this lededje asked they were standing in a short broad carpeted corridor one wall of which was punctuated by five sets of plain double doors jolicci back in his colourful dressing gown had pulled the central set of double doors apart with some effort and was stopping them from sliding back by wedging the left one with his slippershod foot lededje was looking through the opened doors into a dark echoing space laced with vertical cables and crossbeamed with girders she heard rumbling noises sensed movement felt a draught on her face the air smelled oily half familiar she and the fat little avatar had been whisked here by the usual slick process of traveltube with only minutelong walks at either end what she was looking at here felt somehow much older much cruder recreation of a tall building elevator shaft he told her dont you have these we have skyscrapers she said holding on to the righthand door as she leant in and elevators there was the rather grimylooking top of an elevator car reassuringly close beneath only a metre or so down looking up she saw the shafts and cables climbing into the darkness ive just never seen inside a lift shaft before except in a screen i suppose then theres always just the one you know shaft uhhuh jolicci said jump on ill let go the doors careful though no safety net she jumped onto the roof of the car beneath jolicci followed her making the roofs surface quiver the doors above hissed closed and the car started to ascend immediately she held on to one of the cables it was greasy with dark gritty oil and looked over the edge the great dark shaft held space for ten elevators five on each side the car accelerated smartly the slipstream tugging at her hair and making joliccis dressing gown flap as they whizzed upwards she looked down leaning a little further out as they shot past sets of closed double doors almost too fast to count the bottom of the shaft was lost in the darkness she was grabbed from behind by one shoulder she heard herself yelp as she thudded into joliccis surprisingly solid body an instant later a dark shape plunged past her in a storm of disturbed air she had narrowly missed getting decapitated by a rapidly descending car jolicci released his hold on her like i said no safety net this is a dangerously faithful physical recreation no sensors on the cars to stop them hitting or crushing you no ag down the bottom if you fall nobody to see you fall let alone stop you you backedup she found she was shaking a little you mean my my self my personality he just looked at her she suspected it was just as well it was so gloomy it was hard to tell precisely what his expression was im only a day out of a a thing a jar a body tank she swallowed but no the car was slowing drawing to a stop jolicci looked upwards from the far side of the car right here comes the fun bit he glanced at her you ready what for she asked get over here jump when i say dont hesitate youll need to let go of that cable first she let go of the cable stepped to stand beside him at the other side of the elevator roof looking up tentatively she saw the bottom of another dark car descending quickly towards them she heard some sudden distant whoops and then laughter from further down in the great depth of shadows the sounds echoed and reechoed their car was still slowing okay steady steady jolicci said as their car and the one above approached each other should i hold your hand she asked do not hold my hand he said okay okay steady their car had come almost to a stop the one coming towards them from above whooshed past jump jolicci shouted as the cars roofs were almost level he jumped she jumped too a moment later but found that shed jumped as though to land where the other cars roof had been when shed leapt not where it was going to be as she dropped after it she landed awkwardly and would have fallen against the cars cables if jolicci hadnt caught her lededje heard herself gasp she held on to the little fat avatar for a moment as they steadied on the roof of the car the one theyd jumped from was stopped several storeys above and getting further away all the time as their car descended it too was starting to slow now wow she said letting go of jolicci her fingers had left dark greasy marks on his dressing gown lapels that was exciting she frowned at him do you do this a lot never before he told her heard of it that shook her a little she had rather assumed she was in safe or at least experienced hands the car drew to a stop beneath she could feel and hear its doors open a bar of light shone from that edge of the roof showing joliccis face he was looking at her oddly she thought she felt a strange little frisson of fear this special circumstances thing he said yes she said as he took a step closer to her she stepped backward tripped on a piece of the roofs crossbracing and staggered he grabbed her again pulling her to the rear edge of the roof deep below she could see the car whose rear faced their cars rear rising quickly towards them the two sets of five cars per side were separated by nearly two metres three or four times the separation of the cars on each side of the shaft jolicci nodded down indicating the approaching car think we can make that jump when it comes he said into her ear she could feel his warm breath on her skin no safety nets remember not even any surveillance inside here he pulled her a little closer to the edge brought his mouth closer to her ear what do you think think we can do it no she told him and i think you should let go of me before she could do anything to stop him he gripped her hard by one elbow and pushed her out over the drop only her feet still in contact with the cars roof still want me to let go no she shouted grabbing his arm with her free hand dont be stupid of course not he pulled her in towards him though still not out of danger if you had a terminal it would hear you scream if you happened to fall he told her he made a show of looking down he shrugged might be just enough time for the ship to realise what was happening and get a drone to you before you hit the bottom stop doing this please she said youre frightening me he pulled her close to him his breath in her face now everybody thinks sc is so glamorous so sexy he shook her rubbed his groin against her leg thrilling fun all danger and excitement but not too much danger is that what you think heard the rumours absorbed the propaganda read the right assessments listened to the relevant experts selfproclaimed have we im just trying to find out you feel frightened he asked her i just said he shook his head this isnt dangerous he shook her again im not dangerous im a nice rolypoly gcu avatar i wouldnt drop somebody down an antique lift shaft to let them splatter on the concrete im one of the good guys but you still feel frightened dont you you do feel frightened dont you i hope you feel frightened i already told you she said coldly trying to keep any expression from her face or voice as she stared into his eyes he smiled pulled her inwards as he stepped back he let go of her and held on to the cables as the car started downwards again as i say im one of the good guys ms ybreq she gripped another of the cables hard i never told you my full name well spotted seriously though i really am one of the good guys im the sort of ship whod always do everything to save somebody not kill them not let them die sc its ships its people might be on the side of the angels but that doesnt mean they always behave like the good guys in fact as youre falling down the metaphorical lift shaft i can virtually guarantee it will feel like theyre the bad guys no matter how ethically sound the carefully worked out moral algebra was that led to them chucking you into it in the first place you have made your point sir she told him frostily perhaps we might abandon this pastime now he looked at her for a few moments longer then he shook his head looked away well so youre tough he said but youre still a fool he let out a deep breath the elevator car was pulling to a stop ill take you to an sc ship he smiled without any humour if and when it all goes horribly wrong feel free to blame me if you still can itll make no difference the forgotten the bodhisattva told yime nsokyi also known as oubliettionaries there were times yime might occasionally be forced to admit when a neural lace would indeed be useful if she had one she could be quizzing it now asking it for mentions references definitions what the hell was an oubliettionary of course the ship would know she was making such inquiries she was on the ship now not the orbital so any lace or terminal business would be conducted through the bodhisattvas mind or its subsystems but at least with a lace you could have the relevant knowledge just dumped into your head rather than have to listen to it one word at a time i see yime said she folded her arms im listening theyre ships of a certain predisposition shall we say normally a gsv usually with a few other ships and a small number of active drones aboard and often containing no humans at all the bodhisattva told her they resign from the daytoday informational commerce of the culture stop registering their position take themselves off into the middle of nowhere and then they just sit there doing nothing except listen indefinitely listen they listen to one or more probably all id imagine of the handful of widely scattered broadcast stations which send out a continual update on the general state of matters in the greater galactic community in general and the culture in particular news stations for want of a better word broadcasting its a wasteful and inefficient way to communicate but the advantage of a broadcast in this context is precisely that it goes everywhere and nobody can tell who might be listening how many of these forgotten are there good question to most people they appear simply as ships that have gone into an especially uncommunicative retreat an impression the ships concerned do nothing to contradict of course at any time anything up to one per cent of the culture ship fleet might be on a retreat and perhaps point three or point four per cent of those have been silent since quitting what one might call the main sequence of normal ship behaviour i hesitate to call it discipline its not a muchstudied field so even the quality of the relatively few guesstimates is hard to evaluate there might be as few as eight or twelve of these ships or possibly as many as three or four hundred and whats the point of all this theyre backup the bodhisattva said if through some bizarre and frankly unfeasibly widespread and complete calamity the culture somehow ceased to be then any one of these ships could reseed the galaxy or a different one perhaps with something that would be recognisably the culture this does beg the question what would be the point if it had been so comprehensively expunged in the first place but i suppose you could argue some lesson might have been learned that might make version two more resilient somehow i thought the entire contact fleet was supposed to represent our backup yime said in its relationships with other civilisations especially with those that were encountering it for the first time much tended to be made of the fact or at least the assertion that each and every gsv represented the culture in its entirety that each one held all the knowledge the culture had ever accumulated and could build any object or device that the culture was capable of making while the sheer scale of a general systems vehicle meant they each contained so many humans and drones they were more or less guaranteed to hold a reasonably representative sample of both even without trying to the culture was deliberately and selfconsciously very widely distributed throughout the galaxy with no centre no nexus no home planet its distribution might make it easy to attack but it also made it hard to eradicate altogether at least in theory having hundreds of thousands of vessels individually quite capable of rebuilding the entire culture from scratch was generally held to be safeguard enough against civilisational oblivion or so yime had been led to believe obviously others thought differently the contact fleet is what one might call a second line of defence the ship told her whats the first all the orbitals the ship said reasonably and other habs rocks and planets included and these forgotten are the last ditch probably so one might imagine as far as i know that in shipspeak yime thought probably meant no though she knew better than to try to coax a less ambiguous answer out of a mind so they just sit there wherever there might be oort clouds interstellar space within or even beyond the outer halo of the greater galaxy itself who knows however yes that is the general idea and indefinitely indefinitely until now at least the bodhisattva said waiting for a catastrophe thatll probably never happen but which if it did would indicate either the existence of a force so powerful it could probably discover these ships regardless and snuff them out too or an existential flaw in the culture so deep it would certainly be present in these forgotten as well especially given their representativeness put like that the entire strategy does sound a little forlorn the ship said sounding almost apologetic but there we are because you never know i suppose i think a part of the whole idea is that it provides a degree of comfort for those who might otherwise worry about such matters but most people dont know about these ships in the first place yime pointed out how can you be comforted by something you dont know about ah the bodhisattva said thats the beauty of it only people who do worry are likely to seek out such knowledge and so are suitably reassured they also tend to appreciate the need not to make the knowledge too well known and indeed take additional pleasure in helping to keep it from becoming so everybody else just gets happily on with their lives never fretting in the first place yime shook her head frustrated they cant be completely secret she protested they must be mentioned somewhere the culture was notoriously bad at keeping secrets especially big ones it was one of the very few areas where most of the cultures civilisational peers and even many much less advanced societies thoroughly eclipsed it though being the culture this was regarded as being the legitimate source of a certain perverse pride that didnt stop it the it in such contexts usually meaning contact or even more likely sc from trying to keep secrets every now and again but it never worked for very long though sometimes of course not very long was still long enough well naturally the bodhisattva said lets just say the information is there but little notice is taken and by the very nature of the whole program if one can even dignify it with a name implying such a degree of organisation confirmation is almost impossible to find so this isnt what you might call official yime asked the ship made a sighing noise there is no contact department or committee that i know of which devotes itself to such matters yime pursed her lips she knew when a ship was basically saying lets leave it at that shall we well one more thing to have to take account of so she said the me im counting may be aboard the gsv total internal reflection which is on retreat and is probably one of these forgotten indeed and the me im counting holds an image of ms ybreq probably the image of ms ybreq the bodhisattva said we have intelligence from another individual the ship took an image of subsequently that it was happy to guarantee any image it took remained unique for its own collection only never to be shared or even backed up it would appear that it has stuck to this so you think what that ybreq will attempt to recover her image even though its ten years old it has been judged to be a distinct possibility and quietus knows where the me im counting and the total internal reflection are we believe we have a rough idea more to the point we have occasional contact with a representative of the total internal reflection we do do we the total internal reflection is relatively unusual amongst the forgotten we think in that it plays host to a small population of humans and drones who seek a more than usually severe form of seclusion than the average retreat offers such commitments are usually quite long term in nature decades on average however there is a continual if fluctuating churn in both populations so people need to be ferried to and from the gsv there are three semiregular rendezvous points and a fairly reliable rendezvous programme the next scheduled meeting is in eighteen days at a location in the semsarine wisp ms ybreq should be able to get there in time and so should you and i ms nsokyi does she know about this rendezvous we believe so is she heading in that direction again we believe so hmm yime frowned that is the generality of the situation ms nsokyi a more comprehensive briefing awaits obviously obviously may i take it that you are agreeable to taking part in this mission yes yime said are we under way yet the image of the old hooliganclass warship vanished to be replaced with the sight of stars again some of them reflected in the polishedlooking black body of the ship hanging above and others gleaming through the hardness beneath her feet that looked like nothing at all the stars were moving now yes we are the bodhisattva said lededje was introduced to the avatar of the special circumstances ship falling outside the normal moral constraints in a war bar where the only lighting apart from the screens and holos came from broad curtains of amphoteric lead falling down the walls from slots in the dark ceiling the continual sputtering yelloworange blaze of the reaction gave the light in the place an unsteady flickering quality a lot like firelight and made the space feel stickily warm a strange bitter smell hung in the air lead the element very finely ground just dropped through the air jolicci had muttered to her as theyd entered the place and shed remarked upon the strange sight just getting in hadnt been that easy either the venue was housed in a stubby wornlooking interstellarclass ship housed in one of the gsvs smallbays and the ship itself made it very clear as they stood in the darkly echoing depths of the bay that this was essentially a private club one that the gsv had no immediate jurisdiction over and a place that was certainly not under any obligation to admit anybody who any one of its patrons took exception to my name is jolicci avatar of the armchair traveller jolicci told the single small drone floating by the ships closed lower hatchway i think you know who ive come to see please let him know im doing so the boxy little drone said the ship was called the hidden income it was maybe a hundred metres in length looking round squinting into the gloomily cavernous depths of the bay lededje reckoned the smallbay could have squeezed in at least another three ships the same size without them touching fins or engine pods or whatever all the various bits were small was obviously a relative term when it came to ships and the vast hangars required to accommodate them lededje looked at the little drone hanging in front of them at head height well this was a new experience she thought whenever shed been taken somewhere by veppers the most expensive new restaurant the most exclusive new club bar or venue he and his entourage had always been ushered straight in whether hed had a reservation made or not even to the ones which he didnt own how odd to have to come to the reputedly obsessively egalitarian culture finally to experience the phenomenon of hanging around outside a club waiting to see if shed be allowed in the hatchway dropped without warning immediately behind the little drone it fell so fast she expected a clang when it met the finely ridged floor of the bay but it seemed to cushion its descent at the last moment and landed silently the drone said nothing but it floated out of their way thank you jolicci said as they stepped on jolicci held her arm as the hatch rose smoothly up towards a small barely lit hangar volume inside the hidden income demeisen is a little odd he told her even by ship avatar standards just be honest with him or her or it youre not sure we havent met for a while the falling outside the normal moral constraints changes avatars fairly frequently what is this place anyway jolicci looked awkward war porn club i think lededje would have asked more but they were met by another small drone and escorted into the place demeisen may i present ms lededje ybreq jolicci said to the man sitting at the table near the middle of the room the place looked like a sort of strange restaurant with substantial round tables scattered about each featuring at their centre a trio or more of screens or a tankless holo display a variety of people mostly human sat or lounged around the tables in front of most of them drug bowls drinks glasses chill pipes and small trays of food lay arranged scattered or abandoned the screens and holos all showed scenes of warfare at first lededje assumed they were screen just movies but after a few moments and a few grisly sequences she decided they might be real most of the people in the room werent looking at the screens and holos they were looking at her and jolicci the man jolicci had addressed was at a table with several other young men all of them with that air that implied they were within their own subset of panhuman physiognomy quite strikingly handsome demeisen stood he looked cadaverous hollowcheeked dark eyes with no whites two ridges instead of eyebrows a flat nose and middark skin scarred in places he was only medium tall but his height was emphasised by his thinness if his physiology was the same as a sichultians then the slight bagginess about his face implied the weight loss had been recent and rapid his clothes were dark perhaps black skinny trews and a tightfitting shirt or jacket partially closed at the neck by a thumbsized bloodred glittering jewel on a loosened choker lededje saw him look at her right hand and so put it out to him his hand clasped her hand fingers with too many joints closing around like a bony cage his touch felt very warm almost feverish though perfectly dry like paper she saw him wince and noticed that two of his fingers were crudely splinted together with a small piece of wood or plastic and what looked like a piece of knotted rag somehow the wince didnt travel all the way to his face which regarded her without obvious expression good evening lededje said ms ybreq his voice sounded dry and cold he nodded at jolicci then indicated the seats on either side of him wheloube emmis if you would the two young men seemed about to protest but then did not they rose together with a sort of brisk contempt and walked proudly away she and jolicci took their places the other handsome young men stared at them demeisen waved one hand the tables holo display which had been depicting a gruesomely realistic skirmish between some horsemen and a larger force of archers and other footsoldiers faded to blank a rare privilege demeisen murmured to jolicci how goes the business of general contacting generally well hows life as a security guard demeisen smiled night watching is unfailingly illuminating there was a small gold tube in front of him which lededje had assumed was the mouthpiece of an undertable chill or water pipe there were several other mouthpieces lying or cradled on the table but which proved to be a stick with a glowing end un attached to anything else demeisen put it to his lips and sucked hard the golden tube crackled shortened and left a fiery glowing tip beneath a lofting of silky grey smoke demeisen saw her looking and offered the stick to her a drug from sudalle called narthaque the effect is similar to winnow though harsher less pleasant the hangover can be severe winnow lededje asked she got the impression shed been expected to know what this was demeisen looked both surprised and unimpressed ms ybreq does not possess drug glands jolicci explained really demeisen said he frowned at her are you suffering some form of punishment ms ybreq or are you of that demented persuasion that believes enlightenment is to be found in the shadows neither lededje told him i am more of a barely legal alien she had hoped this might be amusing but if it was nobody round the table seemed to find it so maybe her understanding of marain wasnt as flawless as shed been assuming demeisen looked at jolicci im told the young lady looks for passage she does jolicci said demeisen gestured with both hands sending loops of smoke into the air from the hand holding the golden stick well jolicci for once you have the better of me what on earth gives you the idea that i have turned into a taxi do tell cant wait to hear jolicci just smiled there is a little more to the matter i believe ms ybreq he said to her over to you she looked at demeisen i need to get home sir demeisen glanced at jolicci very taxisounding so far he turned back to her go on ms ybreq i cannot wait for this to achieve escape velocity from the mundanity well i intend to kill a man thats a little more uncommon again though one imagines a taxi would suffice unless the gentleman concerned can only be dispatched using a warship a stateoftheart culture warship at that if i may make so immodest for some reason the word overkill leaps to mind he smiled icily at her you may not be doing quite as well here as you thought you might at this point ive been told that ill be slapdroned so you were stupid enough to let slip that you intend to kill this man he frowned oh dear might i suggest that this does not bode terribly well should your murderous plans include more than the absolute minimum of guile subterfuge or dare i say it intelligence my trust me highly limited empathic capacities remain resolutely unengaged he turned to jolicci again have you quite finished humiliating yourself here jolicci or do you really require me to the man i intend to kill is the richest man in the world the richest and most powerful man in my whole civilisation lededje said even she could hear the edge of desperation creeping into her voice demeisen looked at her one eyecrease raised which civilisation the enablement she told him the sichultian enablement jolicci said demeisen snorted again he told lededje not saying as much as you might think he killed me she told him doing all she could to keep her voice under control murdered me with his own hands we have no soulkeeping technology but i was saved because a culture ship called the me im counting put a neural lace in my head ten years ago i was revented here only today demeisen sighed all very melodramatic your feud may inspire a not terribly good screen presentation at some point in the future hopefully distant i look forward to missing it he smiled thinly again now if you wouldnt mind excusing yourselves he nodded to the two young men whod vacated their seats for lededje and jolicci earlier they were standing nearby now looking on quietly triumphant jolicci sighed im sorry i wasted your time he said as he rose still i hope to make you sorrier demeisen said with an insincere smile i was talking to ms ybreq and i was not demeisen said standing as lededje did he turned to her put the gold smoking stick to his pale lips and pulled hard he looked at her and said best of luck finding a ride as he exhaled he smiled more broadly and ground the yellowred glowing tip of the stick into the open palm of his other hand there was a distinct sizzling noise again his body seemed to flinch though his face remained serene what this he said looking down at the ashdark burn on his skin as lededje stared at it openly aghast dont worry i dont feel a thing he laughed the idiot inside here does though he tapped the side of his head smiled again poor fool won some sort of competition to replace a ships avatar for a hundred days or a year or something similar no control over either body or ship whatsoever obviously but the full experience in other respects sensations for example im told he practically came in his pants when he learned an uptodate warship had volunteered to accept his offer of body host the smile became broader more of a grin obviously not the most zealous student of ship psychology then so demeisen said holding up his hand with the splinted finger and studying it i torment the poor fool he put his other hand to the one with the splinted fingers waggled them his body shuddered as he did so lededje found herself wincing with vicarious pain see powerless to stop me demeisen said cheerily he suffers his pain and learns his lesson while i well i gain some small amusement he looked at jolicci and lededje jolicci he said with obviously feigned concern you look offended he nodded creased his eyes its a good look trust me sour opprobrium suits you jolicci said nothing wheloube and emmis resumed their seats standing there demeisen put out both hands and stroked the hair of one and the shaved head of the other then cradled the finely chiselled chin of the one with the shaved head using his unsplinted hand and fascinatingly the fellow he used his splinted fingers to tap the side of his head again hard is quite defiantly heterosexual with a fear of bodily violation that borders on outright homophobia he looked round the table of young men winking at one of them then gazed radiantly at jolicci and lededje lededje stamped across the floor of the dimly lit smallbay there must be other sc ships she said furiously none that will talk to you jolicci said hurrying after her and the only one that would seemed solely to want to shock and demean me jolicci shrugged the abominator class of general offensive unit to which our friend belongs is not known for its mildness or sociability probably specced when the culture was going through one of its periods of feeling that nobody was taking it seriously because it was somehow too nice even amongst those though that particular ship is known as something of an outlier most sc ships conceal their claws and keep the psychopathy switched to full off except when its judged to be absolutely necessary in the traveltube deflated but calmer lededje said well thank you for trying you are welcome was all that you said in there true every word she looked at him i trust youll treat what you heard just now as in confidence well that is something you might have thought to say beforehand but all right i promise what you said will go no further the fat little avatar looked thoughtful i realise it might not feel like it but you may have just had a narrow escape ms ybreq she looked coldly at him then that makes two this evening doesnt it jolicci appeared unconcerned if anything he looked amused as i said i was never going to let you fall what i did was a stunt what you just saw in there was real the ship would really be allowed to treat a human like that if it was done voluntarily if the bargain was struck with eyes open as it were yes jolicci made an expansive gesture with both hands its what can happen if you put yourself in harms way by treating with sc the fat little avatar appeared to think for a moment perhaps a rather extreme example admittedly lededje took a deep breath let it out i have no terminal may i use you as one feel free who would you like to contact the gsv to tell it ill take its suggested ship tomorrow no need itll be assuming so anyway anybody else admile she said her voice small there was a pause then jolicci shook his head regretfully im afraid he is otherwise engaged lededje sighed she looked at jolicci i desire a meaningless sexual encounter with a male preferably one as goodlooking as one of those young men round demeisens table jolicci smiled then sighed well the night is yet middleaged yime nsokyi lay awake in the darkness of her small cabin waiting for sleep she would give it another few minutes and then gland softnow to bring it on notentirelynaturally she possessed the same suite of drug glands as most culture humans the default set that you tended to be born with but she preferred not to use them unless genuinely necessary and almost never for pleasure only to accomplish something of practical value she might have got rid of them completely she supposed just told them all to wither away and be absorbed into her body but she had chosen not to she knew of some within quietus who had gone through with this in some spirit of denial and asceticism that she thought was taking matters too far also it was arguably more disciplined still to possess the glands but not to use them than it was to remove them and their temptations altogether but then the same might be said of her choice to become neuter she put one hand down between her legs to feel the tiny slotted bud like a third bizarrely placed nipple which was all that was left of her genitals when she had been younger when her drug glands had still been maturing that too had been a way of bringing on sleep masturbate and then drift off in the rosy afterglow she rubbed the tiny bud absently remembering there was no hint of pleasure in touching herself there any more she might as well have caressed a knuckle or an ear lobe in fact there was more sensuality to be found in her ear lobes the nipples of her reduced nearflat breasts were similarly unresponsive oh well she thought clasping her hands over her chest it had been her choice a way of making real to herself her dedication to quietus nunlike she supposed on that reckoning there were a lot of nuns and monks within quietus and of course the decision was entirely reversible she wondered about changing back becoming properly female again she still thought of herself as female always had or she might become male she was exactly poised between the two standard genders she touched the little bud at her groin again just as much like a tiny penis as a relocated nipple she supposed she clasped her hands over her chest once more then sighed turned on her side ms nsokyi the ships voice said quietly yes my apologies i sensed you were still some way from sleep you sensed correctly what i have been asked by a number of my colleagues whether your earlier comment regarding informing special circumstances about the matter in hand represented what one might call a formal suggestion or request she waited a moment before replying no she said it did not i see thank you thats all good night sleep well good night yime wondered whether she ship would even have bothered to ask had she not had the history she did with sc she had been drawn to quietus even when shed been a little girl a serious reserved slightly withdrawn little girl who had been interested in dead things found in the woods and keeping insects in terraria a serious reserved slightly withdrawn little girl who knew that she was easily capable of joining special circumstances if she wanted to but who had only ever wanted to be part of the quietudinal service even then she had known that quietus like restoria and the third of contacts relatively recently specialist services numina which dealt with the sublimed was seen by many people and machines as being second best to special circumstances sc was the pinnacle the service that attracted the absolutely best and brightest of the culture in a society that held few positions of individual power sc represented the ultimate goal for those both blessed and cursed with the sort of vaunting hungry ambition to succeed in the real that could not be bought off by the convincing but ultimately artificial attractions of vr if you genuinely wanted to prove yourself there was no question that sc was where you wanted to be even then still a child she had known she was special known that she was capable of doing pretty much whatever it was possible to do within the culture sc would have seemed like the obvious target for her aims and aspirations but she hadnt wanted to be in sc she wanted to be in quietus the service everybody seemed to feel was a second best it was unfair she had made her decision then way back before her drug glands were developed enough to use with any skill or finesse before she was sexually mature at all she studied trained learned grew a neural lace applied to join contact was accepted applied herself both diligently and imaginatively within contact and all the while waited for the invitation to join sc the invitation duly came and she declined it so joining an exclusive club many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the elite of the elite that was sc itself she applied immediately to quietus instead having made her point and was accepted with alacrity she began to curtail her use of her drug glands and started the slow changes in her body that would turn her from female to neuter she also abandoned her use of the neural lace beginning an even longer process that saw the biomechanical tracery of the device gradually shrink and wither and disappear the minerals and metals that had composed the bulk of it being slowly reabsorbed into her body the last few particles of exotic matter it had contained exited in her urine via the tiny sexless bud between her legs a year later she was free of sc committed to quietus only it could never be that simple there was no sudden yesorno point when it came to joining sc you were sounded out first your intentions were questioned and your motivations and seriousness were weighed in the balance at first through apparently innocuous informal conversations often with people you would have no idea were in any way associated with sc then only later in rather more formalised settings and contexts where scs interest was made clear so in a sense she had had to lie or at least constructively deceive to get what she wanted which was the formal invitation to join which she could then turn down but use in the future as proof that quietus had been no second choice no consolation prize but rather something she had valued beyond the merits of sc right from the start she had finessed it as best she could at the time giving answers that seemed straight and unambiguous when they were given and which only later in the light of that obviously planned refusal revealed a degree of dissemblance still she had been guilty of a lack of openness if nothing else and of simple dishonesty if you were judging severely sc considered itself above bearing grudges but was patently disappointed you did not come to the stage of being asked to join it without establishing quite strong relationships with people who had become mentors and friends while in contact relationships which normally would be expected to go on developing once you were in sc itself and it was to those individuals and even a couple of ship minds that she felt she owed apologies she duly said sorry and the apologies were duly accepted but those had been her darkest hours the moments in her life the memories of which still kept her awake when she wanted to sleep or woke her up in the middle of the night and she could never quite shake the feeling that this was the single leastresolved issue in her life the loose end whose niggling presence would trouble her to the end of her days and even though she had foreseen it it had still come as something of a disappointment to her that her behaviour meant she existed within quietus under a faint but undeniable cloud of suspicion if she would turn down sc to prove a point might she not repudiate quietus too how could you ever fully trust somebody like that and was it not possible that she had never really resigned from sc at all might yime nsokyi not still be a special circumstances agent but a secret one planted within quietus either for reasons too arcane and mysterious to divine until some point of crisis arrived or just as a sort of insurance for some set of circumstances still unenvisaged or even with no clear motive at all beyond establishing that sc could do such a thing simply because it chose to to prove it could she had miscalculated there she had thought the whole bluff with sc would only prove how utterly dedicated to quietus she was and her subsequent flawless behaviour and exemplary service would serve to reinforce the point it hadnt worked out like that she was of more value to quietus as a symbol subtly but effectively publicised of its equality of worth with sc than she was as a functioning and fully trusted quietus operative so she spent a lot of time frustrated unused twiddling her thumbs and kicking her heels when she might have been kicking other peoples ass with sc as at least one of her friends had pointed out she had taken part in a few missions for quietus and had been reassured that she had done well indeed near perfectly still she was less used than she might have been less used than inferior talents who had joined at the same time less used than her skills and abilities would have implied she ought to be offered occasional scraps never anything of real substance until now now at last she felt she was being asked to behave like a true quietus operative on a mission of genuine importance even if it might only be because where she lived happened to be quite close to the place where a quietus agent was suddenly required well arguably shed had bad luck in the way quietus had chosen to react to her attempt to prove how much she valued it maybe that bad luck was just being balanced now luck came into it even sc recognised a place for chance and being in the right place at the right time was if not a gift certainly a blessing contact even had a phrase for it utility is seveneighths proximity yime sighed turned over and fell asleep eleven auer lovely to see you radiant as ever and fuleow this gorgeous creature still putting up with you so far veppers got your eye on her yourself have you never taken it off you know that fuleow veppers clapped the other mans stout shoulder and winked at his slender wife oh your poor nose auer said pushing back locks of sootblack hair to display glittering earrings poor nonsense never richer veppers flicked one finger against the new cover over his nose which was still slowly growing back underneath this is pure gold he smiled turned away sapultride good to see you glad you could make it whats it look like under there sapultride asked nodding at veppers nose he pulled down his sunglasses revealing small green eyes above his own thin expensively sculpted nose i was studying medicine before i was lassoed back into the family firm he said i could take a look wouldnt be shocked my dear sapultride it looks great under this face facts i look better mutilated than most men do at their very best whole and hearty after a long day in the grooming salon jasken sapultrides wife jeussere said to the man standing behind veppers one arm in a cast and a sling did you really do this to our dear lovely veppers i regret to say so maam jasken said bowing gently to the slim exquisitely dressed and manicured woman he pushed his slung arm out a little mr veppers more than had his revenge though what a blow he his revenge jeussere said a tiny frown spoiling her otherwise quite perfect face the story i heard was that he struck first he did maam jasken said aware that veppers was watching him it was only his shock at having hit me so sharply and his natural urge to stop putting up his sword and inquiring to make sure that he had not injured me too severely that allowed me the opportunity to deliver my own blow the one that more by luck than skill so assaulted mr veppers nose jeussere smiled conspiratorially you are too modest jasken not so maam what you werent wearing masks sapultride asked veppers snorted masks are for weaklings arent they jasken perhaps sir or for those of us who have such a lack of looks that we cant afford to lose even a little of them unlike your good self veppers smiled my veppers jeussere said slyly do you have all your servants flatter you so absolutely not i work to prevent it veppers told her but the truth will out jeussere laughed delicately youre lucky he didnt run you through jasken she told him her eyes wide she slipped her arm through her husbands sappy here beat joiler at some sport at school and he near throttled him didnt he dear ha he tried sapultride said running a finger round his collar nonsense veppers said turning to somebody else raunt you ancient withered old rogue that committee still hasnt jailed you yet whove you had to bribe nobody that you havent already got to veppers and hilfe still an accessory more of a bauble joiler the woman much younger than her husband though still in expensively wellpreserved middleage coolly regarded his nose well now dear me think youll still be able to sniff out trouble better than ever he told her im sure anyway good to see you back in the land of the sociable she held one hand out to be kissed cant have you hiding away what shall we all do for fun you tell him he spends too much time away on business trips jeussere contributed leaning in my only aim is to keep your good selves entertained veppers told the two women ah peschl well have a word later yes certainly joiler jasken put one finger to an ear bud the boats are ready sir they are good he looked round the other people in the slim barge he clapped his hands stopping most of the other conversations in the open vessel lets enjoy the fun shall we he raised his hands above his head clapped them again loudly listen he hollered attracting the attention of people in the other two barges behind your attention please place your bets choose your favourites our game begins there was some cheering he took his place in the seat raised just a little higher than the rest in the bows of the slim craft astil veppers butler saw to his masters needs while other servants moved down the central aisles of the barges dispensing drinks above the seated vips sun canopies rippled in the breeze in the distance over treedotted pastureland the serried neatness of the kitchen orchards and the formal gardens of the estate the turrets and ornamental battlements of the mansion house of espersium were visible some birds flew up from the network of small lakes ponds and channels beneath the great torusshaped mansion of espersium sat near the centre of the estate of the same name espersium was easily the largest private estate in the world had it been a country its land area would have ranked it as the fiftyfourth largest out of the sixtyfive states that still had some administrative significance in the unified world that was sichult it was the centre of and central to the veppers family fortune in more than merely symbolic ways the original source of the familys vast wealth had been computer and screen games followed by increasingly immersive and convincing virtual reality experiences sims games proactive fictions and multiplyshared adventures as well as further games of every sort and every level of intricacy from those given away as free samples on smartpaper food wrappers through those playable on devices as small as watches or jewellery all the way to those which demanded either total bodily immersion in semiliquid processor goo or the more simple but even more radical softtohardwiring of biological brain to computational substrate the house had long been ringed with comms domes kept just out of sight of the house itself but linking it and the buried masses of computer substrate it sat on via satellites and systemedge relaystations to further distant processor cores and servers all over the hundreds of planets that made up enablement space and even beyond to similar if as a rule not quite so developed civilisat ions that with surprisingly little translation and alteration found the games of the veprine corporation just as enjoyable and fascin ating as sichultians themselves had still zealously guarding their original code many of those games effectively reported back eventually via all those intervening arrays servers processors and substrates to the still potent seat of power that was espersium from the estate house itself whole worlds and systems could be rewarded or punished according to how assiduously the local lawenforcement agencies applied antipiracy legislation billions of users could be granted access to the latest upgrades tweaks and bonus levels and lucrative personal online and ingame behaviour preference and predilection data could be either used by the veprine corporation itself or sold on to other interested parties either of a governmental or commercial nature word had it that this sort of micromanaged operationality was no longer quite so centrally controlled and the house had ceased to be the place that all versions of all games came to to get their latest updates certainly there were fewer obvious satellite domes and programming geeks about the place than in the old days but it was still much more than just a fancy country house the birds disturbed from the network of waterways beneath the barges wheeled in the sky calling plaintively the little convoy of barges moved along a network of aqueducts poised above the watery landscape below a couple of dozen skinny stone towers anchored the supporting stonework of delicate arches and flying buttresses which held the airborne canals aloft at each of the towers the viaducts broadened out into circular basins collaring the slim spires and allowing the barges individually or joined as a tiny fleet to change direction onto other channels half a dozen thicker towers held lifts within them and had quaysides where people could embark and disembark from the barges the viaducts were only a couple of metres wide with thin stone walls and no walkways alongside so that one could look almost straight down twenty metres beneath in the channels pools and lakes below a dozen miniature battleships were just setting out from their individual start positions each warship was the length of a large singleperson canoe and had been designed to resemble a capital ship from the age when armour plate and largecalibre guns had ruled the seas of sichult each ship contained a man who powered his vessel by pedalling turning a single propeller at the stern steered it with a tiller attached to a bracket round his waist and used his hands to aim and fire the three or four gun turrets his ship carried each equipped with two or three guns where the bridge would have been on the superstructure of the fullsize vessels there was a series of slits very like those in an ancient armoured helmet from the days of swords lances and arrows these provided the only way for the man inside the vessel to see out gun aiming was accomplished by nothing more sophisticated than dead reckoning and skill the crewman of the miniature warship traversing the turrets and elevating their guns by way of a set of wheels and levers contained within his cramped compartment each ship also came equipped with a set of miniature torpedoes and a system of lights the searchlights of the original ships that let the vessels communicate with each other to form temporary alliances and swap information pennants flew from their masts identifying who commanded them the crewmen were far more highly trained than mere jockeys veppers contended he had piloted the ships himself quite often from when he had first come up with the idea and still held the occasional amateursonly battle for himself and similarly rich and competitive friends but the truth was there was a great deal of skill involved more than it was worth acquiring for a mere pastime these days the amateur versions of the ships were fitted with engines which made life a little easier but it was still taxing enough just manoeuvring the damned things without running aground or crashing into the banks of the channels never mind the surprisingly difficult task of aiming the guns accurately the amateur versions had better armour and less powerful weapons than the ships they were watching now two ships caught a brief glimpse of each other from either end of a long channel connecting pools close to their start positions disappearing from view again they each elevated and fired their guns towards where they thought the other would shortly be more in hope than with any expectation of a hit both sets of shells landed scattered amongst the low grassy hills of islands in miniature reed beds and in the channels raising skinny spouts of water neither part of either salvo landed closer than a ship length from its intended target something of a waste veppers muttered watching through a pair of field glasses are the bullets terribly expensive jeussere asked veppers smiled no i mean they only have so many do they load the guns themselves fuleow asked no automatic veppers said the ships main weapons were almost more like grenade launchers than true guns certainly they had nothing like the range they should have had had that too been scaled proportionately the little shells they fired fizzed and left a trail of smoke as they curved out across the waters but they were explosive and could do real damage piercing the armour of a ship and starting a fire within or hitting near the waterline holing them so that they started to sink or disabling turrets or the rudder or prop if they hit the right place a handful of pilots had been killed over the years either struck by lucky shots that squeezed through the viewing slits or drowning when their vessel turned over and the damage they had sustained had made it impossible to work the escape hatches or choking or burned to death usually you could put out a fire by scuttling your ship the channels pools and most of the single large lake were generally little more than half a metre deep so the command citadel where the pilots head was would still be just above water even when the ship was sitting on the bottom but valves jammed or men were knocked unconscious and accidents happened there were rescue teams of helpers and divers standing by but they were not infallible twice ships had blown up completely the contents of their magazines detonating all at once most spectacular though on one occasion fragments of wreckage had flown far enough to threaten the spectators which had been worrying the pilots all part of veppers general staff with other parttime duties were well paid especially if they won their battles and the risk of real injury and even death made the sport more interesting for the spectators todays match was a team game two ships to a side the winning team being whoever was first to sink four of their opponents the first thing the six sets of ships had to do was find each other each ship started individually from one of the dozen floating boathouses scattered round the perimeter of the watery complex at any of several dozen randomly chosen locations the miniature naval battle itself ship against ship or fleet against fleet guns flashing and roaring smoke drifting shots landing pieces getting blown off the ships fountains of water bursting into the air when a torpedo hit was only part of the delight of watching veppers found much of the enjoyment came from having this godlike overview of the whole battle arena and being able to see what the men in the ships couldnt see most of the islands and the channel banks were too high to see over when you were sitting in one of the miniature battleships however from the network of aqueducts above pretty much every part of the watery maze could be seen it could be almost unbearably exciting to see ships converging on the same pool from different directions or to watch a damaged vessel limping home and nearly there being caught by another ship lying in wait for it you should have smoke you know veppers fuleow told him as they all watched the ships cruise down the channels leading away from their starting points they went at different speeds some favouring high speed to get to some tactically important pool or junction before anybody else some favouring a more stealthy approach where the geography allowed you could learn a lot by causing few waves yourself but watching for signs of the wakes of others as you passed side channels you know from their funnels that would make it look more realistic dont you think smoke veppers said raising the pair of binoculars to his eyes yes sometimes we have smoke and they can put down smokescreens he lowered the glasses smiled at fuleow who had not been to one of these displays before makes it hard to see from up here though thats the trouble fuleow nodded ah of course dont you think you ought to have pretty little bridges linking all the islands auer asked veppers looked at her pretty little bridges between the islands she said little arched bridges you know bowed it would look so much prettier little too unrealistic veppers informed her smiling insincerely also theyd get in the way of the shells too many ricochets there are wading routes between the islands for when the staff need to access them sort of submerged paths ah i see just a thought veppers went back to watching his own two ships they had been started far enough apart for it all to look convincingly random though a quiet word had been had to let the two pilots know where the other was starting out from so they were beginning with a slight advantage over the other five teams their pennants were silver and blue the veppers family colours one of his ships chanced upon one of the red team powering down a channel forming the stem of a tjunction just as the other vessel was crossing ahead allowing it to loose a salvo from its a and b turrets veppers always favoured ships with two forwardfacing turrets and one rearfacing it seemed more attacking more adventurous it also meant that a broadside consisted of nine shells rather than eight it was the first proper engagement of the afternoon cheers rang out as the targeted ship rocked to one side under the fusillade bits of superstructure spun off the vessel as it lost its signalling lights two dark holes appeared near the waterline at midships veppers ordered a round of celebratory cocktails for all arriving at the next tower with its encircling girdle of water and choice of three different viaducts to take the three barges split up and went their separate ways veppers was in control of the first barge steering it with pedals at his feet and ignoring the pleas of his passengers to watch the ships theyd placed bets on so that he could watch the progress of his own vessels there was a roar and some ladylike screams from some distance away as another two ships met sideon just beneath but even closer than in the first engagement one rammed the other forcing it sideways onto a sandbank through the attacking vessels momentum and trapping it there firing pointblank into its superstructure shells whizzed away ricocheting the grounded vessel brought all four twingun turrets to bear and let off a broadside that blasted into the other ships command citadel where the torso shoulders and head of the opposing pilot would be veppers watching through his binoculars made a whistling noise that looks like it could well hurt raunt said the poor mans just inside there auer said they sit in an armoured tub veppers told her and they wear flak vests yes jasken he said as the other man leaned in towards him enhancing oculenses glittering in the sunlight the house sir jasken said quietly nodding veppers frowned wondering what he was talking about he looked towards the distant mansion and saw a small dark arrowhead shape lowering itself towards the central courtyard he brought the binoculars up in time to see the familiar alien craft disappearing behind the stonework he put the field glasses down fuck he said chooses his moments shall i ask him to wait jasken said his mouth very close to veppers ear no i want the news good or bad call sulbazghi get him to come too he looked behind they were a lot closer to the tower to their rear than the one ahead theyd disembark there he put the barge into full astern sorry ladies gentlemen he shouted over questions and protests duty calls i must go but i shall return to collect my winnings i imagine sapultride youre captain splendid do i get a special hat so have we decided exactly what it is veppers asked he jasken dr sulbazghi and xingre the jhlupian were in the shielded windowless drawing room in the subbasement of the espersium mansion which veppers used for especially secret meetings or delicate negotiations somewhat to veppers surprise it was xingre the usually reticent jhlupian who spoke the translation filtering from the silvery cushion the alien sat upon voice pitched to the scratchy tinkly tones it favoured i believe it to be consistent with an intermembranial fullspectrum cranialeventstate germinatory processor matrix with singular condensatecollapse indefinitedistance signalling ability level eight player in manufacture bilateral carboniform panhuman subdesign veppers stared at the twelvelimbed creature its three stalk eyes stared back one dipped down let itself be cleaned and wetted by its mouth parts then flipped jauntily upright again the alien had returned with the thing that had been in the girls head the thing that might or might not be a neural lace xingre had had its own techs analyse the device using jhlupian technology if veppers was being honest with himself he would have to admit that over the handful of days that the device had been with the jhlupians he had quite happily let thoughts of the thing and its implications slip from his mind jasken had been unable to establish any more useful facts about it beyond what they already knew and on the couple of occasions they had talked about it they had largely convinced themselves that it must be a fake or just something else maybe alien maybe not that had somehow found its way into the furnace the alien extended one bright green limb towards sulbazghi giving him the device back inside a little transparent cylinder the doctor looked at veppers who nodded sulbazghi poured the shimmering bluegrey thing into his palm my dear xingre veppers said after a moment with a tolerant smile i think i understood every single word you said there but sadly only as single words put together like that they made no sense at all what are you talking about he looked at jasken who was frowning mightily i told you the alien said probably it is what remains of an intermembranial fullspectrum cranialeventstate germinatory yes yes veppers said as i say i heard the words let me translate said sulbazghi its a culture neural lace youre sure this time jasken asked looking from the doctor to the alien certainly level eight player in manufacture xingre said but who put it in her veppers asked definitely not the clinicians sulbazghi shook his head definitely not agreed the jhlupian said not then who what who could have nobody else that we know of sulbazghi said level eight player manufacture is absolutely certain xingre said level eight player socalled culture manufacture likely to ratio of one hundred and fortythree out of one hundred and fortyfour in total almost certainly in other words the doctor said i suspected it was from the start its culture only to ratio of one hundred and fortythree out of one hundred and fortyfour chances xingre pointed out again additionally device implantation might have occurred at any time from immediately subsequent to birth event to within last two local years approximately but not closer to present probably also only remains of very most fine cilialike twiggings likely burned off in furnace but the kicker sulbazghi said is in the onetime signalling capacity xingre bounced once on its silvery cushion the jhlupian equivalent of a nod singular condensatecollapse bievent indefinitedistance signalling ability it said used signalling veppers said he wasnt sure if he was simply being slow here or if a deep part of him just didnt want to know what might be the truth he already had the feeling he usually got before people delivered particularly bad news it didnt signal her he heard his own voice trail off as he looked again at the tiny nearly weightless thing that lay in his palm mindstate jasken said it might have signalled her mindstate her soul to somewhere else somewhere in the culture malfunction rate of said process betrays ratio of equal to or higher than four out of one hundred and fortyfour in total xingre said and that really is possible veppers asked looking at all three of them in turn i mean total full transferring of a real persons consciousness this isnt just a cosy myth or alien propaganda jasken and sulbazghi looked at the alien which sat floating silently for a short while then suddenly fixing them with the gaze from one eye each seemed to realise it was the one they all expected to answer yes it blurted positively a full affirmation and bringing them back to life they can do that too veppers asked xingre was quicker this time after a moment when nobody else answered it said yes also most possible availability of appropriate and compatible processing and physique substrate shell being assumed veppers sat for a moment i see he said he put the neural lace down on the glass top of a nearby table letting it drop from a halfmetre up to see what noise it made it seemed to fall slightly too slowly and landed silently bad luck veppers sapultride told him when he got back to the naval battle both your ships got sunk twelve lededje ybreq the avatar sensia said may i introduce chanchen kallierfalpise barchendra drenskoyne kallierfalpise for short the drone itself said dipping in the air in what she guessed was the equivalent of a bow or nod though ill happily answer to kall or even just kp the machine floated in the air in front of her it was about big enough to sit comfortably on two outspread hands a creamcasinged mostly smooth device that looked like something youd find on the work surface of an intimidatingly wellequipped kitchen and wonder what its function was it was surrounded by a vague misty halo that appeared to be various mixtures of yellow green and blue according to the angle this would be its aura field the drone equivalent of facial expression and body language there to convey emotions she nodded pleased to meet you she told it so youre my slapdrone kallierfalpise rocked back in the air as though hit please thats a little pejorative if i may say so ms ybreq ill be accompanying you principally for your own convenience and protection im she began then was interrupted by the young man standing at her side my lovely led he said im sorry i cant wave you farewell properly but i must go let me he took her hand kissed it then after a shake of his head and a wide smile he held her head in both hands and kissed her face in a variety of places he was called shokas and while he had proved an attentive and sensitive lover he had been impossible to shake off come the morning hed said he had other things he had to do that day but had insisted on accompanying her here despite protests mmm she said noncommittally as he kissed her she prised his hands from her face a pleasure shokas she told him i dont suppose we shall ever meet again shh he said placing a finger to her lips and his other hand on his chest as he half closed his eyes and shook his head however i must go he said backing off but keeping hold of her hand until the last moment you wonderful girl he looked round the others winked wonderful girl he told them then sighed deeply turned and walked quickly for the traveltube doors well that was one less she hadnt expected so many people jolicci was there too standing smiling at her she was in a mediumbay of the gsv on a wide gantry fifty metres up a side wall from the deck the view in front of her filled by the pinkhulled bulk of the fast picket the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory near three hundred relatively slim metres of ancient warship now turned to more peaceful duties such as ferrying people about the galaxy when they were heading for points not covered by the cultures more routine transportation arrangements the ship was supposed to be fifteen hundred years old but appeared brand spanking new and to her still looked like a round windowless skyscraper laid on its side its rear threefifths was a single great cylinder its pale pinkness chevroned with brown this was its engine seemingly another substantial section held various mostly sensory systems and the roughly conical section at the front would have held weapons when it had been a psychopathclass rapid offensive unit the crew section a thick band on the central spindle squeezed in between the engine and the systems section looked small for the thirty or so people who would once have formed its crew but generous for one it had produced a single solidlooking plug of doorway twenty metres long which had moved smoothly out towards them then dropped gently down to the gantrys floor level to provide a sort of gangplank affording access to the vessel the ships own avatar was another drone a little bigger boxy and more throwntogetherlooking than kallierfalpise shall we she said to it certainly the drone floated to one side and picked up the two small cases of clothes assorted toiletries and so on which sensia had given her farewell lededje sensia said lededje smiled at her thanked her accepted a hug then bade a slightly more formal goodbye to jolicci she turned towards the ship just in time let me be the last to wish you bon voyage a voice said behind her she turned to find demeisen strolling from the traveltube entrance smiling thinly he looked a little less haggard and dishevelled than when lededje had seen him the evening before the red jewel at his neck glittered under the lights sensia glared at him i thought you left earlier i did leave earlier my gracious hostess i am currently some eighty years or so distant on an acutely divergent course and travelling only slightly more rapidly than your good self though still just about within realtime control range at least for something as intrinsically slowreacting as a human host all of which i would hope youre well aware of youre abandoning your puppet here then jolicci said i am demeisen agreed i thought now would be as appropriate an occasion as any other to return the fucker to the wild i have heard some disturbing reports regarding your treatment of this human youre using ship sensia said lededje looked at the gsvs avatar for a small fraillooking lady with frizzy blonde hair she seemed suddenly invested with a steeliness lededje found herself glad was not directed at her demeisen turned to sensia all above board dear thing i have the relevant releases signed by his own fair hand in blood admittedly but signed what was i to use engine oil he looked puzzled and turned to jolicci do we even have engine oil i dont think we do do we enough jolicci said say goodbye and release your hold now before i do it for you sensia said levelly that would be impolite demeisen said pretending shock ill suffer the injury to my reputation the gsvs avatar said coolly the cadaverous humanoid rolled his eyes before turning to lededje and smiling broadly my every best wish for your journey ms ybreq he said i hope i did not alarm you unduly with my little display last night i get into character sometimes find it hard to know when im causing distress my apologies if any are required if not then please accept them in any event on account to be banked against any future transgressions so perhaps we shall meet again until then farewell he bowed deeply when he came upright he looked quite changed his face was set differently and his body language had altered subtly too he blinked looked around then stared blankly at lededje and then at the others is that it he said he stared at the ship in front of him where is this is that the ship there demeisen jolicci said moving closer to the man who was looking down at himself and feeling his neck under his chin ive lost weight he muttered then he looked at jolicci what he looked at sensia and lededje has it happened yet have i been the avatar sensia smiled reassuringly and took him by the arm yes sir i believe you have she began to lead him towards the traveltube and made a beggingyourleave gesture to jolicci and lededje before turning away but i cant remember anything really oh dear however that may be a blessing but i wanted memories something to remember well lededje heard sensia say before the doors of the traveltube capsule closed lededje nodded to an unsmiling jolicci and walked along the level granitesolid gangplank towards the ship followed by the ships drone and the creamy presence of her slapdrone the fast picket the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory slipped away from the gsv sense amid madness wit amidst folly slung out in a great elongated nest of fields that decelerated it to speeds the fast pickets engines could cope with to lededje who was used to fighter planes being faster than passenger jets and powerboats overtaking liners this seemed wrong somehow scale the boxylooking shipdrone told her as she stood and it and kallierfalpise floated in the main lounge watching a wall screen showing the silvery dot that was the gsv disappearing into the distance the dot and the swirl of stars shown beyond it started to track across the screen as the the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory began its long turn to head for arm oneone neartip and the ruprine cluster with ship engines there are advantages that come with scale bigger is better confirmed kallierfalpise the silvery dot and the whole great sweep of stars moved faster and faster across the screen apparent motion accelerating as the fast picket wheeled about heading threequarters of the way back in the direction the gsv had come from let me show you to your cabin the ships drone said they set course for sichult the journey was due to take about ninety days lededjes cabin taking up the space of four of the originals was spacious and beautiful if somewhat minimalist compared to what she was used to back home veppers didnt believe in minimalism he thought it smacked of a lack of imagination or money or both the bathroom was similar in size to the cabin and had a transparent spherical bath for which she suspected she was going to need instructions kallierfalpise followed her and the ships drone around floating a metre or so to her side just visible at the corner of her eye as she inspected the cabin she turned and faced it once the ships own drone had left i think ill get some more sleep she told the slapdrone allow me the creamcoloured machine said and the bed another of the scoopplusintelligentsnowflakefeathers design she was becoming used to fluffed up like a curiously localised snowstorm in one corner of the cabin they were called billow beds apparently thank you she said you dont need to stay are you sure the little machine asked i mean obviously while were aboard ship thats fine but once we arrive anywhere else i would be derelict in my duty if i didnt remain where i might be of most immediate protective use especially while youre asleep it might be best for us both to get used to that arrangement dont you think no she said i prefer my privacy i see the machine bobbed in the air its aura field going greyblue well as i say while were aboard ship excuse me the door shushed closed behind it ahem is the accepted interrupter i believe so ahfuckinghem she opened her eyes to find herself looking sideways at a man sitting crosslegged on the floor about two metres away near the centre of the cabin he was dressed in the same dark clothes demeisen had worn and as she blinked trying to confirm to herself that she was really seeing what she appeared to be seeing she realised that he looked like a healthier filledout version of the gaunt figure whod bade her farewell only a few hours earlier she sat up aware of the bed feathers swirling neatly about her tidying themselves out of the way she was glad she had worn pyjamas less glad now that she had got rid of the slapdrone demeisen raised one long finger wait a mo you might need this the word simulation glowed in red letters in marian this time at the lower limit of her field of vision what the hell is going on she said she pulled her knees up to her chin for a dizzying instant she was back in her bedroom in the town house in ubruater a decade earlier im not really here demeisen said winking at her you havent seen me right he laughed spread his arms looked about the cabin do you have any idea how highly fucking irregular this is he put his elbows on his knees rested his chin on his tented fingers too long too multiply jointed they looked like a cage this poor old stager thinks its still some sort of hotshot fucking warship with a few of its systems removed and most of the others improved no more chance of somebody having a private chat with a passenger than i dont know it hitting a space reef or something what are you talking about she asked she looked around the cabin the word simulation followed her gaze like a subtitle demeisens face sort of scrunched up not that theres any such thing running aground on an asteroid maybe whatever anyway he said hello again bet you didnt expect to see me again so soon or ever well quite also bet youre wondering why im here she waggled a finger towards her lower face as she looked at him can you get rid of he snapped his fingers it was an unsettlingly sharp loud sound she almost jumped there he said the word simulation vanished thank you why are you here if only apparently to make you an offer what to be your next abused avatar he grimaced again oh that was all just to upset jolicci you saw the guy i was inhabiting i released him in front of you he was fine id even fixed his fingers and everything didnt you notice this morning she hadnt and anyway he did agree to everything not that i really abused him in the first place did he say anything when i released him did he i didnt bother to send any surveillance backup and i havent asked the samwaf so i honestly dont know what happened after i pulled out did he make any allegations he couldnt remember anything at all he wasnt even sure hed been an avatar he thought maybe it was about to happen demeisen waved his arms well there you are there you are what that proves nothing yes it does if id really been sneaky id have left the dumb fuck with a batch of implanted false memories full of whatever contactwank fantasies hed been imagining before he took the gig in the first place he waved one hand in a blur of toolong fingers anyway were getting off the point here you need to hear my offer she raised one brow do i he smiled it was the first time hed smiled she thought when it actually looked like he meant it fine attempt at dismissive insouciance he told her but yes you do all right what is it come with me not right now necessarily but come with me where to sichult back to your home im already going there yes but very slowly and with a slapdrone in tow plus theyre going to try to distract you how are they going to distract me by telling you theyve found the ship with your full body image the me im counting which they sort of have so its not a lie but theyre hoping youll want to detour to get your old body back or have the tattoo stuff copied onto your present body or some such nonsense which will mean a serious delay especially travelling in this antique perhaps ill want to do that anyway she said she felt a pang of something like loss and hope together wouldnt it be good to see her old true self even if she wouldnt want to regain her mark maybe ever but certainly not until shed returned and got as close to veppers as she could and done her damnedest to kill him makes no difference demeisen said scything one hand through the air ill fucking take you there if you insist on going still be quicker point is stay on this thing and youll get home in not less than ninety days and with a slapdrone dogging your every step whereas he rocked forward on his crossed legs looked suddenly serious and said whereas come with me and ill get you there in twentynine days with no funspoiling chaperone to hobble you no slapdrone none and no mistreatment of me i mean the way you mistreated that poor man including mistreatment i forget about he frowned you still on about that of course no mistreatment i swear she thought after a moment she said would you help me kill veppers he put his head back and laughed loudly the simulation did a convincing job of making his laughter echo round the generously proportioned cabin ah if only he said shaking his head you can cause your own major assassinatory incident sweetheart without making it a diplomatic one involving the culture you cant offer me any help at all im offering to get you there quicker and without the fucking slapdrone but no help in doing what i want to do when i get there he slapped himself on the forehead fuck me what more do you want she shrugged help with killing him he put one longfingered hand over his eyes for a moment well he said on an inward breath taking his hand away and looking at her that is the only catch much as id like to offer you one of my own drones or a knife missile or some magic forcefield buttons for your cardigan or an enchanted gusset or whatever the fuck for protection if nothing else i cant because in the unlikely event you do waste this fucker or try to but fail a much more plausible scenario if were being honest here and they find any culture tech on you suddenly we look like the bad guys and hilarious though that would be in so many ways obviously even i draw the line at that sort of shit unless im requested to by a properly constituted committee of my strategically informed intellectual superiors naturally that would be entirely different so why offer to help me at all he grinned for my own amusement to see what you get up to to annoy the samwaf and jolicci and all the other constipated smugmeisters of contact and also because im heading in that direction anyway he lifted both eyebrow creases dont ask why and how do you know all this you told me quite a lot of it last night babe the rest he spread his arms again im just well connected i know minds that know stuff specifically exactly this sort of stuff youre part of special circumstances he waggled one hand technically no ships or minds really are not in an organised hierarchic signedupfortheduration kind of way all that any of us can ever do is just help out as best we can making whatever small contribution we are able to as specific timelimited opportunities present themselves but yes he sighed somewhere between patiently and in exasperation look i dont have for ever even this bumpkin of a taxi will twig to me being here eventually so im going to go you have a think the offer stands for the next eight hours local midnight after that i really need to dash on ahead but just you wait theyll spring this meetup with the me im counting or something representing it he sat back nodding semsarine wisp thats the name to look out for the semsarine wisp he flapped one long hand at her you can go back to sleep now she woke with a start sat up the cabin lights reacted to her movement turning slowly up from near total darkness to a pervasive gentle glow the noise of the ship made a distant shushing noise all about her she lay back down in her little organised storm of wellbehaved snowflakes after a few moments the lights faded away too whereabouts hmm where would this rendezvous take place she asked kallierfalpise they were in a part of the ships lounge shaped like a giant bay window she sat at a table eating a meal that was part breakfast part early supper a breeze blew about her bringing smells of the ocean she had rolled the cuffs of her pyjamas up to feel the soft warm wind on her calves and forearms the concave wall around her impersonated the view of a bluegreen cloudless sky a ruffled green ocean and snowwhite breakers crashing onto the pale blue sand of a wide deserted beach framed by gently swaying trees even the floor beneath her bare feet was taking part in the illusion ridging and roughening to become a convincing impression of polished but uneven wooden boards just like youd find at a beachside villa or resort somewhere nice and hot and far away shed almost finished the plate of completely unidentifiable but perfectly delicious fresh fruits shed been ravenous theres a place in a part of the sky called the semsarine wisp the little drone told her as though she really didnt need to bother her pretty little head about such boring details thats where the rendezvous is expected to take place mmhmm she drank some water sloshed it round her teeth the drone floating over the table near her right hand was silent for a moment as though thinking youve youve heard of it she swallowed the water dabbed at her mouth with a fluidsoft napkin she gazed out at the fake view of the beach and sea then looked at the little creamcoloured drone and smiled would you ask the ship to contact the general offensive unit falling outside the normal moral constraints please what why go on say its irregular irregular is the very least of what it is its rude it is suspicious the boxy ships drone swivelled in midair turning away from the grinning figure of demeisen to point itself at lededje ms ybreq it said frostily i cannot emphasise strongly enough that i think this would be a profoundly unwise move frankly even a stupid and dangerous one im sorry to be so blunt it glanced at demeisen i thought you had seen something of how this person this ship is liable to treat innocent human beings i cannot believe that you are even contemplating such a hazardous and foolhardy choice hmm lededje said nodding at this you know i think ill leave these bags behind she frowned down at the two small cases sensia had given her they sat at her feet in the ships main lounge demeisen stood at her side the two drones floated in front of them she turned at demeisen you can provide me of course ms ybreq kallierfalpise said sounding like it was trying to remain calm obviously i shall be coming with you obviously the ships drone agreed traversing to point at demeisen there was only the faintest of pauses eh oh yes obviously demeisen said nodding strenuously ah you agree then kallierfalpise said flicking to look straight at demeisen i accompany ms ybreq i would have it no other way demeisen said solemnly just so the little drones aura field glowed an agreeable pink it turned smoothly back to lededje as we all agree then i shall be coming with you still charged of course with protecting you mostly from yourself demeisen said with a quick grin he bowed his head and held up one hand as the little creamcoloured drones field flashed a bright grey sorry he said however kallierfalpise continued i too am very much of the opinion that this is nevertheless a foolish dangerous and unnecessary move please i beg you reconsider lededje smiled at it she looked at the ships drone thank you for all your help she told it she turned to demeisen again ready when you are ill prepare a shuttle the shipdrone said demeisen flapped one hand well displace has ms ybreq been informed there is a chance displacements can be bad for you demeisen said with a sigh yes ive read her her last rights kallierfalpises fields went frosty grey again you did not think to ask me if i consent to being displaced when a far more intrinsically safe method of transferring us between ships exists to hand demeisen rolled his eyes fine you take the shuttle you rough tough little protectionandintervention drone ill displace the squidgy bag of guts gas and fluids that is the painfully vulnerable but patently unafraid human being frankly i wouldnt trust you to wait for me the little drone said i shall displace along with ms ybreq within the same containment field if you please fuck me demeisen breathed hoity and toity fine well do it your way he pointed at the ships drone tell you what grandpa why dont you do the fucking displace you move them both over to me i was going to suggest that anyway the shipdrone said coldly right demeisen said sounding exasperated can we get going now your venerableness here might be going flat out but im barely strolling getting antsy here excuse me the little creamcoloured drone said as it floated closer to lededje and upended itself to press gently in against her stomach she wore another set of the trews and top she had grown fond of since waking in this body you are sure you dont want to take your luggage quite sure she said both ready the shipdrone asked entirely so yes after you the shipdrone said to demeisen see you over there he said to lededje then a silver ovoid enclosed him it winked to nothing an instant later lededje briefly found herself staring at a distorted version of her own face the ships drone tipped back to look up at the ceiling which was where the protectionandintervention drone kallierfalpise had floated the instant the displacement containment field around it and lededje ybreq had flicked out of existence kallierfalpise listing badly bumped randomly along the ceiling a few times for all the world like an escaped party balloon partly deflated its aura field displayed the colours of oil floating on water shao shumshanshinaw sholowalowa shuw shuwha it mumbled the boxylooking shipdrone used its own light effector unit to administer the equivalent of a slap kallierfalpise trembled against the ceiling fixtures then dropped sideslipping it flashed a strident yelloworange for an instant then it seemed to shake itself it straightened floating down to the same level as the shipdrone its aura field glowing white with anger meatfucker if its any comfort the shipdrone sent i dont even know how it did that its not as though it let you land and then spat you straight back fucking thing jumped my displace midthrow i wasnt even aware we could do that thats downright worrying did you put anything on the girl on and in best bits and pieces i was given im just waiting to there was a flicker of silver directly over the shipdrone followed by a tiny clapping noise as the incoming displacement field collapsed a bitty rain of tiny components seemingly little more than dust some hairthin threads and a few grains of sand floated down through the air to be caught and held by a maniple field the drone extended above itself ah it sent here they are now it made a show of bouncing the maniple field up and down weighing yup theyre all there to the last picogram meatfucker the other drone repeated trying comms zero avail the ships drone rose a quartermetre in the air then sank slowly down guess thats that then the two machines watched through the ships main sensor array as it showed the sixteenhundredmetre length of the other warship sweeping its multiple deepspace highspeed engine fields about it with a completely unnecessary flourish for the merest instant the falling outside the normal moral constraints presented in real space as a black perfectly reflecting ovoid then with a flicker it was gone so quickly even the fast pickets finely tuned sensors struggled to track it thirteen this deep in the ice you would need serious amounts of cooling otherwise youd boil at least you would if you were any normal sort of human or indeed if you were any kind of conventional being with the sort of biochemistry that could not cope with temperatures much outside a narrow band between freezing and boiling keep cool inside the ice or youd boil alive the alternative would be to submit to the pressure which would crush you to oblivion even quicker than the temperature would cook you to death it was all relative of course below freezing or above boiling of what and where water was the reference medium he was used to as part of the panhuman metaspecies and liquid water at standard temperature and pressure he supposed but then whose standard temperature and pressure down here inside a water planet under a hundred kilometres of warm ocean the sheer pressure of the water column above turned the water first to slush and then to ice it was highpressure ice not lowtemperature ice but it was still ice and the further down towards the planets centre you went the harder and hotter the ice got heated by the same pressure that had forced the water from its liquid to its solid state even so there were imperfections and contaminants in the ice flaws boundaries sometimes narrowing down to only a single molecule wide between volumes of the solid where it was possible for other liquids to slip amidst the vast compressive masses of the surrounding ice and if you had evolved here or had been carefully designed to exist here it was even possible for creatures to exist within the ice tendrilslim transparently tenuous more like highly spreadout membranes than anything resembling an animal they were able to make their way up and down and along the flaws and seams and fissures in the ice seeking food in the shape of those minerals and other contaminants the ice held or in the case of the predators of the deep ice attacking those grazing creatures themselves he what he now was had not evolved here what he was now was a simulation of a creature an organism designed to be at home in the pressure ice of a water world but only a simulation he was not what he appeared to be he was beginning to wonder if he ever had been the ice inside the water planet did not really exist neither did the water planet itself nor the star it orbited nor the galaxy beyond nor anything of what appeared to be real no matter how far out you might think you were looking nor how far in you looked either peer into anything closely enough and you would find only the same graininess that the real exhibited the smallest units of measurement were the same in both realms whether it was of time or extent or mass for some people of course this meant the real itself was not really real not in the sense of being genuinely the last unsimulated bedrock of actuality according to this view everybody was already in a preexisting simulation but simply unaware of it and the faithful accurate virtual worlds they were so proud of creating were just simulations within a simulation that way though arguably madness lay or a kind of lassitude through acceptance that could be exploited there were few better ways of knocking the fight out of people than by convincing them that life was a joke a contrivance under somebody elses ultimate control and nothing of what they thought or did really mattered the trick he supposed was never to lose sight of the theoretical possibility while not for a moment taking the idea remotely seriously musing upon such thoughts he slipped with the others down a onekilometrehigh manykilometreslong flaw in the ice in human terms it was probably like being a caver a potholer he imagined though that must do the experience little justice they were he supposed like separate strands of sluggish oil seeping between the ice sheets on what he still thought of as a conventional world a rocky planet with ice at the poles and mountain peaks he commanded a small but potent force a crack team of thirty all highly trained and armed with poisons chemical microexplosives and packages of solvent most perhaps all of the marines and machines whose representations hed inhabited over the subjectivetime decades the great war had lasted to date would have regarded this as laughably inadequate weaponry but it would be perfectly deadly down here where not one of those marines or war machines would last for more than a fraction of a second they were overofficered he was here as a major though in any other theatre hed be a general but that just reflected the importance of the mission he could feel the presence of each of the others chemical gradients and electrochemical signals passing within and between each of them keeping him in literal touch with every one of the thirty marines under his command here was corporal byozuel on the right slipping and sliding down a particularly wide channel briefly beating the rest of them for penetration here was captain meavaje way out on the left and spinforward guiding his squads four solventcarrying specialists through a tricky sequence of fissures like a threedimensional maze first byozuel then the marines between them in sequence reported a strong quake vatueil felt it himself an instant later the ice seemed to creak and whine the space which most of vatueil himself was in tightened shrinking by half a millimetre another part of him was in a cavity a little higher further up this widened a fraction trying to pull him upwards he had to grip tighter push harder to continue his slow progress downwards towards the core all right sir came the question from lieutenant lyske who was next but one along the line fine lieutenant he sent back vatueil had sensed them all stopping freezing in position as the quakes compression wave had passed around and through them freezing like that slowed them down a fraction and it did no real good unless you were in a wide fissure about to enter a narrower one but it was just what happened what you did human nature or animal nature or sentient nature however you wanted to characterise it you stopped and waited hoping and dreading hoping not to be about to die and dreading the feel of the ice around you shifting and dreading too the biochemical scream that might come pulsing through the single living net they had made of themselves as somebody else was so compressed by fissures closing around them that they were squeezed to single separated molecules crushed to mush chemicalised out of existence however the quake had gone leaving them all intact and alive they resumed their progress insinuating themselves deeper and deeper into the water worlds ice he sent electrochemical signals out to let everybody know that they were all okay still they could not afford to relax just because that little instance of random danger had gone they were approaching the level where they might expect to find defences and guards he wondered how you could characterise where they were now it was not part of the main war sim it was not another simulation running within that one either it was something separate something elsewhere similar but held apart from the other sims byozuels sudden signal came flashing through the net of the unit passing from marine to marine something sir vatueil commanded a full stop they all came to a halt as quickly as possible without causing any further disturbance he waited a moment then sent what do we have corporal movement ahead sir vatueil held waited they all did byozuel was no fool none of them were theyd all been carefully picked hed be in touch when there was something to report in the meantime best to let him listen sniff ahead watch for any scintillations in the glassy darkness of the ice all around them not that theyd seen much since the submarine had offloaded them in the silt slush at the bottom of the ocean hours earlier there had been absolutely nothing to see there no sunlight was visible below a quarter of a klick down from the ocean surface never mind a hundred klicks once theyd entered the ice a few cosmic rays had produced distant flashes and a shallow icequake when theyd been less than a kilometre into the hard ice had produced some piezoelectric activity including a few dim glimmers but their eyes such as they were represented their least useful sense ha the exclamation came along with a chemically transmitted wave of elation and relief pulsing through the company of marines as though through a single body sorry sir byozuel sent didnt want to risk communicating anything there enemy combatant engaged and neutralised sir well done byozuel its identity here sir a complex set of chemical idents and gradients transmitted itself through the web of the unit to vatueil a guard a single highly aware but barely sentient unit secreted in a fissure within the ice ahead and sensed by byozuel before it could sense him so they had to hope anyway studying the analysis of the paralysed dying creature vatueil could see no sign that it had communicated anything before it had been speared by byozuel and filled with poison vatueil communicated the necessary details to the rest of the platoon lets assume there will be more ahead he told them byozuel he sent hows the way ahead look from where you are good sir good as weve seen not getting anything un toward listening or smelling okay were going to shift formation vatueil sent rest of squad one and squad two follow behind byozuel three and four regroup with same internal spacing and keep probing as we descend weve got one enemy profile so watch for that but be aware there will be other types were tightening up here concentrating stay as wary as you like he felt the formation change around him the two squads slowly shifting to concentrate and gather above byozuel the other two pulling in from the other side the icequake came without warning the screams came from both sides seemingly at the same time as the tortured shriek of the shifting ice and the hazy scintillations produced by ice contaminants piezoelectricity the ice closed around vatueil squeezing him producing a feeling of utter helplessness and terror just for a moment he ignored it let it all pass through him prepared to die if it came to it but not prepared to show his fear he was squeezed out of where he was forced downwards by the sheer closing force of the ice above into a broader fissure beneath he felt others moving out of control as well felt three lose contact tendrils between them broken snapped teased apart they all stopped again those that were not writhing moments later even they ceased to move either dead or after selfadministering relaxants or being darted with them by their comrades could it have been an explosion enemy action had they set something off when byozuel had neutralised the guard the aftershocks moaned and rattled through the vastness above and around them the quake felt too big too comprehensive to have come from a singlepoint detonation report vatueil sent a moment later they had lost five of their total including captain meavaje some injuries loss of senses in two partial loss of locomotion in another two they regrouped again he confirmed lyske as his new secondincommand they left the injured and one ablebodied marine to guard their retreat bastard blow sir byozuel sent from his downforward position fifteen metres further down but its opened a finelooking cleft down here a positive highway it is sir treat it as suspicious byozuel he told the marine anything obvious might be mined or suckertrapped yes sir but this only just opened to the side of the one where our friend was looks pristine and deep feel confident to explore byozuel feel confident sir okay i think were all where we should be again go ahead byozuel but still take it easy the new fracture led almost straight down byozuel dropped hesitantly at first then more quickly with greater confidence the rest formed up behind byozuel following him downwards the other two squads were making little progress vatueil decided to make the most of the advantage he ordered them into the new fissure too the next guard came stumbling out of a sidecrevice a breach from the earlier fissure theyd been taking before the guard lanced into byozuel instantly disabling him but was in turn pierced by a pumpdart from one of the weaponsupport specialists immediately behind byozuel the enemy struggled died started to dissolve byozuel adhered to one wall of the crevasse sticking there immobile poisons spreading through his extended body another specialist flowed over him investigating diagnosing trying to see where he might be cauterised what parts might be amputated to save him the specialist pulled away cutting connections with byozuel before communicating with vatueil looks like ill be covering retreat too sir byozuel sent looks like it byozuel that one might have got a warning off one of the specialists sent i can see something down here sir sent the one whod continued past where byozuel had been hit deep down looks looks like a comprehensive light source sir establishing a better link through two more descending marines vatueil could more or less see what the deepest marine was seeing caution to the wind time he thought to himself stay here byozuel not much choice sir well be back for you byozuel everybody else were here this is it form up for maximum attack by squad they gathered shifted configured he felt the familiar pride close to love for those to whom hed become close as they calmly and efficiently prepared to put themselves at great risk for a cause they believed in and for the collective good of their comrades almost sooner than hed have liked they were ready they floated four small squads of marines ready to receive one last electrochemical command before they split into their separate squads and could communicate only by vibration or light on my command he told them go go go they powered down the fissure towards the unreal light of the core of course these things do not exist as you describe them not in the sense that they are suffered by these socalled virtual people in these alleged virtual realities they exist only in the sense that they are imagined talked about warned of ultimately we believe that these things do exist but we believe that they exist in the greater reality beyond our limited understanding and yours that is the true afterlife the one that awaits all who faithfully believe regardless of whether they have these soulkeeper devices or not we are content to leave such reward and punishment to god we would not presume to take on the work of god that is for god alone it would be blasphemy so to presume frankly you insult us by making the claims about us that you do this had been a remarkably short speech by representative erruns standards as he finished sweeping his senatorial robes about him and sitting down representative filhyn had to scramble to her feet again well she said im sure we didnt mean to insult you honourable colleague errun only halfrose from his seat to say insult like many such feelings is experienced in the soul of the person addressed it is not something that can be granted or withheld by the person doing the addressing there was murmured assent to this expression as there had been to the one before representative errun resumed his seat accepting shoulderpats nods and muttered welldones from his retinue of advisors and aides as i say the young representative from the outlying habitats said we did not mean to take offence filhyn realised what she had said and blurted i mean give offence she stared at the senate speaker at the raised end of the debating chamber ah apologies she said to the ancient and worthy senator sitting there surrounded by his scribbling keyboardtapping staff she felt herself flush saw the amused expression on the face of representative errun and with a gesture indicating to the speaker that she was giving way sat down she could hear a leavesinthewind noise spreading through the public and press galleries representative filhyn went to put her trunks over her face then remembered that the cameras would probably still be on her and so didnt instead as the speaker brought up some doubtless lengthy and utterly irrelevant point of order she made sure her mike was off dipped her head to kemracht her aide and said i might as well be wearing a necklace saying bite here put me out of my misery kemracht im hoping to maam the young male said nodding to a departing messenger he put his mouth near her ear we have a guest for the afternoon session something about the way he said it made her rock back in her seat she stared at him he smiled back using both his trunks to halfhide the expression modestly do you mean she said a visitor come back from the other side she smiled at him he looked down she gazed away to see representative errun looking suspiciously at her from the other side of the debating chamber she wanted to smile broadly at him but thought the better of it best to give no hint she made her smile look like a brave but hopeless one then quickly looked away again as though covering her inability to keep up the pretence of good humour any longer she put both her trunks up to her eyes as though wiping away tears my ill make a politician of myself yet she thought they lost a whole squad to a sudden electric jolt that ran through the ice like a depth charge leaving the marines whod borne the brunt of it dissolving in their wakes as those unaffected continued to power their way downwards another attack came from the side where the original fissure had been two guards and coordinated but this time they were ready darting them both and leaving them jerking and dying in their slipstream as the light from below took on a greenish tinge the light brightened smoothly as they got closer then it changed became slightly duller speckled and with something about it that implied movement a whole force of guards was moving up towards them their shadows flickering against the green light from below vatueil tried to count then to roughly estimate a dozen twenty more it was too difficult and it made no difference they were not going to pull out now he wished that his real self the self that would continue back in the main war sim the self that still held all his memories of the decades of war would be able to remember all this but that self would never know in the war sim you learned from all your mistakes including the ones that killed you death itself was part of the learning process everything including dying happened within a meticulously overseen simulation where the backedup self was allowed to know everything that had happened to each of its earlier iterations so you learned became continually more experienced even wise this was a simulation a virtual world but it was not part of the war sim and there would be no going back for him or any of the other marines they might succeed or fail but both results would lead to their deaths his real continuing self back in the war sim would learn nothing from this mission if he was lucky that self might hear that this self had succeeded on this mission if he and the others succeeded they closed quickly with the cores guards the guards were wriggling up to meet them almost as fast as they were plunging downwards some darts from their opponents whizzed up past them one deflecting off the shield of the marine next to vatueil his squad was in the lead they were the vanguard the very tip of the spear he watched the dark shapes of the guards flit quickly closer very quickly faster now than his force was falling and powering down towards them they would have time for one barrage vatueil realised then this was rapidly going to turn into what in the old days theyd have called handtohand steady he sent then open fire impact lances poison darts dissolver rods and tasing bolts rained down onto their opponents representative filhyn had taken her lunch on one of the broad grassy terraces on the wide roof of the main senate building the terrace looked out over the rolling grasslands that wound around the central leadership complex like a mothers trunk round a newborn beyond the green river of the grasslands the great shallowsided ziggurats rose vast outcrops of administration commerce and habitation their sides festooned with vegetation their terraces and levels dotted with trees the great plains beyond the city were lost in the bulking presences of the pyramids and the haze of the warm day errun came alone as his obviously hastily scribbled message had said he would she wondered how much he had found out and through whom she met him at a deserted wallow near the transparent wall which ran round the terrace she had left her robes and other personal effects with her aides so sat modestly attired in the cool mud nodding to the old male when he arrived grunted a greeting and lowered his old rotund body into the mud alongside i am trying to imagine to what i owe this unexpected honour senator she told him perhaps you are the portly old male said relaxing luxuriantly in the mud he kept his back to the view from the wallow there was a threemetre safety gap between the transparent wall round the whole terrace and the edge that was pretty much the minimum that a pavulean could cope with once they were higher than one storey up but the old senator was known to be particularly prone to vertigo she was surprised hed agreed to meet on such a high level in the first place he turned in the mud to look at her on the other trunk perhaps youre not he left a space she was seemingly meant to fill but she didnt half a year ago she would have and might have given away more than shed have wanted to she declined to congratulate herself just yet representative errun had many more tricks than just leaving people the space to talk themselves into trouble either way he said slapping some mud over his back with one trunk i think we should clear some things up i am all for clearing things up she told him umhum he said throwing more mud over himself there was a surprising neatness almost a delicacy to how he did this that filhyn found quite endearing we are the old male began then paused we are a fallen species representative he stopped looked her in the eye may i call you filhyn he raised one muddied trunk let it fall with a small muddy splash as we are in such informal circumstances i suppose so she said why not well then we are a fallen species filhyn we have never been entirely sure what really came before us but we have always imagined something more heroic more bold more like a predator we are told this is the price of having become civilised errun snorted at this anyway we are who we are and although we are not perfect we have done the best we could and done quite well and we can be proud that we have not yet surrendered to the ais we have brought into being or abandoned all the attributes and mechanisms that made us great and civilised in the first place by this errun probably meant the primacy of natural pavulean decisionmaking rather than letting their ais have anything other than an advisory role and commerce money the accumulation of capital and of course collective wisdom the pavulean philosophyreligionway of life which still bore within it traces of male supremacism and haremism these were exactly the things which filhyn personally thought were now holding their whole civilisation back but she wasnt about to start arguing with an ancient and revered conservative like errun some problems were generational you just had to wait for the relevant elders to die off and be replaced with more progressive types with luck you people from the outlyings see matters differently we realise errun told her but still the soul of our people our species our civilisation lies here on these plains this planet on the terraformed new homes and the habitats that spin around our home star errun raised his gaze to the sun currently lighting up some layers of creamy cloud to the south under this sun filhyn said she was also not going to bring up the absurdity of her being the only representative for the whole diasporic mass of the greater pavulean herd in theory they were all part of the fifteen herds and there was no need for all the tens of billions of pavuleans who now lived around other stars to have extra representation but this was of course complete nonsense just a way for the centre here on pavul to keep control of its distributed empire under this sun the old male agreed do you possess a soulkeeper device he asked her suddenly yes she told him for an outlying religion i dare say she wasnt sure she would even call it a religion ill stay amongst my farflung friends when i die she said my soulkeeper is keyed to our local afterlife the old male sighed shook his head he seemed to be about to say something perhaps he was going to chastise her she thought but then he didnt he slapped some more mud about himself we need threat to keep us honest filhyn he told her he sounded regretful but intent i wouldnt go as far as those who wish we hadnt rid ourselves of predators but we need something to keep us on our toes to bring us up to the moral mark dont you see i see that you believe that deeply representative she said diplomatically umhum you will see the track i am heading along here i wont dissemble we need the threat of punishment in the afterlife to keep us from behaving like mere beasts in this existence he waved one trunk i have no idea if there really is a god filhyn any more than you do any more than the grand high priest does he snorted filhyn was genuinely shocked to hear him say this even if shed long assumed just that perhaps god resides in the places where the sublimed live in these hidden dimensions so conveniently folded up and hard to get at the old male said i suppose it is almost the last place he might as i say i dont know but i know most certainly that there is evil in us and i know and accept that the technologies that have given us the means to express that evil allowing us to exterminate our natural predators have led in turn to the technologies that now let us save our souls that let us save ourselves and that let us continue to administer rewards and punishments beyond the grave or at least the threat of punishment he looked at her she slowly smeared her own back with mud are you going to tell me that it is only the threat he rolled a little closer to her rotating in the greybrown mud of course it is just the threat he told her quietly conspiratorially with a hint of humour he rolled back again all that matters is that people are frightened into behaving properly while they are alive what happens after they are dead is really no concern of the living nor should it ever be he chuckled that last bits just my personal belief but its also the truth of the matter as it stands we scare them with these threats of correction and unpleasantness but once theyre scared theres no need actually to impose the punishments there are entire teams of creatives artists scenarioists writers explicators designers psychologists sound sculptors and well god knows who and what else anyway their entire working lives are spent creating a completely unrealistic environment and a completely false expectation for completely good and moral reasons so the hells only exist as a threat to keep people in line while theyre still alive well ours certainly does and thats all it does cant speak for the afterlives of aliens but ill tell you this a lot of the current fuss about them is founded on a basic misunderstanding whats annoying is that people who dont want them to exist cant accept that they actually dont exist meanwhile theyre wrecking the whole point of pretending that they do if people just shut up and stopped complaining about things that dont happen in the first place then there wouldnt be any problem life would go on people would behave themselves and nobody would really get hurt the old male shook himself seemingly disgusted i mean what do they want to make the hells real so that people can be suitably frightened of them so where are all the people who ought to be in other afterlives in heavens because they are not there errun snorted in limbo he slapped at something on his flank inspected what he found there an imaginary insect filhyn suspected stored but not functioning not in any sense living he seemed to hesitate then rolled closer to her again may i speak in confidence filhyn i assumed all thats being said here is in confidence representative of course of course but i mean in particular confidence something that you would not even share with your closest aides or a partner something strictly between you and me yes she said very well go ahead he rolled closer still some of those who disappear who it might appear go into this socalled hell he said quietly are simply deleted he looked at her quite serious she looked back they are not even held in limbo he told her they simply cease to be their soulkeeper thing is wiped clean and the information their soul is not transferred anywhere thats the truth filhyn its not something thats supposed to happen but it does now he said tapping her on one front knee you most emphatically did not hear that from me do you understand of course she said good that really is something we dont want people knowing dont you see he asked her all that matters is that people believe they are still living in some sense and suffering but frankly why waste the computer space on the bastards excuse my language filhyn smiled is it not always better to tell the truth though representative errun looked at her shook his head the truth no matter what for good or ill are you mad i do hope youre having a joke with me here young lady he held his nostrils with the finger stubs of one trunk and submerged himself completely in the mud resurfacing moments later and snorting powerfully before wiping the mud from his eyes dont pretend you are so naive filhyn the truth is not always useful not always good its like putting your faith in water yes we need the rain but too much can sweep you away in a flood and drown you like all great natural elemental forces the truth needs to be channelled managed controlled and intelligently morally allocated he glared at her you are having a joke with me arent you i might as well be she thought she wondered if she would finally be a real politician when she agreed with what errun was saying otherwise we are both wasting our time here representative one of us certainly is she thought she looked up saw kemracht signalling her from some distance away not at all representative she told the old male as she rose on all fours this has been most instructive however if youll excuse me i must go will you shower with me the old male looked at her for some moments thank you no ill stay here a little longer he kept looking at her dont rock the barge filhyn he told her and dont believe everything that everybody tells you thats no way to the truth just confusion and muddle i assure you i dont she told him she performed a modestly shallow curtsy with her front legs ill see you for the afternoon session representative he was one of the only two survivors of his squad and their total force now numbered six the rest had fallen to the upswarming mass of guards his marines had the better weaponry and were easily a match for the opposition one against one but there had been many more of the guards than there had seemed at first and even when he and his men had poured through their entangling mass of bodies and weaponry they had encountered nets of barbs nets of poisons and nets of convulsing electricity piercing cutting those took more time and held up there enfolded in the sickly green light flooding up from below theyd been attacked from above by the remnants of the guards they had forced their way through more marines had fallen or dissolved or jerked and spasmed spiralling upwards but then they were through just six of them they fell against the green glowing surface expanded released their packaged solvents and seemed to become part of the transparent wall itself then they were through and falling the conceit of the ice above was gone now they were in some vast spherical space like the inside of a multilayered moon above were quickly closing holes like bruises in a layer of dark cloud the conceit of their own forms had changed too no longer tissuethin membranes they were dark solid shapes serrated spearheads plunging down accelerating hard they fell through vacuum towards a landscape of something between a single surfacecovering city and a gigantic industrial plant all lights and grids and swirling patterns of luminescence flares drifting smokes and steams rivers and fountains and whirlpools of light it is like a dream vatueil thought a dream of flying falling he snapped himself out of it looked about taking stock evaluating five more besides himself in theory only one was needed in practice or at least in the best sims theyd been able to run for this a force of twelve gave an eighty per cent chance of success fiftyfifty came with a force of nine with six of them to make the final assault the odds were slim the simulations experts hadnt even wanted to talk about a force of less than eight making the last push still not impossible and what was glory but something that reduced the more there were of you to share it the vast coruscating landscape below was probably the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in his long and varied existence it was heartbreaking that they had come here to destroy it utterly special witness sessions were rare events in the chamber even if this was the low season when most of the representatives were on holiday or just on other business filhyn had had to pull pretty much all the strings she could call in all the favours she thought she might be owed to arrange the session not just at such short notice but at all their witness needed no real coaching which was just as well as there had been little time to arrange any prin shed told him just before the session started while theyd been waiting in the antechamber and errun and his people had been trying to get the special session cancelled or postponed will you be able to do this she knew how intimidating it could be to stand in the chamber all eyes upon you trying to make your point knowing that hundreds were looking at you there and then tens of millions were watching throughout the system in real time and possibly billions might hear your words and see your actions and expressions later potentially tens even hundreds of billions if what you said turned out to be of any great importance or at least of interest to the news channels i can do it hed told her his eyes looked too old she thought though that might just be her fancy given that she now knew a little of what hed been through deep breaths shed advised him concentrate on one person when you speak ignore others and forget about the cameras hed nodded she hoped hed be able to keep himself together the chamber had an odd buzz about it with a few more straggler reps suddenly present who hadnt been able to drag themselves away from whatever city business had been detaining them in the morning some of the journalist seats and camera positions in the press galleries were occupied now that hadnt been before usually the afternoon sessions were quieter than the morning ones the rumour mills had obviously been working even less than a third full the chamber could be an intimidating place ultimately they were herd animals for all their civilising and to be singled out in the herd had been almost inevitably lethal for most of the millions of years of their species existence other species nonherd species must have it easier she supposed their own predator species would have found it easier for sure had they won the struggle to be the planets dominant species but then they were not the ones present for all their ferocity they had lost the struggle been quietly outbred sidelined driven to extinction or into the twilight existence of nature reserves and breeding zoos in the end she need not have worried she was able to sit back and listen crying quite a lot quite openly and freely and without even trying to hide it and watch the effect that prins sober unhurried testimony had on the others in the chamber the bare details were unbearable enough she discovered later that most of the networks censored some of the more sickening parts but the truly crushing the most undeniably effective moments came when prin was subject to the most ferocious crossexamination by the traditionalist party in general and by representative errun in particular did he really expect to be taken seriously with this mass of lies they were not lies he wished that they were he did not necessarily expect to be taken seriously because he knew how monstrous and cruel it all sounded and how much many different interests did not want the truth to be known he knew that they would do all that they could to discredit both him personally and what he was telling people how could he even tell this was not some bizarre nightmare some possibly druginduced hallucination it was a matter of fact that he had been away for realtime weeks his body held within a fully licensed medical facility exactly like the kind that many representatives had used for various treatments over the years he had never heard of a nightmare that went on for so long had the representative so he did not deny it might have been druginduced he did deny it he did not take drugs he never had not even now when his physician said he ought to to try to stop the nightmares he had reliving what he had been through would a blood test convince the representative so now he suddenly admitted that he did have nightmares after all as hed just said only due to the hell he had just lived through representative errun would not let go he had been a trial lawyer then a judge and famous for his questioning his brutal tenacity she watched him become more and more determined to rattle prin to trip him up and bring him down to reveal him as a liar or a fantasist or a fanatic and she listened to him lose with every extra detail errun dragged out of prin he made the totality of the revelations impact all the greater yes everybody was nude in hell yes people in hell might try to have sex but that was punishable in hell only rape was permitted just as in hell only war formed the basis for any social structure yes people died in hell you could die a million times suffer its agonies on a million separate occasions and every time you would be brought back for further punishment more torture the demons were people who had been sadists in the real to them hell was more like their own heaven no there were not that many sadists in the real but there could be as many as the functioning of hell required because this was all virtual remember and individuals could be copied one sadist one person who gloried in the pain of others would be all you needed youd just create a million copies yes he was aware of the claims that the tours of hell that people were forced to undergo sometimes as part of a courts judgement were of a hell that didnt exist or that only existed in a very limited sense while the miscreants were being shown round and that anybody who failed to return from such grisly junkets had merely been put into limbo but that was a lie filhyn saw somebody hand errun a note a shiver of apprehension ran through her she thought she saw erruns eyes glint with something like exaltation with cruelty with victory anticipated the old males tone and demeanour changed as he became more statesmanlike and solemn like somebody delivering a final judgement a coupdegr√¢ce more in regret than anger was it not true he said that he prin had gone into this dream or nightmare this supposed hell with his wife so where was she why was she not at his side now to back up his wild claims filhyn thought she might faint wife hed taken his wife with him had he been mad why hadnt he said anything even just to her a despair settled over her prin was answering first of all the female concerned was his love and his mate but not formally his wife he had left her behind right at the very end when there had been a chance for only one of them to get out and he had had to do the hardest thing he had ever had to do in his life and leave her in there to suffer while he escaped to tell the truth of what was happening there what was still happening there to and why had he left her out of this tale this it was now conclusively revealed confection of lies halftruths and outright fantasy because he had been afraid to mention her participation in the mission into hell afraid him a man who claimed to have been through hell and come back afraid yes afraid prin said his voice ringing out in the hushed chamber i am afraid that before i can take my testimony to where it really needs to be heard before a jury of the galactic council somebody old and trustworthy and of impeccable indisputable honour somebody like yourself sir will come to me and quietly tell me that i can have my beloved back out of hell if only ill say no more about what she and i experienced there and indeed even retract what ive already said prin looked blinking round the other members of the party opposite then at the press and public galleries as though suddenly seeing them for the first time then he looked back at representative errun because i am afraid that i will accept that offer sir because i cant bear the thought of her continuing to suffer in that place a moment longer and i will abandon all the others there just to get my beloved back and so will hate myself for ever for my weakness and selfishness he let out a deeply held breath thats why i kept her errun seemed finally to wake up to the veiled accusation prin had just levelled at him he erupted with indignation swiftly followed by his followers and shortly by the rest of the traditionalist party in moments the chamber was as noisy as filhyn had ever heard it even when it was packed prin might have permitted himself a smile then filhyn thought if this had been no more than a debate in a debating chamber he did not could not she realised because he was perfectly serious and completely terrified of exactly what he had just revealed he turned to look at her she smiled as best she could through her tears mouthed well done at him and nodded for him to sit down he nodded to the speaker then sat not that the worthy senator in the speakers chair was actually in it or taking any notice he was on his feet roaring and waving both trunks trying to restore order filhyn recognised the chamber letting off steam after having been forced to listen to something they hadnt wanted to hear coming from somebody who was not one of their own not to mention somebody who had just reminded them that there were higher and greater talking shops than this one thats put the pride amidst the herd kemracht muttered from behind her meanwhile the speaker was rising furiously on his hind legs and clapping his front feet together that wild breach of protocol hadnt happened for years the news services carried everything ah the joys of a slow news day during the slack season they showed the speaker trampling etiquette and rearing to his feet like a disputing skivvy they showed errun turning shades of rage that filhyn had not thought him capable of and most of all they showed prin calm flawless but sincere and his words those ghastly searing nearunimaginable details and herself with her mostly the news teams focused on her crying her tears not her oratory sincerity political skill or her principles had made her properly famous fourteen veppers aircraft hurtled across his estate at only a little over treetop height veppers himself sat at the rear shooting at things leading from the grounds immediately around the torusshaped mansion house of espersium were seven trackways of trees lines of dense woodland only forty or fifty metres wide but so long that they stretched unbroken save for where they crossed major rivers all the way to the estates perimeter a distance of almost ninety kilometres in the case of the longest and most used trackway which was the one leading towards ubruater the capital city of the capital planet of the whole sichultian enablement the trackways were there famously for one reason only to provide sport for veppers simply jumping into a flier and being bounced across to the capital on a parabolic trajectory had always seemed like something of a waste to him for all that it was the fastest and most efficient way of getting to ubruater when he had the time and he could generally make the time he would take the slower lowlevel route having his pilots take one of his aircraft tearing over the tops of the trees only ten metres or so above the tallest branches the idea was to use the flier as a beater utilising its screaming engines and battering slipstream to disturb the wildlife in general and in particular to bring birds panicking up out of the foliage below veppers aircraft were all shaped like giant arrowheads with a broad flat rear containing a recessed windshielded balcony where anything up to ten people could sit firing laser rifles out through the ultraclear glass into the bustling riot of suckedup leaves and small twigs at the startled squawking birds veppers sat with jasken lehktevi another of his haremgirls and crederre the daughter of sapultride and his first wife who had stayed on at the estate after her father and the girls stepmother jeussere had left after the weekend party that had included a couple of miniature sea battles veppers had taken particular care to make sure that his ships did not lose the second sea battle the day after xingres unsettling visit the bets involved in the ship battles were always small but that was not the point for veppers winning was the point they were on the longest trackway the one which led to ubruater the aircrafts engines roared distantly as it followed the trackway trees into a slight hollow then powered upwards again veppers stomach lurched as they bottomed out and then zoomed again a particularly large and fine spevaline rose wheeling out of the blizzard of dark leaves and somersaulting twigs behind still sporting its mating season plumage veppers cradled the tripodded laser rifle let the opticals grab the image of the bird and identify it as the largest moving entity in the viewfinder the guns servos whined lining it up shaking it with what felt like a series of tiny spasms to allow for the aircrafts movements veppers fired the instant the aiming grid flashed a single shot passed straight through the great bird in a small explosion of feathers the spevaline crumpled about itself like a man wrapping a cloak about him it fell tumbling back into the forest oh good shot sir lehktevi said having to raise her voice only a little to make herself heard over the howling of the engines the balcony was shielded from the slipstream by the bowed surface of ultraclear glass the glass could be retracted to allow other weapons besides the laser rifles to be used against the birds and other animals but that made the balcony a quite furiously noisy place to be at any reasonable speed you needed ear defenders and the swirling slipstream caused total havoc to any hairstyle worth the name thank you veppers said smiling briefly at the achingly beautiful lehktevi he looked at the girl on his other side crederre he said nodding at the laser on its tripod in front of her wont you try a shot the girl shook her head no joiler i cant i feel sorry for the birds i cant shoot them crederre was young still becoming a woman really entirely legal though she was not badlooking though her wan pale blonde look was quite eclipsed by the dark magnificence of lehktevi hed watched the girl swim in the underground pool at the house just that morning the main indoor pool under the house took up some of the space where the rows and banks of computer servers had once stood when the house had been even more the centre of the veppers family power than it was now and games and programs throughout the everexpanding sichultian enablement had been controlled from there that amount of raw bulky computational power was no longer necessary you could build processing substrate into walls hulls carpets chassis ceiling tiles monocoques almost anything nowadays so all that space under the mansion had come free to be filled with storage underground garages full of exotic machinery and a giant pool ornately decorated with waterfalls giant naturally grown crystals the size of trees perfume pools bubble bays and water slides crederres slim pale body had moved over the night black of the jet tiles on the pools floor sinuous and quick hed watched her and known that shed known he was watching her well he watched all women he found attractive like that and hed thought no more about it still the girl might be a prize worth pursuing he was aware that he hadnt bedded or even attempted to bed anyone new since the unpleasantness which had resulted in that little scribbledon slut biting the tip of his nose off too selfconscious he supposed he stroked the golden shield covering his nose he laughed gently well i feel sorry for the woodland creatures too but then if it wasnt for this sport then these trees wouldnt be here in the first place and there are an awful lot of trees and an awful lot of spevalines and other birds and only me who really shoots them most people are like you too squeamish so theyre ahead on the deal really the girl shrugged if you say so she smiled at him quite a pleasant winning smile he thought he wondered again why shed chosen and been allowed to stay behind with him she was of an age of course technically independent an adult but all the same it amused him when his friends acquaintances and business partners tried to pair him off with their daughters or even wives perhaps that was the idea here he doubted anyone still thought they could marry their females off to him but even just a liaison an affair might be useful to somebody with ambitions veppers looked round at jasken standing braced behind him oculenses on holding on to a handle set into the bulkhead behind his other arm still in its cast and supported by the sling jasken why dont you come and show us how its done while i talk to miss crederre here sir lehktevi veppers said why dont you go and see how our pilots doing certainly sir lehktevi swung out of her seat long legs flashing beneath a short skirt massed dark hair tumbling as she pivoted to disappear though the doorway leading to the aircrafts main cabin jasken sat in her seat he pushed the oculenses up his head switched on the laser rifle in front of him and cradled it onearmed he got a shot off almost immediately nailing a young blackbird in a detonation of indigo feathers it fell back to the coppery foliage rushing past beneath arent you worried your mistress will distract the pilot crederre asked veppers this thing does fly awfully low and she is well distracting wouldnt matter if she did veppers said nudging a button to bring his seat and crederres closer together motors whined the girls brows rose a little as she watched the gap between their seats shrink to nothing padded armrests touching its all done automatically he explained pilots redundant almost irrelevant most critical operation they perform is punching in the destination coordinates there are five separate terrainfollowing systems making sure we stay just above the scenery without becoming part of it five my she said quietly sounding conspiratorial and dipping her head towards him her long straight blonde hair nearly touching the soft material of his shirt was she trying to flirt with him or being sarcastic he found it hard to tell the difference with young women sometimes despite all his experience why so many she asked why not he countered always best to have lots of redundancy with something so critical doesnt really cost either i own the company that makes them makes the whole aircraft he said glancing about them jasken blasted another blackbird then another actually the pilots are there more for legal reasons than anything else he shrugged i blame the unions bane of my life though he said tapping the girl on her bare forearm she wore a kneelength shortsleeved softlooking dress which appeared plain but expensive at the same time i should point out that lehktevi isnt a mistress more of a whore veppers smiled tolerantly shes staff a servant its just that her duties are principally sexual in nature he looked thoughtfully at the door shed gone through dare say theres a union for her profession too he looked back at crederre who appeared not to be following all this i dont really hold with unions not amongst the staff he explained divided loyalties does mean i have to pay more for her services though how terrible for you she said he heard her stepmother jeussere in the remark shed been one of his lovers once too long ago for crederre to be his though i know isnt it he said hed decided it might be quite amusing to bed the girl a sort of continuance jeussere might even have been intending it shed been a young woman of slightly odd and exotic sexual tastes in her time who knew i have this frighteningly tiresome hearing this afternoon he said as jasken fired again downing something large and coppercoloured but im free this evening let me buy you dinner is there anywhere youve always wanted to go thats very kind ill let you choose just you and me yes he said smiling at her again private room id suggest ill get my fill of crowds at the hearing this afternoon a court hearing im afraid so why have you done something terrible oh ive done many terrible things he confided leaning over close to her though probably not what im being accused of today well possibly not its hard to say dont you know he grinned honestly i dont he tapped his temple i am the most frightfully old man really you know one hundred and seventyeight is that true one hundred and seventyeightish he agreed he held out his arms looked down at his fit taut muscular frame and yet i look well you tell me what would you say oh i dont know she said looking down modestly thirty so she was trying to flatter him between that and forty is the look i go for he smiled broadly though i have the appetites of a man of twenty he shrugged as she looked down again a smile on her lips so im told as i say its been so long since i was twenty i honestly cant recall he sighed deeply just as i cant recall any of the details of the appallingly ancient case theyre going to bore me with this afternoon i mean really cant im not lying when they ask me what i remember and i say i cant remember anything im just not able to those memories all had to be excised decades ago to leave me room for new memories really had to be done the medics insisted not my fault those memories are the ones the court would like to know about id love to cooperate even more fully tell them all they want to know but i just cant that does seem terribly convenient she said he nodded that is a word i have heard used in this context convenient he shook his head people can be so cynical i know shocking isnt it crederre said and again veppers heard her stepmothers phraseology shocking indeed so youll come for dinner well i dont know im not sure what my parents would say he smiled tolerantly its dinner dear girl not a sex club do you frequent those too never youve seen my harem havent you i have you are so shameless you know thank you i do my best im surprised you have any energy left even to think about other women normal women ah but theres the challenge you see he told her for simple sex just fulfilling a need the harem girls are perfect quite wonderful uncomplicated but to make a chap feel treasured wanted for his own sake he has to feel that he can still make somebody want to have sex with him just because she wants to not because its her job hmm yes so how about you how about me what do you frequent sex clubs never either not yet not yet she shrugged well you never know do you no he agreed sitting back smiling thoughtfully you never do jasken brought down a spevaline a little smaller than the one veppers had killed earlier but closer still to the rushing aircraft then the trees stopped abruptly and the view dropped away to a broad river waters sparkling wavy gravel banks unwinding beneath jasken clicked the laser rifle off and swung it to its stowed position estate border sir he said he brought the oculenses back down over his eyes veppers motioned towards the balcony door excuse me jasken said the aircraft started to gain height and speed heading for more conventional air corridors now that it had left the espersium estate and was in the shared airspace leading to the vast conurbation of greater ubruater crederre watched jasken close the door behind him she turned back to veppers you dont have to buy me dinner first if you just want to fuck me he shook his head good heavens you youngsters are so forward she looked down at the seat veppers was in judging she wriggled her skirt up she wasnt wearing anything underneath but were only ten minutes from landing he said watching her she pushed both laser rifles out of the way then hoisted herself out of her seat and brought one long leg curving over so that she straddled him better get to it then he frowned as he watched her pulling at the laces securing his trousers crotch it wasnt your mother put you up to this was it he asked nope she said he laughed put his hands under her skirt to her naked hips you young girls i do declare fifteen here was a gulf of space an infinite valley stuffed full to choking with scenes of torment spread out to the furthest reach of sight filled with the low moans and the chorused anguished of the torn and tormented and infested with a miasmic stench of shit and burned corrupted flesh here was a pressure on the eyes of fractal detail torment within torment within torment within torment endlessly just waiting stacked lined up marking time until it could be dwelt upon comprehended made part of the self guarantors of perpetual nightmare here was a seemingly infinite realm of torture presided over by slavering wildeyed devils a neverending world of unbearable pain humiliation beyond imagining and utter unending hatred she had decided there was a perverse beauty about it an almost celebratory fecundity about the depths of creativity which must have been plumbed to produce such imaginative cruelty the very bestiality the absolute depravity of it raised it to the level of great art there was a transcendent quality to its horror its complete commitment to agony and degradation and there was even a humour to it too shed decided it was the humour of children of adolescence determined to appal the adults or to take something to such an extreme you shocked even your peers it was the humour of wringing every last conceivable shred of doublemeaning or fanciful connection out of every even remotely misconstruable subject every mention of anything that could be seen as having anything whatsoever to do with sexuality bodily waste or any other function of simple matteroffact creaturality or biochemicalness but it was still humour of a sort when prin went through and she did not when the blue glowing doorway she had been only very peripherally aware of rejected her and bounced her back into the groaning confines of the mill she had lain on the sweated boards of the ramp watching the blue glowing mist evaporate and the surface of the doorway turn to what looked like grey metal she could hear the predatordemons howling and cursing and arguing they were further up on the level where prin in the form of an even larger demon had brushed them aside moments earlier before launching himself and her at the glowing doorway she got the impression that they hadnt yet noticed her lying there she lay still they would find her and probably very soon she knew that but for these precious few moments she was alone undisturbed yet to come to the attention of these most dedicated persecutors prin was gone he had tried to take them both through to whatever was on the other side of the blue glowing doorway but only he had got through she had been left behind or he had left her behind she wondered whether to feel sorry for him or not probably not if he was right and there really was some other preexisting nontormenting life to be found beyond the doorway then she hoped that he had found it if he had gone into oblivion then that was something to celebrate too for oblivion if it existed as a real achievable possibility meant an end to suffering as likely though she thought was that he had simply gone to another part of here another and possibly worse more terrible quarter of reality of what he had chosen to call hell perhaps she had been the lucky one getting to stay behind there would be more torment more pain and abasement in store for her she knew that but perhaps what now awaited prin was even worse she didnt like to think about what would happen to her now but thinking about what might be happening or about to happen to prin was even worse she did not let herself shy away from it she made herself think about it if you thought about it if you embraced it then the revelation you might in time be faced with of what had happened to him what had been done to him would lose some of its power and its ability to shock she wondered if she would ever see him again she wondered if she would want to given what they might do to him he had disobeyed the rules of this place the rules they lived by he had gone against the very law of hell and his punishment would be extreme so might hers of course she heard one of the demons say something she didnt understand exactly what had been said but it had sounded like an exclamation like an expression of surprise she knew then that she had been seen she heard and felt crashing ironshod paws clattering down the ramp towards her they stamped up to right beside her head she was hauled upright by both her trunks she tried to keep her handpads over her face but she was shaken and her bodys own weight tore their grip free she caught a glimpse of a demons wide furred face its two great eyes staring at her then she shut her eyes tightly the demon shouted in her face didnt get through thats bad his breath smelled of rotting meat he marched up the slope dragging her behind him he was roaring to the others look what hed found they took turns raping her while they discussed what to do to really make her suffer in hell the seed of demons burned like acid and generally brought with it parasites worms gangrene and tumours as well as the possibility of the conception of something that would eat its way out when the time came to be born that conception could equally well take place in a male a womb was not required and the demons were not fussy she found the pain astounding the humiliation and degradation absolute she started to sing to them she sang without words just making sounds in a language that she herself didnt understand and had not known she possessed the halfdozen demons reacted with fury taking an iron bar to her mouth smashing her teeth she kept on singing even through the froth of blood and broken teeth inside her mouth the sounds bubbling up and out sounding more and more like wheezing unstoppable laughter one of them tied something round her neck so that she started to suffocate she felt the life going from her and wondered what new torments would await her when she was brought back to life again to continue suffering the mad ghastly thrusting that was tearing her apart suddenly stopped the thing round her neck was torn away and she gulped air then spat and retched as the blood coughed itself up then was able to roll over onto her side and take a sequence of further deep painful gasps letting the blood and the bits of her teeth fall from her mouth onto the stained uneven surface of the floor there was more snarling and shouting and some thumping like bodies being thrown about or being forced to the floor she could see the boards better than before because the door to the outside was open and a giant beetle was visible she looked up and standing over her saw a demon like the one prin had become massive and powerful six limbed fur striped yellow and purple accoutred with jagged armour another one striped yellow and black not quite so fantastically armoured stood behind its powerful forelimbs holding a struggling minor demon one of those whod been raping her the other minor demons had been scattered around the floor of the mill and lay moaning and slowly picking themselves up the giant predator demon lowered its face to hers as she wheezed and spat the last of the blood from her mouth between her legs it felt as though she had been split apart inside it was as though they had filled her with boiling water unclever little one the giant demon told her now we go to a place where soon you will beg to come back here and let these scamps resume their play with you it straightened you bring her it said to the yellow and black demon which threw the minor demon it held across the floor and into the rotating machinery of the mill it howled as it was crushed the machinery creaked to a stop the demon lay like a limp rag leaking blood within the cogs and gears of bone the yellow and black demon picked her up as easily as prin had done and took her to the giant beetle waiting outside inside the flier she was thrown into a giant open pod with a glistening red interior and brownblack lips like some enormous animal the lips closed around her neck as her body was sucked further into the centre of the closing pod she felt dozens of barbs connect with her skin then penetrate her flesh she waited for the next symphony of pain to consume her instead everything went numb a feeling of something like relief flooded her even her mouth stopped hurting no pain for the first time in months she was free of pain she was facing forward just behind the crafts control deck where the giant beetles hollow eyes looked out over the valley she heard the ramp behind thud closed the two giant demons squeezed themselves into seats one looking out through each of the beetles segmented eyes sorry about all that the yellow and purple one said to her glancing over its shoulder as the other demon worked the crafts controls and the whirring sound of giant beating wings filled the beetles interior the demons voice was quieter now conversational though it still carried above the sounds of the wings has to look and sound good for the minions you know the other demon pulled on some sort of headset portal we agreed first choice it said flight time as simmed sounds good to me the first demon said last one throughs unfavoured the demon wearing the headset pulled at the controls the beetle lurched upward reared back as it rose then tipped forward it settled level but still felt as though it was pointing upwards as it accelerated away across the riven smokestreamered landscape beneath rising almost to the greasylooking brown overcast the first demon looked over its shoulder at her again could only get one of you out yes she blinked at it no pain no pain to be flying trapped in this thing but to be feeling no pain it made her want to cry the demon looking at her made a shape with its great toothfilled mouth that was probably meant to be a smile its all right to talk it told her you are allowed to reply the cruelty has already stopped the madness ceased to be were going to get you out of here were your rescuers i dont believe you she said her voice sounded strange to her without teeth her tongue had been bitten and although not causing her any pain it was swollen and that was making her voice different too she didnt know if she had bitten her own tongue or if one of the demons in the mill had the senior demon shrugged suit yourself it turned away im sorry she said what it turned back to look at her again im sorry i dont believe you she shook her head slowly but i dont cant sorry the demon looked at her for a moment they really have chewed you up bad havent they she didnt say anything for a while the demon continued to look at her who are you she asked eventually im called klomestrum it told her it nodded at the demon flying the beetle ruriel the other demon waved one forelimb but did not look round where are you taking me place we can all get the fuck out of here another portal a portal to where the real you know the place where there isnt all this pain and suffering and torture and shit really yeah really and where will we be then where in this real does it really matter not here thats the point the two demons glanced at each other and laughed yes she insisted but where wait and see were not there yet best not to give anything away eh she blinked at him he sighed look if i tell you where were going to come out and theyve somehow managed to listen in on this then they might be able to stop us see the first demon halfturned his head to her where did you think you were going back to just there back at the mill he asked her she shook her head another part of here she said there is no real its just a myth to make things seem even worse here you really think that the demon said looking aghast at her its all that makes sense she said its all there is this is all there is how could there be a real where people would allow something so terrible as this to exist this place must be all that there is what people call the real is a myth an unreachable heaven only there to make existence all the worse by comparison there could still be a real the demon protested but one where the people leave it the other demon said somehow without her noticing it happening the demon piloting the giant beetle had turned into one of the smaller demons a dark little squirmy thing with a long glistening body it looked like something that had just been born or excreted fuck the other demon said it had turned into something much smaller too a sort of featherless bird with pale raw tattered skin and a beak whose top part had been broken half off you really think your friend just went to another part of hell where else is there to go she asked fuck the demon said again it seemed to stiffen so did the other demon oh fuck were not even getting to there was no transition one instant she was numb and without pain in the pod inside the giant flying beetle the next she was pinned flayed in agony her flesh opened out and spread out all around her on a slope in front of some sort of ultimate demon she was shrieking shush something said and the force of it tumbled across her like a gigantic wave pressing her into the noisome earth beneath her where things crawled and squirmed and invaded her flesh now she could not scream her throat had been sealed her mouth had been sewn shut she breathed through a ragged hole in what was left of her neck chest muscles working to expand and compress her lungs but leaving her unable to make any sound she writhed moved side to side tried to jerk herself loose from whatever held her the motions produced only more pain but she persisted a noise like a sigh rolled across her scarcely less batteringly heavy than the sound of shush a moment earlier the pain ebbed retreated left her quivering it did not go away entirely but it left her room to think to feel other things besides the agony she could see properly now the pain before had been so bad she had not been able to understand what she was looking at before her across a dark valley full of smoke and halfhidden red and orange flames on a dully glowing throne the size of a great building sat a demon at least a hundred metres tall the demon had four limbs but looked alien bipedal its upper limbs were arms rather than legs its skin was made from living pelts and hides and flesh its body from an obscene amalgam of sweating metal stretched gristle pitted ceramic gears reconstituted pulverised bone and inflamed smouldering sinew tattered flesh and leaking boiling blood the vast throne glowed dully because it was red hot producing a greasy slow upwelling of smoke from the fleshes and pelts that cloaked the demon filling the air with a continual sizzling spitting noise the thing had a lantern head like an enormous version of a fourpaned inwardsloping gas light from ancient history there was a sort of face shown within the lantern itself an alien face made of a dirty smoking flame it peered out through glass made dark and filthy by the soot and livid fumes within at each of the four external corners of the lantern a giant candle of tallow stood each containing a hundred shrieking nervous systems intact and in burning agony within she looked at it knew it knew all this and could see herself through its eyes or whatever infernal senses or organs it used to see she was a skinned skeletonplusmusculature figure a tiny distant doll of a thing her flesh pulled away from her and pegged pinned to the ground around her i hoped to make you hope the vast voice said the syllables rolling over her like thunder her ears hurt with the force of it and kept on ringing afterwards but you are beyond hope that is vexing suddenly she could talk again the stitches that had sealed her mouth gone in a blink the ragged tear in her neck sealed her throat no longer crushed closed her breath coming and going normally hope she gasped there is no hope there is always hope the vast voice declaimed she could feel the force of it in her lungs feel its words shaking the very ground beneath her and there must be hope to abandon hope is to escape part of the punishment one must hope in order for hope to be destroyed one must trust in order to feel the anguish of betrayal one must yearn or one cannot feel the pain of rejection and one must love in order to feel the agony of witnessing the loved one suffer excruciation the vast being sat back producing wreathes of smoke like the currents of dark continental rivers candles spearing flame like huge trees burning but above all one must hope the voice said each word each syllable smacking into her body resounding inside her head there must be hope or otherwise how can it be satisfyingly dashed the certainty of hopelessness might become a comfort the uncertainty the notknowing that is what helps to bring on true despair the tormented cannot be allowed to abandon themselves to their fate that is insufficient i am abandoned i am nothing but abandoned abandonment is all there is she screamed back make your myths but ill not believe in them the demon rose up fire and fumes and smoke beating and wallowing in his wake the ground beneath her shook to his footsteps jarring the few teeth left in her head he stood over her towering above like an insane statue of something unbalanced unnatural twolegged he stooped causing a great roaring as the flames around him tore brightening through the air a finger longer than her whole body scooped something from the ground near her head dripping wax from one towersized fleshy candle splashed spattering onto her tornopen skin stinking of rotten burned flesh causing her to howl with fresh pain until it cooled part solidified you did not even notice this did you the great voice bellowed rolling over her he held the tinylooking necklace of barbed wire which she had worn for as long as she could remember he rubbed it between his bodythick fingers and for an instant took on the magnified but gritty pixelated appearance of one of the great powerful demons prin had impersonated and the two in the flying beetle machine had at first seemed to be the image flickered off he threw the lengths of wire away disappointing the word cracked and rolled over her seemed to press her into the earth with its vast despondent force he held his cock and sprayed her with fluid salts at the same time as the pain came flooding back the gushing waters pummelled her and their firebright stinging made her shriek once more the pain was turned right down again just long enough for her to hear him say you should have had religion child that in it you might have found the hope that could then be crushed he raised one massive iron foot the size of a truck high above her then brought it down fast and hard from twenty metres up killing her sixteen what is that that is a present the ship told her she looked at the thing lying in demeisens palm then she looked up at his eyes the avatars face had filled out a little more over the last few days his body had altered a fraction too making him look more like a sichultian this was a process that was intended to continue until he looked as native as she did when they arrived in enablement space fifteen days from now his eyes looked crinklier she thought friendlier she knew that technically he was an it not a he but she still thought of him as male all she had to remember of course she told herself was that whether a he a she an it or anything else demeisen was the ship the avatar was not anything truly independent or genuinely human she frowned it looks a bit like a neural lace demeisen said nodding only it isnt what then its a tattoo a tattoo he shrugged kind of they were in the twelveperson module the ship had brought aboard from the gsv especially for her it was housed within one of the falling outside the normal moral constraints many cramped spaces that were something between magazines munitionstores and hangars the ship had no other dedicated human habitable space inside it at all even this module was a concession it had not impressed her when shed first seen it and been told this was all there was this is it shed said after shed joined demeisen on board and realised that somehow the little slapdrone had been left behind shed said a sincere thank you for that but then there had been a moment of awkwardness after the avatar had welcomed her aboard and shed stood there waiting to be shown to her cabin from the rather minimal and utilitarian cabin space shed materialised in this is it shed repeated turning looking round she was standing in a space about four metres by three in one direction lay a blank grey wall opposite it there was a raised platform a little narrower than and one step up from the space she stood in the platform held three long deep padded chairs facing a double sloped wall the upper part of which appeared to be a screen though it was also blank at the moment to either side there were what might be double doors though they too were a uniform grey demeisen had looked genuinely hurt i had to leave behind an offensive slaved broadspectrum munitions platform self powered to fit this in hed told her you dont have any space inside your inside the ship at all im a warship not a taxi i keep telling you i thought even warships could carry a few people pa old tech not me youre one and a half kilometres long there must be room somewhere please one point six kilometres long and thats naked hull in full compression in standard operational deployment mode im two point eight klicks three point two with all fields on but pulled corset tight in serious glovesoff claws out teeth bared justpointmeatthebadguys engagementready mode im well it varies its what we call threatmix dependent but many kilo metres riledup im really more like a sort of mini fleet lededje who had stopped listening at the first use of the word point had wailed i can touch the ceiling shed reached up to do just that without even standing on tiptoe demeisen had sighed in exasperation im an abominatorclass picket ship this is the best i can do sorry would you rather i slung you back aboard the usual but etymologically unsatisfactory picket but it was a picket ship and it had lots of space ah no it wasnt thats the clever bit what people have spent the best part of one and a half millennia getting used to the idea of the culture having all these exwarships most of them largely demilitarised called fast pickets or very fast pickets and they are basically just express taxis then along comes this new class called the abominator they call it a picket ship and nobody takes any notice even when abominators almost never taxi anybody anywhere what the hell are you talking about picket in my case means i hang around waiting for trouble not that i hang around waiting for hitchhikers there are two thousand abominatorclass ships were scattered evenly throughout the galaxy and all we do is sit and wait for stuff to happen im part of the cultures quick reaction force we used to keep all the serious upfucking ships in a few mostly veryfaraway ports but that didnt always work out when things blew up suddenly remember i said dont ask why earlier yes you said not to ask you why you were heading in the direction of sichult anyway well lededje and appreciate that to continue the dubious maritime analogy im negotiating a tricky course between the minefield of personal honesty on one side and the rocky coast of operational security on the other thats as good a hint as i can afford to give you now im serious do you want to be put back aboard the the usual but bla bla bla shed scowled at him i suppose not shed looked around this thing does have a toilet nine seats blossomed from the floor and rear wall then they collapsed back as though made from a membrane that had suddenly been punctured and collapsed to be followed by a very generously sized bed then by a sort of white glazed balloon which parted neatly to reveal what was probably a combined bath and walkin shower then that too was swallowed back up into the floor and wall that do demeisen had asked the fifteen days since had been spent in the same tiny space though the entirety of the cabins interior surfaces could function as a single astoundingly convincing screen so it could look like she was standing on a snowy mountain top the middle of a table flat desert a wavewashed beach or anywhere else she or the module could think of she had been thinking ahead and had decided what she might require when she got to sichult she was intending to get to veppers through his lust she reckoned the degree of physical beauty she had been granted thanks to sensia and her humangrowing vats would be sufficiently beguiling to entice veppers if she got close enough to be seen by him in the right social situation a second way to get to him might be through her own knowledge of how his household the town house in ubruater and the mansion at espersium all worked shed had the ship make her clothes and jewellery and various other personal possessions ready for when she arrived at sichult shed tried to get it to make her some weapons but it wouldnt play it had even hesitated over one of her necklaces given that it was long enough to be used to strangle somebody it had conceded on that one it had had no detectable qualms whatsoever about providing her with a diamondfilm currency card allegedly loaded with enough credit to ensure that if she changed her mind about murdering veppers she could buy her own ubruater town house her own country estate and just live like a princess for the rest of her life maybe that was the idea she exercised she studied mostly she studied all that the culture knew of veppers sichult and the enablement which was a lot more than even veppers himself knew shed be prepared to bet and she talked to the alwaysavailable demeisen who would materialise whenever she wanted to talk not that it was really materialising literally apparently though she felt her eyes start to glaze over once the technical explanation kicked in shed undergone a guided virtual tour of the ship albeit reluctantly shed only agreed because demeisen had seemed so boyishly enthusiastic about it the tour had taken a while though probably not as long as it had felt at the time all she remembered was that the ship could split into different bits like a sort of one ship fleet or something though it was most powerful as a single unit sixteen bits or maybe it was twentyfour shed made the appropriate ooh ah no really noises at the time which was what actually mattered she had lots of experience at that sort of thing she had tentatively entertained the idea of taking demeisen as a lover the more sichultian he got and the longer she was cooped up in here fabulous fake scenery or not the more attractive he looked and the itchier that subject got she guessed first it would be pretty meaningless to the ship second that shed be indulged it would say yes third that it would be done with some style and sensitivity and it occurred to her one day fourth it might just just make her safer and her plan to kill veppers more likely to succeed the minds the hyper ais that commanded that basically were the cultures capital ships were unarguably sentient and they had emotions even if their feelings were always under the control of their intellects never the other way round the ship had already hinted that there might be trouble where it was taking her the sort of trouble where its fearsome martial abilities might come into play so was there not just a chance that having sex with its avatar might make it feel even the tiniest bit of extra commitment towards her how much would it mean to the ship if she and its avatar did fuck nothing whatsoever or would it be like a human stroking a domestic pet indulgent companionable mildly pleasant though with no possible component that might lead to feelings of ownership commitment or jealousy it was calculation rather than emotion shed be whoring herself but then veppers had long ago removed any choice she might have had regarding who she fucked shed had to whore herself for him and against him not that that had worked the only time shed ever had sex simply because shed wanted to had been on that single night aboard the gsv with shokas anyway she had not broached the subject and besides for all she knew the ship would revert to type the way it had been while it had been aboard the gsv before it had had its sudden and still slightly suspicious change of mind then it had seemed to enjoy hurting people so it might do so again and take pleasure in having its avatar reject her now he it was offering her a present a tattoo allegedly she was sat in one of the three flightdeck seats shed been watching news reports out of sichult on the modules screen when demeisen had popped into existence behind her she leant forward the thing lay in his palm a looped tangled assortment of thin greyblue filaments looking a lot how she knew a fully grown neural lace looked what makes you think i might want a tattoo you said you missed having one i did eleven days ago then again yesterday the first time you said that sometimes you felt too naked when you woke up you also mentioned that since you were revented youd had dreams of walking down a city street thinking you were fully clothed but everybody looking at you weirdly and then you looking down at yourself and realising you were naked apparently normal people have that dream i know did i also say i was glad to be rid of the tattoo no maybe you just think you say that to people she frowned looked at the thing in his palm again now it looked like thin strands of oily mercury anyway that does not look like a tattoo she told him not like this watch the assemblage of loops and lines started to move slowly stirring itself it began to flow out across demeisens palm as though forming a sort of chainmail glove he turned his hand over for a moment to show it wrapping itself round his fingers then turned it back as the lines moved like tiny waves up his wrist and arm disappearing under his shirt he rolled the sleeve back to show the filaments coursing along his upper arm thinning fractionally and spreading out he undid his shirt a little to show the silverblue lines tracking smoothly across his upper chest it was smooth hairless like a childs then put his head back as the tattoo rose up his neck and over his face and then right round his head a few tiny thin lines decorating his ears while others swept fabulously precisely over his face moving to within millimetres of his nostrils mouth and eyes but stopping there he raised his other hand to show the lines flowing down there too then held both hands and forearms up to show that they were identically symmetrically decorated in millimetrically spaced curls and swirls curves and parabolas im getting it to display just the upperbody section he explained it does the torso legs and feet too same spacing he admired his hands or you can go for a more angular look the mobile tattoo shifted everywhere the curves becoming straight lines the tight curls becoming right angles zigzags colours commandable too demeisen muttered the tattoo changed to soot black then to perfectly reflective silver as though the whole tattoo was made of mercury teased impossibly fine or sort of random within seconds the tattoo had become a dark random scribble across what she could see of his body motifs obviously demeisen added the tattoo became a series of nested concentric silver circles on his skin the largest a handsbreadth in diameter across his upper chest she reached out and took one of his hands peering at the circles on the back of his hand looking extremely closely she still thought her eyesight was significantly better than any normal sichultians had ever been more zoomable for a start she could just make out tiny silver lines running from one circle to another hair fine she thought no down fine she gazed at all the silvery circles spread across his skin like toosymmetrical ripples in a pond someone had thrown a few dozen pebbles into the circles spread merged became a crisscross pattern of thick lines that looked braided and much finer lines which wove in between the braids changing from silver to gold they made it look as though he was wrapped in a glittering wire cage of course im able to alter it by just thinking he told her youd need to control it through an interface maybe have some sort of control section always manifest in the pattern if you wanted to make it change appearance one wrist with a sort of stylised key or glyphboard on it would work or even just coded fingertip sequences anywhere though a terminal would work too something to decide later she was barely listening still staring its astonishing she breathed like it its yours he told her she kept hold of his hand she looked up at him it doesnt hurt does it he laughed of course not are there any catches catches he looked confused for a moment oh he said you mean any downside anything i might wish id known looking back on this moment from some point in the future she worried that she might have insulted him insulted the ship somehow by being so cautious even suspicious but demeisen just pursed his lips and looked thoughtful none i can think of he shrugged anyway its yours if you want it the tattoo was already moving all over him changing from silver circles to wavy dark grey lines and sliding back the way it had come up from one hand down from his head face and neck away from his chest and back down the other arm until it rested coiled greyblue and immobile back in his palm again she still held that hand all right she said softly ill take it keep your hand there he told her the tattoo moved up his palm along two of his fingers and then onto her fingers hand wrist and forearm she could only just feel it as it slid slowly along her tawny skin faintly disturbing the fine downy hairs on her arms for some reason she had assumed it would be cool but it was skin temperature any particular pattern youd like it to assume demeisen asked that first one you had she said watching it settle over her fingers on the hand it started on she flexed her fingers there was no resistance no feeling of tightness even where the lines seemed printed over her knuckles the pattern hed had first the one with the whorls and swirls expressed itself over her arms she pulled her sleeve up to see i can change it later she asked glancing at him yes he said he made a handshaking gesture you can let go now he said she smiled at him let go of his hand the tattoo went smoothly onto her upper chest she could feel it go quite quickly across her back between her shoulder blades heading for her other arm it wrapped round her chest and torso and spread up over her neck and face and head she stood up as it covered her belly and flowed down over her behind she stepped down to where demeisen stood can i she asked and immediately demeisen was holding a mirror showing her her own face she raised her other hand to watch it move down from her wrist to her fingers it slid easily under the silvery ring which was her terminal she looked back at her reflection mirror demeisen said he twirled the mirrors handle presenting her with the other side or invertor a screen in other words she gave a small laugh shook her head as she watched the dark patterns settle over her face like tiny trajectories like tracks in a bubble chamber like the slightest finest spiralvines in a mini ature forest she touched her fingers to her cheek it was as though it wasnt there her fingertips felt as sensitive as they ever had and her cheek felt just as it always did make it go silver she whispered your wish maam he said it went silver she regarded her face silver would never look as good as when her skin had been black black please she said it went perfectly black she felt it complete its spread over her torso and back it settled and joined between her legs close by vagina and anus but not covering it moved down her legs spiralling towards her ankles and feet she pulled the material of her blouse out looked down is there any strength to it she asked could it act as support as a brassiere there is a little tensile strength to it naturally demeisen said quietly she felt and blouse neck still pulled open watched as the tattoo pushed her breasts gently upwards now there was a slight tightness around her rib cage just under her breasts she let the material go grinned at him not that im vain she told him with a suddenly shy smile or really need one you can let it go back the way it was she felt the tightness around her chest relax and disappear for a moment she was aware of the weight of her breasts then they just went back to feeling normal again demeisen smiled also it can go skin coloured she felt it squeeze between the soles of her feet and the thin slippers she wore at the same time the tattoo disappeared she peered at her image in the invertor again there was no sign of it whatsoever she put her fingers to her face once more still nothing to be felt bring it back she asked missing it already it faded slowly up from her precise skin tone to soot black again like an ancient photograph whats it made of she asked masedstate transfixor atoms woven longchain molecular exotics multiphased condensates nanoscale efines advanced picogels other stuff he shrugged you werent expecting anything simple like plastic or memory mercury were you she smiled did you make it yourself certainly did from preexisting patterns but tweaked the tattoo had settled everywhere upon her skin it had stopped moving she closed her eyes for a moment flexed her fingers rotated both arms in an exaggerated windmilling motion she could feel nothing as far as her skin was concerned the tat might as well not be there thank you she said when she opened her eyes can it come off as quickly slightly quicker she put one hand to the skin just under her eye but could it say stop somebody trying to poke me in the eye with a sharp stick a tiny grid of dark lines leapt up in front of her right eye near where her fingers were she felt that all right not exactly sore but there had been real pressure on the skin all around her eye she grinned any other orifices or bodily parts it protects she asked it can probably dice your poo as it emerges demeisen said matteroffactly and act as a chastity belt if you want youll need to practise controlling it with your terminal therell be something of a learning process for the more complicated stuff anything else it can do a pained expression crossed his face thats about it i wouldnt go jumping off any tall buildings expecting it to save you because it wont youll still end up squished she stepped back looked at her arms and hands then came forward and hugged him thank you demeisen she said into his ear thank you ship my pleasure entirely the avatar said he it returned the hug with shed have been prepared to bet exactly the same amount of pressure she was putting into it i am very glad you like it she loved it she hugged the avatar a little longer and was patted on the back she gave it just one extra beat to see if there would be any more to it than that but there wasnt any normal man she thought but that of course was precisely what he was not she patted his upper arms and let go seventeen the semsarine wisp was an etiolated meander of young stars strewn amidst great gauzy veils of shadowing shielding interstellar gas it protruded from the main galactic mass like a single fuzzily curled hair from a tousled head the general contact unit bodhisattva oaqs brought yime nsokyi to the rendezvous point within the wisp sixteen days after picking her up from her home orbital the rendezvous point itself was an unfallen bulbitian the bulbitians had been the losers in a great war long ago the things that people now called bulbitians fallen or otherwise had been the species primary habitats substantial space structures which looked like two great dark heavily decorated cakes joined base to base they averaged about twentyfive kilometres measured either across their diameter or from pinnacle to pinnacle so were relatively small by habitat standards though of respectable size compared to the spacecraft of most other civilisations the bulbitians themselves had been a panhopper species small monopedal and quite longlived by the time they got involved in the great war that destroyed them as far as was known no verified biological trace of them still existed all that remained were their space structures and almost all of them were no longer in space they were the fallen bulbitians the shipshabitats that had been deliberately and carefully lowered through the atmosphere of the nearest suitable solidsurface planet by the hakandra the winners of that particular war to serve as monuments to their victory brought down to a planetary surface the great structures were crushed by their own weight and crumpled into vast citysized mountainrangehigh ruins the hakandra had not troubled to remove anything save the most advanced weapon systems from the structures before theyd run them aground on the planetary rocks theyd chosen which meant that the bulbitian species themselves having been avid creators and collectors of all sorts of technologies gifts and gadgets the fallen bulbitian structures had proved quite fabulous if highly dangerous technotreasure troves for any developing species lucky enough to be present when one was deposited in their midst and also lucky enough not to have had any important cities of their own flattened by the structures sudden arrival the hakandra had not been as conscientious as they might have been when deciding exactly where to leave their triumphant droppings the ais that had controlled the structures had either never been fully deactivated by the indifferent hakandra or had somehow contrived to regain some sort of activity following their partial destruction because the notorious thing about fallen and unfallen bulbitians was that they remained in some sense alive their computational and processing substrates proving resistant to anything save the utter annihilation of the entire structure they inhabited they were also in every case somewhere beyond eccentric in nature and arguably mad as well as seemingly still possessed of powers that hinted at links to one or more of the elder civil isations or even to the realm of the sublimed despite there having been no hint that the species itself had even partially gone in that direction by the time these links or powers were fully recognised the hakandra at least regarded as a stylish but offhand semidetached species even by those who were their friends had become even more unconcerned regarding the whole issue having hit the sublime button themselves and so cashed in their civilisational chips in the realm of the real where matter still mattered fewer than one quarter of one per cent of the bulbitians were unfallen in other words still left in space and they displayed no more inherent rationality than their fallen kin their ais too had seemingly been deactivated they too had swept clear of any remaining biological vestige of the species that had created them they too had been looted over the centieons though in their case by those who already at least possessed space travel and they too had seemingly come back online centuries or millennia after they had been assumed to be as dead as their progenitor species all the unfallen bulbitians were in outoftheway galactic locations far distant from the kind of rocky atmosphered planets the hakandra had chosen to lower the vast majority of the structures onto and the suspicion had always been that they simply couldnt be bothered going to the effort in every case the unfallen bulbitian within the semsarine wisp lay in the trailing lagrangian point of a gas giant protostar itself a part of a browndwarf binary system leaving the giant doublecake of the bulbitian bathed in the longfrequency radiations of the whole still hazily dusty system and its artificially maintained skies punctuated by the bluewhite glares of the wisps younger stars where their light was able to struggle through the great slowswirling clouds and nebulas of dust still in the process of building new suns this particular bulbitian had been colonised by several different species over the milleons the current nominal occupiers being nobody in particular some long time ago the structure had had a stabilised singularity placed at its hollowedout centre a black hole which provided about a third of what panhumans chose to deem one standard gravity this was very close to the limit that an unfallen bulbitian could take without the whole structure collapsing in on itself it didnt help that the structure had ori ginally been spun to provide the semblance of gravity but no longer did so meaning that due to the absence of spin and the presence of the singularity up had become down and down up people had tried to do this sort of thing to bulbitians before and paid usually very messily with their lives the structures themselves seemed to object to being messed around with and either activated defence systems nobody had known were there in the first place or had been somehow able to call on somebody elses highly effective resources this one had allowed the contained singularity to be placed at its core but given that in every other respect it was just as eccentric wilful and occasionally murderously unpredictable as any other bulbitian nobody had ever dared to try and remove the black hole even though it did arguably make the structure as unstable physically as it had always been behaviourally nobody knew who had last been in charge of the place or what had happened to them this was obviously worrying though no more worrying than any random phenomenon associated with any other bulbitian whoever it had been they had obviously liked it hot hazy and wet the bodhisattva entered the sixthousandkilometrewide bubble of cloudy air surrounding the bulbitian very slowly like a thick needle somehow persuading the balloon it was penetrating not to pop out of sheer politeness yime watched the ships careful gentle progress via a screen in her quarters as she packed a bag in case she had to quit the bodhisattva on little notice finally the dripping rear end of the ships outermost horizon field parted company with the glisteningly adhesive internal surface of the bulbitians atmospheric bubble the view started to tilt as the ship rotated to position itself compatibly with the structures own gentle gravity field safely inside yime asked snapping her bag shut inside the ship replied there were no confirmed reports of culture ships suffering injury or destruction at the behest of a bulbitian but the space craft of other civilisations on the same technological level and arguably of no less moral worth had very occasionally been bizarrely crippled or had outright disappeared at least allegedly and so even culture vessels not normally known for their caution in such matters tended to think twice before breezing up to your average bulbitian with a cheery hail fellowentity the bodhisattva moved on through a hothouse atmosphere of slowswirling weather systems giant greybrown blisterclouds and long sweeping swathes of darkly torrential rain yime nsokyi i presume the elderly lady said welcome to the unfallen bulbitian semsarine wisp thank you and you fal dvelner the woman said here have an umbrella allow me said the ships drone taking the offered device before yime could accept it they were still under the ship itself so sheltered from the rain for the moment it was so dark the main light came from the big drones aura field which was formal blue mixed with green good humour the bodhisattva had backed carefully up to the structures only inuse landing entrance hovering a few metres above the puddled surface of the landing pier itself which was made of ancient pitted metals the colour of mud from the part of the ship nearest to the wide bowed entryway into the bulbitian to the entrance itself was only twenty metres but the deluge was so heavy it would soak anybody crossing the rainhazed surface of the pier i was expecting somebody else yime said as they walked splashing along under the jetblack undersurface of the ship in the low gravity she found herself imitating the floaty bouncing gait of the older woman the raindrops were huge slowfalling slightly oblate spheres splashes from below she noted could soak you quite thoroughly in low gravity her ankle boots and trousers were already quite wet ms dvelner wore glossy thigh boots and a slicklooking shift both of which were doubtless much more practical in the conditions yime carried her own bag the air felt warm and as humid as having a soaking bloodtemperature cloth applied to the face the atmosphere seemed to press in and down as though the floating bulk of the milliontonne ship directly above was somehow truly bearing down on her for all that in reality it was supported within a dimension not even visible and weighed right now within the frame of reference accessible to her precisely nothing ah yes mr nopri fal dvelner said nodding hell be being unavoidably detained i dare say dvelner looked to be in about the last quarter of her life spry but delicately thin and white haired with a face that contained distinct lines hes your quietus rep here im with the numina mission numina was the part of the cultures contact section that concerned itself with the sublimed or at least tried to it was sometimes known as the department of what the fuck why might mr nopri be unavoidably detained yime asked raising her voice over the noise of the downpour they were coming close to where the great snub nose of the ship rose like an obsidian cliff through the rainfilled air above the ship had extended a field to shelter them from the rain a dry corridor three metres wide extended all the way across the pier to the brightly lit entrance funny old places bulbitians dvelner said quietly arching one brow she shook her umbrella out and opened it nodded to the shipdrone which was a soapbar smooth oldfashioned design nearly a metre long the drone made a noise that might been hmm and flicked the umbrella open over yime as they walked out from beneath the nose of the bodhisattva the ship rocked the whole threehundredmetre length of it wobbled visibly in the air as the corridor it had made for them through the rain just disappeared letting the rain thunder down around them the downpour was so heavy yime saw dvelners arm sink appreciably as the weight of water hit the umbrella she was carrying given that they were bouncing along in only a third of standard g this implied a lot of water or a very weak old lady yime supposed here yime said taking the umbrella protecting her from the drones maniple field she inclined her head towards dvelner and the drone moved smoothly through the torrent gently taking the handle of the umbrella from the older woman thank you dvelner said did i just see you move yime asked the ships drone you did so what was all that about anywhere else id treat that as an attack the ship said through the drone casually you dont interfere with a gcus fields even if all theyre doing is keeping the rain off somebody beside her ms dvelner snorted yime glanced at her then said to the drone it can do that it can try to the drone said its voice pitched to affable reasonableness with the implicit threat that if i didnt let it it would get upset and try harder which as i say anywhere else id take as tantamount to a challenge however my own field enclosures were never put under threat i am a quietus ship after all and this is a particularly sensitive and special bulbitian so i chose to let it have its way this is its turf after all and i am the guestcumintruder most ships stay outside the bubble dvelner said also raising her voice over the rain as they neared the entrance way and the sounds of the cataracts of water falling off the towering facade above increased in volume the yellow lights inside shone through the thick trembling bubbles of the rain as though through a rippled transparent curtain so i understand the ship said as i say though i am a quietus ship however if the bulbitian would rather i stayed beyond its atmospheric sphere i will be happy to oblige the drone made a show of turning to yime ill leave a shuttle with a last crash of drumming rain straining the bowing material of the umbrellas they walked into the wide entrance to be met by a tall young man dressed quite similarly to yime though much less smartly he was struggling and failing to open another umbrella he was swearing quietly then looked up saw them stopped swearing smiled instead and threw the umbrella aside ms dvelner thank you he said nodding to the older woman who was frowning suspiciously at him ms nsokyi he said taking her hand in his welcome mr nopri yime said he sucked air through his teeth well yes and no he looked pained yime looked at dvelner who had closed her eyes and might have been shaking her head yime looked back at nopri what would constitute the grounds for the no part technically the person you were expecting the me you were expecting is dead the television was old its casing made of wood its thick glass screen bulbous and the image displayed on it monochrome it showed a halfdozen dark shapes like long jagged spear points hurtling down from a black sky riven with lightning he reached over and turned it off the doctor tapped her pen on the side of her clipboard she was pale had short brown hair wore glasses she looked half his age she wore a dull grey suit and a white coat like doctors were meant to he wore standard army fatigues you should really watch it to the end she said he looked at her sighed then reached over and turned the set back on again the dark spearhead shapes fell formation splitting up as they twisted and wove their way through what might have been air or not the camera stayed with one of the spearheads in particular remaining on it after the others had disappeared it fell past wherever the camera was watching all this from and as the view tipped following it the screen filled with light it was a poor representation the image was too small too grainy and smeary to do justice to the sight even if it had been in colour in vaguely greentinged blackandwhite it was just a mess you could hardly see the spearhead shape now its presence was only revealed by its quickly shrinking shadow occluding some parts of the flares and pools and rivers of light beneath then a point of light seemed to detach from the lights below and rise to meet the spearhead shape which rolled and flicked and twisted ever more desperately until the rising point of light flashed past both the spearhead and the camera a dozen more points of light rose from the lightscape followed by another bigger barrage and another just visible at the distorted edge of the screen more sets of sparks rose fanning out towards the other spearheads the spearhead the camera was following dodged three of the incoming lights then one of them winked out just behind it a moment later the spearhead shape was silhouetted caught threequarters to side on in a flare of light bursting all around it drowning out the view below the screen washed out with light even on the old muddy looking screen the flash of brilliance somehow startled the eye the screen went dark satisfied vatueil asked the young doctor said nothing made a note they were in an anonymous office filled with anonymous furniture they sat in two cheap chairs in front of a desk the crude looking television was perched on the surface of the desk between them a power cable made s shapes across the desk and floor to a wall socket a window with halfopen vertical blinds looked out onto a whitetiled lightwell the white tiles looked grimy the lightwell let in little light a buzzing fluorescent lamp was set diagonally across the ceiling shedding a flat glare that gave the young doctors pale face an unhealthy pallor probably his too though he had darker skin a faint rising and falling feeling and a sensation that the whole room and lightwell were moving a little from side to side clashed with the obvious impression that they were in a conventional building on land there was a degree of regularity a periodicity to the various oscillations and vatueil was trying to work out the intervals involved there seemed to be at least two a long one lasting about fifteen or sixteen heartbeats and a shorter one of about a third of that he was using heartbeats because he had no watch or phone or terminal and there wasnt a clock visible anywhere in the room either the doctor wore a watch but it was too small for him to make out they must be on a ship or barge maybe some sort of floating city he had no idea hed just woken up here sitting in this cheap looking chair in this bland office room being made to watch lofi video on an ancient screen device called a television hed already had a prowl round the space the door was locked the lightwell went down another four storeys to a small leaflitterfilled courtyard the young doctor had just sat there asking him to sit down and making notes on her clipboard while hed looked round the drawers in the rooms single desk wood batteredlooking were locked too as was the single dented grey mild steel filing cabinet no telephone comms screen terminal or sign that there was anything intelligent and helpful listening or present there was even a switch for the ceiling light for fates sake hed looked over the doctors shoulder at the notes she was taking but they were in a language he didnt recognise he wondered how long he was expected to give it before he tried threatening the doctor or shouldercharging the flimsylooking door he looked up at what was obviously a suspended ceiling maybe he could crawl his way out just tell me what you want to know he said the doctor made another note crossed her legs said what do think we might want to know he put his hands to his face wiped back from his nose to his cheeks and then ears well he said i dont know do i why did you think we might want to know anything i attacked you he told her pointing at the wooden box that held the screen that was me in that i was that thing attacking you he waved his hands looked around but i got shot down im guessing we all got intercepted and now im here whatever you saved of me you must have been able to learn all you needed to directly just looking at the code running bits of it you dont need me so im just puzzled why im here all i can think of is you still want to know something else or is this just the first circle of hell do i stay here for ever being bored to death she made another note maybe we should watch the screen again she suggested he sighed she turned the television back on the black spearhead shape fell from the lightningcracked sky its nothing just a death yime smiled thinly i think you make light of our calling mr nopri if you treat the cessation of life in quite so offhand a fashion i know i know i know he said agreeing heartily and nodding vigorously youre absolutely right of course but it is in a good cause it is necessary i do take the whole quietus ethic seriously very seriously these are haha well special circumstances yime looked at him levelly nopri was a skinny dishevelled looking young man with bright blue eyes pale skin and a gleamingly bald head they were in what was apparently entitled the officers club the main social space for the forty or so culture citizens who made up about a half per cent of the bulbitians highly diverse and dispersed population the club was part of what had once been some sort of games hall for the bulbitian species what had been its ceiling and was now its floor studded with enormous multicoloured cones like gaudy versions of fat stalagmites food drink and for nopri a drug bowl were brought by small wheeled drones which roamed the wide space apparently the bulbitian could display unpredictable reactions when it came to other entities using fields inside it so the drones used wheels and multijointed arms instead of just levitating by ag and using maniple fields still yime noticed the ships drone seemed to be doing all right floating level with their table she and nopri sat alone with the drone dvelner having returned to her own duties there were two other tables occupied in the warm but pleasantly dehumidified space both supported little groups of four or five people huddled round them all of whom looked rather drab by the normal standards of culture sartorial acceptability and all of whom seemed to be keeping themselves to themselves yime had guessed before nopri had told her anyway that these were people who were here to rendezvous with the ship which would arrive sometime in the next two or three days from the total internal reflection the gsv which was one of the cultures oubliettionaries its forgotten fleet of supposedly ultrahidden postpositedcatastrophe seedcraft what special circumstances mr nopri she asked ive been trying to talk to the bulbitian nopri told her talking to it involves dying yes all too often how often twentythree times so far yime was appalled she took a drink before saying youve been killed by this thing twentythree times she said her voice dropping to a shocked whisper without her meaning it to you mean in a virtual environment no really killed really yes killed in the real yes and what revented each time yes did you come with a stack of blank bodies then how can you of course not it makes me new bodies it the bulbitian it makes you new bodies yes i back up before every attempt to talk to it and it kills you every time yes but only so far yime looked at him for a moment in that case silence might constitute a more prudent course you dont understand yime sighed put her drink down and sat back fingers interlocked over her midriff and im sure i shall continue not to until you enlighten me or i can talk to somebody else on your team who is more she paused plausible she said the drones blueish aura field coloured a subtle shade of pink nopri appeared oblivious to the insult he sat forward eagerly i am convinced that the bulbitians are in touch with the sublimed he told her you are yime said isnt that a matter for our colleagues in numina like ms dvelner yes and ive talked to them about it but this bulbitian only wants to talk to me not to them yime thought about this and the fact that it keeps killing you every time you attempt to do so hasnt shaken your faith in this conviction please nopri said its not faith i can prove this or i will be able to soon he buried his face in the fumes rising from the drug bowl sucked in deeply yime looked at the drone ship are you still listening here i am ms nsokyi hanging fascinated on every word mr nopri there are how many on your team here eighteen nopri nodded holding his breath do you have a ship here nopri shook his head emphatically a mind then nopri let his clouded breath out and started coughing yime turned to the drone again does the team that mr nopri belongs to have the benefit of a resident mind or ai no the drone replied and neither does the numina team the nearest mind at the moment aside from my own of course is probably that belonging to the inbound ship journeying here from the total internal reflection there are no minds or true ais stationed here no minds or true ais of anybodys in fact not just the cultures it isnt keen on minds or ais nopri agreed wiping his eyes he sucked from the drug bowl again not that wild about drones either to be frank he looked at the ships drone smiled is there any news of the ship on its way from the total internal reflection yime asked nopri shook his head no theres never any news they dont tend to publish course schedules he breathed deep from the bowl again but let it out quickly this time they just turn up without warning or dont show at all you think it might not show no it probably will theres just no guarantee nopri showed her to her quarters a bewilderingly large multi level space set off a vast curving corridor to have reached this by walking would have taken about half an hour from the officers club instead one of the wheeled drones just picked up their seats with them still sitting in them and rolled away through the dark tall corridors towards her cabin yime gazed up at the tall inverted arch of the ceiling as they progressed through the bizarre upsidedown architecture of the bulbitian it was like being at the bottom of a small valley the smooth floor the drone ran along was narrow only a metre or so across the walls took on a ribbed appearance now it was like travelling through the gutted carcass of some vast animal the ribs above rose outwards to a broad flat ceiling ten metres wide and easily twenty metres above they did like their high ceilings didnt they hoppers tend to nopri said she tried to imagine the place full of the monopedal creatures who had built this place all bouncing along on their single lower limbs and upside down of course shed be travelling along the ceiling and theyd be bouncing up towards her with each springing step then sinking back to the wide floor back then the great structure would have spun to create the apparent gravity the species preferred but now there was just the troubling tug that resulted from being balanced on the curve of the singularitys gravity well does this thing still spin at all she asked very slowly the ships drone floating alongside said when nopri didnt reply synched to the rotation of the galaxy itself she thought about this that is slow i wonder why so does everybody else nopri said nodding thank you she said as the door to her quarters hinged open like a valve behind her the ship drone dipped a little and drifted in carrying her overnight bag nopri looked over her shoulder into the shadowy space beyond looks nice would you like me to stay too kind but no she told him i dont mean for sex he said i mean for company as i say it is kind of you to offer but no okay he nodded behind her mind your head she watched the little wheeled drone take him away into the shadows then turned to look into her cabin the door must have been some sort of window once at ceiling height that was why it rotated about its horizontal axis leaving the door itself as a thick obstruction straight across the threemetrewide doorway she ducked underneath it hinged closed the cabin looked complicated with lots of different levels and bits where it just seemed to wander off into the shadows doubtless it had made more sense the other way up the ships drone floated over to report it had found what it was fairly sure was some sort of bed of a fluidbased nature suitable for a human to sleep safely within bathroom location on the other hand was still ongoing you are a soldier the young doctor asked vatueil rolled his eyes soldier naval officer marine flying serviceman submariner space warrior vacuum trooper disembodied intellect investing military hardware or software all of the above does this come as news to you there is a war conduct agreement doc im not supposed to be subject to any torture or unauthorised interference youre entitled to my code and anything it holds but youre not entitled to run my consciousness at all and certainly not for any punitive purpose do you feel you are being punished borderline he told her it depends how long this goes on how long do you think it will go on i dont know im not in control here who do you think is in control your side maybe you depending on what you are or represent who do you represent who do you think i represent he sighed do you ever get tired having to answer questions with questions all the time do you think i should get tired he gave a small laugh yes i think you should he couldnt work out why he was here they had his code they knew everything hed come here with there was nothing that he had come here knowing that they didnt also know by now that wasnt what was meant to happen a subroutine should have wiped his personality and memories with the rest of the information carried in the code cell as soon as it realised that he in the shape of the dark spearhead wasnt going to survive the attack if you were totally destroyed it didnt matter anyway but if there was going to be something left then you tried to make sure as little as possible fell into enemy hands but sometimes the subroutines didnt work in time they couldnt be too hairtrigger or they might launch prematurely so mistakes got made he was here because of a mistake it shouldnt matter anyway hed had a good rummage round his own memories since hed found himself sitting here in the bland room with the young doctor and he hadnt found anything that shouldnt be there he knew who he was he was major vatueil and he knew he had spent decades running as code within the giant war sim which was supposed to take the place of a real war between the pro and antihell sides but he could recall only very hazy memories of those earlier missions and nothing at all of any existence beyond those missions that was the way it was meant to be his core personality the one that was safe somewhere else entirely held within one or more of the secure substrates that were the safest citadels of the antihell side changed with the lessons learned from each recorded mission and it was a distillation of that personality which was downloaded into each of his sequential iterations but nothing that could compromise him or his side should be present each personality whether seemingly human in form completely machinelike or running as pure software taking on whatever simulated appearance worked best would be checked before it was allowed to get anywhere near a combat zone scoured for anything that might be of value to the enemy if it fell into hostile hands so he shouldnt have anything useful and he didnt seem to so why was he here what were they doing what is your name he said to the young doctor he sat upright head back frowning at her imagining her as some meek hopelessly sloppy recruit he was choosing to pick on in the parade ground putting all the authority he could into his voice i demand to know your name or identification i know my rights im sorry she said levelly im not obliged to give you my name yes you are do you think knowing my name will be of help to you still answering questions with your own questions is that what you think im doing he glared at her he imagined getting up and slapping her or punching her or dangling her out of the window or strangling her with the electric cord that powered the ancient television how far would he get trying any of that would the sim just end would she fight back impossibly stronger than he was would brutish guards burst in and overpower him maybe hed be allowed to carry out whatever he tried and then deal with whatever simulated consequences arose could all be a test you werent supposed to attack medics or noncombatants at all for that matter it would be a first for him certainly vatueil let out a breath he waited a moment please he said politely may i know your name she smiled and tapped her pen on the side of the clipboard i am doctor miejeyar she said she made another note vatueil hadnt really been listening when shed told him her name hed just realised something oh fuck he said grinning suddenly excuse me the young doctor said blinking youre really not obliged to tell me your name are you he was still grinning we have established that she agreed and i could be legally punished even tortured according to the articles ive signed when i joined up maybe not serious torture but the sort of mistreatment your average civilian would kick up shit about does that seem and the he gestured at the blank face of the television the footage the screen images they were poor quality for a good reason werent they were they and not shot from below he said and laughed he slapped his hands on his thighs damn i should have picked up on that i mean i noticed but i didnt that drone that camera whatever it was it was with us was it he sat back narrowed his eyes so how come im here why cant i remember anything more than id remember if i had just been captured in combat what do you think the answer might be i think the answer might be that im under suspicion for some reason he shrugged or maybe this is some sort of commitment checkup that we never hear about until it happens to us personally or maybe this happens regularly but were made to forget about it each time so it always comes as a surprise do you think you should be under suspicion no i dont he told her calmly my loyalty should be unquestioned ive served this cause faithfully to the best of my ability fully committed for over thirty years i believe in what we are doing and the cause that we fight for whatever questions you might have for me ask them and ill answer them honestly and fully whatever suspicions you might hold reveal them and ill prove them to be unfounded he stood up otherwise i think you ought to let me go he looked at the door and then back to her do you think you should be allowed to go she asked yes of course i do he walked over to the door feeling the floor move very slightly under him as he went part of that gentle longperiod upanddown movement he put his hand on the handle im assuming this is some sort of test he told her and ive passed it by realising youre not on the enemy side youre on my own side so now i get to open the door and go what do you think will be on the other side of the door ive no idea but there is one very obvious way to find out he tried the handle still locked please dr miejeyar he said nodding to her if you would she looked at him expressionlessly for a few moments then reached into a pocket of her white coat pulled out a key and threw it to him he caught it unlocked the door and opened it dr miejeyar came up and stood beside him as he looked out to the open air a breeze entered the room around them ruffling the material of his fatigues and mussing his hair he was looking out across a broad expanse of mossy green it curved falling gently away towards a cloudscape of white on blue the green carpet of moss lay on the level bough of a vast impossibly big tree all around the boughs branches twigs and leaves proliferated where level the boughs supported substantial multi storey buildings and broad roads for small wheeled vehicles where the boughs curved upwards the roads wound their way round them like the slides on helterskelters and smaller buildings the size of houses clung to the pitted ridged and gnarled wood the branches held paths more houses platforms balconies and terraces the twigs were big and strong enough to hold paths and spiralling steps and smaller buildings like gazebos and pavilions the leaves were green going golden and the size of the sails on great sailing ships the small cars people walking and the slow great rustle of the sailsized leaves filled the view with movement the gentle upanddown and sidetoside motion was revealed as the effect of the strong steady wind on both the tree as a whole and this particular bough dr miejeyar now wore some sort of wingsuit dark webbed voluminous he felt something change and looked down he was wearing something similar she smiled at him well done major vatueil now time for a little r r yes he nodded slowly turning to look back into the room which had changed into an appropriately rustic chamber full of bulbously uneven richly coloured wooden furniture the window was roughly oval and looked out into a shrubfilled courtyard care to fly dr miejeyar asked and set off at a run across the broad thoroughfare of mosscovered bark a passing car tallwheeled open like something from history honked at her as she sprinted across the road then she was over starting to disappear as the boughs surface curved downwards he set off after her he lost sight of her for a few moments then she reappeared in midair curving up through the wind zooming as the wingsuit filled and bore her upwards lofted like a kite there was a long platform like an extended diving board which she must have leapt from he remembered how you did this now he had been here many times before the impossible tree the ability to fly many times he ran along the platform and threw himself into the air spreading his arms making a v with his legs and felt the warm air pushing him gently upwards the ground fields winding rivers was a kilometre below the crown of the tree about the same distance higher dr miejeyar was a dark shape curving upwards he adjusted his wingsuit banked and zoomed after her as soon as yime woke she knew she was still asleep she got up she was not entirely sure if she willed this or if she was somehow lifted brought out of the bed it was hard to tell there were fine dark lines reaching upwards from her hands also she noticed from her feet protruding from the hem of her nightdress and there were strings rising from her shoulders too and her head she reached up with one hand and felt the strings rising out of her head they pulled and slackened appropriately to let her tip her head back she had become a marionette it seemed which was odd she had never dreamt that before still looking up she saw that where you might have expected to see a hand holding the cruciform structure controlling the strings the ships drone was there instead leaning out to one side again the strings went slack or tight accordingly she could see that the strings rose beyond the drone as well so that it too was controlled by somebody else she wondered if this was some sort of deeply buried image shed always held about how the culture arranged its big notreallyhierarchicalatall self above the drone the strings rose towards the ceiling which was really a floor of course there was another drone up there then another and another they got smaller as they went up and not just because they were further away she realised she was looking through the ceiling by now high above rose a succession of ships getting bigger until they disappeared in a haze of floors ribs and other structures the biggest ship she could see looked like a mediumsized gsv though it might just have been a cloud she movedwas moved along the floorceiling it felt like she was willing the movement but at the same time the strings they were more like wires really appeared to be doing all the work the floaty feeling came from the strings she realised not the fractional gravity that made sense she looked down at her feet to watch them moving and noticed that she could see through the floor to her surprise the strings went on down through her feet towards another person in the level beneath she was looking straight down at that persons head she stopped the person below her stopped she felt the strings do something but somehow through her without moving her the person below her was looking up at her she waved down the person below waved back she looked a bit like her but not entirely below the person below there were more people human maybe just panhuman further down it was hard to tell vaguely female all looking a bit like her again they sort of faded into the haze beneath eventually which was quite rightly exactly the same as the haze above she took off her nightdress and got dressed the clothes just flowed like liquid around the strings that controlled her parting and reforming as required soon she was outside walking along the true broad floor of the corridor outside with the arches rising to a series of points above the way it was supposed to be a cascade of riffling images and a faint breath on her cheek indicated moving very quickly and then she was at the entrance to the chamber housing the singularity the gravity felt stronger here maybe about half normal a sequence of great thick shiny metal doors rolled away irised open or ascended to let her enter and in she went whatever structure was above her and beneath her didnt interfere with the strings in the least inside was a huge dark spherical space with only one thing right in the middle of it she laughed when she saw how the singularity was choosing to project itself to her it was a cock an erect phallus that any panhuman adult would have recognised but with a vagina splitting it not quite from top to bottom frilled with vertical double lips looking at it it did quite a good job of looking exactly like both sets of genitals at once with neither really predominating she wondered if her subconscious had designed this for her she patted herself between the legs as though telling her own little nub not to mind not to get jealous oh she heard herself say youre not going to kill me too are you like norpi nopri the vagina corrected her of course it could speak she always got names wrong in dreams youre not are you shed remembered the bald young man telling her that each time he tried to talk to the bulbitian it killed him and he had to be revented she assumed that was what was going on here strange shed have thought she would feel frightened right now but she didnt she wondered why that was i would ask you not to she glanced up saw that the ships drone was still there a few metres above her that was reassuring he is trying to do something different the voice said it was a thick luscious voice each rolled syllable perfectly enunciated this is not that she thought about this well what is apart from this itself just so who are you exactly i am what people call the bulbitian she bowed to it looking down as she did so she saw the person below her still standing straight she wondered if this was rude she hoped not pleased to meet you she said why are you here prebeignfrultesa yime leutze nsokyi dam volsh wow her full name that wasnt something you heard every day i am to wait for the ship coming here from the culture gsv total internal reflection she told it why to see if a girl called ludedge ibrek hmm something like that anyway to see if she turns up too and goes back with the ship from the total internal reflection it was all right to say all this wasnt it everybody knew this to what end apparently there was a string that made her cheeks blow out and let her expel a long breath well its complicated please explain well she began and she explained your turn what your turn to tell me what i want to know you may not remember anything i tell you tell me anyway all right what do you want to know where is the total internal reflection i dont know how far away is its incoming ship i dont know what is the name of that ship i dont know who exactly are you i told you i am the structure around you what people call a bulbitian what is your name i am called the unfallen bulbitian semsarine wisp but what would you call yourself just that all right what did you used to be called before the war jariviour mochurlian explain please the first part is my given name the figurative part is a size and type designation the last is the old name of the stellar system which i inhabit who put the singularity in your core the apsejunde hmm ive never heard of them next question why did they put it there partly to produce energy partly to demonstrate their power and skill and partly to destroy or possibly store information their methods seemed as opaque as their motivations on occasion why did you let them at the time i was still recovering my faculties they had been damaged almost beyond repair by the enemy what happened to these apsenjude apsejunde they angered me so i threw them all into the singularity arguably they still exist in a sense smeared around its event horizon their grasp of time may be compromised how did they anger you it did not help that they asked so many questions of me i see next question are you in touch with the sublimed yes we all are define we in this context no no i refuse to why did you ask me all that you did i ask the great secrets of everybody who comes to me why do you keep killing norpe nopri he enjoys and needs it i discovered this when i asked him about his greatest secrets the night that he first arrived he believes that death is ineffably profound and that he gets closer to some absolute truth with each dying it is his failing what are your great secrets one an old one is that i am a conduit for the sublimed that is no great secret the culture has a team from its numina section here working on just that assumption yes but they do not know for sure i could be lying are all bulbitians linked to the sublimed i believe all the unfallen may be for the fallen it is impossible to say we do not communicate directly i know of none who definitely are any other secrets my most recent is that i am concerned that there may be an attack on myself and my fellows please define fellows in this context all the socalled bulbitians unfallen and fallen an attack by whom those on the antihell side of the socalled war in heaven why would they attack the bulbitians because we are known to possess processing substrates of substantial but indeterminate capacity whose precise qualities civilisational loyalties and practical purposes are unknown and inherently mysterious because of this there are those who suspect it is the bulbitians who harbour the hells which are the subject of the aforementioned dispute i have intelligence to the effect that the antihell side may be losing the war in the agreed virtual space set up to house it that it the antihell side has failed to destroy the hells by direct informational attack and so now contemplates a war in the real to destroy the physical substrates themselves we are not alone in being so suspected i understand there are many potential processor cores now coming under suspicion if we are singled out though we may find ourselves under acute and prolonged attack i anticipate no existential danger to myself and my fellow unfallen in space however the planetbound fallen may well be unable to protect themselves can you prove show that you are not the home of these hells i believe i could do so myself though possibly only by shutting down my links to the sublimed albeit temporarily the same course ought to be open to the rest of the unfallen still if somebody was determined to remain suspicious they might think it was the links to the hells somehow held within deeper levels of ourselves that we had detached from and blanked off taken to an extreme of suspicion one can imagine that only our outright and complete destruction might satisfy those so prejudiced and so intent the situation with the fallen is much more worrying because even i am not sure that they are not indeed the homes of the hells they may be if unwittingly or wittingly you see i have no better idea than anybody else which is itself a cause for concern what do you mean to do i have decided to alert the civilisation known as the culture as well as other potentially sympathetic civilisations with similar reputations for empathy altruism strategic decency and the possession of significant military capability that is what i am doing now talking to you until you arrived i was thinking of finally letting nopri and his team know this or dvelners team or both as well as anyone of significance arriving on the ship inbound from the total internal reflection perhaps even the ship itself or that which you arrived on though this would be to break a pledge to myself made a long time ago however you are here and it is you that i am telling as you appear to be a person of some importance and potential i am you have some importance within your own specialist department quietus and within the special circumstances section of contact you are known you are within certain elites famous if you talk people will listen only if i remember you said i might not remember all this i think you will in fact i may never have been able to stop you from remembering or at least from passing on what you have learned hmm thats irksome please explain the distributed device within your brain and central nervous system which i have annoyingly only recently become aware of will have recorded its own memories of this encounter and would be able to transmit them to your own biological brain i strongly suspect it has already transmitted our conversation so far else where perhaps to the drone you arrived with and the ship you arrived on that is very unusual unique even also most irritating what are you talking about do you mean a neural lace within a sufficiently wide definition yes it is certainly some thing similar well youre wrong i dont have a neural lace i think you do and i know i dont i beg to differ as those who are right have always begged to differ from those who are wrong but refuse to admit it look i would know if she heard her voice trail off her jaw going slack as the relevant string relaxed leaving her speechless yes she was pulled upright i do not have a neural lace but you do ms nsokyi it is an unconventional example of high exoticism but it would pass most peoples definition of just such a device this is absurd who would put such a again she heard her voice die away as she realised as i believe you may have just started to suspect i think special circumstances did yime nsokyi stared at the thing in the middle of the great dark sphere it had given up representing panhuman sexual organs to become a little black scintillating mote then nothing then she seemed to be flung backwards from it trailing her strings rippling behind her flying through intervening walls and structure as though they werent there her clothes flapping madly in the howling gale of her backwardrushing regress her strings whipped to destruction suddenly snapping off in the maniacal slipstream as she was missiled back towards her cabin the wind noise rose to a shriek her clothes were torn off her body as though shed been caught in a terrible explosion and she plunged naked and howling into her bed in a great burst of ripped fabric and slowly spouting wildly frothing water yime came to in what felt like a struggle with reality itself writhing and choking in the midst of the slowly descending waters she was still wearing the sodden nightdress though it was bunched up round her armpits the huge room was lit by something strobing white and pink she coughed rolled across the punctured bed through the remaining pools of water and hauled herself over the raised edge looking for the drone the drone lay on its back spinning on the floor that didnt look good she thought as she fell out of the bed i think we need she began a bolt of violet lightning speared down from the ceiling crashing into the drone and puncturing it blowing a fine yellow white mist towards her the mist was incandescent the sparks within it setting fire to whatever they touched the drone had been holed straight through and split almost in half by the blast spatterings from the mist of molten metals hit her legs burning a dozen tiny holes in her skin she screamed rolled away across the damp floor she felt her painmanagement system cut in slicing off the redhotneedle sensations a knife missile bounced out of the front part of the drones fractured casing it flew towards her she thought she heard it start to say something then it too was bludgeoned by a violet bolt from above blasting it apart a whitehot fragment tore past her cheek another tugged at the nightdress where it had part fallen back across her chest smoke and flames seemed to be all around her she flattened started to crawl away as fast as she could there was the whipcrack of a supersonic boom making her ears close up suddenly a knife missile was there a metre in front of her it flicked upright so that its shimmering pointfield was aimed straight at the ceiling another violet lightning bolt slammed down hammering the knife missiles blunt end halfway into the floor crouch crouch now crouch position crouch position the missile bellowed at her before a second bolt blew it apart and something smacked her hard in the side of the head she had jumped halfup and was already crouched in the emergency displace posture ankles together knees together bum on heels arms wrapped round her legs head sideway to her knees by the time the drone got to the first position cerise fire filled the air all around and a terrific thunderclap slapped across her trying to force the air out of her lungs for an instant everything went utterly quiet and dark then suddenly she was squeezed compressed to the point where she could feel her bones start to bend hear her spine creak and knew that if she hadnt been under the paincontrol regime shed be screaming in agony then she was halfflopping halfexploding out across the gently lit main lounge of the gcu bodhisattva her skin stinging in a confusing variety of places all her major bones aching and her head ringing she lay on her front on the dense fluffy carpet retching water her back hurt she looked at the skin on her wrists where they had been clamped tight over her legs theyd been skinned blood already clotting was oozing out over a patch of flesh about three centimetres square on the outer fold of both wrists her feet felt similarly raw and tender blood had run down from her right temple and partially closed that eye she put her fingers to what felt like a piece of stillhot metal protruding from her skull and pulled it out she could hear and feel a small boney grinding noise inside her head she wiped blood from her right eye and peered at the fragment centimetre long maybe she shouldnt have pulled it out blood on its shiny grey surface was fuming smoking the fingertips holding it were burning brown she dropped it to the carpet which started to singe painfully she put her hand to the back of her head shed been part scalped too the ship was making a noise a deep strong humming noise getting louder shed never heard a quietus ship make any sort of noise like that before never come aboard one and not been greeted almost instantly and very politely too so far though nothing things must be desperate then gravity seemed to shift and she slid quickly along the floor with the fluffy carpet until she thudded into a wall she was rolled over spread out across the bulkhead the ship felt like it was standing upright on its stern she began to feel very heavy and compressed again appreciable acceleration inside a ships field structure that was an atrociously bad sign she suspected it was only going to get worse she waited for a field to snap about her one did and she blanked out he caught up with dr miejeyar rising to meet her as they both rose through the warm air towards the crown of the vast impossible tree he shouted hello she smiled again said something back they were rising with the thermal light as feathers and the wind noise was not that great but he wanted to hear what she had to say he manoeuvred closer to her getting to within a metre or so what was that again he asked her i said i am not on your side she told him really he favoured her with a sceptical tolerant smile and the war conduct agreement does not apply outside the mutually agreed limits of the confliction itself what he said suddenly the wingsuit around him turned to tatters as if slashed by a hundred razorsharp knives he fell out of the sky tumbling helplessly screaming the air and clouds and sky all turned dark and in the space of one clawing flapping somersault the impossible tree became a vast blasted leafless thing studded with fires wreathed in smoke most of its twigs and branches broken off or hanging twisting in the shrivelling wind like limp and broken limbs he plummeted unstoppable the shredded wingsuit flapping madly around him the tatters of torn material like cold black flames whipping at his limbs he screamed grew hoarse gathered more air and screamed again the dark angel that had been dr miejeyar flowed smoothly down from above as calm measured and elegant as he was terrorstricken and out of control she was very beautiful now with arms that became great black wings streaming dark hair and a brief minimal costume that revealed most of her voluptuously glossy brown body what you did was hack colonel she told him that is against the rules of the war and so leaves you unprotected by those same rules it is tantamount to spying and spies are accorded no mercy look down he looked down to see a landscape filled with smoke and fire and torture pits of flame rivers of acid and forests of barbed spikes some already tipped with writhing bodies they were coming up fast towards him just seconds away he screamed again everything froze he was still staring at the horrific scene beneath but it had stopped coming closer he tried to look away but couldnt the dark angels voice said we wouldnt waste it on you she make a clicking sound with her mouth and he died vatueil sat on the trapeze in trapeze space swaying slowly to and fro humming to himself waiting the others appeared one by one you could have told who were his friends and who were his enemies by whether they did or did not meet his gaze the ones who had always thought the hacking attempts were a waste of valuable time and little more than a cackhanded way of telling their enemies that they were getting desperate looked at him and smiled happy to look him in the eye those who had agreed with him afforded him a quick nod and a fleeting glance at most looking away when he tried to look at them pursing their lips scratching their fur picking at their toenails and so on it didnt work yellow said so much for preamble vatueil thought oh well it wasnt as though they kept minutes it did not he agreed he picked at a little knotted tuft of red fur on his belly i think we all know what the next level the last resort is purple said they all looked at each other a sort of formal symmetry to their sequential onetoone glances nods and muttered words let us be clear about this vatueil said after a few moments we are talking about taking the war into the real we are talking about disobeying the rules we freely agreed to abide by right at the start of all this we are talking about going back on the commitments and undertakings we took so solemnly so long ago and have lived and fought by from then until now we are talking about making the whole confliction to which we have dedicated three decades of our lives irrelevant and pointless he paused looked round them all and this is the real we are talking about there are no resets and while there might be extra lives for some not everybody will be so blessed the deaths and the suffering we cause will be real and so will the blame we attract are we really prepared to go through with this he looked round them all again he shrugged i know i am he told them but are you we have been through all this green said we all i know but shouldnt cant we vatueil talked over them lets just vote and get it over with shall we yes lets not waste any more time purple said looking pointedly at vatueil they took the vote they sat still or gently swinging on their trapezes for a while nobody said anything then let havoc be unleashed yellow said resignedly the war against the hells brings hell to the real green sighed if we get this wrong he said they wont forgive us for ten thousand years purple snorted a lot of them wont forgive us for a million years even if we get it right vatueil sighed shook his head slowly he said fate help us all eighteen there was nothing worse veppers thought than a loser whod made it it was just part of the way things worked part of the complexity of life he supposed that sometimes somebody who absolutely deserved nothing more than to be one of the downtrodden the oppressed the dregs of society lucked out into a position of wealth power and admiration at least people who were natural winners knew how to carry themselves in their pomp whether their ascendancy had come through the luck of being born rich and powerful or the luck of being born ambitious and capable losers whod made it always let the side down veppers was all for arrogance he possessed the quality in full measure himself as hed often been informed but it had to be deserved you had to have worked for it or at the very least an ancestor had to have worked for it arrogance without cause arrogance without achievement or that mistook sheer luck for true achievement was an abomination losers made everybody look bad worse they made the whole thing the great game that was life appear arbitrary almost meaningless their only use veppers had long since decided was as examples to be held up to those who complained about their lack of status or money or control over their lives look if this idiot can achieve something so can anybody so can you so stop whining about being exploited and work harder still at least individual losers were quite obviously statistical freaks you could allow for that you could tolerate that albeit with gritted teeth what he would not have believed was that you could find an entire society an entire civilisation of losers whod made it and the culture was exactly that veppers hated the culture he hated it for existing and he hated it for for far too damned many credulous idiots setting the standard for what a decent society ought to look like and so what other peoples ought to aspire to it wasnt what other peoples ought to aspire to it was what machines had aspired to and created for their own inhuman purposes it was another of veppers deeply held personal beliefs that when you were besieged or felt cornered you should attack he marched into the culture ambassadors office in ubruater and threw the remains of the neural lace down on her desk what the fuck is this he demanded the culture ambassador was called kreit huen she was a tall statuesque woman slightly oddly proportioned for a sichultian but still attractive in a haughty formidable sort of way it had crossed veppers mind on more than one occasion to have one of his impersonator girls change to look just like the culture woman so he could fuck her conceited brains out but in the end he couldnt bring himself to he had his pride when veppers burst in she was standing at a window of her generously proportioned penthouse office looking out over the city to where in the hazy sunlight of early afternoon a large dark sleek ship was hovering over the massive veprine corporation tower at the heart of ubruaters central business district she was drinking something steaming from a cup and was dressed like an office cleaner a barefoot office cleaner she turned and looked blinking at the tangle of silveryblue wires lying on her desk afternoon to you too she said quietly she walked over peered more closely at the thing its a neural lace she told him how bad are your techs getting she looked at the other man just entering the room good afternoon jasken jasken nodded behind him floating in the doorway was the drone which had chosen not to get in veppers way when hed come storming through theyd known veppers was heading in their direction for about three minutes as soon as his flier had left the justice ministry and set course for their building so she had had plenty of time to decide exactly how to appear when he arrived kichaow kichaow a reedy voice sang out from behind one of the rooms larger couches veppers looked and saw a small blond head duck back down and what is that he asked that is a child veppers huen said pulling her chair out from the desk really what next she pointed at the window sky clouds oh look a birdy she sat down picked up the lace the drone a briefcasesized lozenge floated nearby huen frowned how did you come by this its been in a fire the drone muttered the machine had been huens servant or master who knew for the three years she had been there it was supposed to have a name or a title or some thing and veppers had been introduced to it but he refused to remember whatever it was supposed to be called kichaow the blond child was standing behind the couch only its head and one hand formed into a pretend gun showing the gun was pointing at jasken who had brought his oculenses down from over his head and was frowning like a stage villain and pointing his own finger at the child sighting carefully down it he jerked his hand back suddenly as though in recoil urk the child said and disappeared flopping onto the couch with a small thud veppers knew huen had a child he hadnt expected to find the brat in her office it was found in the ashes of one of my staff veppers told huen knuckles on her desk arms spread leaning over her and my extremely able techs reckon its one of yours so my next question is what the fuck is the culture doing putting illegal espionage equipment into the heads of my people you are not supposed to spy on us remember havent the foggiest idea what it was doing there huen said handing the lace to the outstretched maniple field of the drone which teased it out to its maximum extent the remains of the lace took on the rough shape of a brain veppers caught a glimpse and found the sight oddly unsettling he slammed one palm on huens desk what the hell do you think gives you the right to do something like this he waved one hand at the lace as it glowed in the drones immaterial grasp i have every right to take this to court this is a violation of our rights and the mutual contact agreement we signed in good faith when you communist bastards first arrived who had it in their head anyway huen asked sitting back in her seat and putting her hands behind her head one shoeless foot over her other knee what happened to them dont evade the question veppers slammed the desk again huen shrugged all right nothing in particular gives us whoever us might be here the right to do something like this she frowned whose head was it in the drone made a throatclearing noise whoever they were they either died in a fire or were cremated it said probably the latter hightemperature combustion probably few impurities hard to tell this has been cleaned and analysed at first quite crudely and then only a little clumsily the machine swivelled in the air as though looking at veppers by mr veppers techs and then by our jhlupian friends id guess the barely visible haze around the machine had turned vaguely pink veppers ignored it dont try to wriggle out of it he said pointing one finger at huen kichaow said a small voice from the other side of the room who cares who us is us is you us is the culture this thing is yours so youre responsible dont try to deny it mr veppers has a point the drone said reasonably this is our tech quite ah high tech if you know what i mean and i imagine it or the seed that became it as it were was emplaced by somebody or something who might reasonably be described as belonging to the culture veppers glared at the machine fuck off he told it the drone seemed unruffled i was agreeing with you mr veppers i dont need this things agreement veppers told huen i need to know what you intend to do about this violation of the terms of the agreement that lets you stay here huen smiled leave it with me ill see what i can do thats not good enough and that thing leaves with me he said pointing at the lace i dont want it conveniently disappearing he hesitated then snatched it from the drones grasp the sensation was unsettling like plunging ones hand into a warm cloying foam seriously huen said whose head was it in itll help with our investigations if we know veppers pushed himself upright with one fist folded his arms her name was l ybreq he told the culture woman a court authorised ward of mine and the subject of a commercial generational reparation order under the indented intagliate act huen frowned then sat forward looked away for a moment ah the marked woman lededje i remember her talked to her a few times im sure you did veppers said she was okay troubled but all right i liked her she looked at veppers with what he felt sure was meant to be profound sincerity shes dead extremely im very sorry to hear that please pass on my condolences to her family and loved ones veppers smiled thinly myself in other words im so sorry how did she die she took her own life oh huen said her expression pained she looked down veppers wanted to smack her in the teeth with something heavy she took a deep breath stared at the surface of the desk that is veppers took over before it got too sentimental i expect some sort of report an accounting for this im going to be away for the next few days yes the drone said pivoting to point towards the view specifically at where the sleek shape of the ship stationed over the veprine corporation tower threw a slanted grey shadow over part of the city we saw your ride arrive veppers ignored it he pointed at huen again kichaow said the voice from the couch and by the time i get back i expect to hear some sort of explanation if not there will be consequences legal and diplomatic consequences did she leave a note huen asked what veppers said did she leave a note huen repeated often when people kill themselves they leave a note something to explain why they did it did lededje veppers allowed his mouth to hang open a little to attempt to express just how grotesquely insulting and irrelevant this piece of meddling effrontery was he shook his head you have six days he told the woman he turned and walked to the door answer any further questions she has he told jasken as he passed him ill be in the flier dont take too long he left that man had a funny nose said the little voice from behind the couch so jasken huen said smiling a little for a moment did she leave a note jasken cradled his good hand in the sling no note was left maam he told her she looked at him for a moment and was it suicide jaskens expression remained just as it had been of course maam and you have no idea how the lace came to be in her head none maam she nodded slowly took a breath sat forward hows the arm this he moved the arm in the cast out from his body a little fine healing feels good as new im glad huen smiled she got up from the chair behind the desk and nodded thank you jasken maam he said with a short bow huen held her child in her arms as she and the drone watched veppers widebodied flier depart from overhead its rotund mirrored rear glinting in the golden sunshine as it banked the craft straightened and headed directly towards the veprine corporation tower and the ship barely smaller than the tower itself poised immediately above it the drones name was olfeshresh well it said the nose injurys real enough but it was never done with a blade and not a bone in jaskens arm has ever been broken his arm is perfectly healthy save for about twenty days worth of minor atrophy due to partial immobility also that cast has concealed hinges to let it come off easily did you get a full reading on the lace as good as though hed left it she glanced at the machine and the drone wobbled its equivalent of a shrug sc tech or good as huen nodded staring at the jhlupian ship as veppers aircraft flew towards it she patted her childs back softly thats interesting chay found herself in the refuge the refuge took up the entire summit of a finger of rock which thrust up from the scrubby desert the remains of a natural arch lay in great piles of sand blown stone between the refuge mesa and the nearby plateau the only access to the refuge was by a rope and cane basket lowered the thirty metres from the refuge to the desert floor by pulleys worked by muscle power the refuge had expanded over the years to rise to six or seven storeys of cluttered wood and adobe buildings and spilled over the side of the mesa itself via treetrunkpropped platforms supporting further precariously poised architecture only females were allowed in the refuge the more senior females copied things called manuscripts she was treated if not exactly as a servant then certainly as somebody who was junior whose opinions did not really matter whose importance came solely from the menial tasks that she performed when not sleeping eating or working she was at worship joining everybody else in the refuge praising god in the chapel god here was a female deity worshipped for her fecundity by these celibates in long services full of chanting she tried to explain that she didnt believe in god but this was at first dismissed as impossible nonsense as absurd as denying the existence of the sun or gravity then when the others saw she was serious she was hauled up before the fearsome superior of the refuge who explained that belief in god was not a choice she was newly arrived and would be indulged this time but she must submit to the will of god and obey her betters in the villages and cities they burned people alive for proclaiming that god did not exist here if she persisted she would be starved and beaten until she saw sense not everybody the superior explained and at this point the formidable female in her dark robes of office appeared suddenly old chay thought was able to accept god into their hearts as easily or as fully as did the most pious and enlightened even if she had not yet opened herself completely to gods love she must realise that it was something that would come with time and the very rituals and services devotions and chants that she found so meaningless might themselves lead to the belief she lacked even if at first she did not feel that she partook of them with any faith at all just as one might do useful work without fully understanding the job one was engaged in or even what the point of it was so the behaviour of devotion still mattered to the allforgiving god and just as the habitual performance of a task gradually raised ones skills to something close to perfection bringing a deeper understanding of the work so the actions of faith would lead to the state of faith finally she was shown the filthy stinking windowless cell carved into the rock beneath the refuge where she would be chained starved and beaten if she did not at least try to accept gods love she trembled as she looked at the shackles and the flails and agreed she would do her best she shared a dorm with half a dozen others on the floor beneath the top looking out in the other direction from the nearby plateau towards the open desert these were open rooms one wall missing with only a heavy tarpaulin to lower if the dusty wind was blowing in with stepped floors leading down to a wall that was hidden from the topmost tier open rooms with a view over the plain desert or grassland were comforting places closed rooms felt wrong imprisoning especially for going to sleep in or waking up in similarly being alone was a punishment to an individual from a herd species so like most normal people she liked to bed down in a group with at least half a dozen others she woke the others up with her nightmares too often to be a popular sleepcompanion but then she was not alone in having tormenting dreams she had books to read and other people to talk to and all she had to do for her keep was help with the general work required to keep the place in good repair and add her strength to help pull on the ropes which brought the baskets of water and food and the very occasional visitor or noviciate up from the cluster of small buildings at the base of the mesa the services and chants became just part of the routine she still resented them and still thought they were without meaning but she added her voice to all the others the weather was warm without being uncomfortable except when the wind blew out of the desert and brought dust with it the water came from a deep well near the base of the mesa and was still deliciously cold when it arrived in the big canewrapped pottery jars she stood by the walls over the cliff sometimes staring down at the land beneath marvelling at her lack of fear she knew that she ought to feel threatened by the precipitous drop but she didnt the others thought she was mad they stayed away from the edges avoided being too near windows over sheer drops she had no idea how long she would be allowed to stay in the refuge presumably until she got so used to life here it had come to seem normal then when all that had gone before had started to seem like a terrible dream just a nightmare and she had convinced herself that this limited but safe and frugally rewarding life was going to continue then when she had learned to hope she would be taken back to the hell they had done what they could with her memories to make them less raw and livid than they would have been and when she slept the nightmares though still terrible were somehow more vague than she might have expected after a year there she began to sleep quite well but the memories were still there in some form she knew she supposed they had to be your memories made you she could remember more of her life in the real now before during roughly the latter half of the time she had spent in the hell with prin she had come to think that that earlier life her real life she supposed had itself been a dream or something that had been part of the torture concocted imposed to make the suffering worse now she accepted that it probably had been real and she had simply been driven out of her mind by her experiences in hell she had been a real person a pavulean academic involved with the good cause of bringing an end to the hells she had met prin at the university and between them theyd had the connections and the bravery to get themselves sent into the hell to record what they experienced there and bring back the truth of it to the world the hell had been virtual but the experiences and the suffering had felt entirely real she had lost her mind and retreated to a belief that her earlier real life had been a dream or some thing invented within the hell to make the contrast between the two all the more painful prin had been stronger than her he had stayed sane and tried to save her along with himself when the time came for them to attempt their escape but only he had got through and returned to the real at the time shed convinced herself hed only gone from one bit of the hell to another but he must have got out entirely if he hadnt she was sure shed have been presented with the proof of it by now she had been taken before the king of hell some ultimate demon who had been frustrated that she had no hope and so was resigned to the hell and he had killed her then she had woken here in this hale and healthy pavulean body on this strange tall stick of rock poised between the plateau and the desert a sun yellowwhite rose and fell arcing high over the desert out in the desert lines of tiny dots that might be animals or people moved sometimes birds flew in the sky singly or in small flocks occasionally landing and calling raucously from the highest roofs of the refuge buildings rains came rarely sweeping in from the plateau in giant dark veils like the trailing bristles of a vast broom the refuge smelled strange pleasantly different for a halfday afterwards and the open rooms and quiet courtyards were full of the sound of dripping once she stood and listened to the steady dripdripdrip of an overflowing gutter as its rhythm exactly matched that of a chant being sung in the chapel and marvelled at the simple beauty of both there was a track that led away over the plateau towards the flat horizon and from the tracks end a steep path zigzagged down flaws and ravines cut into the plateau edge until it met the slope of rubble at the foot of the cliff far away across the plateau at the far end of the track there was a road apparently and the road led to a city to many cities eventually but even the closest was many tens of days away and none of them were good places they were dangerous and unhealthy the sort of places that you needed a refuge to get away from she had never felt any desire to go to any of them never felt any desire to leave the refuge at all they would leave her until this all became normal until it had become all that she really remembered then she would be dragged back to the hell again she never lost sight of this accepting each day without pain as a blessing but never taking the next day for granted she had been there over two years before she was asked to help with the copying of the manuscripts this was what the females of the refuge did to pay for the food they received via the road and the track and the path and the buildings at the foot of the mesa and the ropehauled cane baskets they made perfect copies of ancient illuminated manuscripts in a language that none of them understood the blank books pens inks and gold leaf arrived by basket and a year or two later the completed books were sent back down by basket to start their journey back to the distant cities you were only alone when you worked on the manuscripts you were allocated a bare copying cell which had a desk a manuscript to be copied a blank book which would become the copy and a supply of pens and inks each cell had a single window which was too high up in the wall to present a distracting view but which provided plenty of light her eyes would start to hurt after a few hours it was a relief to herd down to the chapel with the others and sing eyes closed or raised to the resplendent light of the chapels translucently glowing plaster windows she had become a good singer and knew many of the chants by heart she worked hard at copying the manuscripts marvelling at their indecipherable beauty the illuminations were of stars and planets and fabulous animals and ancient buildings and plants lots of trees and flowers and verdant landscapes even so she thought as she carefully traced and then coloured in the illuminations and subsequently copied the mysterious letters for all she knew these were instruction manuals for torturing people and the pretty illustrations were just to fool you she worked away filling her days with the silent copying of the words onto the blank pages and the echoed singing of the chants into the embracing space of the chapel the books that she was able to read which came from a separate library and were much plainer and cruderlooking than the ones she and the others copied all talked only of a time long before she had been born and the other females of the refuge also talked solely of a much more simple time cities with no public transport ships with sails and no engines medicine that was little better than crossing your trunks and hoping and no real industry at all just the workshops of individuals still they found things to talk about the general idiocy of males the boringness of their diet the rumours of bandits in the desert or on the plateau the frailties jealousies friendships enmities and crushes of their fellows and all the general gossip of a couple of hundred people of the same sex all cooped up together with a rigid if generally nonpunitive hierarchy the other females looked at her uncomprehendingly when she tried to tell them what had happened to her she guessed they thought she was mad they seemed to have had no life beyond this one with all the limitations of technology and mores that implied they had been raised in the distant cities or in rural communities they had experienced some misfortune and been thrown out of whatever herd community they had been part of been rescued and brought here as far as she could tell they really did believe in this god that they all had to worship still at least this god promised only one afterlife for those worthy heaven awaited the pious while those found wanting faced oblivion rather than perpetual torture she wondered sometimes how long this was all taking back in the real she knew something of the technology and the ratios involved a year of time in the real could be compressed into a minute in a virtual environment it was the opposite of a nearlightspeed experience spend what felt to you like half a lifetime away but come back a changed completely different person and find that only an hour had passed and nobody had even missed you was this quiet painfree life running at that speed or at a gentler rate perhaps even in realtime for all she knew she realised eventually she was living ultra slowly in this virtual existence and what felt like a few years here was a millennium back in the real so that if she ever did get back she would find everything altered totally and all the people she had known long dead so long dead that even in the average and perfectly pleasant afterlife there would be no trace of them left very occasionally as she stood by one of the cliffedge walls she wondered what would happen to her if she climbed over and jumped straight back here back to the hell or nothing just oblivion you are so fearless the others told her when they saw her standing there looking down but not so fearless she would take the leap and find out after a few years she took on some extra responsibilities in the script room overseeing and checking the work of others in the chapel she led the singing often as not by now the refuge superior was a wizened old thing with poor back legs in time she needed a trolley for her hind quarters and help to ascend the spiral ramp that led to the higher floors of the refuge she started instructing chay in the running of the refuge bringing her into its administration chay was given her own small room though usually she still preferred to bed down with the others when night fell she still had nightmares of suffering and torment but they were duller and even more vague now one evening seven years after shed arrived a fire broke out when the hot desert wind was blowing they all fought it desperately quickly using up the little water they had ten of them perished in smokefilled rooms trying to save the manuscripts finally throwing the precious originals from high windows into the central courtyard and saving all but two before being choked by the smoke or caught by the flames six of them died when a whole wing of the refuge supports weakened by the fire fell to the desert in a great boiling burst of flame and smoke even over the terrible roaring noise produced by the disintegrating brick work splintering wood and careening flame you could hear the screams as they fell night had fallen by then and the wind had gone she watched the rolling rush of sparks produced by the collapse sweeping upwards outshining and outnumbering the stars in the clear black gulf of sky they buried the remains in the small graveyard at the foot of the mesa it was the first time she had descended from the refuge in all those years the ceremony was brief the most meaningful words said impromptu the chants sung over the graves sounded flat unechoing she could find nothing to say but stood looking at the little piles of sandy earth with their wooden grave markers and thought of the suffering the dead had endured just before they died at least it had been brief she told herself and when it was over it was over maybe she reminded herself bleakly they were still within the virtual this had all taken place inside a simulation no matter that there was no proof of this who within it knew what had really happened to whatever consciousness those dead individuals had possessed she stood in one of the burnedout script halls that night she was one of those on firewatch in case it all started up again surrounded by the smell of burned wood and rebaked brick wisps of smoke or steam leaked into the cool still night air from a few places she checked each one lantern in one trunk bucket of water at the ready in the other under an overturned burnedblack table she found one charred blank manuscript it was a small one for the tiniest of the manuscripts they ever copied she brushed the brown crisped edges of the pages clear it would never do to be copied onto now she couldnt bear to put it back where shed found it so she stuffed it into a pocket she thought back to this later and knew that she had had no idea at the time what she was going to do with the blank book maybe just keep it in her copying cell or on the shelves of her room a grim and grisly souvenir a memento mori instead she started writing in it she would set down the story of her life as she remembered it just a dozen or so lines each day it was not something that was forbidden as far as she could gather there were no rules covering such a thing at all but she kept it secret nevertheless she used wornout pens which had become too scratchy to be risked on the manuscript copies the ink was made from the charred timbers from the fire life went on they rebuilt much of the refuge took in fresh noviciates the superior died and a new one was appointed chay even had a vote and she found herself a little further up the hierarchy the old superior had wanted to be disposed of the old way left to the elements and the scavenger birds on the refuges highest tower chay was one of those accorded the dubious privilege of cleaning up the bits of bone after the birds had picked them clean and the sun had bleached them white it was nearly a year after the old superiors death while she was singing one of the most beautiful chants that she broke down and wept for the old female gradually the chants had brought a sort of beauty and even a meaning into her life she realised twenty years later she was the superior and had it not been for the book of her life written in the manuscript blank with the charred page she might not still have believed that she had had any sort of existence before that no life as a gifted academic in a free liberated society with superconductors space elevators ais and lifeextension treatments and no few months spent in the utter ghastliness of the virtual hell accumulating the evidence to present to an unbelieving world an unbelieving galaxy for that matter that might help bring about the destruction of the hells for ever she had kept writing her book continuing on beyond all that she could recall of her life in the real and her time with prin in the virtual hell writing down everything that happened to her since here in this quiet untroubled existence which she had come to love and believe in and still expected to be dragged away from back to hell every single night she had become wizened her face was lined her pelt was grey and her gait had stiffened and become awkward with age she oversaw the workings of the refuge to the best of her ability and did all that she could for the noviciates and other occupants at least once per season now that she was superior she had to clamber into a basket and be lowered to the austere cluster of small buildings at the foot of the mesa to deal and negotiate with the representative of the charity which distributed their manuscripts in the cities the representatives were always male so she had no choice but to descend to them they could not be winched up to come and see her because it was forbidden usually as she was lowered carefully towards the desert floor she reflected on how much she had changed her old self the person she had been back in the real before the brief but traumatising excursion in the hell would have wanted to break with that tradition would have wanted to change things would have wanted to insist that there was nothing beyond idiotic absurdly unquestioned tradition stopping males from being brought up into the refuge itself the person she had become the person she was now could see the force in all such arguments and yet still thought it was right to continue with the tradition perhaps it was wrong in some theoretical way but perhaps not and if it was well it did no great harm maybe it was even charming just eccentric anyway she would not like to have to be the superior on whose shift the tradition was changed she had always wondered how faithful to a real changing society and world this simulation was did the cities that the noviciates travellers and charity representatives spoke of and claimed to have come from really exist did people within those cities work and struggle and study and improvise as they would in the real if you left this sim running would somebody somewhere invent moveable type and printing and so make what they did here in the refuge irrelevant and all its occupants redundant she kept waiting for one of the charity representatives to turn up for their latest meeting with a regretful look and a copy of something hot off this brand new thing called a press however as she approached what must be the end of her life in this virtuality the freshly illuminated manuscripts kept on being taken away and the supplies of writing materials and of food and other necessities kept on being delivered she realised that she would die as far as that idea had any meaning here in the same society she had been born into then she would have to remind herself that she had not been born here she had simply woken up already an adult one year a noviciate was brought before her for denying the existence of god she found herself saying pretty much what had been said to her by the old superior showing the girl the deep buried cell and the whips and flails gave chay no pleasure though the dank lamplit dungeon didnt smell as bad as it had when shed been shown it she thought shed never had cause to use it that was probably why or maybe her sense of smell was going with everything else thankfully the noviciate relented albeit with illdisguised contempt and no further action needed to be taken she wondered if she could have ordered the punishment carried out if things hadnt gone so agreeably her eyesight gradually grew too poor for her to continue to write her life story in her partcharred book the letters had become larger and larger as her sight had failed one day she thought she would be writing only a single letter per page just as well in way as she had only filled twothirds of the blank and would die soon with lots of pages unfilled but writing the bigger and bigger letters made the whole undertaking start to appear ridiculous and selfimportant and eventually she gave in and stopped writing altogether she had long since caught up with herself anyway and was effectively just keeping a rather boring diary so she bored the noviciates with her stories instead she was the superior so they had to listen or maybe young people these days were just very polite her voice had almost gone but still she would be carried to the chapel each day to listen enraptured eyes closed to the beautiful transcendent singing eventually she lay on her death bed and an angel came for her nineteen the jhlupian heavy cruiser ucalegon forty times as fast as any ship possessed by the sichultian enablement delivered veppers to iobe cavern city on vebezua in less than two days vebezua was the furthest flung of the enablements planets lying in a small spiral of stars called the chunzunzan whirl a sparse twist of old stars that also held the tsung system of course im serious why cant i just buy one they are not for sale why not it is not policy so change the policy the policy is not to be changed why is the policy not to be changed because changing policies is not policy now youre just going round in circles i am merely following you no youre not i am being direct you are being evasive nevertheless is that it nevertheless and we just leave things there yes veppers jasken xingre half a dozen others of veppers retinue plus the jhlupians principal aide and a mediumranking officer from the ucalegon were sharing a tethered flier making its way through one of the great karst caves that made up iobe cavern city the cave averaged a kilometre or so across a huge pipe whose floor held a small winding river the citys buildings terraces promenades and boulevards rose up from the riverside increasingly precipitously as they approached the midway point of the cave where the buildings became sheer cliffs a few went even beyond that clinging to the overhanging curve of the caverns upper wall the flier tetherrails were stationed further up still cantilevered out from the caves roof on gantries like a sequence of giant cranes a series of enormous oval holes punctured the roofs summit letting in great slanting slabs of withering vebezuan sunlight lying close to its slowly everbrightening star the planet was cursed with too much sunlight but blessed with entire continents made mostly of deeply eroded limestone providing vast cave systems in which its inhabitants native animals and sichultian incomers could hide you had to travel to the very high and very low latitudes to find pleasantly balmy climates the poles were havens of temperate freshness very occasionally the hills there even got snow xingre veppers said with a sorrowful shake of his head you are my trusted business associate and even a friend in your own strange alien way but i may have to go over your head here or carapace carapace though in our language the expression is i may have to go beyond your reach so who would i have to ask about what about buying a ship no one there is no one to ask because such things are not covered not covered is that the same as being not policy yes lieutenant veppers said turning to the ships officer who also floated twelve limbs neatly folded on one of the shiny cushions that doubled as chairs and translators is this really true is what true sir that its not possible to buy one of your ships it is not possible to buy navy ships of our navy why not it is not policy veppers sighed yes so ive been told he said looking at xingre navies rarely sell their vessels not if they are of the best xingre said youre already hiring it to me veppers said not the same the officer told him we remain in control sold to you you assume control itd only be one ship veppers insisted i dont want your whole navy really such a fuss you people are positively purists veppers had once asked ambassador huen if it was possible to buy a culture ship shed stared at him for a second then burst out laughing the flier zoomed rising to avoid a high bridge barring their way the craft stayed flat rather than pointing its nose up the winch bogey travelling the network of flier tether rails above reeling in the crafts four invisibly fine monofilament lines equally iobe city had banned flying machines entirely for centuries then allowed fliers to be used but suffered one or two accidents which had resulted in the destruction of several notable buildings and prized historic crosscavern bridges so had compromised by allowing fliers but only if they were tethered to tracks in the cavern roofs and controlled automatically the best jhlupian ships are of the jhlupian navy the lieutenant said we prefer to keep it that way for the benefit of not being outrun by civilian vessels embarrassment might ensue otherwise most governmental entities share this policy do the sichultians sell their best ships to their lessers xingre asked id give you a very good price veppers said he turned from xingre to the lieutenant very good you could even take the weapons off its the speed im after culture ships are even faster sir jasken said veppers looked coldly at him are they now some are the lieutenant said how much would a ship like the ucalegon cost jasken asked the lieutenant if it was for sale impossible to say the officer said you must know how much they cost veppers said you have to price them you must have a budget for how many you can build and operate realistic price might be more than entire gross economic product of sichultian enablement xingre said veppers smiled i doubt that xingre made a chuckling sound nevertheless additionally the lieutenant said there are treaties to be considered veppers exchanged looks with jasken oh i bet there are as responsible members of galactic community and galactic council the officer said we are signatories to treaties forbidding us from overrunging certain technologies overrunging veppers asked in his best whatthefuckdoesthatmean tone he looked from the lieutenant to jasken who shrugged technical term xingre said one may gift or sell technology one rung down the ladder of civilisational attainment but no further ah that veppers said sourly that keeps us all in our place doesnt it xingre rocked backwards on his shiny pillow looking outward from the flier my is beautiful city he said and the ships officer said one is behoved to retain control over said technology to prevent it being resold further down relevant tech ladder by rascalish peoples acting purely as middlemen fraudulently enduser certificates xingre said agreeing so we have to wait until were about to invent something our selves before we can buy it from somebody else veppers asked much like that xingre said it waved a thin green limb at a particularly slim highly ornate bridge they were passing over see great elegance of form it waved at the road and pedestrian traffic crossing the bridge not that anybody was looking at them and anyway the fliers bubble canopy was mirrored on the outside such treaties and agreements prevent freeforall the lieutenant said helpfully veppers looked unimpressed hmm freeforalls xingre agreed tsk the flier swung round banking as it turned to enter a side cavern this new tunnel was about half the diameter of the one they had been heading down until now the craft levelled out but dropped still level and flew on into darkness this cavern had no roof piercings to let in the sunlight or buildings within a display on the fliers forward screen lit up to show what the cavern looked like ahead rocky uneven walls stretched curving away into the distance i like freeforalls veppers said quietly they sat in a paper boat floating on a lake of mercury lit by a single distant ceiling hole producing a searchlight shaft of luminescence veppers had brought an ingot of pure gold specially he took his mask off for a moment plop it in he told jasken jasken didnt take his mask off you can talk through the mask sir he told veppers who just frowned then nodded impatiently jasken slid the soapbarsize lump of gold out of his tunic held it by one end reached over the side of the boat and dropped the thick glossy sliver overboard it vanished into the silver surface veppers took part of the boats gunwale between his fingers wobbled it paper really he asked xingre pulling his mask away again the jhlupian didnt need a mask mercury vapour wasnt poisonous to jhlupians paper the alien confirmed compressed it made an expanding then contracting gesture with its limbs easier disposing of the flier had reached the limit of the cave systems tether rails had landed been released from its cables and flown on through another two junctions worth of smaller and smaller side tunnels until it had reached the cavern holding mercury lake one of vebezuas modest number of tourist attractions the flier had hovered centimetres off the surface of the lake and let them step straight into the paper boat they could have walked across the surface of the mercury of course and veppers had wanted to but apparently that was forbidden or at least frowned on or gave you seasickness or something the mercury could have been cleaner veppers reckoned its surface held dust and grit and swirls of little rock particles like dark sand the boat was slightly absurd it looked like a scaledup version of the sort of paper boat a child might make even as a raft of course it could have been made from gold or any element with a molecular number lower than mercury lead would still sink in mercury but gold shouldnt it was one number down the periodic table and so ought to float veppers looked over the side of the vessel at where his ingot of gold had entered the liquid metal but it showed no sign of surfacing yet after dropping them at the boat the flier had taken off again carrying the other two jhlupians with it apart from showing his importance to the jhlupian navy xingre hadnt needed his aide along with him in the first place and the navy itself while being contractually obliged to bring veppers here safely had wanted no part of whatever might transpire or be agreed here another smaller flier approached jasken watched it on his oculenses the paper boat lay about two hundred metres off the nearest section of cavern wall mercury lake was not natural though nobody knew who had chosen to place such a huge amount of the metal in an outoftheway spot within a natural labyrinth in a planet that was itself quite isolated the approaching flier was only about three metres by four small for two people of different species jasken thought he had several weapons with him including one concealed by the cast over his arm he felt a need to check them again but didnt he already knew they were primed and ready the oculenses were a little confused by the mercury vapour swirling within the chamber the cavern was roughly spherical about half a kilometre across it was a little under half full of mercury and volcanic activity kept the very bottom of the chamber heated producing every now and again gigantic belching bubbles within the liquid metal those bubbles produced the gasses that made the air in the chamber poisonous to panhumans and many other biological beings as well as making it next to impossible to monitor any vibrations through the air by laser or any other form of surveillance the paper boat kept near but not too close to the centre of the lake sufficiently distant to ride any waves produced by the sporadic bubbles the volcanic activity wasnt natural either several hundred thousand years earlier long before the sichultians arrived on the scene to find a happily habitable but sentiently uninhabited planet a hole had been drilled down through many tens of kilometres of rock to create the tiny magma chamber that heated the base of the cavern and so kept the mercury simmering nobody knew who had done this or why the best guesses were that it was either a religious thing or an artwork while jasken was watching the flier approach veppers looked over the side of the boat and saw the shining lozenge of the gold ingot surfaced again at last he prodded jasken on the shoulder and he retrieved it the flier set down by the side of the paper boat it looked like a fat bullet made of chrome and coloured glass it split opened and revealed a glistening mass within just about discernible inside was a dark elliptical shape fringed or tentacled at either end welcome friend from flekke xingre said good day said an obviously synthesised voice from the opened bullet of the flier chruw slude zsor functionarygeneral an honour xingre said dipping on its floating cushion we were expecting you to arrive with the nauptrian negotiator veppers said talking through the mask that is me i am here said the flier containing the flekke in what was somewhat counterintuitively veppers thought a more organicsounding voice though i am not nauptrian i am of the nauptre reliquaria were you expecting a sample of our feeder species or making a mistake humble apologies xingre said extending the limb nearest veppers towards the man by just enough for the movement to be interpreted as a gesture at all veppers had seen and reluctantly kept quiet we biological species xingre said putting a laugh into its voice in such niceties matterings err with sporadic effect veppers had to suppress a smile he had noticed before that xingres grasp of language ebbed and flowed quite usefully on such occasions allowing the jhlupian to present itself as any where between razor smart and hopelessly bumbling as desired the reliquarian might have been nonplussed by this it said nothing for a moment then to introduce i am risytcin nauptre reliquaria extrajurisdictional service rank full mediary please xingre said gesturing onboarding the opened bullet shape slid forward up and over the shallow gunwale of the boat coming to rest just above the flat interior surface of the vessels hull most splendid xingre said and reaching up with half of its dozen limbs drew a compressed paper cover right over the whole of the boats open surface enclosing them gentle glows from the jhlupians floating pillow and the interior of the reliquarians bulletshaped casing kept them all visible to each other it was almost romantic veppers thought if your taste ran to weird inhuman aliens and fanatical machines with a taste for torment well hello to you both veppers said to the flekkian and the reliquarian thank you for coming and for agreeing to conduct our meeting in sichultian it is easier for us to talk down to you than it is for you to aspire to our far more sophisticated language the reliquarian said veppers smiled well i have to hope that lost something in the translation now however i understand we have to do this ridiculous thing with the masks the ridiculous thing with the masks meant them wearing a sort of helmet or similar each from which a hose led to a central junction chamber this way they could all talk and listen to each other without anybody else hearing it all seemed madly contrived to veppers but apparently in this age of summedstate super quantum phaseparsed encryptography it was the last thing anybody would be looking for the nauptre reliquaria especially thought it was just the greatest thing imaginable and had insisted on it it took a while to get everything and everybody set up and adjusted risytcin insisted on inspecting both the ingot of gold in jaskens pocket and his oculenses taking some time over the latter turning them over and over in a maniple field and at one point seemingly trying to twist them apart but eventually pronounced them safe and handing them back jasken looked unhappy and carefully cleaned and readjusted them before putting them back on to business xingre said once they were all technically happy and the pleasantries had been dealt with its voice sounded at once muffled and echoey coming through the interlinked set of tubes all linked up together barely lit hunkered down in this crude approximation of a boat they looked veppers thought like some bizarrely motley set of desperate survivors from some strange and terrible shipwreck the reliquarian said introductory statement and opening position of the nr with superposition of same relevant to flekke we have good reason to believe that the antihell faction in the relevant confliction concerning proposed unwarranted intrusions in certain virtual realities grows desperate they may attempt to intrude within the real a possible source of intrusion might conceivably come via the tsungarial disk we will seek to prevent this happening and expect our allies and friends to cooperate in this the cooperation of the veprine corporation falls within this definition to mr veppers of the veprine corporation kindly state your position and intentions veppers nodded all very interesting he said so we are to take it that the nr representative speaks for the flekke as well indeed the ellipsoid shape within the reliquarian said as stated its voice sounded appropriately watery through the linking tubes and do you also talk on the behalf of the gfcf veppers asked the geseptianfardesile cultural federacy need not be present the reliquarian informed them their acquiescence is assured and assumed veppers smiled broadly splendid to repeat your position and intentions mr veppers speaking on behalf of yourself the veprine corporation and the sichultian enablement to the extent that you are able to answer for it the reliquarian said well then subject to a satisfactory negotiationary outcome here veppers said my position is that i fully support the stance and values of our good friends and allies the nr and the flekke and will do whatever is within my modest means to facilitate their strategic goals he smiled opened his arms wide i am on your side of course he smiled again providing the price is right naturally what is this price chruw slude zsor functionarygeneral for the flekke said i recently lost something very precious to me veppers said and discovered that i had gained something at the same time something i might not have wished on myself would this be linked to the remains of the culture neural lace which is in one of your servants pockets risytcin asked how well spotted veppers said yes i would like to investigate the possibility of replacing the thing that i lost with an identical item and i would like to have the assistance even protection of both the nr and the flekke should somebody anybody wish to harm me due to any circumstances which might be linked with the neural lace being in my possession this sounds a little vague chruw slude zsor said i intend to be much less vague when we discuss financial remuneration and technology transfer veppers said what im looking for right now is a declaration of goodwill more than anything else the flekke are happy to give this chruw slude zsor said there was another inscrutable pause before the reliquarian said similarly subject to contract the flekkian added also similarly risytcin confirmed veppers nodded slowly good he said we can do details later but for now id like to approach the monetary strand of these talks mr jasken here will record our deliberations using his oculenses from this point on until further notice each of us having a veto is that agreed agreed risytcin said the principle is allowed chruw slude zsor said though given that all we ask of you is to do nothing and the price of in action traditionally is significantly less than that of action we might wish that you do not approach such negotiations with too unrealistic a set of hopes veppers smiled i shall as ever be the very soul of reasonableness veppers had extensive business interests on vebezua and throughout the rest of that day he attended a series of more conventional meetings following the one held in the paper boat on mercury lake the iobe city authorities held a reception for him that evening in a great ballroom complex suspended on cables in the centre of the single greatest circular piercing above the main city caverns the ceiling was opened to the night vebezua was uncomfortably close to its star and iobe lay almost right on the equator by day it would have been insufferably hot and bright in the ballroom with the ceiling irised back but by night the full glory of the stars was displayed a distant speckled wash of multicoloured lights enhanced by a large waning moon and the layered slow and notsoslowmoving sparkle of junk and hab light as the planets various halos of artificial satellites rotated overhead veppers had been coming to vebezua on business for decades and possessed one of the finest mansions in the inner city however it was being remodelled again and so he had elected to stay in iobes finest hotel his suite of suites and his retinue taking up the two top floors he owned the hotel of course so making the arrangements even at relatively short notice had been trivial for security reasons he slept right at the back of the hotel where its largest finest but windowless grand bedroom had been carved out of the rock of the cavern wall before retiring for the night he had jasken meet him in one of the saunas they sat facing each other naked in the steam my how pale that arm is becoming he told the other man jasken had taken his cast off and left it outside jasken flexed his arm clenched his fist im due to take it off next week mmhmm veppers said the reliquarian did it put something in the oculenses i think so probably a tracker too small to tell do i give it to xingres techs to check tomorrow tonight you stay here jasken frowned you sure quite sure dont worry about me cant i just leave the oculenses no and do something memorable what something memorable go back out to a club start a fight or get two girls fighting over you or throw a whore into a wine barrel whatever it takes to be noticed nothing so heinous anyone would think to wake me obviously but something thatll make it very clear youre still here veppers frowned jasken was frowning at him veppers looked down at his own lap oh yes well just the mention of whores will do that better deal with it he grinned at jasken meeting over tell astil ill manage by myself tonight and send pleur up on your way out the suites giant circular bed could be surrounded by multiple concentric layers of soft and floaty curtains once they were all fully drawn round and the hidden monofils within the fabrics had been activated and stiffened it was impossible to tell from outside that the bed had descended into the deep floor and retreated into the rock wall behind and beneath veppers left pleur sleeping the tiny drugdelivery bulb attached to her neck would keep her under for days if necessary the drug bulb looked just like an insect which was a nice touch he thought he must get sulbazghi to provide more of the things the bed went back to where it had come from veppers walked across the gently lit tunnel and into a little underground car not too dissimilar to the reliquarians bullet shape he thought as he swung the door down switched the thing on and flicked a button to tell it to go he was pressed back in the couch as the car accelerated the reliquaria annoying species or machine type whatever the fuck they were again though useful on occasion even if it was to be little better than a decoy he punched in the destination code the private underground car system had various stops most within iobe city almost all within buildings and other structures owned by veppers one though was inside an old mine way out in the karst desert a quarter of an hour and over a hundred kilometres from the city outskirts the stealthed gfcf shuttle was waiting for him a dark shape like a ragged shallow dome of night squatting on the serrations of rock moments after hed boarded it rose silently kept subsonic accelerated harder once it achieved space threaded its way through the layers of the orbiting habs fabs and satellites and docked with a much larger but similarly secretive ship keeping a little above geosynchronous orbit the dark slimly ellipsoid vessel swallowed the shuttle craft and slipped away into hyperspace with barely a ripple to disturb the skein of real space he was met by a group of small obviously alien but ethereally beautiful creatures with sliverblue skin which turned to delicate scales insectwing thin and iridescent like a tiny lacy rainbow where most panhumans had head hair they wore white wispy clothes and had large round eyes one came forward and addressed him mr veppers it said its singsong voice soft high and mellifluous how good to see you again you are indeed most welcome back aboard the gfcf succourclass contact craft messenger of truth veppers smiled evening all great to be aboard and what are you supposed to be i am the angel of life and death chay it is time the thing had appeared in her sleeping chamber in the very middle of the night there was a noviciate sleeping in a chair by chays bedside but chay didnt even bother trying to wake her she knew in her heart this was something she would have to deal with or endure by herself the creature was something between quadri and bipedal in form its front legs still looked like legs but they were much smaller than its rear legs it had a single trunk and two vast slowly beating wings which flared from its back they were impossibly wide far too big to fit into the chamber and yet by whatever logic was supposed to be operating here they appeared to fit inside quite comfortably nevertheless the thing claiming to be the angel of life and death hovered over the foot of bed which was where such things were generally expected to show up if you believed in that sort of thing and perhaps even if you didnt she supposed she wondered again about reaching out and shaking the noviciate awake but it would be such an effort she thought everything was such an effort these days getting up hunkering down bending standing eating defecating everything even seeing of course though she noticed that she could see the selfproclaimed angel of life and death better than she ought to be able to an apparition then a virtuality or whatever you wanted to call it after all these years she thought finally some proof beyond her own dimming memories and the fading ink in her charred page diary that all she had lived through in the real and the hell had been in some sense true not just figments of her imagination you mean time for me to die yes chay well i must disappoint you whatever you are or might claim to be by one way of looking at things i am already dead i was killed by the king of hell himself she gave a bubbling choking laugh or at least by some big bugger of a thing in another way of looking chay you have lived here and now it is time to die at things you cannot kill me said chay who as superior of the refuge for many years had become used to not being interrupted because in the place i came from originally i am still alive or at least i presume i am and will continue to remain so no matter what sort of tricks you chay you must be quiet now and prepare to meet your maker i had no maker my maker was the universe or my parents they were still alive when i entered the hell can you do anything useful and tell me how they are still alive passed on well well eh no thought not maker indeed what superstitious bollocks are you trying to chay the thing shouted at her quite loudly chay thought and what with her failing hearing that must have meant extremely loudly still the young noviciate asleep in the chair by her bedside didnt even stir she was glad she hadnt wasted the effort waking the girl up you are about to die the apparition told her have you no wish to see god and be accepted into her love oh dont be ridiculous there is no god it was what she believed what she had always believed but still she looked nervously at the sleeping noviciate what the angel cried will you have no thought for your immortal soul oh fuck off chay said then she stopped and felt terrible swearing in front of the noviciate she hadnt sworn aloud for over two decades she was the superior the superior didnt swear but then she was annoyed at herself for being embarrassed and penitent in the first place what did it matter yes chay said while the socalled angel of life and death flapped its impossible wings and stared wideeyed at her fuck off entirely fuck off you ersatz cobbledtogether neitheronethingnortheother piece of poorquality animation do whatever it is you have to do and lets just get this charade over with the great dark angel seemed to pull briefly back then came forward again enfolding her vast black wings about the bed then just around chay who said oh shit and i bet this is going to hurt the ship towered within the shadowy space of its hangar a little over three hundred and fifty metres in height its trim pale hull girdled about its waist with five dark weapon blisters its sleekly pointed nose housing three even longer bubbles it looks fabulously retro veppers said what exactly is it the alien who had addressed him earlier turned to him technically to allow for legal challenges based on laws which admittedly do not yet exist it is a onepointzeroonetwofive to one scale model of a culture murderer general offensive unit it said veppers thought about this doesnt that mean its a model which is bigger than the original yes the gfcfian said clapping its little hands bigger is better yes well generally veppers agreed frowning they were standing in a viewing gallery looking out into a cylindrical hangar a kilometre from top to bottom and half that wide the hangar had been carved out of the compacted ice and rock making up one of the tsung systems halftrillion or so oort cloud objects the lumpy conglomerate of ice housing the gfcf base and within it this hangar was sufficiently massive to provide less than one per cent of standard gravity point your mouth down when you sneezed and you could take off the ship they were looking at its hull a lustrous golden hue veppers strongly suspected had been chosen to resemble as closely as possible his own usual skin colour sat lightly on its flat circular rear its sharply pointed nose spiring toward the hangars ceiling its working name is the joiler veppers the little alien told him though it may be renamed anything you wish of course of course veppers looked round the rest of the gallery they were alone the other gfcf people had remained on the ship when theyd shuttled across to the ancient lump of space debris one of the near uncountable bits of debris left over after the stellar system had come into being billions of years earlier you approve of the ship veppers shrugged maybe how fast is it mr veppers this obsession with speed let us say faster than the original may we not deem that sufficient what would that be in figures i sigh however the craft is capable of velocities up to approximately one hundred and twentynine thousand times the speed of light veppers genuinely had to stop for a moment and think that did sound like a lot hed have to check but he was fairly certain the jhlupian ship which had taken him to vebezua had travelled slower than that the ships which the veprine corporation heavy industries deep space division constructed measured their maximum velocities in hundreds of times lightspeed this thing was a galaxycrosser even so he refused to look impressed up to he asked the gfcfian was called bettlescroybisspeblispin iii and was androgynous bettlescroy held the rank of legislatoradmiral though like most people in the gfcf the little alien seemed almost ashamed of having any rank at all in fact officially bettlescroys full title was and most species required a deep breath at this point the most honourable heritably concurrent delegated vice emissary legislatoradmiral elect bettlescroybisspeblispin iii of turwentire tertiary demesne c this was the short version of course excluding his educational qualifications and military service medals certain components of this startlingly grand honorific apparently indicated that bettlescroy was the trusted wordgoodastheoriginal clone of somebody back home who was even more imposingly magnificent to the point of being too posh even to do anything as vulgar as actually travelling bettlescroy looked briefly very slightly pained the precise operational parameters are still being optimised as the vessel is fitted out it explained as in original it utilises hyperspacial aggregation motors and additionally applied induction factoring rather than the more common warp engine technology which powers the vessels your own society builds again as in the original of course the maximum apparent velocity is achievable over a defined period a defined period indeed what you mean is only in bursts of course again as in the the original though again again as it were a higher maximum and for longer so whats its indefinitely sustainable maximum the little alien sighed we are still working that out but in excess of ten kilolights assuredly ah what about the weapons generally similar to and in some cases improvements on and refinements of the originals in a word formidable far beyond anything the sichultian enablement currently possesses to be frank so far beyond they will remain arguably nonanalysable and certainly nonreproducible for the foreseeable near to medium future this sir will be a space yacht capable of successfully engaging entire fleets of vessels representing stateoftheart technology by sichultian enablement standards and some way beyond great care will need to be taken drawing up the how shall i put this the generally availablecomponent of the use and ownership contract for this to pass muster with the sadly alltoozealous bureaucrats of the galactic councils technology transfer oversight board hmm well well see it does look terribly retro in style dont you think it is not styled it is simply designed see the form allows all weapons to point forward five out of the eight to point rearward and never less than five to point to any side without rotation in event of field failure the highly fluiddynamic directional profile outline provides high abrasiveenvironment survivability the internal component layout and field substrate deployment are generally held to be as close to perfection as it was then possible to achieve and has not been significantly improved upon since i beseech you veppers inquire such inquiry will prove what i say the murderer class is rightly regarded as a design classic so it is actually quite old let us say that it is proven in many ways it has never been bettered for purposeful elegance still though old veppers my dear friend the example you see before you is better than the original and that was the best there was at the time warship design has improved only incrementally since with gradual though significant improvements to raw speed crude weaponpower effectiveness and so on but in a sense all the various design teams have ever been trying to do is to recreate the design you see here before you for future ages any given design produced right now to represent the sum of all subsequent improvements will quickly itself be improved upon and so eclipsed within a relatively short interval the beauty of the murderer class is that in a way it never was improved upon that legacy is secure endures and ensures that its reputation rather than fade will likely only grow the brighter accommodation the original could accommodate up to one hundred and twenty humans in admittedly relatively cramped conditions our improved version requires minimal operational crew perhaps three or four and so allows for say equal numbers of twenty servantcrew and twenty passengers the latter existing in conditions of some considerable luxury the exact disposition of the apartments and suites would be up to your good self hmm veppers said okay ill think about it well said like our civilisational inspirates we worship nothing but if we and they did worship anything it would be thought reason and rationality as such your ambition to think leaves us assured that our offer will be seen as the generous indeed generous almost to a fault one that it is your confidence is an inspiration to us all im sure twenty the tsungarial disk had been a disappointment the first time veppers had seen it three hundred million space factories of half a million tonnes or more each sounded like a lot but spread out around an entire gas giant from within a few hundred kilometres of razhirs cloud tops to over half a million kilometres distant from the planet in a band forty thousand kilometres thick it was amazing how empty the space around the planet could seem it didnt help that the fabricaria were soot black they didnt reflect glint or really show up at all unless they got in the way of light coming from somewhere else when they registered as at best a spatter of silhouettes as razhir itself was a fairly dullcoloured planet mostly dark reds and browns with only a few lighter yellows at the poles silhouetting the fabricaria against something wasnt that easy either they looked much better and far more impressive in an enhanced image their locations signalled by little spots of light superimposed onto the real view of the system that gave you an impression of just how many of the fuckers there really were the gfcf succourclass ship messenger of truth swung neatly out of hyperspace with the minimum of fuss just a few hundred klicks out from the disks designated initial contact facility one of the disks relatively rare habitats rather than a true factory unit the little space port orbited slowly around razhir at a distance of just over half a million klicks and so was about as far out as any part of the disk ever got the facility itself was a fat grey slightly flattened torus ten klicks across and one in diameter its sides studded with lights and its outer surface barnacled with dock pits and mooring gantries apparently only six of the facilitys twentyfive docking points were in use though that was still twice as many as veppers had ever seen on previous visits veppers sat in what he judged to be a rather cheesy overdecorated lounge within the gfcf ship sprawled within a recliner seat having a pedicure performed by two giggling naked females who looked to represent a sort of halfway compromise between sichultians and gfcfians hed been told their names but had lost interest in them after about the third giggle he sipped on a long drink with pretentious amounts of garnish and a little allegedly entirely edible fish swimming around inside bettlescroybisspeblispin iii sat in a smaller but otherwise similar recliner alongside a roughly spherical floating robot device was gently combing the aliens headscales with a softly glowing immaterial field we are just checking in bettlescroy explained waving one elegantly formed hand at the screen filling their field of vision in front of them this is what is called the disk designated initial contact facility though we usually just call it reception i have been here before veppers said he sort of drawled the remark though he doubted the subtlety would be lost on the alien i own ninetysix of these factories bettlescroy and i dislike being an absentee landlord of course of course the alien said nodding wisely veppers gestured at the screen where the space station was rotating slowly isnt that a culture ship the one just coming into view indeed well spotted that is the fast picket ex killer class limited offensive unit hylozoist of the cultures restoria section it has been stationed here for the last standard year or so supporting the restoria mission within the disk isnt it likely to be checking us out as we are as you put it checking in that would be impolite the alien said with a charming small smile in any event rest assured that the messenger of truth is one of our finest ships and easily capable of resisting any attempt by a craft like the hylozoist to intrusively investigate us without our express permission and indeed active cooperation we can both outgun and outrun the hylozoist it is no threat to us or to the actions that may need to be taken in the near future it has been taken account of and its presence and indeed likely engagement fully factored in to our plans and sims plus without giving too much away bettlescroys pale facial skin flushed a little and it held up one delicate hand in modesty i think it is no secret that the messenger of truth is not here in or near the disk alone it is simply the nominal flagship of our fleet here and indeed not even the most militarily capable of our immediately applicable assets any other culture ships around veppers asked eyeing the fast picket suspiciously as it moved slowly round in front of them nested into its docking pit on the facilitys outer surface no bettlescroy said veppers looked at the alien youre sure it smiled beatifically back were sure it made a graceful blossoming gesture with its hands there we are registered checked in we have done the polite thing and may now go about our business i take it i havent been mentioned veppers asked of course not we are here ostensibly simply to carry out regular oversight and minor maintenance as required of our monitoring facilities distributed throughout the greater disk we may go where we please useful veppers nodded ship bettlescroy said you may continue on to our destination the view on the screen flickered the space station was suddenly replaced by the gas giant razhir its sidelit disc filling a substantial part of the screen and the locations of the fabricaria again shown by tiny points of light the effect was to create a near invisibly fine speckle of bright dust that girdled the banded ruddiness of the gas giant like a haze the view tipped then expanded suddenly and dramatically as the ship plunged into the mass of light points they zipped past the vessel like hail in a ground cars headlights the view swung again as the ship curved round partially following the orbits of the displayed fabricaria bettlescroy clapped its hands daintily and sat up shooing the floating robot away we should make our way to the shuttle the alien announced the shuttle departed the ship on the far side of the disk from the reception facility ejected into space just as the messenger of truth carried out a sudden course correction this bettlescroy explained should serve to conceal the shuttles departure from even the most assiduous monitoring equipment the shuttle drifted already quite precisely aimed towards one of the dark anonymous fabricaria watching on the shuttles screen bettlescroy on one side and the crafts pilot on the other veppers saw the dark absence of the rapidly approaching object blotting out more and more of the other lightpoints until its blackness appeared to fill the screen and it seemed they were about to collide with it he felt an instinctive desire to push himself back into his seat for all the good that would do he told himself he stared at the darkness enveloping the screen as though trying to fend off the manufactorys implied bulk by force of will alone a sudden jolt of deceleration and a longer tug of calibrated slowing pulled them up short close enough to see hints of detail on the dark satellites surface the screen was still superimposing a false view the faint wash of radiation coming off the thing was in wavelengths way below what panhuman eyes could register it was hard to estimate size though veppers knew that the average manufactory was a fat disk about a couple of kilometre across and a third of that in height they varied a little in size though generally only by a factor of two this one looked pretty averagesized though it was less syntheticlooking more natural in appearance than was the norm its surface looked smoothly lumpy enough to be a very old and worn comet nucleus only a few toostraight lines and nearflat surfaces hinted at its artificiality the shuttle flew slowly into what looked like a deep dark crater the screen went perfectly black then light filtered back a faint but slowly increasing yellowwhite luminescence began to seep in all around then flooded the screen the interior of the manufactory was a weblaced space over a kilometre across the massed silvery crisscrossing filaments studded with hundreds upon hundreds of darkly gleaming machines like giant pieces of clockwork all disks and gears shafts and plates cylinders spindles looms and nozzles the shuttle came to a halt perhaps a hundred metres in towards the centre of the satellite may i show you how this will look when and if we go ahead bettlescroy said please do veppers said the screen went into what was obviously a simulation mode overlaying what the fabricarys interior would look like when it was operating the many great clockwork machines ran up and down the network of silvery lines most retreating to the outskirt walls of the manufactory while about a twentieth of their number clumped in the very centre of the space like a nucleus the machines flicked this way and that some light flickered and dark lumps of matter rained down from the machines set around the perimeter falling into the central nexus to disappear gradually the nucleus of machines expanded and other machines slid in from the outside to join those working in the centre whatever they were working on it grew taking on a succession of fairly simple shapes though all implied something roughly twice as long as it was wide and approximately cylindrical as the shape grew its surface only rarely visible and never quite looking like what might be a hull more and more of the clockworklooking machines joined in the act of creation taking place meanwhile the network of silvery filaments was bowing out like an expanding lens made of wires accommodating the roughly ellipsoid shape growing in the centre all the time greater and greater quantities of matter in increasingly varied shapes and sizes were falling in from those machines still stationed on the outside and from holes and nozzles dotted around the interior wall of the satellite itself a couple of minutes after the production process had begun the filaments had shrunk back almost to the interior walls of the fabricary and the great clockwork machines had gone with them and become still no parcels of matter issued from the machines or from the nozzles slots and pits on the walls sitting in the middle of the space now there was a ship it was still very approximately ellipsoidal in shape maybe six hundred metres long two hundred across and one hundred in height its hull shimmered in the light seemingly unable to decide whether it was pitch black or hazy silver rashed all over its shifting uncertain surface were round black blisters of various sizes and sets of shallow perfectly elliptical craters tara bettlescroy said with a shy giggle then glanced at veppers and blushed one space warship it said how fast can it go maximum velocity two point four kilolights and its fully working veppers asked sceptical fully bettlescroy said it would be no match for the vessel we have constructed for you of course but it contains a realtime grown mediumlevel ai substrate already running all relevant internal systems maintenance functions fullspectrum radiative and skein sensory systems a primer fusion power unit ready to start manufacturing antimatter for its prefunctional warp drive and a variety of weapon systems including thermonuclear warhead missiles and thermonuclear plasma generators all that would be necessary to activate it would be to transmit the relevant runprotocols into its processing substrate a trivial task taking minutes at most it would then be immediately ready for spaceflight and battle though obviously giving it a few days to produce its own am would increase its utility and power vastly equip it with prefabricated am for its power units and missiles and it would be even more powerful even more quickly how long does it all take veppers asked for this size the whole process to the stage you see here takes between nine and fifteen days according to the exact specification sufficient raw material being present obviously thats just the surface layers of the fabricary itself isnt it veppers asked again he wasnt going to show what he was feeling here hed had no idea the fabricaria could spin a fullsize working ship especially a fullsize tooledup working warship so quickly hed always known that the fabricaria the veprine corporation was allowed to use had been reduced in operational effectiveness before theyd been allowed to get their hands on them but hed had no inkling by how much hed asked naturally but everybody involved had been professionally vague the veprine corp fabricaria could also produce a ship ready for fitting out in a matter of days albeit a much smaller much less sophisticated ship but the devil was in the fittingout bit that was where most of the hard work lay even disregarding the processing substrates concerned you always brought them in from other specialist subsidiaries anyway the sensory power and engine components were what took all the time to make not to mention all the other bewilderingly many and arcanely diverse subsystems a working spacecraft seemed to require just making the relevant components took months of expensive high complexity work and then fitting them all in place and getting them all working together took almost as long again getting all of that done in a week or two was almost preposterous the outer surfaces of the fabricaria traditionally provide the semiprocessed raw material initially bettlescroy confirmed for longerterm sequential manufacturing there are shuttletugs ready to bring in further truly raw material from other parts of the system though that would not be an issue here the point of the exercise is to manufacture a fleet of ships very quickly for effectively instant deployment rather than to set up a sustainable production process how many ships are we talking about veppers asked bettlescroy made a whistling noise potentially anything up to approximately two hundred and thirty million veppers stared at the alien how many it was hard not to show his astonishment hed thought only a few of the fabricaria would be able or properly primed to build ships this implied that almost all of them would be able to produce a ship each approximately two hundred and thirty million the alien repeated at most fabricaria are capable of being brought together to create larger units themselves subsequently capable of constructing larger andor more complicated vessels probably to a point where the numbers of individual craft involved would be reduced by a factor of thirty or forty no one knows these are guesstimates plus it is not impossible that slightly greater numbers of the fabricaria than we are assuming have been corrupted or disabled by the preexisting smatter infection or by the measures taken to deal with the infection but still up to two hundred and thirty million approximately and all ready at once better than ninetynine point five per cent would be with numbers on that scale especially as we are envisaging using such ancient facilities there are bound to be delays stragglers failures and incompletes possibly even calamities apparently fabricaria have been known to blow up or aggressively dismantle themselves or occasionally sometimes each other veppers hadnt meant to stare at the alien but he found that even he couldnt help it billion ships he said i am hearing you right that is what you said bettlescroy looked bashful almost embarrassed but nodded assuredly im not missing something here am i veppers said that is a truly astounding almost farcical number of ships isnt it bettlescroy blinked a few times its a lot of ships it agreed cautiously couldnt you take over the fucking galaxy with a fleet that size the aliens laughter tinkled gracious no with a fleet of that nature youd be restricted to civilisations no more sophisticated than your own and even then more sophisticated civs would quickly step in to prevent such shenanigans the alien smiled waving one hand at the image of the warship now frozen on the screen these are quite simple craft by level seven or eight civilisational standards we ourselves would need a substantial fleet to cope with the sheer numbers involved but it would hardly trouble us a single large culture gsv could probably cope on its own even if they all came at it together standard tactics would be to slightly outpace them and turn them on each other with its effectors theyd destroy themselves without the gsv firing a single real shot even if they were all magically equipped with hyperspace engines and were capable of performing a surprise d shellsurround manoeuvre youd bet on a gsv breaking out through them itd just brush them aside but if they split up and went off destroying ships and habitats and attacking primitive planets veppers said then theyd need to be dealt with onebyone bettlescroy conceded uncomfortably in effect they would be treated as a highinitialforcestatus lowescalationthreat nonpropagating hegemonising swarm outbreak but well we ourselves have subsubmunitions in cluster missiles capable of successfully engaging craft like this and such behaviour unleashing such a pandestructive force would be beyond reprehensible condemnation would be universal whoever was responsible for setting such actions in motion would be signing their own perpetual incarceration order the little alien shivered convincingly at the very thought so what the hell are we doing even discussing what we are discussing that is different bettlescroy sounded confident depending on the locations and distributions of the targets involved processing substrates and cores presumably remote from high concentration habitation less than fifty million ships ought to be quite sufficient they would overwhelm the defences round the substrate sites through sheer numbers effectively on suicide missions the action would be strictly precision targeted mission end selfdestructlimited and any perceived wider threat would be over before anybody realised it had ever existed meanwhile far from meeting with genuine condemnation a lot of the galactic inplay would be entirely happy that the war had been settled if not in this manner then certainly with this result the alien paused looked at veppers apparently worried let us be clear we are talking about aiding the antihell side are we not yes we are bettlescroy looked relieved well then veppers sat back staring at the image of the ship on the screen he nodded at it how confident of that sim we just saw are you will it really all happen so flawlessly that was not a sim bettlescroy said that was a recording we built that ship a month ago then we set microdrones crawling all through it to check it had been built properly before dismantling it just to be sure and then letting the fabricaria reduce it back to semiprocessed raw material again to cover our tracks the ship was entirely as specified fully working and the disk object which built it is indistinguishable from its quarter of a billion fellow fabricaria you could have beamed this to me in my own study veppers said nodding at the screen a little risky bettlescroy said with a smile it waved one hand and the ship disappeared to be replaced with what sidereadouts by the screen claimed was the real view again of the fabricarys interior webbed with crisscrossing filaments studded with what looked like giant pieces of clockwork also we rather assumed youd arrive with analytical equipment to let you take a closer look at all this stuff the little alien looked at veppers as though searching his clothing for signs of paraphernalia however you appear to have come unencumbered by both tech and suspicions your trust is gratifying we thank you veppers smiled thinly at the alien i decided to travel light he turned to look at the screen again why did they build all these why so many what was the point insurance possibly bettlescroy said defence you build the means to build the fleets rather than build the fleets themselves the means of production being inherently less threatening to ones neighbours than the means of destruction it still makes people think twice about tangling with you the little alien paused though it has to be said that those inclined to the fuckup theory of history maintain that the disk has no such planned purpose and is essentially the result of something between a minor monopathic hegemonising event and an instance of colossal military overordering it shrugged who is to say they both stared at the dark network of threat and promise arrayed before them there is still going to be some degree of blame involved in all this though isnt there veppers asked quietly no matter how precisely targeted and quickly over it all is some retribution will be required good grief yes bettlescroy exclaimed thats precisely why we intend to frame the culture for everything she became an angel in hell chay woke from the blackwinged embrace of the creature which had claimed to be the angel of life and death to discover that she herself had become something not dissimilar she opened her eyes to find herself hanging upside down in a dark space lit by a dim red light from below a faint smell of shit and burning flesh left little doubt where she was she felt sick the truth was that despite everything despite her best intentions despite her dailyrenewed promise to herself she had felt hope she had hoped that she would be spared a return to the hell hoped that instead she might be reincarnated once again within the reality of the refuge restarting her accidental career as a noviciate or even as something more humble as long as it meant a life without any more than the average amount of pain and heartbreak she looked around still slowly waking she looked up which wand burning as really down at her own body she had become something great and dark and winged her feet had become claws big enough to grasp a person whole she spread her frontlegsarmswings they opened easily purposefully far out to either side limbs ready to walk the air limbs ready to grasp the wind she folded them back in again hugging herself she could feel no pain she was in a huge hanging space in what smelled absolutely like hell and she was very aware that her sense of smell was much better than it had been before both wider somehow and more sensitive more accurate and refined but she was not in any pain her feet seemed to clutch whatever she was hanging from quite naturally without conscious will or even any discernible effort she clutched at the thing it felt like a great iron bar as thick as a persons leg and increased her grip until it did hurt a little she relaxed again she opened her mouth a predators mouth a long pointed tongue she closed her sharp toothed jaws over her tongue bit down tentatively that hurt she tasted blood she shook her broad oversize head to clear it and found that she had been looking at everything through some sort of membranes over her eyes which she could sweep back she did so she was hanging in what looked like a sort of gigantic hollow fruit all veined and organiclooking but with a single massive iron bar running right across it seemingly just so she could hang on it she lifted first one foot off it then the other to make sure that she wasnt shackled to it each foot and leg seemed easily capable of taking her whole weight she was strong she realised her wings folded back in she hadnt even realised that theyd extended again as shed tried taking her feet off the bar some instinctual thing she supposed beneath her head looking properly down there was a sort of frilled opening that looked unpleasantly like a sphincter of some sort beyond she could see what appeared to be drifting redtinged cloud she would need to halffold her wings she thought as soon as she saw the aperture she felt a strange hunger and a tremendous urge to fly she opened her feet and dropped back aboard the messenger of truth powering its way back to vebezua veppers sat at an impressively large round table with bettlescroy the rest of the gfcf people who had first greeted him when hed arrived and several projections holograms of those unable to be physically present even these werent being beamed in they were present aboard the ship in some form their personalities housed in the vessels substrates this made for better security increased deniability in other words all but one were gfcfian each as small and beautiful as the other the only exception was a hologram of another panhuman a uniformed male called spacemarshal vatueil he was a big grizzledlooking creature both unmistakably alien and entirely panhuman to veppers he looked barrelchested with too long a head and freakishly small features a hero whod worked his way up through the ranks in the great war in heaven allegedly veppers had never heard of the guy though admittedly hed never taken much notice of the war at all it had always sounded to him like just a particularly longwinded multiplayer war game he had nothing against longwinded multiplayer war games they were how his ancestors had made the first family megafortune he just didnt think that anything that happened inside them should qualify as news he hoped the gfcf knew what they were doing and who they were dealing with here one of them had wittered on at the start of the meeting singing vatueils praises describing him as a fully accredited member of something called the trapeze group of the strategic operational space or something and saying how theyd had extensive preparatory dealings with this or that or him like this was meant to set his mind at ease to restate then bettlescroy said waving one decorously attenuated limb at vatueil the spacemarshal here on behalf of those forces known as the antihell side now taking part in the current confliction being overseen by the ishlorsinami requests that we the veprine corporation and the currently constituted and here configured subsection of the geseptianfardesile cultural federacy special contact division use the facilities of the tsungarial disk to build a fleet of warships currently estimated as numbering between sixty and one hundred million though that is subject to revision for the purpose of attacking the processing cores running the virtual realities which house the aforementioned hells the veprine corporation will provide the ai operating systems and navigational software subcomplexes for the vessels suitably groomed to make them appear stolen and modestly improved in a distinctly culture style by our good selves we also undertake to transport a modest proportion of the vessels as rapidly as possible to more distant parts of the galaxy to be deployed where required if necessary the antihell forces will provide the expendable combat personalities for the fleets leadership hierarchy these command vessels to make up one sixtyfifth of the total similar virtual specialists will also make up the direct hacking teams emplaced on certain designated ships which will attempt to disrupt the interhell information traffic by where possible temporarily occupying the substrate housings and support systems and physically interfacing with them preselfdestruct there were nods their equivalents and other appropriate gestures and noises of assent bettlescroy went on we the gfcf will undertake to present to our friends the culture in the shape of the restoria mission presently working in the tsungarial disk what will appear to be a sudden and violent outbreak of the currently abated smatter infection infesting certain components of the disk initially this will distract and tie up the culture assets which we know are present as well as drawing out and sucking in any other nearby forces within practical rushin distance come the inevitable postincident investigations the smatter eruption will begin to look like something the culture itself staged to allow it to take on an aggressively operational role in what transpires subsequently you are sure you can keep your own fingerprints off this are you vatueil asked we are bettlescroy said we have done this before without detection the little alien smiled winningly the trick is to do something that the culture would actually quite like to have done itself anyway that way any subsequent investigations tend to be more cursory than they might otherwise have been have you taken any actions like this on such a scale before vatueil asked bettlescroy blushed looked down absolutely not this is a significantly greater interference than any we have attempted before however we remain extremely confident that it will succeed vatueil looked unconvinced veppers thought maybe always hard to tell with aliens if the culture decides its been tricked used manipulated the spacemarshal said slowly and deliberately with the air of a man imparting a great and serious certitude it will move afterlives to get to the truth and it will not stop until it thinks its got to the bottom of it no matter what and he said looking round them all there will always be forces within the culture who will exact revenge again no matter what vatueil paused looked grim i think we all know the saying dont fuck with the culture bettlescroy smiled blushing once again sir it said some of the incidents to which i suspect you are referring the ones which have reinforced that famous saying which i shall not repeat yes vatueil said realising it was expected bettlescroy paused as though wondering to say what it was about to say or not eventually the little alien said those were us not them vatueil definitely looked dubious now really bettlescroy looked down modestly again really it said extremely quietly vatueil frowned then do you ever wonder who might be using who the little alien smiled sighed we give it some consideration sir it looked round the other gfcfians gathered round the table they looked happy as zealots whod just found a heathen to burn veppers thought that was a little worrying bettlescroy made a flowing resigned gesture with its arms we are happy with our current situational analysis and pattern of behaviour and youre happy you can keep the flekke and the nr in the dark veppers asked im pinned by my balls at the business end of a firing range if you dont the nr are less concerned than you think bettlescroy said reassuringly they approach their own sublimation more immediately than is known by all but us the flekke are an irrelevance a legacy concern they are our old mentors as they are still yours mr veppers their diverse and great achievements now in many ways eclipsed by those of the gfcf even if as a species they remain theoretically our betters bettlescroy paused for a little laugh at least according to the inflexible and quite arguably outmoded definitions of the galactic councils currently accepted recognised civilisationary levels framework the little alien paused again and was rewarded with what was by gfcf standards a positive storm of rowdy agreement deep nods loud muttering and a lot of meaningful eyecontact veppers would have sworn some of them even thought about slapping their manicured little hands on the table glowing bettlescroy went on the flekke will be quietly proud of anything we achieve and the same vicarious sense of accomplishment will most doubtlessly be applied to the sichultian enablement in turn he beamed at veppers in sum in both cases leave them to us veppers exchanged looks with vatueil of course you never entirely knew what an exchanged look really meant to an alien panhuman or not but it felt like somebody had to exercise a little realism here maybe even a little healthy cynicism on the other hand they were pretty much agreed there was little enough left to iron out they were going to go ahead with this doubts or not the rewards were too great not to veppers just smiled your confidence is reassuring he told bettlescroy thank you so we are all agreed yes bettlescroy said looking around the table the alien might as well veppers thought have been asking whether they wanted to order out for sandwiches or dips for lunch it was almost impressive everybody looked at everybody else no one raised any objections bettlescroy just kept on smiling when do we begin vatueil asked eventually directly bettlescroy said our little pretendsmatter squib will go off within the next half a day a little more than an hour after we deliver mr veppers back to vebezua we start the fabricaria running immediately we see that the culture forces are fully engaged with the outbreak bettlescroy sat back looking very satisfied all we need then of course it said thoughtfully is the location of the substrates to be targeted we cant do anything without that information it turned smoothly to veppers can we veppers old friend they were all looking at him now spacemarshal vatueil was positively staring for the first time in the meeting veppers felt he was finally getting the attention and respect he normally took for granted he smiled slowly lets get the ships built first shall we then well be ready to target them some of us bettlescroy said glancing around the table before focusing intently on veppers are still a little sceptical about how easy it will be to get to a significant number of hellcontaining substrates in the limited amount of time that will be available veppers made his face expressionless you may be surprised bettlescroy he said even amused the little alien sat forward perfectly proportioned arms on the table surface it looked steadily into veppers eyes for some time we are all very much depending on you here joiler it said quietly assuming it was a threat it was rather well delivered veppers thought hed have been proud of it himself despite the apocalyptic nature of everything theyd been discussing it was the first time maybe since theyd met that veppers thought he might have caught a glimpse of the hardened steel hiding underneath all the alien velout√© he sat forward too towards bettlescroy why i would have it no other way he said smoothly she flew above the hell it smelled stank just as it had the view from this high up just under the dark brown boiling overcast was of a rolling sometimes jagged landscape of ash grey and shit brown splattered with shadowy nearblacks acidic yellows and bilious greens red mostly meant pits of fire the distant screams groans and wails sounded no different the place she had woken in really had looked like a giant piece of fruit a bloated purple shape hanging unsupported in the choking air as though dangling from the bruised looking mass of cloud at least in the immediate area it appeared to be unique she could see no other similar giant bulbs hanging from the clouds she tried flying up through the clouds just to see the clouds were acidic choking her making her eyes water she flew back down took some clearer air waited for her eyes to clear then tried again with lungs full holding her breath as she beat upwards on her great dark wings eventually just before her lungs felt they might be about to burst she collided painfully with something hard and rough slightly granular she had the air knocked out of her jarred her head and scraped the ends of both wings she fell out of the clouds in a small rain of rusting flakes of iron she breathed collected herself flew on in the distance she saw the line of fire that was the very edge of the war within hell a crackling stitch of tiny red orange and yellow bursts of light something that was part curiosity and part the strange hunger she had felt earlier made her fly towards it she wheeled overhead watching waves and little rivulets of men make their slow breaking surges across the multiply broken seared and blasted landscape below they fought with every edged weapon ever known and primitive guns and explosives some stopped and looked up at her she thought though she did not want to approach too closely flying demons whizzed amongst the arcing fizzing shells and storms of arrows some came up towards her she experienced terror and each time was about to beat madly away but then they turned and dropped away again the hunger nagged at her part of her wanted to land to do what was she to be a demon was the need she felt the need to torment was she supposed to become one of the torturers she would starve first kill herself if she could simply refuse if it was possible knowing hell knowing the way it worked she doubted that would be possible the flying demons who had flown up towards her had been smaller than her she had cruel hooks midway along the leading edges of her wings where a biped might have had thumbs on its hands she had sharp teeth and strong jaws and treetrunkcrushing claws she wondered if she could start killing demons the screams from below the smells of flesh burned by flames and acid sprays and the rising choking clouds of poison gas all drove her away after a while a large black shape flew across the landscape behind her she looked back saw the giant beetle thing following her catching up keeping a hundred metres or so off her left side it drew level wobbled in the air then peeled away she flew on and it came back repeating the actions the third time she followed it she trod the air beating her leathery black wings slowly such that she seemed to stand in the air level with the face of the enormous uberdemon who had taunted and killed her most of a lifetime ago its gigantic lantern head was lit from within the pulsing flamecloud continually taking on the appearance of different tortured faces the towering candles at each corner of the creatures squaredoff head sputtered and crackled their gnarled surfaces veined with the nervous systems of the screaming unfortunates embedded within below its vast amalgamed body of reconstituted bone pitted sweating metals stresscracked twisted sinew and bubbling weeping flesh quivered in the heat released from its dullglowing throne wreathed in its hideous fumes and retchingly intense smokes it created a briefly recognisable face within its glassedoff lantern of a head chay recognised prin her heart massive in her barrel of a chest pounded harder a sort of hopeless pleasure filled her for a moment then she felt suddenly sick prin smiled at her for a moment then his face contorted in pain before the image disappeared a flat ugly alien face replaced prins and remained there popeyed and grinning while the thing talked to her welcome back he bellowed the sound was still earsplitting but just about below the level of pain why am i here she asked why do you think i will not be one of your demons she told it she thought about flying at him claws out trying to damage the thing she had a brief image of herself caught in one of its colossal hands crushed like a tiny fluttering bird inside a shrinking cage of girder fingers another image showed her trapped inside the creatures lantern head beating frantically against the unbreakable glass wings ragged jaws broken eyes gouged out for ever choking you would be a useless demon little bitch the thing said that is not why you are here she beat the air in front of it of him waiting it tipped its head to one side a little the four candles roared screamed that hunger you feel what of it sick again what would it turn out to be it is the hunger to kill is it indeed she would defy she thought she would be defiant for all the good that ever did in hell with enough pain you stopped defying or simply lost your mind if you were lucky maybe death real death is a blessing in hell she told him that is precisely the point the creature thundered you may kill one person per day may i now they will die fully they will not be reincarnated in this hell or anywhere else they will be permanently removed deleted why the thing put back its head and laughed a thunder spilling over the flames and smokes of the valley below the candles sputtered furiously dripped to bring hope back into hell you will be their angel whore they will beseech you to come to them to deliver them from their torment they will worship you they will try to tempt you with supplications prayers offerings any superstitious fuckwittery theyll think might work you may choose whom to reward with death pander to their idiocies or deliberately ignore them have the miserable cunts set up fucking committees amongst themselves to decide democratically who should be the lucky little grubsucker who gets to be relieved of their burden of pain i dont give a fuck just kill one a day you can try and kill more but it wont work theyll die all right but theyll come right back worse and if i kill none at all then the hunger will grow inside you until it feels like its something alive trying to gnaw its way out it will become unbearable also the wretches will have to do without their chance of release what is the point of releasing one soul from this infinitude of suffering its not infinite the creature screamed its vast but it has limits you have already scraped against the sky you stupid whore beat away if you want until you find the iron walls of hell and then tell me its infinite finite its finite truly vast but finite with only so many tortured souls how one and a quarter billion does that fucking satisfy you go and count them if you dont believe me i dont fucking care you are beginning to bore me oh i didnt mention it wont all be fun for you with each one you kill youll take on a little of their pain the more you kill the more pain youll experience eventually the pain of the increasing hunger and the pain youve absorbed from those youve released should balance out you might lose your mind again but well deal with that when it happens i expect ill have thought of something even more condign for you by then the king of the demons gripped the redglowing ends of the mountainous seats arms and came roaring forward at her making her beat back through the air now do fuck off and start killing it waved one vast hand at her she felt herself swallow a sickness clutched at her belly and a terrible aching need to fly away seemed to tug at her wings and the bundled muscles in her chest but she held where she was beating steadily prin she shouted what happened to prin who what prin my mate the one i came in here with tell me and ill do what you want youll do what i want whether you fucking like it or not you dumb wormed cunt tell me kill me a thousand and ill think about it promise she wailed the enormous demon laughed again promise youre in hell you cysted cretin why the fuck would i make a promise but for the joy of breaking it go before i change my mind and break your semenencrusted wings just for fun come back when youve sent ten times a hundred to their undeserved ends and ill think about telling you what happened to your precious prin now fuck off it brought its vast arms sweeping up towards her one winging in from each side hands as big as her entire body splayed out clawed and clutching as though trying to catch and crush her she beat back fell away swooped and zoomed glancing fearfully back as the great demon sat back in his great glowing chair wreathes of smoke from his recent movements pulsing through the air around him she killed her first that evening as the already dull light deepened to a ruddy sunless gloaming it was a young female caught on the rusted spikes of a cheval de frise on a cold hillside above a mean trickle of an acid stream moaning almost continually except when she had banked enough breath to scream chay landed listened to the female trying to speak but got no sense from the piteous creature she hesitated looking around in case anything appearred familiar but it was not the same hillside she and prin had sheltered on she was crying as she folded her great dark wings round the female trying not to tear the thin leathery membranes of her wings on the cruel spikes chay felt the females being move out of her broken twisted body and into her own before dissipating entirely just evaporating away like a little cloud on a warm dry day she felt a different kind of hunger and ate some of the body tearing through the tough hide to get into the juicy buttock muscles as she flew back to her distant roost she wondered how much pain would accrue as a result of what she had done she hung there digesting later she was left with a sore tooth she had become an angel in hell twentyone when the adults were away sometimes they could play in the places where the adults played she had a group of friends who were all about the same age and they played together a lot when they werent being taught in the little school room on the top floor of the big estate house the others could still be cruel to her now and again when they wanted to get back at her for something or when she had won something and they wanted to remind her that it didnt matter if she came first in a race or got better marks then anybody else in an exam because in the end she was just a servant really in fact worse than a servant because at least a servant could just leave if they wanted to but she couldnt she was like a mount or a hunt chaser or a gamehound she belonged to the estate she belonged to veppers lededje had learned not to pretend that she didnt care when the other children were like this it had taken her a while to work out how best to handle this sort of teasing crying a lot and running to her mother made it too easy for the children to use her like a toy when they were bored press lededjes button and off shed race so that was no good not reacting at all going all stonyfaced that just made them say even worse things until it ended in a fight and she it always seemed to be her fault got them all punished so that didnt work either the best thing to do was to cry a little and let them know that shed been hurt then just get on with things sometimes when she did this she got the impression some of the other children thought she hadnt seemed hurt enough and they tried to hurt her some more but then she would just tell them they were being immature leave it behind move on learn and progress they were just about at the age when this sort of adult talk could be successfully used they played in the places they were supposed to play places where nobody had said they couldnt and best of all in the places where they definitely werent supposed to play at all of the latter her favourite had always been the water maze the complex of shallow channels ponds and lakes where the adults played with big toy battleships and where they watched the mini ature sea battles take place from all the big towers and soaring arches and canals in the air she had been allowed to watch one of the battles once with her mother though it had taken a lot of nagging and her mother had had to ask it as a big favour and even then it wasnt one of the really important battles with lots of rich and famous people watching it was just a sort of trying out and testing sort of battle that people from the estate could watch sometimes if they didnt have other duties her mother hadnt enjoyed it because she didnt like heights she kept her eyes closed most of the time her hands grasping the sides of the little flatbottomed boat they rode around in on the canals in the sky lededje had liked it at first but eventually got bored she thought it would be more interesting if she could be inside one of the battleships herself rather than have to watch other people working them her mother still without opening her eyes told her that was a stupid idea for one thing she was too small and anyway only men were stupid and aggressive enough to want to get inside those floating deathtraps and be shot at with live ammunition for the entertainment of the spoiled rich in the distance lededje had seen one of the old dome plinths busy with people teams of workmen with cranes and big vehicles full of electronics were dismantling all the sat domes two dozen of which had surrounded the mansion house in a ring a couple of kilometres across for as long as she could remember the first time she had run away it had been at the foot of one of those stoneclad plinths she had been caught that had been years and years and years ago maybe half her life now the gleaming white satellite domes were useless and outdated and being dismantled right there and then for the first time she felt herself growing old they had to wait to be allowed to dock at the little pier on one of the towers then go down in the coffinlike elevator and through the tunnel that led safely away from the lake and the towers and the channels and the ships you could hear the guns firing even from the house she and the other children well most of them two were too frightened used to sneak under the fence that went all the way round the water maze they kept well away from the miniature docks where the ships were maintained and repaired the docks were usually only busy for the few days around one of the big proper battles but even on the quietest days there would be one or two grownups working there misty days were best it all looked very strange and mysterious and bigger somehow as though the toy landscape of the channels and little lakes had grown to be the right bigness for fullsize battleships she had an old foametal plank for her ship the others used various bits and pieces of plastic foametal and wood as theirs they learned how to tie and glue extra bits and scraps of other stuff that floated to their ships or plastic bottles or that sort of thing to make them float better they hid their ships in the reeds so they wouldnt get caught they had their own races battles and games of grouptag and hideandseek when they had proper battles they threw lumps of earth and mud at each other one time it was almost dark before they heard adults calling for them the others said she only won that one because she was black as the night a couple of their ships were found one time when somebody doing something to one of the flatbottom boats in the sky canals saw them playing those two ships were taken away and they all got a lecture about danger and unexploded munitions they solemnly promised not to do it again and watched as the hole in the fence theyd got in through was wired up it was okay because theyd already found another hole further round after that they were supposed to carry comms kidphones that told the adults where they were at all times but a couple of the older kids had shown everybody how to turn them off completely or make them give out signals that said they were a hundred metres away from where they really were the last day they played in the water maze it was very bright and sunny though they only got to play there as the sun was going down after school all the adults were very busy because mr veppers was coming back after a long time away on a business trip way out in the stars and so the house and the whole estate needed to be made to look as pretty and clean as possible she didnt like hearing that mr veppers was coming back because he was the man who owned her she didnt see him very often when he was in the big estate house their paths seldom crossed as her mother put it but just knowing he was in the place made her feel funny it was like being breathless like when you fell on your back and hurt yourself but worse than the getting hurt was the not being able to draw a breath it was a bit like that except all the time when mr veppers was at home lededje hadnt run away for a while though she still thought about it sometimes she was thinking about running away the next day the day mr veppers came back but for now she wasnt thinking about it at all and was just having fun in the last insectbuzzy heat of the day under a sky that was all red and yellow she paddled along lying on her front on her old ship the trusty battleship made from the length of foametal that had been an offcut from one of the dock pontoons shed shaped it a bit over the years to make it more aerodynamic in the water it had a point at the front and it bent over at the back where you could brace your foot actually hers wasnt a battleship at all because battleships were big and heavy and slow and when she was on her ship she wasnt any of those things she was light and quick and so shed decided she was a light cruiser they were playing grouptag she hid in the rushes close by one of the wading points between islands as the others slid quietly or splashed noisily past most of them were calling out her name and hinos hino was the second youngest and small like her and he was very good at tag and hideandseek also like her that meant that probably they were the last two to be found and tagged she liked that she liked to be the last to be caught or not to get caught at all sometimes they heard the adults calling them or one of the older kids got a comms call they couldnt ignore and so they had to give up on the game and that meant whoever still hadnt been caught by then had won once she had fallen asleep on her light cruiser board in the sunlight and discovered that all the others had got bored and hungry and just gone off leaving her there alone shed decided that counted as winning too stuck into the mud near where she was hiding was a metal and plastic shell you rarely saw these because they had locator things in them like the kidphones did that meant they could be tidied up after each battle but here was this one lying with a badly dented nose that must have doinked off the armour of one of the ships she picked it up carefully just to look at it holding it in two fingers like it might explode at any moment it looked very old and dirty there was writing on it she couldnt make out she thought about putting it back where shed found it or throwing it onto the nearest island to see if it would explode or dropping it in one of the deeper bits of the lakes she even thought about leaving it where it would be found really easily by one of the maintenance people but in the end she kept it making a little mud nest for it right at the front the bow of her foametal light cruiser leaning over to scoop up the mud to do this must have caused ripples because next thing she knew there was a loud shout from alarmingly nearby and purdil one of the bigger older boys was almost on top of her powering his plastic warship towards her along the channel using both hands raising a breaking bow wave that shone in the red rays of the setting sun as he turned to head straight for her though the reeds she struck out as hard as she could angling out and away through a gap in the swaying stalks but she knew she would never make it purdil was going too fast and she could never outpace him anyway purdil was a bully who sometimes threw stones instead of mud when they had proper battles and was one of those who most liked to tease her about her tattoo and her being owned by mr veppers so the best she could do would be to get out into the channel and hope at least shed get caught by somebody else she flattened herself on the board and started paddling desperately both hands digging deep into the warm water raising clouds of mud towards the surface something flew over her head and splashed just ahead of her purdil was shouting and laughing close behind her she could hear the dry rattling sound of the reed stems being pushed aside and under by the curved prow of his plastic ship she got into the channel and almost collided with hino who was being pursued by two of the others they both manoeuvred to avoid hitting each other he sat up when he saw it was her and was struck in the face by a clod of earth with some broken reed stems still attached hino nearly fell off his board which curved back round blocking lededjes course shed never get past him now she started to pull up using both hands to slow herself as the front of her craft slid in towards hino oh she thought she hoped the shell shed found didnt blow up when her ship hit hinos it didnt phew she thought hino wiped the mud off his face and glared past her at purdil led felt purdils craft smack into the back of her own just as hino reached out to the little lumpen nest of mud shed put the shell in at the bows of her ship she saw him pick up the muddy shell and throw it in one quick movement lededje had time to draw breath the shell tore past her half a metre away the explosion seemed to slap her once right across the back it made her head ring sound seemed to go away she was still looking forward at hino and raising her hand to try to say no she felt the ringing noise everywhere in her body she saw hinos face go pale as fast as clicking your fingers the two other kids behind him wore the same expression it was those expressions she would never forget they were worse than what she saw when she looked round their faces the three of them staring openmouthed eyes wider than she thought eyes could go all blood draining from the faces she pushed herself up and turned to look behind her it seemed to take a long time to do this she looked away from hino and the other two children away from the channel behind and the setting sun and the reed beds stretching alongside as she turned she saw the low hill of the miniature island forming one bank of the channel above was the arch and spire of a sky canal and a tower above that she glimpsed something red what was left of purdil was still just about sitting on his plastic board most of his head had gone though she only had a little while to see this as he fell forward and crashed down part onto his board and part into the water it was only then that they all started screaming no backing up then of course not we dont do that we cant do that were not you lededje frowned at demeisen the second or third most traumatic thing in her life and the ships avatar seemed almost unconcerned so demeisen said properly dead yes properly dead what happened to hino we never saw him again he was taken to the city for the police investigation and then had intensive posttraumatic counselling his why what did the police do to him what nothing there had to be a formal investigation thats all of course they didnt do anything to him what do you think we are lededje shook her head the posttraumatic counselling was because hed thrown what he thought was a rock and blown a kids head off ah right i see hinos father was a consulting landscaper who was only due to be on the estate until the end of that year anyway so by the time he was fit to be seen in polite company again hino was on the other side of the world while his dad sorted out some other rich mans problematic mansion sightlines hmm demeisen nodded looked thoughtful i didnt realise you had foametal lededje glared at him eyes narrowed i cant believe that hasnt come up before she said through gritted teeth what was i thinking of i ran away the next morning and nearly died of exposure thanks for asking you did the avatar looked surprised why didnt you mention that i was coming to it lededje said icily they were sitting in the outer two of the little shuttle crafts pilot seats their feet up on the seat in the middle the falling outside the normal moral constraints was just about to enter enablement space and lededje had thought to tell a little more of her life story to the ship as she came back to the place she had been born and brought up demeisen nodded im sorry he said that was insensitive of me of course it must have been traumatic for you as well and the other two children not to mention the various parents involved were you punished either for being in the battle area or for your part in providing the unexploded shell or for running away lededje let out a breath all of the above she said she was silent for a moment eventually she said i dont think veppers was very happy about having his big triumphant homecoming spoiled by a runaway brat and a security kerfuffle over his toy battleships well demeisen said then paused in a most undemeisenlike manner what lededje asked the avatar swung his legs off the seat between them turning and pointing at the main screen which flashed into life showing a slowly retreating star field now theres a strange thing demeisen said almost as though not talking to her at all he glanced at her nodded at the screen see that lededje looked peered squinted see what hmm demeisen said and the image on the screen zoomed in altered in colour and what appeared to be texture in theory it was a holo display but everything being shown was so far away there was no real sense of depth sidescreens filled with coloured graphs numerals bar and pie charts described the image manipulation taking place that he said nodding and sitting back there was a strange granular quality to the centre of the screen where the darkness seemed to flicker slightly oscillating between two very similar and very dark shades of grey what is that lededje asked demeisen was silent for a couple of beats then with a small laugh he said i do believe were being followed followed not by a missile or something not by a missile the avatar said staring at the screen then he looked away and turned back to her smiling dont know why im making this thing stare at the fucking module screen he said as the screen went blank again yes followed by another ship demeisen put his feet up on the seat in between them again cradling his head in his fingers against the seats headrest i thought you were supposed to be fast i know and i am but ive been slowing down for the last day or so reconfiguring my fields sort of just in case this happened he said nodding at the blank screen why why look like what you are when you can fool people by looking like what youre not the avatars smile was dazzling she thought about this for a moment im glad ive been able to teach you something demeisen grinned that thing he said as the screen flashed on again still showing the curious grey pixilation at its centre before it clicked off once more almost before she could register what shed seen doesnt know what its following you sure oh im positive the avatar sounded smug so what does it think its following a lowly torturerclass rapid offensive unit from the days of fucking yore demeisen said with what sounded like relish thats what it thinks its following assuming its done its home work properly encasement sensory traction every field im currently deploying right now looks convincingly like a very slightly and extremely plausibly tweaked version of the classic torturerclass signature profile so it thinks i am a mere dainty pebble amongst modern spacecraft but im not im a fucking rockslide the avatar sighed happily it also thinks there isnt the slightest chance that i can see it because a torturer couldnt so what does it look like the thing thats following us the avatar made a clicking noise with its mouth no idea it looks like what you saw on the screen im not seeing much more than you im only just able to see its there at all which at that range means its probably level tech an l civ or a highend seven not an enablement ship then nope at a guess could be flekke nr jhlupian maybe gfcf if theyve been paying especially diligent attention to the proceedings of the institute of wizzo space ship designers newsletter recently why would any of them be following you thats the question isnt it demeisen said i presume to see what i get up to he grinned at her and to see what i might be carrying the question theyll be asking themselves and might want me to answer is what am i doing here lededje hoisted one eyebrow thought up anything plausible oh i had concentric layers of cover stories prepared the avatar told her though in the end im a borderline eccentric and very slightly psychotic abominatorclass picket ship and i dont really have to answer to any fucker however most of my alibis are for a humble tramping torturer class and one involved being vaguely interested in the tsungarial disk or having some connection with somebody or something in the culture mission attached to it an unnecessary ruse in a sense as it turns out because the mission is actively calling for a bit of help following a smatter outbreak any culture ship pulling up here now has a perfect excuse lededje shook her head i have no idea what a smatter outbreak is runaway nanotech swarmata remains of an mhe a monopathic hegemonising event sometimes known as a hegswarm your eyes have gone glazed anyway some of that stuff got into the disk you do know what the disk is lots of abandoned alien ships no ones allowed to use isnt it lots of abandoned alien factories no ones allowed to use mostly the avatar said nodding anyway the smatter got into the disk sometime in the dim and distant and one of our infuriatingly wellmeaning canwehelp teams has been in there sitting on top of it for probably longer thans really been necessary you know one of those jobs you make sure you never quite finish because you like being where you are except now it does rather seem to have blown up in their faces and all of a sudden our chums have a properly serious runaway event on their hands demeisen paused and got that faraway look avatars sometimes did when the vastly powerful thing they represented was watching something utterly fascinating going on in mysterious highdefinition realms inaccessible to mere mortal biologicals the avatar shook his head hilarious so youre going to go and help lededje asked good grief no demeisen said pest control problem they took the decision to spin this out they can fucking deal with it he shrugged though having said that i may have to pretend to go and help i suppose or whoevers following us might see through my magic cloak of plausibility we are heading straight for the tsung system its just i hadnt intended to stop the avatar clicked his fingernails on the console beneath the screen annoying he sighed also interestingly this is maybe not the first odd thing to happen in this neck of the woods either there was an ablationary plume nine days ago not a million klicks away from that rendezvous they were trying to get you to make in the semsarine wisp she shook her head youd make a great teenage boy she told the avatar beg your pardon you still think girls get moist when they hear arcane nomenclature its sweet i suppose what you mean an ablationary plume yes what the fuck is that now oh come on this is just the stuff i have to deal with an emergence from the weirdshit space i happen to pass my days in if lededje hadnt known better she might have thought the avatar was hurt an ablationary plume he said sighing its what happens when a ship tries to hit the ground running and fails in egrid terms its field engines are unable to connect efficiently with the grid and rather than blowing up or being flung out wrecked to coast for ever its engines ablate a part of themselves to cushion the energy blow slows the ship though at great cost immediate total engine refit required the point is that the resulting plumes visible from way far away in egrid terms so it can work as a sort of emergency distress signal embarrassing enough during peacetime and likely fatal in a war the avatar fell silent seemingly contemplating this odd turn of events egrid lededje asked tentatively oh come on demeisen said sounding exasperated do they teach you nothing at school somebody was calling her name everything was a bit fuzzy even including her sense of who she was her name for example there it was again somebody saying it well they were saying something her first thought was that they were saying her name but now she thought about it she wasnt so sure it was as though the sounds meant something but she wasnt sure what or maybe she knew what they meant but couldnt be sure what the sounds actually were no that wasnt what she meant fuzzy yime that was her name wasnt it she wasnt entirely sure it sounded like it was supposed to mean something pretty important and it wasnt an ordinary word that she knew which meant something it sounded like a name she was pretty sure it was a name chances were it was her name yime she needed to get her eyes open she wanted to get her eyes open she wasnt used to having to think about opening her eyes usually it was something that just happened still if she was going to have to think about yime can you hear me it shed just have to think about it there it was again just there while shed been thinking about getting her eyes open that feeling that somebody or something had said her name yime said a tiny highpitched voice it was a silly voice a pretend madeup voice or one belonging to a child whod just sucked on a helium balloon yime hello yime the squeaky voice said it was hard to hear at all it was almost drowned out by the roaring sound of a big waterfall or something like a big waterfall a high wind in tall trees maybe yime can you hear me it really did sound like a doll she got one eye open and saw a doll well that fitted she supposed the doll was standing looking at her quite close to her it was standing on the floor she realised that she must be lying on the floor the doll was standing at a funny angle being at that angle it should be falling over maybe it had special feet with suckers on them or magnets shed had a toy that could climb walls once she guessed the doll was the usual dollsize about right for a human toddler to carry and cuddle like an adult would a baby it had glowing yellowbrown skin black intensely curled hair and the usual toobig head and eyes and overchubby limbs it wore a little vestandpants set some dark colour yime can you see me can you hear me the voice was coming from the doll its mouth had moved as it had spoken though it was a little hard to be sure because there was some stuff in her eye she tried to bring her hand up to her face to wipe away whatever it was in her eye but her hand wasnt cooperating her whole arm wasnt cooperating she tried the other armhand combination but it wasnt being any more helpful signals seemed to be piling up inside her head from both arms both hands trying to tell her something but she couldnt make sense of whatever it was there were a lot of signals like that from all over her body another mystery she was getting tired of them she tried to yawn but got a strange grating feeling from her jaw and head she opened her other eye and saw two dolls they were identical and both were at the same strange angle yime youre back with me good ack she said she had meant to say back but it had come out wrong she didnt seem to be able to get her mouth to work properly she tried to take a deep breath but that didnt go too well either it felt like she was sort of jammed as though shed tried to squeeze through a really tight gap and it hadnt worked and shed got trapped stay with me yime the doll squeaked she tried to nod but no okay she said there was only one doll shed worked out not two it was a focusing problem the doll was too close there was stuff black stuff in her eyes and everything was at an odd angle the ceiling if you were going to call it that seemed awfully close to the dolls bubblehaired head and the dolls glowing skin seemed to be the only light within this cramped shadowy space where the hell was she she tried to think where she had been last she had been standing under the ship being briefed looking at images of stars and clusters and systems the vast dark bulk of the ship directly above no shed been walking out from underneath the ship into rain with the blunt snout of the ship like a black glass cliff poised above a giant flat knife for cutting through to the underneathness of the universe yime something squeaked she got one of her eyes to open oh yes this weird little doll thing standing in front of her funny angle ot what dont do that stay with me dont drift off like that she wanted to laugh but couldnt drift off how to where she was trapped here caught the doll wobbled towards her its gait made awkward by its short thick legs it had something in its hand something like a needle with a single slicklooking thread trailing behind it the thread disappeared into the slanted narrow darkness behind the doll she thought there was something familiar but wrong about the two very closetogether surfaces behind the doll the doll had something in its other hand too the toy waddled so close to her head she couldnt see it properly any more she could feel it though feel its little clothed body squeezing against the side of her head ot you doing she asked it something cold was pressed against her neck she tried to move anything eyelids they worked mouth a bit her lips didnt seem to be too keen on pressing together facial muscles mostly tongue and throat and breathing a bit fingers no fingers toes toes not responding bladder muscles something there great she could pee herself if she wanted she could not move her head or body or limbs at all suddenly the slanted narrow space made a sort of sense and she realised she was still in the ship still in the lounge shed been in earlier when it had been accelerating accelerating did ships accelerate this was the floor folded over and pressed up against the wall she was lying on the wall and the floor had come up to meet the wall and she was lying crushed between the two this would account for her not being able to move what the doll squeaked clambering lightly over her face as it moved to the other side of her neck ot you doing she repeated im putting a micro medpack on you and hooking you up to a distantdelivery medpack thats as close as i can get it a couple of metres away ang i trat are you trapped the doll repeated fiddling with something just outside of sight yes yime im afraid you are she felt and halfsaw it flick the long silver line then felt something cold on the other side of her neck she sensed a needle sliding into her flesh but there was no pain at all not even the slightest which was surprising she was sure you were supposed to experience a tiny bit of pain with anything the body experienced as an injury before the painrelief system kicked in unless your whole body was basically in screaming agony and therefore your brain was so flooded with painrelief secretions coming from the appropriate glands and justignoreit signals coming from the relevant brainbits that something as trivial as a needle sliding into your flesh just didnt register at all that must be it she was crushed immobile inside the crippled ship barely able to breathe and her body was probably really badly smashed up made sense she was taking all this very calmly she thought well there wasnt much point in panicking she swallowed then said ot the suck haind what the fuck happened the doll said finishing what it was doing and climbing back out from beside her neck and standing in front of her again it stood a little further back now so she could see it better i we got clobbered by something very powerful either the bulbitian itself displaying hitherto unknown martial prowess or an equivtech ship that was nearby we only just got out of the bulbitians environment sphere i had to total go into hyperspace before i cleared the sphere or wed have been smeared it was a rough old transit and we were still getting attacked got off some retaliation but no idea if i hit anything more frazzling ensued before i could get us away took myself to bits firing off burst units like missiles and pchambers like mines lost d directional and had to tractionplough the grid to stop us subrupturing now were drifting decoupled oor juss aoyding saying yeer sucked no im not the doll squeaked we are fucked in the sense were both in a very bad way but on the other hand we are alive at the moment and we have a substantial chance of getting out of this alive ee do we do thanks to my efforts and your bodys own emergency systems we can keep you stabilised and even start some repairs meanwhile i seem to have shaken off our attackers my own repair systems are running at maximum and the distress calls i got out before losing my signal fields plus the ablation plume itself should have been sufficient to summon help i expect it is on its way even as we speak she tried to frown it was just about possible i a doll all my other remotes are compromised too big or otherwise engaged the doll dates from when i once had some children aboard rather than recycle it i retained it in this form for sentimental reasons ill leave it here to keep you company if you want to stay awake though it might be better to let you sleep now weve got you hooked up going to be a while before i can get you unstuck she thought about this slee she said just before she slipped under she thought wait there had been something important shed really meant to remember but then it all went away from her that things coming up on me demeisen said frowning what the fuck does it think its trying to do overtake youre sure its not a missile lededje asked shed got the ship to put the image back on the module screen again so she could at least see something of what was going on immediately behind them the granular twotone greyness in the screens centre looked just as it had whatever this thing is i doubt it considers itself singleuse expendable so not a missile by the standard definition the avatar said but it is coming straight up behind us which is a semihostile manoeuvre when does it become a totally hostile manoeuvre demeisen shrugged when it reaches a point where a torturerclass rou would normally catch sight of something immediately behind it at the moment it thinks i cant see it so in a sense ive no business assuming its hostile as soon as or slightly before it reaches the point where a real torturer class would spot it it should hail us when does that happen as things stand if nobody alters power about two hours the avatar frowned which is shortly before well get to the tsung system where the disk is now isnt that a coincidence the avatar plainly didnt expect an answer so lededje didnt attempt to provide one demeisen tapped one fingernail on a front tooth one slightly worrying nuance here is that it expects me to see it about halfway into my approach its assuming that im stopping at tsung which is not unreasonable the avatar was more muttering than talking now lededje remained patient but ill be slowing down halfway to dead stop when it expects to pop up on my sensors demeisen said quietly staring sideways at the screen and if you were being paranoid about it thats almost a hostile act in itself because that sets our chum up for an attacking pass unless he slows too or peels away the avatar laughed raised his eyebrows at her golly what shall we do lededje she thought the smartest thing she suggested demeisen clicked his fingers what a splendid suggestion he said swivelling round in the seat to look at the screen naturally we have to ignore the awkward fact that the smartest thing is all too often only obvious in hindsight but never mind he turned to look at her there is just a very small chance that this could get awkward lededje i might actually get in a proper firefight here the avatar grinned at her eyes bright a prospect that patently fills you with horror demeisen laughed might almost have looked embarrassed thing is he said big space fights between grownup ships aint no place for a young slip of a girl such as yourself so if thats what looks like happening ill try and get you away right now youre safest here inside me but that could change in an instant you might find yourself inside the shuttle inside one of my subsections or just inside the shuttle alone or even just in a suit or even a gel suit with scary empty space only millimetres away all with no warning actually be better even if you still had a lace we could back you up and make you nearly as shockproof as me but never mind you ever worn a gel suit no really i suppose not never mind nothing to it here you go just to the side of lededjes seat a silvery ovoid swelled popped and disappeared depositing what looked like a cross between a large jellyfish and a thick condom the size and shape of a human onto the floor she stared down at it it looked like somebody had had their skin turned transparent and then been flayed thats a space suit she asked aghast in her experience space suits looked a little more reassuringly complicated not to mention bulky youll probably want to empty your bladder and bowels before putting it on demeisen told her nodding back to where the shuttles living area was already reconfiguring to its shiny hitech bathshowertoilet aspect then just strip off and step in itll do the rest she picked the gel suit up it was heavier than shed expected peering at it she could see what looked like dozens of thinnerthantissuethin layers within it boundaries marked out with a hint of iridescence there were some parts of it that looked a little thicker than others and which were sort of mistily opaque they made the thing appear a little more substantial than it had at first glance but not by much i suppose id only be exposing my hopeless naivety if i asked if there was some alternative to this itd be more of a hopeless inability to come to terms with reality the avatar told her but if it appears a bit flimsy dont worry theres an armoured outersuit that goes over the top im getting one of those ready too he nodded at the now fully formed bathroom now do your business like a good little biological and dont tarry she glared at the avatar but he was staring at the screen she wheeled out of the seat and stamped to the bathroom do you need to pee and poo she called from inside the bathroom in your human form there no the avatar called not biological can do though if ive been eating or drinking for what you might call social effect comes out just like it went in though chewed obviously in the case of solids edible and drinkable well unless ive kept it inside long enough for any airborne or alreadypresent organisms to start to break it down so i can do convincing if very delicate belches and farts some human people actually like to eat what comes out of avatars very odd still thats people sorry i asked lededje muttered starting to strip off ha thought you might be the avatar called back cheerily sometimes she forgot how good its hearing was she had a token pee and then laid the gel suit out on the floor the mistily opaque bits were mostly on its back or front it was impossible to tell they tapered smoothly looking like long nearly transparent muscles she looked at herself in the reverser the tattoo was a frozen storm of swirling black lines scrolled across her body she had spent a lot of the time over the days since theyd left the gsv learning how to use the tats own controls to influence its display she could thicken and thin the lines alter their number their colours and reflectivity make them straight wiggly curled or spiralled turn them into circles or squares or any other simple geometric form or choose from any one of thousands of tweakable patterns she frowned at the silvery ring on her left hand what about the terminal ring she called dont worry the suit will adjust she shrugged oh well she thought she stepped onto the foot parts of the suit there didnt seem to be any holes to put her feet into just when she thought nothing was going to happen and that maybe she ought to reach down and see if she could pull it up somehow the thing suddenly rippled and rose clumping round her feet then flowing upwards climbing up her shins and thighs enveloping her torso and flowing down her arms as it gathered in a sort of ruff round her neck it moved faster than the tattoo had performing its roughly similar trick it felt like it was at blood heat like the tat she could hardly tell it was there stopped at my neck she called out thats standard demeisen shouted back itll go complete if theres any threat or if you tell it to how do i tell it to saying helmet up or just eek usually works im told its intelligent she said it came out closer to a screech than shed intended dumber than a knife missile the avatar told her sounding amused but it recognises speech and it can hold a conversation things supposed to react to perceived threat even when youre asleep led cant be totally stupid her eyes went wide and she sucked in a breath she felt herself rise on her tiptoes its also just given me what feels like a buttplug and a pessary she said aware that her voice had risen a couple of tones that had better be entirely fucking standard yup you can adjust that too for all that stuff you can talk to it or use the controls on either forearm or the finger pads just like the tattoo got colouring and camo functions you can use them to give it modesty panels if youre shy she looked at herself in the reverser the gel suit didnt even reflect the way shed have expected it to she could still see the tat it was almost like the gel suit wasnt there at all except at the edges of her body as they appeared in the image where it looked like she had a thin grey line drawn right round her so it can talk she shouted mmhmm the avatar replied you going to introduce us then she asked seems only right she muttered it was being polite waiting to be spoken to demeisen said say hello suit hello the suit said making her jump the smooth cool androgynous voice came from just under each of her ears well hello she said and realised she was smiling like an idiot ms ybreq i understand the suit said hello there she said probably louder and more heartily than was strictly necessary may i suggest i introduce minor filaments into your ears to allow me to speak to you directly that necessary she said she found she was whispering for some reason it is preferable the suit said the collar components are already able to comprehend subvocalisations this means we may converse without appearing to right she said okay then there was a pause she didnt feel anything happening then felt a brief tiny tickling feeling inside both ears that it she asked yes the suit voice said sounding slightly different testing left right it said the source of its voice shifting appropriately before centring in her head again does that sound correct to you i suppose she said another pause no couldnt hear a thing suit demeisen said lededje took a breath suit put the helmet up please the helmet component flipped up over her head almost before the last syllable had been uttered unrolling from the neck ruff with a whoosh of air she was aware there was something around her head but she could still see perfectly well and she could blink she put her fingers tentatively up to her eyes and found what felt like invisible bulges over each eye she flexed her jaw stuck out her tongue a shallow bulge had opened over her mouth and extended outwards when she stuck her tongue out her nose had tiny bulges under each nostril what am i breathing she asked quietly air i imagine the avatar shouted ambient air the suit told her i am charging backunit components with pressurised ambient air as a precaution however for longterm use i can continually reconstitute oxygen from carbon dioxide with my reactor reactor lededje said slightly alarmed chemical processing reactor the suit told her ah oh its got what youd think of as a real reactor too demeisen shouted she got the impression he was enjoying all this a standard microform mam unit the suit told her lededje rolled her eyes helmet down she said the helmet flipped instantly back to become a neck ruff again can you go all black she said the suit turned matt black now make the bit over the tat controls go transparent the area over her left forearm went transparent again touching there it felt like the suit surface under the pads of her fingers had gone submillimetre thin allowing her almost full sensitivity she dialled the tat lines to thick and her face darkened satisfied she marched out of the bathroom all right she said im suited up now what she stopped a couple of steps from the seats what the fuck is she started to say then said oh the armoured bit sitting in the shuttles middle seat was what looked like an armoured warrior the suit was mirrorshiny and smooth maybe three or four times as thick as the gel suit the head section looked like a blankvisored silver version of the sort of thing you were meant to wear riding a motor bike the armoured bit demeisen agreed he glanced at her very fetching he said uhhuh she sat in her seat again the image on the screen looked just the same as before disappointingly now what she said now you get into the armoured suit the avatar said she looked at demeisen just a precaution he said waving his arms she got up the armoured suit rose too more smoothly she suspected than any mere human ever had it stepped down and stood facing her on the floor then it just peeled apart splitting centrally down every part nearest her its legs torso and arms spread almost flat out to each side doubling its profile she stepped down too faced it she looked at its shiny inside surface and felt herself swallow she glanced back demeisen was still staring at the screen he seemed to become aware of a delay and looked round at her what you she began then had to stop she cleared her throat you really wouldnt hurt me would you she hadnt meant to but then she found herself saying you did promise the avatar looked at her expression uncertain then smiled yes i promised led she nodded turned stepped backwards into the suit the suit closed calmly around her pressing gently in on the gel suit but seeming to add no weight the helmet didnt close completely the visor slid away above leaving her an unrestricted field of vision walk normally demeisen said not looking back at her she walked normally expecting to be dragging the suit with her or maybe to fall over instead the suit felt like it was walking with her she got back into the seat again highly aware of her silvery bulk i feel like im a fucking space warrior she told the avatar well youre not demeisen said i am he flashed a smile hurrah for you so what now now we try focusing whatll look like the track scanner of a torturer class straight back thatll pick up our overtaking enthusiast wont that look suspicious not that much ships especially warships and especially old warships do that kind of thing every now and again just in case how often would you find something practically never are all old warships that jumpy the ones that survived are demeisen said and then some of us are just paranoid ive been known to backflip and point my primary ahead scanner directly backwards just to make sure theres no fucker tagging quietly along behind not for long of course its a bit scary like running backwards in the dark the avatar laughed though not as scary as thinking youre sneakily pursuing some unsuspecting ship and then suddenly finding yourself all lit up and blinking in the glare of an abominator classs forward scanner the avatar looked amused at this anyway here we go lededje watched the screen the granularity in the centre of the image resolved into a shape it looked like a sort of rounded black snowflake with eightfold symmetry there was a pause demeisens eyebrows went up yes lededje said after a few moments when the avatar hadnt said anything and whats happening fucking hell demeisen said theyre speeding up fast lededje stared at the screen but nothing seemed to have changed what are you going to do she asked the avatar demeisen whistled out a breath oh i am so tempted to just sprint off and leave the fuckers standing or do the backflip scanner thing with full targeting component and shout hello there fellow space farers can i help you the avatar sighed but well learn more if we stick with the innocent little torturer class disguise for a bit theyll be on us in about forty minutes demeisen looked at her with what was probably meant to be a reassuring look he wasnt very good at it you must understand that this is almost certainly still nothing and you can climb out of that suit quite soon its very comfortable is it good good so i understand anyway just to be on the safe side im spooling up to full operational readiness battle stations she asked demeisen looked pained terribly old expression from so long ago ships had crews or crews that werent just along for the ride but yes anything i can do he smiled my dear girl in culture history alone it has been about nine thousand years since a human marvellous though they are in so many other ways could do anything useful in a serious bigguns space battle other than admire the pretty explosions or in some cases contribute to them contribute chemicals colours you know twentytwo anyway more help is on the way it is well hippetyhey for us what is it who are they some old torturer class what a proper ship a proper warship though old like i say here in a couple of hours so soon thats unannounced thats old warships for you tramp around dont tell anybody where they are or what theyre up to for years decades or longer but then every now and again one of them finds itself in the right place at the right time to do something useful breaks the monotony i suppose well its come to the right fucking place to do that woh getting frazzled are we no more than you coll thats estcoll to you blit a few kilo more of these little graveller fucks and you might just pretend to the level of esteemed colleague until then youre only provisionally even a colleague coll golly terrible how we flirt isnt it oh my yes auppi unstril said grinning even though this was a soundonly comm gets me allscale flushed up any other news our everhelpful estcolls in the gfcf report theyre just about containing the outbreaks theyve come across lanyares tersetier colleague and lover told her like us they keep thinking thats it dealt with under control then another bit flares up mostly though they seem to be spending their time like they said checking out all the other fabricaria i suppose we should be grateful they seem to be coping so well and that they had so many ships that close yeah makes you wonder what they were all doing hereabouts in the first place you really have it in for the little cute guys dont you is that how it sounds yes good i dont trust those little fucks they speak very well of you they speak very well of everybody that so bad yes it means you cant trust them youre so cynical and paranoid dont forget paranoid you sure you wouldnt have done better in sc no im not what about the hylo the fast picket hylozoist was on the far side of the disk from where they were bamboozlingly an almost simultaneous eruption of smatter had taken place alarmingly near to the disks initial contact facility the principal indeed by treaty terms mandatory base for all the species currently taking an active interest in the tsungarial disk if anything that infection was worse than this one with fewer but more sophisticated machines emerging like hatching larvae from a scatter of fabricaria clustered about the facility itself and taxing the longdisarmed hylozoist severely it was just about coping in its own theatre but it had no more resources to spare for the outbreaks auppi and her friends were trying to handle same still struggling to cope with its share of the fun the gfcf were already talking darkly about some sort of plot these two outbreaks so close together in time but far apart in terms of disk geometry looked suspicious they reckoned they suspected dastardly outside interference and would not rest until the culprits were unmasked in the meantime they would fight valiantly alongside their esteemed culture comrades to contain roll back and ultimately extinguish the smatter outbreak they were sending their ships all over the disk ensuring that the infection was spreading no further while leaving their more martially oriented culture cousins to do the equivalent of the handtohand stuff play to ones strengths and all that even trying to avoid the truly vicious stuff they were still stumbling across bits of it now and again they were doing their best to smite with the best of them which meant the culture obviously even though this was not really in their nature okay so whats the news with you personally lover missing you otherwise okay keeping busy oh arent we all well id better go more swarmers to waste got another cloud coming out of one of the mid lsevens off i go to blit blit away dont get blitted ditto to you till next you forgot to say missing you too wha i did didnt i what a crap girlfriend miss you love you love you too back to the fray i guess hold on we have a name for that torturer class oddly no probably means its one of the particularly weird ones want to bet its a vet of the iwar still troubled and trying to deal with its issues after a millennium and a half oh fuck a weirdedup geriatric warship getting piled into the current mix with our luck itll have come to join the fucking outbreak not help us jump up and down on it there now cynical paranoid and pessimistic i think that completes the set doesnt it ill use at least part of the next four hours thinking up fresh negativities to display for you good hunting spoiled for choice out here you too off later off auppi unstril muted comms glanded a little more edge and took a deep breath as the drug coursed through her the displays seemed to sharpen and brighten their d qualities appeared enhanced and all the other signals coming into her sort of freshened whether they were auditory tactile or anything else and there was a lot else she felt very alert and raring to go junkie said the ship yep she said enjoying it too you worry me sometimes when i worry you all the time we may have started to reach equilibrium she told it though it was more just the sort of thing you felt you had to say when you were riding an edge buzz than what she actually felt the ship didnt really worry her at all she worried it just as it should be she enjoyed that feeling too the ship wasnt really a ship too small and so didnt have a proper name it was a fast fleet liaison module with emergency weaponisationability or something and all it had was a number well it had been thoroughly weaponisationed all right and it had room inside for a human pilot so like the dashingly gorgeous mr lanyares tersetier colleague and lover shed been determined not to let the machines have all the fun dealing with the unexpected semiwidespread and bizarrely uncontainable smatter outbreak shed decided to call the ship the bliterator which smacked even her as a bit childish but never mind auppi and the ship blitted the fuck out of whatever elements of the hegswarm outbreak they got to point themselves at just blowing the selfish dust out of the skies she was genuinely in mortal danger hadnt slept more than a few minutes at a time for well offhand she couldnt remember how many days and she was starting to feel more like a machine than a fully functioning and quite attractive human female didnt matter she was loving it there were immersive shootgames as good arguably better in some ways than this and she had played them all but this had an advantage over all of them it was real one unlucky collision with a boulder stone gravel granule or maybe even sandgrainsize bit of the current infection and shed be lucky to live same applied to the weapons that some of these later outbreakians were coming equipped with that was worrying in itself the hegswarm getting gunnedup too developing so far the weapons themselves were nothing to worry a properly prepared tooledup piece of culture offensive kit like the one she was in humble civilian transport origins or not but again an unlucky combination of events and shed be plasma meatdust a highly distributed red smear she lanyares and the others had agreed that knowing that fact added something to the whole experience terror mostly but also an extra level of excitement of exultation when you came out the other side of an encounter still alive plus a feeling after each engagement that you never really got in a sim that of having genuinely done something of accomplishment there had been over sixty humans in the restoria mission to the tsungarial disk when the outbreak began theyd all volunteered to get involved theyd drawn lots for who got to pilot the twentyfour microships they could field so far two of the drone ships had been damaged but had managed to get back to base for repair none of the humans had ended up deadmissing injured the humans had all run their own sims and looked at old scenarios and reckoned that they had about a fourtoone chance of getting through this unscathed if the outbreak ran the way it had been expected to only it hadnt they didnt even think to report it immediately because the original little smatter burstlet had been interesting something worth studying then a day later when theyd realised it was the real thing theyd still confidently assured superiors and distant offers of help that they could handle it itd be over before anybody more than a day away got there and there was nobody anywhere near a day away it went over that first oneday prediction but by then they were even more confident they had worked it out and knew how to deal with it itd be over in a couple of days well four okay definitely six now they were on day eight or nine the fucking outbreak wasnt letting up in fact it was showing signs of developing those weapons crude or not and they were all starting to get as lan had put it frazzled plus their pooled averaged constantly updated shouldbefairlyreliable sims had over the last few days gone from giving them a four out of five chance of surviving without casualties to odds of three out of four then to a two out of three chance and then inevitably it felt like to a onetoone likelihood that had been sobering it was only a sim only a prediction but it was still worrying that last estimate had been good up to about five hours ago by now they must be well into negative odds unless the outbreak just stopped or even just tailed away unfeasibly rapidly or they were ridiculously lucky they were going to lose somebody well maybe they were but she wasnt going to be the one they might lose more than one she wasnt going to be the first fuck it maybe theyd all die she wanted to be the one survivor or the last to go down a ferocity auppi would never have guessed resided in her rose and burned in her chest and behind her eyes when she thought about this sort of stuff yeah natural warrior that was her she could hear lanyares laughing at her already glanded too much edge sperk quicken focal drill and gung young lady still though that lust for destruction glory even glorious death was a sort of extra emergent drug in itself a metahit that spoke to something deepburied long veneered over but never entirely expunged in the panhuman bioheritage she was armoursuited plugged into a gelfoamed brace couch with at least four metres of highdensity gunnedup muchbeweaponed fast fleet liaison module between her and the vacuum twelve metres of pointy armoured ditto measuring from the front and she had an arsenal of weaponry one main laser four secondaries eight tertiaries six pointdefence highrepeat shrapnel laser cells a couple of nanogun pods currently seveneighths depleted so it would soon be time to get back to base to rearm and a heavy slowing bulky but useful hullslung missile container with an assortment of sleekly deadly lovelies inside that was only half depleted which the ship still maintained meant she was being too miserly with the missiles she saw it as just being careful be tight with the stuff that could get depleted and extravagant with what seemed neverending her own desire to fight and destroy she was almost ashamed to be backed up a real warrior shouldnt be a real warrior should face the certainty of death and oblivion and still be fearless still treat their life as just something to be gambled with against the odds of fate as effectively as possible fuck it though the warriors of old had thought they were effectively backed up too sure in themselves that they were bound for some glorious martial heaven that it was nonsense wasnt the point some of them must have had their doubts but they had still behaved as though they didnt that was fucking bravery or stupidity or gullibility or a kind of narcissism what you thought it was depended on what sort of person you were what you might have felt and done in the same situation would theyhave taken the offer of being truly backed up had they been able leapt at it shed have bet and never forget they would be killing other people not dumb matter smartened up a couple of notches to the point it became annoying that was where the analogy with gameplaying became something even closer you could waste smatter with exactly the same moral abandon as something whacked in a shootup game anyway she was backed up and popped out of the fray every four hours or so like the others to draw breath find out what was happening and transmit the latest version of her alltoomortal soul to the restoria mission control hab on the inner fringe of the disk only a thousand klicks above the cloud tops of the gas giant razhir where shed be heading shortly to rearm doubtless extra copies of her mindstate would then be passed on to whatever the nearest restoria ship was and beyond that probably to other substrates overseen by different minds quite possibly on the other side of the big g or even further afield backed up tooled up riled up time to waste something she used the starefocus function to zoom in on the cloud of boulders coming out of the middisk levelseven fabricary the front of the cloud was less than a minute old most of it was still bursting out of the ancient space factory through round ports in the fabricarys dark surface it looked a lot like a giant seed pod releasing spores which was fairly appropriate she supposed two point eight minutes away she said she took a sweep about scanning right around right to left and back to forward and then looking everywhere at once just to get the local feel she could just about remember how that had felt the first time it had been demonstrated to her shed almost thrown up looking in two contrarotating directions at once and then in all directions at the same time just wasnt stuff the ancient human brain systems were able to cope with processing the results kind of confused the frontal cortex too shed thought shed never get the hang of it but she had it was routine now anything closer smaller nastier or further but worse if there is im not seeing it agree the ship said it had already started powering up its engines and pointed them at the offending fabricary and the cloud of smart boulders pouring out of it numbers twentysix k and counting better than per second from about as many ports stable issue rate just over a hundred thousand by the time we get there and estimating as many to come where are the fucking gfcf and their infab intervention teams not in that one at a guess the ship said im sending its ident to the initial contact facility so they can come sanitise it later never mind lets go get the fuckers the ship hummed around her she felt it accelerate and felt too her body adjust to the force most of the gs they were pulling were being cancelled but they could go faster if they let some leak through the ship went tearing through the field of disk components heading inward for the middle of the torus flashing past the dark shapes of the fabricaria she wondered how many more held infestations of the smatter how much longer they could keep whacking everything that appeared there was another way of course for her lan and the others not to get killed they could just stop fighting and leave it all to the machines there were another twenty droneor selfcontrolled microships similar to the one she was in all desperately trying to contain the outbreak if the humans just stopped taking part in the fight the ships they were in would keep on operating regardless once theyd offloaded their single crew person theyd be able to accelerate and turn faster without their biological component aboard and they would hardly suffer in the heat of battle the ships took advantage of useful aspects of the human brains behaviour like its intrinsic pattern recognition ontarget concentration and flinch responses so their wiredin human charges genuinely did some useful work alongside the ais but in the end everybody knew this was really just one set of machines against another and the humans were only along for the ride participant observers taking part because not to do so would be dishonourable ignominious in the big long picture this was just another tiny instance that told anybody who was interested that the culture was not just its machines auppi didnt care useful useless big help or hindrance she was having the time of her life she hoped shed have greatgreatgrandchildren to dandle on her knee one day so she could tell them about the time shed fought the nasty cancerous breeding machines of the tsungarial disk armed only with a highly sophisticated little weaponified microship an onboard brainlinked ai and more exotic weaponry than you could shake a spacestick at but that was for another time what would feel no doubt like another life altogether for now she was a warrior and she had stuff to blit she wondered what the incoming torturerclass ship would bring to the fray and almost wished it hadnt come at all they came for him as hed known they would hed expected theyd find a way eventually representative filhyn her aide kemracht and the others many others it had turned into quite a big operation had done all they could to keep him safe away from interference and temptation they had spirited him away from the parliament building after the hearing where he had spoken out and they had kept him mobile moving him from place to place almost every day over the ensuing weeks he rarely slept in the same place twice he had stayed in vast skyscraper apartments belonging to sympathisers budget hotels off buzzing superhighways houseboats on shallow lagoons near the sea and for the last two nights in an old hill station in the mountains a leafy summer retreat for the upper and uppermiddle classes of centuries ago before anybody had invented air conditioning a little narrowgauge railway had brought them up here him and his two immediate companions and the small team of less obvious helpers and guards that nowadays always travelled with him the lodge sat on a shallow ridge looking out over unbroken slopes of trees stretching to the gently undulating horizon on a clear day they said you could see the plains and some of the great ziggurats of the nearest big city not this weather though it was cloudy misty humid and great snagging strands of clouds drifted above and around the lodge sometimes wrapping themselves about the ridge like insubstantial tooeasily torn veils they had been due to move to a different travellers lodge that morning but there had been a mud slide overnight and the road was blocked theyd move tomorrow however reluctantly prin had become a star it was not something he was comfortable with people wanted him they wanted to interview him they wanted to change his mind or show him the error of his ways they wanted to support him they wanted to condemn him they wanted to save him they wanted to destroy him they wanted to help him and they wanted to obstruct and hinder him mostly they wanted access to him to accomplish all these things prin was an academic a law professor who had devoted his life to the theory and the practice of justice the theoretical side was his professional life the practical part had drawn him into worthy causes campus protests underground semilegal netpublishing and finally into the scheme to infiltrate the hell that everybody either denied existed outright or sort of knew was there but liked to pretend wasnt because they sort of half agreed with the idea behind it to punish those who deserved punishment hell was always for other people hed known something of the grisly reality of it from officially published and illegally disseminated accounts and he and one of his junior colleagues had taken the decision to be the ones who went into hell to experience it first hand and bring back the truth the very fact he and chay wouldnt have been anybodys first choice for such a bizarre and frightening mission they hoped would make them more credible witnesses if and when they returned they were not fameobsessed attentionseekers not journalists trying to make a reputation not people who had ever had much obvious interest in doing anything which would bring them the amount of attention such an undertaking might result in then when they were doing what training they could for their undercover mission training that to them just meant doing lots of reading about the subject though others in their little cell of subversives had insisted include psychological hardening that had involved experiences a lot like the sort of stuff they were going in there to denounce they had become lovers that had complicated things a little but they had discussed it and decided that if anything it would be an advantage they would be more committed to each other as a team when they were in the hell now that they were something more than colleagues and friends he looked back on their pathetic preparations and their terribly earnest discussions with a mixture of embarrassment fondness and bitterness what could prepare you for such horror not all their days of hardening enduring small electric shocks the start of suffocation and a lot of being shouted at and verbally abused by the exarmy guys whod agreed to help had amounted to a minutes worth of what they had experienced in hell right from the start from day one nevertheless despite being caught up in the horrifying vortex of violence and sheer hatred that had enveloped them instantly on their arrival they had stayed together and they had in some sense accomplished their mission he had got out even if chay had lost her mind he had been able to be the sober sensible unrufflable witness that he had meant to be right from the start when they had first started talking about the mission with the relevant programmers hackers and exgovernment agency whistleblowers whod originally been put in touch with their little underground organisation but he had had to leave chay behind hed done what he could to get her through as well but he hadnt made her his first priority at the last moment as theyd hurtled through the air towards the glowing gate that led back to reality and a relief from pain he had twisted led with his own back rather than with her held in his limbs literally putting himself first he had hoped they would both make it through but he had known that it was unlikely and what he had to ask himself what he had been asking himself ever since was this if chay had been of sound mind at the time would he have acted any differently he thought he hoped he would have that being the case he was sure she would have made just as good a witness as he had then he could have done the decent chivalrous masculine thing and saved the girl got her to safety and taken whatever extra punishment the mephitic bureaucracy of hell decreed but he could only have done that if hed thought that she would get back to the real as anything other than a broken weeping wreck she had denied the real while shed been in hell to preserve what was left of her disintegrating sanity how could he be sure she wouldnt have denied the reality of hell once she was back in the real even that presupposed that shed have made a considerable recovery from the pathetic state shed been in towards the end well the end for him because he got out probably just the start of fresh torment and horror for her of course he had nightmares and of course he tried not to think of what might be happening to her back in the hell the prohell parts of pavulean society headed by people like representative errun had been doing everything they could to destroy his reputation and make his testimony look like a lie or grossly exaggerated everything from a schooldays girlfriend who felt shed been dumped too harshly to a fine for being disruptive in a university bar when he was a firstyear student had been dragged out to make him look unreliable that such trivial misdemeanours were the best the other side could do had been treated as a great and unexpected victory by rep filhyn who had become a trusted friend over the months since hed first testified at her side they saw each other only rarely now it would have made him too easy to trace instead they talked on the phone left messages he could watch her on the screen most evenings too on news coverage magazine programmes documentaries or specialist feeds denouncing the hells and defending him mostly he liked her and could even imagine something happening between them if that idea wasnt in itself a wild fantasy if things had been different if he wasnt for ever thinking of chay it was assumed that the pavulean hell was running on a substrate far away from pavul itself for decades people had been searching for any sign of it being in any sense physically on the planet itself or even anywhere near the relatively anarchic habitats of the planets inner system were particularly favoured as locations but without having found any evidence at all most likely chays being resided tens hundreds maybe thousands of light years away deepburied inside the substrate of some unknowably alien society he looked up at the stars some nights wondering where she was dont you feel guilty about leaving her do you feel guilty that you left her how guilty do you feel abandoning her there do you sleep well with all that guilt do you dream about her you must feel so guilty would you do the same thing again would she have abandoned you there he had been asked the same question in many slightly different guises many times and answered it as honestly as he could each time they had tried to get at him through her tried to get her the chay who had been woken up on the houseboat the chay who would never have the memories of their time together in hell to denounce him for abandoning her but she hadnt let them use her she said shed felt hurt initially but thought hed done the right thing she still completely believed in what theyd done she supported him fully she wasnt saying the things the media especially the hostile prohell media wanted her to say so they quickly stopped asking her how she felt and the prohell side the erruns of their world the people who would keep hell had started trying to reach him through their public pronouncements hinting at a deal that would let chay go if he would retract his earlier testimony and agree not to testify again prin had given filhyn and kemracht permission to try to shield him from this sort of temptation but there was only so much he could do especially when journalists granted interviews and calling in remotely asked him for his response to such vicariously delivered overtures and now a week before he was due to testify before the galactic council the prohell people had tracked him down he knew something was wrong even before he fully woke up the sensation was like knowing you had gone to sleep on a narrow ledge high on a cliff and woken in darkness to find there was the hint of an edge under your back and nothing there when you stretched out to one side his heart thumped his mouth felt dry he felt he was about to fall he struggled to consciousness prin son are you all right it was representative errun the old prohell campaigner who had tried to stop him giving any evidence at all in the parliament two long months earlier of course now it felt like hed known from the start it would be errun theyd send but he told himself it was just a lucky guess a coincidence prin woke up looked around he was in a fairly grand rather cluttered comfortablelooking room that might have been modelled on representative erruns own study for all he knew so he had not really woken up at all was not really looking round they had found a way into his dreams they would tempt him here then he wondered how theyd accomplished this may as well just ask how are you doing this he asked errun shook his head i dont know the technical details son please do not call me son errun sighed prin i just need to talk to you prin got up walked to the door of the room the door was locked where windows might have been there were mirrors errun was watching him prin nodded at the desk i intend to pick up that antique lamp and attempt to strike you across the head with it representative what do you think will happen i think you should sit down and let us talk prin errun said prin said nothing he went to the desk picked up the heavy oil lamp gripped it in both trunks so that its weighted base was upright and walked towards the older male who was now looking alarmed he was back in the seat sitting facing errun again he looked at the desk the lamp was where it had been the representative appeared unruffled that is what will happen prin errun told him say what you have to say prin said the older male hesitated wore an expression of concern prin he said i cant claim to know everything youve been through but prin let the old one witter on they could make him stay in here stop him from leaving and stop him from offering any violence to this dreamimage of the old representative but they couldnt stop his attention from wandering the techniques learned in lecture theatres and later honed to perfection in faculty meetings were proving their real worth at last he could vaguely follow what was being said without needing to bother with the detail when hed been a student he had assumed he could do this because he was just so damn smart and basically already knew pretty much all they were trying to teach him later during seemingly endless committee sessions hed accepted that a lot of what passed for useful informationsharing within an organisation was really just the bureaucratic phatic of people protecting their position looking for praise projecting criticism setting up positions of nonresponsibility for upcoming failures and calamities that were both entirely predictable but seemingly completely unavoidable and telling each other what they all already knew anyway the trick was to be able to reengage quickly and seamlessly without allowing anyone to know youd stopped listening properly shortly after the speaker had first opened their mouth so representative errun had been blathering on with some homely folksy little speech about a childhood experience that had left him convinced of the need for useful lies pretend worlds and keeping those that made up the lumpen herd in their place he was coming to the end of his rather obvious and graceless summingup now reviewing it with his academic hat on prin thought it had been a rather pedestrian presentation capable but unimaginative it might have merited a c a c if one was being generous sometimes you didnt want to reengage quickly and seamlessly sometimes you wanted the student postgrad colleague or official to know that they had been boring you he gazed expression lessly at errun for a moment too long to be entirely polite before saying hmm i see anyway representative i assume youre here to offer a deal why dont you just make your offer errun looked annoyed but with an obvious effort controlled himself shes still alive in there prin chay shes still in there she hasnt suffered and shes proved stronger than people in there thought she was so you can still save her but their patience is running out both with her and you i see prin said nodding go on do you want to see see what see what has happened to her since you left her there prin felt the words like a blow but tried not to show it im not sure that i do its not its not that unpleasant prin the first longest part isnt even hell at all no where then in a place they sent her to recover errun said to recover prin was not especially surprised because shed lost her mind and the mad dont suffer properly something like that i suppose though they didnt punish her after she seemed to get it back either let me show you i dont but they showed him anyway it was like being strapped into a chair in front of a wraparound screen unable to move your eyes or even blink he watched her arrive at a place called the refuge in some medieval place and time copying manuscripts in an era before moveable type and printing he heard her voice saw her threatened with punishment for voicing doubts about religion and faith saw her acquiesce and conform saw her work diligently through the following years and watched her work her way up the shallow arthritic hierarchy of the place always keeping a journal until she became its chief he saw her sing their chants and take comfort in the rituals of their faith saw her admonish a noviciate for lack of faith just as she had been admonished years earlier and thought he could see where this was going but then on her death bed she revealed she had not changed had not let the behaviour of piety become the reality of internalised faith he wept a little and was proud of her even though he knew such vicarious pride was mere sentimentality arguably just a typically male attempt to appropriate some of her achievement for himself but still then he watched her become an angel in hell one who delivered sufferers from their suffering ending their torment one per day no more and taking on a fraction of their pain with every merciful snuffingout so that to the extent that she suffered she did so of her own volition and meanwhile became an object of veneration the centre of a death cult within hell the miracleworking messiah of a new faith so she was being used to bring a little extra hope to hell removing one lucky winner per day as though in some fatal state lottery of release to increase the suffering of the vast majority left behind prin was moderately impressed what an inspired diabolical way to use one who had lost their mind to stop others losing theirs the better to torment them more efficiently a blink and he was back in erruns study taking that all at face value prin said it provides a fascinating insight into the thought processes of those concerned and so this deal the old male stared at him for a moment as though nonplussed before he seemed to gather himself dont go humiliating your own society at that hearing prin he said dont presume to know better than so many generations of your ancestors dont give in to that desire to posture dont testify thats all we ask and she will be released released in what sense she can come back prin back to the real there already is a chayeleze hifornsdaughter here in the real representative i know errun nodded and i understand there is probably no way of reintegrating the two however there would be nothing to stop her from living on in an entirely pleasant afterlife i understand there are hundreds of different heavens enough to suit every taste there is however another possibility a new body could be found for her grown for her indeed created specially just for chay i thought we had laws about that sort of thing prin said smiling we do prin but laws can be amended it was erruns turn to smile thats what those of us lucky enough to serve as representatives do he looked serious again i can assure you there will be no obstacle to chay being reembodied absolutely none prin nodded and hoped that he looked thoughtful and either way he said whether she ends up in a heaven or a new body there will be no trace left of her being her consciousness left in hell prin asked immediately he felt guilty he not the senator already knew how this was going to play out and giving the old male false hope was a little cruel only a little cruel of course within the context they were talking about it was trivial to the point of irrelevance yes errun agreed there will be no trace of her consciousness left in hell whatsoever and all i have to do is not testify yes the old male looked avuncular encouraging he sighed made a tiredlooking gesture with both trunks oh in time you might be expected to take back some of what youve already said in the past but wed leave that for the moment on pain of what prin asked trying to sound merely reasonable pragmatic if i didnt what then representative errun sighed looked sad son prin youre smart and youre principled you could be set to do very well within the academic community with the right people taking an interest in your advancement very well very well indeed but if you insist on being awkward well the same trunks that can help lift you up can keep you pressed down keep you in your place he held up both trunks in a defensive gesture as though fending off an objection prin had not voiced its no great conspiracy its just nature people are liable to help out people whove helped them make life difficult for them and theyll just do the same for you no need to invoke secret societies or sinister cabals prin looked away for a moment taking in the view of the carved wood desk and the highly patterned carpet wondering idly how deep the level of detail went in such dreamrealities would a microscope reveal further intricacy or a blurred pixel representative he said and both hoped and suspected he sounded tired let me be frank i had thought to string you along tell you that id think about it that id let you know my answer in a few days errun was shaking his head im afraid i need your he began but prin just held one trunk up and talked over him but im not going to the answer is no i will not deal with you i intend to make my statement before council prin no the old male said sitting forward in his seat dont do this if you say no to this therell be nothing i can do to hold them back theyll do whatever they want to do to her youve seen what they do to people to females in particular you cant condemn her to that for gods sake think what youre saying ive already asked if theres any leniency i can ask for but shut up you foul corrupt cruel old male prin said keeping his voice level there is no they there is only you you are one of them you help control them dont pretend they are somehow separate from you prin im not in hell i dont control what happens there youre on the same side representative and you must have some control over hell or you couldnt offer this deal in the first place prin waved one trunk but in any event lets not distract ourselves the answer is no now may i resume my sleep do i get to wake up screaming or do you intend to subject me to some further punishment in this strange little virtual dream environment were inhabiting errun stared at him wideeyed do you have any idea what theyll do to her he said voice raised hoarse what sort of barbarian are you that you can condemn somebody you purport to love to that prin shook his head you really cant see that youve made a monster of yourself can you representative you threaten to do these things or if we are to accept your naive attempt to distance yourself from the grisly realties of the environment you so readily support to let these things happen to another being unless i lie in a manner that suits you and then you accuse me of being the monster your position is perverse farcical and as intellectually demeaning as it is morally destitute you coldhearted bastard the representative seemed genuinely upset prin got the impression the old male would be out of his seat and attacking him if hed been younger or shaking him by the shoulders at the very least how can you leave her there how can you just abandon her because if i save her i condemn all the others representative whereas if i tell you to lift your tail and insert your deal where only a loved one will ever get wind of it perhaps i can do something to end the obscenity of the hells for chay and all the others you conceited presumptuous little shithead who the fuck are you to decide how we run our fucking society all i can do is tell the we need the hells were fallen evil creatures nothing that requires torture for its continuance is worth you live on your fucking campuses with your heads in the fucking clouds and think everythings as nice as it is there and everybody as civilised and reasonable and polite and noble and intellectual and as cooperative as they are there and you think thats the way it is everywhere and how everybody is youve no fucking idea what would happen if we didnt have the threat of hell to hold people back i hear what you say prin told him keeping calm noble civilised reasonable clearly errun had never sat in on a faculty annual performance remuneration seniority and selfcriticism meeting its nonsense of course but it is interesting to know that you hold such views you pompous egotistical little cunt the representative screeched and you representative are typical of those with ethical myopia who feel only for those nearest them you would save a friend or loved one and feel a glow of selfsatisfaction at the act no matter to what torment that same act condemned countless others you selfimportant little fuck errun growled talking at the same time as prin you expect everybody else to feel the same way and deeply resent the fact that some might feel differently ill make sure they tell her its all your fault when theyre fucking her to death every night a hundred at a time you are the barbarian representative you are the one who thinks so highly of himself he assumes everybody who means something to him ought to be elevated above all others prin took a breath and really listen to yourself threatening such depravity just because i wont do as you demand how good do you expect to feel about yourself at the end of this representative fuck you you icelivered selfsatisfied intellectual shit your moral fucking high ground wont be high enough to escape her screams every night for the rest of your life youre just embarrassing yourself now representative prin told him thats no way for an elderly and respected elected officer of the state to talk i think we ought to conclude this here dont you this does not end here the old male told him in a voice dripping with hatred and contempt but end it did and prin woke sweating but not jerking upright screaming which was something with a sort of cold dread in his belly he hesitated then reached out tugging on the antique bellpull for help they found something called a thinband cerebral induction generator it had been stuck a little lopsided as though it had been done very hastily to the back of the beds headboard a shielded cable ran from it through the wall to the roof and a satellite dish disguised as a tile patch this was what had allowed them to take over his dreams none of it had been there the day before kemracht representative filhyns aide looked him in the eye as the allwheeldrive bumped down the road in the darkness taking them to the next hideout the lights of the second vehicle following behind cast wildly waving shadows about the passenger compartment you still going to testify prin prin who could not be sure that kemracht was not the traitor in their midst those faculty committee meetings also taught you to trust no one said ill be saying what i was always going to be saying kem and left it at that kemracht looked at him for a little while then patted him on the shoulder with one trunk it was like diving into a blizzard of multicoloured sleet a disturbed whirling maelstrom of tens of thousands of barely glimpsed lightpoints all tearing turmoiled towards you against the darkness auppi unstril had glanded everything there was worth glanding slipping into the zonedout state of steady unremitting concentration such engagements called for she was entirely part of the machine feeling its sensory power and weapon systems as perfect extensions of herself and connecting with the little ships ai as though it was another higher quicker layer of tissue laid across her own brain tightly bundled penetrated and penetrating via her neural lace and the network of humanmindattuned filaments within the ships dedicated pilot interface suite at such moments she felt she was the very heart and soul of the ship the tiny animal kernel of its being with every other part from her own drugjazzed body out like forcemultiplying layers of martial ability and destructive sophistication each concentricity of level adding extrapolating intensifying she plunged into the storm of swirling motes coloured sparks against the black each was a single trucksized boulder of notquitemindless smatter a mixture of crude rocketpowered ballistic javelins moderately manoeuvrable explosive cluster munitions chemical laserarmed microships and the mirrored ablationarmoured but unarmed breeder machines that were the real prize here the entities amongst the lethal debris that could start other smatter infections elsewhere at the start of the outbreak all those days earlier the breeders had made up nineteen out of twenty of the swarming machines immediately swept and evaluated by the ships sensors they had shown up as a cloud of tiny blue dots speckling the dark skies around the gas giant razhir as though the great planet had birthed a million tiny water moons with only a few of the other types of swarmers dotting the outpouring clouds of smatter in retrospect those first few days when the blue dots made up vast nearmonochrome fields of easily tracked targets had been the days of happy hunting then however the machines the infection had learned it was getting nowhere with its original mix of production signals coming back to where the machines originated in the infected manufacturies told it that nothing was surviving so it had switched its priorities for five or six days now the blue dots had been steadily reducing in number until for the last day or so they had become lost in the billowing masses of green yellow orange and red points all indicating swarmers with offensive abilities gazing into the cloud around her auppi could see that this latest outbreak was composed mostly of red dots indicating these were the laserarmed variety red mist she thought distantly as she and the good ship bliterator plummeted further into them like a spray of blood good sign natty omen here we go together she and the ship registered the near ninety thousand contacts and prioritised by type designating the oneinahundred blue contacts as their initial targets this made the targeting easier in some ways even drugged to her scalp neurallacedbrain running at as near to aispeed as beyondhumanly possible targets running into the high fourthpower meant a lot to take in with one look only ninety thousand though odd she thought theyd been estimating more usually the estimate was easy to make and reliable whyd they got it wrong she ought to feel glad there were ten kilos fewer to blit but she didnt instead she got a feeling something was wrong combat superstition maybe embedded in the cloud of red dots still naively ignoring the bliterator because it hadnt shown itself as hostile yet the few blue dots were all located some way in with none towards the surface of the emerging cloud the ship wove a suggested route for them to the best place deep inside the cloud to start firing lets bend past those two blues and mine them with missiles dormanted till we open auppi sent to the ship reaching out with a sort of ghostlimb sense to adjust the ships sketchedin course okay the ship sent they swung curving round to take in the two blue contacts shed outlined jinking this way and that to avoid running into the swarmers she still found this bit weird tactically logically this made sense get to the centre and start laying waste from there but even though the sims said this was the most destructively efficient approach she still yearned to be firing now in fact to have started firing as soon as theyd come into range of the first swarmers but then another of her instincts just wanted to blow the fabricaria out of the sky why treat the symptoms when you could attack the disease at the source but the disk the fabricaria that made it up was what they were all there to protect ancient fucking monument wasnt it couldnt touch that thatd be uncivilised it was right she agreed with this of course she did she hadnt joined restoria to blast smatter shed joined because she was fascin ated in ancient tech and especially ancient tech that had this rather childish desire to turn everything about it into little copies of itself but after a nineday haul with almost no breaks pounding the onlyarguablyliving crap out of any glowing blue dot that presented itself in her shipshared sensorium you kind of got to thinking like a weapon to a gun all problems resolved into what could be shot at the fabricaria were the source of all this hassle ergo but no aside from the small matter of not getting ones own self blitted preserving the fabricaria and the disk was what mattered most here she felt the missiles go programmed to initiate when the ship started brightening up its own immediate whereabouts the missiles would prioritise the blueecho breeder machines and then start setting about the rest theres a lot of these redecho laser fuckers auppi sent to the ship lets loose all the missiles get this over fast and jump to the rearm immediately after yes yes agreed suggest missiles to these locations leaves half okay gone gone beautiful spread thank you right were about there yes centred in one tenth warm them up get spinning and atumbling and lets light the fuckers up nearly there come on come on come on oh close enough i suppose on yours whoopdedoop auppi felt like she had a trigger beneath more digits than she possessed as though each finger and toe was somehow curled round a little grouping of firing filaments every one individually launchable according to the amount of squeeze she applied she doubleswept her gaze around the feast of targets gloried in the sheer luxuriousness of it and clutched the triggers smoothly to her firing everything loosing everything lighting up every priorityone target in view at once the space she lay in sparkled all around like a diamondball bathysphere lowered into the sort of planetary depths where every organism made its own light rosettes florets sideslanted bursts little spears and dirty flurries of light erupted on every side filling her eyes with sparks whirling within the seen cacophony the spinning tumbling ship was already flagging up the next array of targets she swung and spun with it untroubled by gyrations that would have had her throwing up pretraining whatre the grey blobs she asked the ship as the lasers and their collimators locked into the aiming grids of the ships primary sensors indicates swarmer type unclear the ship told her fuck she sent before loosing another fusillade to strew another hundredplus bright scratches across the sky unclear they hadnt had any unclear before what the fuck was this she could see the missiles popping open their own little pockets of destruction two behind them down the course the ship had taken towards the centre of the cloud and others further away some still just starting to fire meanwhile the smatter had woken up to the fact that this racing wildly tumbling thing in its midst did not wish it well and some of the trucksize laser swarmers were starting to turn their singlemouth longaxes towards them the ship took a hit almost immediately as one swarmer found itself fortuitously pointing right at them and at the right stage in its charging cycle the beam struck slid off bounced away by the little crafts mirror field proportion unclear she sent as the next layer of targets snicked into the aiming grids about one per cent hitting some with sheitthey fired flicking destruction across the darkness this salvo the ship continued devoting sensory resources to analyse debris result they were close enough to the fabricary now to have to take it into account when they targeted this close to what they were aiming at and with such relatively slowmoving targets there was almost zero chance of just plain missing and a stray shot heading straight at the fabricary but it was possible for a blast from the main laser to go straight through one of the swarmers and some of the latest versions had semiserviceable laser coatings capable of deflecting at least part of a bolt from one of the secondary or tertiaries plus you well the ship thankfully had to think about postdestruction mainremainingbody direction vectors and shrapneldebrisscatter profiles auppi was glad she didnt have to think about that sort of housekeeping crap let her concentrate on just blasting stuff they swung again retargeted a few more incoming hits registered small calibre nuisance against the heavy armour of the ships reactive mirror field so she sent the latest targets had blossomed so the ship would have had time to analyse the relevant debris signatures zip the ship sent all still there hitting nearest greyunclear with full main as the ship sent this over twenty of the contacts theyd been aiming at suddenly werent being targeted any more just blinking out fuck such was the weapons power and the swarmers relative vulnerability the ships main laser usually got multiplycollimated into anything up to twentyfour separate independently aimed beams devoting the whole beam on full power to a single object had been unheardof overkill until now nanoguns exhausted the ship told her confirming something she could already see from her own displays she squeezed off another salvo at the truncated target list the mains was obvious the impacting bolt lighting up whatever was around the target itself with splashout freezeframing the pelting swarmers nearby as though in a flash photograph the ship would be watching in greater detail than auppi but even she could see umpteen tiny glowing traces burst glinting from the aimpoint that got it the ship sent everything wheeled again the ship continuing to gyrate wildly carving a gradually increasing hollow space of smatter debris out of the centre of the cloud of swarmers multiple incoming registered as pops and clicks ringing the mirror field meanwhile auppi had been loosing missiles into the depths of the swarm sending them off to start their own spreading blossoms of destruction two grey on halfmain each she suggested doing the ship agreed and the depleted grids lit up firmed again she flexed distributing unseen rays like benedictions she concentrated on the two foci of the main armament a single unsullied brightness flicked on in each then faded neatly the other swarmers being engulfed in glowing debris clouds all happened elsewhere unworthy of notice further afield still the missiles careened about their own little patches of sky dispatching all they could no she asked no the ship said another wild twisting about the skies and razhir the gas giant was suddenly there filling the view its banded face instantly rashed with the aim points the ships main armament had resumed targeting a fullpower blast on individual grey targets motherfucker analysis bigger than average nonablating reflectivity moving quicker complicated lot of wreckage accounting for fewer total targets there she thought shed known there was something wrong about their being only ninety k swarmers when theyd been expecting more the fucking outbreak was switching production mix again going for complex survivability rather than sheer numbers grownup power signatures the ship continued as auppi unleashed another salvo the incoming laser hits sounded like hail on a glass roof another hurried tumble one more array of targets snapping into focus caught and steadied in the aiming grids even as she readied to fire auppi was scanning for the grey contacts preferentially now picking out where they lurked in the red sleetstorm of other contacts tiny patches of the sensor view were outing briefly now as the sheer weight of laser bursts incoming forced the mirror field to occlude the sensors producing little hexagonal pixilations like clutter they came and went almost before she had time to register them she flung out the latest manic lightburst like shaking water droplets from her fingers with the main armament taking one target at a time it was possible to up the collimation on the secondaries for short and mediumrange targets bringing their salvo total back up again there might be a few more wounds rather than outright kills but that was acceptable that one just took off the ship said indicating one of the two grey targets theyd tried to waste two salvoes earlier and there goes the other one see them auppi sent theyre fast she had another reduced set of targets sliding across the view she let fly at them the two fleeing grey contacts would be out of range in seconds any missiles we can put in their way not the first one second yes get the other missiles to concentrate on the greys she suggested she wanted to fire a lot more missiles everywhere but they were out of missiles now too shit we powered them the ship sounded upset didnt know you swore ship i didnt know swarmers could use incoming laser to power them to that sort of speed the ship replied fixing an unlikelylooking vector line across the points representing where one of the grey contacts had been when theyd hit it and where it was now still accelerating we need to chase those she sent you think so its prioritising them another small set of targets swiftly dispatched while another slotted instantly into view the weaponry was falling out of phase now as the differences between the varying recharging intervals started to add up and the additional collimating on the secondaries introduced its own slight delay maybe it wants us to do the same the ship suggested the incoming sounded like drumming heavy rain now the pixilation outings were spattering across the view like manically invasive subtitles in an unknown language i dont think its that smart you want to chase yes that one she indicated the first one to set off out of the cloud of contacts at the same time as loosing another halfsalvo and marking a swathe of fresh targets across the red cloud around them okay the view tumbled one more time another set of targets highlighted across the wash of contactstrewn space then even as she triggered the weaponry again they set off their slow nearcentred drift composed of many lightningfast tumbles and gyrations turning into a single darting vector aimed at where they reckoned the grey they were targeting would be she kept on firing microsalvo after microsalvo at the sleetechoes of red targets as they pursued triggerings becoming almost continuous as the firing patterns diverged red sleet red sleet turning fire bright they must be leaving a tunnel of ravaged fading debris behind them through the swarmer cloud the ship itself a sleek spearpoint glittering with reflected light as the redflagged laser elements swivelled following it and firing so many reds so many its accelerating hard the ship sent shit she thought we powered it by hitting it she sent to the ship yes with the laser yes oh theyre not all just to hit us with theyre there to power the greys thats a departure that could be a lot of fucking departures those grey fuckers are ships microships the outburst has halted the ship told her the last swarmer just exited the infected fabricary auppi and the ship were picking out doublehandfuls of targets constantly now as they charged through the mist of contacts becoming targets delegating the fire commands to the subais effectively letting the weaponry make up its own mind when to initiate hundreds of the laser swarmers are firing at the grey were pursuing the ship sent i can see the backscatter other laser swarmers starting to pattern themselves around each of the greys theyre going to power them up too we arent going to be able to cope she sent this needs mayhem weaponry what weve gots far too polite and pinpoint or a serious effector job for our inbound torturer class i think we should suggest just that okay were in range auppi squeezed off the single mainarmament shot at the fleeing swarmer blasting it across the skies in a pulsating detonation of light fragments incandescing in the pulses of laser still coming in from the swarmers which had been helping to power it their own incoming increased again as the swarmers switched from powering the now destroyed microship to just plain shooting at the bliterator and auppi the ship was swinging powering away curving round lifting away from the debris field it had just created how many more greys auppi asked thirtyeight well never get them all as many as we can then any heading for the planet that had always been one of the nightmare scenarios the swarmers turning properly feral and plunging into the gas giant to start trying to tear it apart so far they hadnt shown any desire to do this none mostly sticking to the system plane few straight up and down nearest this one the ship highlighted one of the microships seemingly headed straight for another fabricary its rear end lit up by the laser swarmers helping to propel it signal lan and the others she sent get base to contact the torturer class and suggest it gets stuck straight in with its effector only way were going to cope here is by turning these fuckers on themselves agree done they left the missiles to deal with the bluetagged breeder swarmers while they went after the microship this one loosed its own tail laser at them redirecting some of its vicarious propellant laser fire back at its pursuer the bliterators mirror field blanked their sensors for an instant to cope oh thats not funny she sent range the ship replied take that with your fucking arselight auppi sent as she triggered their main armament the weapon was wound up to frequencies there was no way the target ships own mirror armour could counter the swarmer erupted brightly way in the distance the bliterator was already curving away hard picking out their next target they ran down ten more the intervals between growing greater as the fleeing swarmer ships moved quickly away from the initial outbreak point they passed the time frazzling as many of the cloud of laser swarmers as they could get near dipping into the stillslowly expanding cloud of contacts like a predatory fish into a baitball the next grey was taking them way out of the original infection outbreak volume zipping past other dormant fabricaria as they tore after the rearlit microship this ones accelerating harder than the others given its distance from the laser swarmers powering it the ship told her thought it was taking a while may mean its learned something about using that rear absorp tiondeflector set we in any danger shouldnt be mirror fields been unstressed so far the ship sounded unworried range she fired the resulting explosion didnt look right too small for a start a partial the ship sent just wounded wow our first partial still accelerating though slower seventy per cent course change too heading straight for that fabricary collisionary the ship highlighted one of the great dark slowly orbiting shapes sitting less than a thousand kilometres ahead collisionary auppi sent oh fuck she thought just what they needed highspeed swarmerfabricary collisions ready the ship told her hit it again she did still too small a result the swarmer had got harder smaller more reflective fortyfive per cent of original acceleration the ship reported still picking up speed though come on you fucker fucking die they whizzed through the debris field from their first partial hit the ship scanned the still hot cloud as they flashed through it shields taking tiny impacts that made the ship judder interesting materials profile the ship said definitely learning same course yes swerved back to it after we knocked it off impact three seconds they had time to hit the swarmer twice more by the time it collided with the fabricary it had stopped accelerating and been reduced to the status of something more like a tight cloud of debris all travelling in the same direction rather than a ship though it was still making sufficient speed to create a substantial flash when it hit the dark threekilometrelong lump of the fabricary fuck auppi sent watching the debris bloom and expand agree the ship replied they cruised in after it already turned about and decelerating hard as the engines readied them to go back the way theyd come still heading backwards on their earlier course through sheer momentum unexpected impact signature the ship sounded puzzled oh fuck has it broken it she asked the debris had hit at over thirty klicks a second it had ended up being a glancing blow rather than headon but it had blasted a hole in the fabricary and set it spinning and tumbling it was already spiralling out of its orbit and drifting fractionally inwards towards razhir uncorrected it would eventually head right down into the gas giants atmosphere to burn up in theory the disk ought to remain stable for ever in practice passing comets and even nearpassing stars could disrupt it and the fabricaria each had automatic systems that could vent gas to keep them on station it was one of the responsibilities of whatever species was in charge of the disk to keep those automatics charged and working the systems were designed to nudge the fabricaria back into place when their orbits were ruffled by tiny fractions though even if theyd survived the impact undamaged the gross effect of the swarmer remains slamming into it would be orders of magnitude beyond anything the automatics could deal with its as though the ship said sounding hesitant probably waiting for additional detail to accrue via its sensors the surface had been hollowed out the outer shell should be solid protecting the fabricary itself and providing raw material for when its producing something but instead its like the debris hit a thin outer crust and then partly went through partly collided with some sort of minimal structure underneath they had almost drawn to a stop now still approaching the damaged fabricary but increasingly slowly as the engines still at full power cancelled their earlier vector cut engines she sent back flip take us in for a look you sure the ship cut its engines a halfsecond or so before they would have started pulling away from the holed slowly cartwheeling fabricary they were nearly stationary still drifting slowly towards the impact site no not sure she admitted but okay the ship turned about fired its engines briefly turned fired them again and with a little finessing got them locally stationary relative to the hundredmetrelong raggedly ellipsoid breach in the giant slowly tumbling fabricary auppi and the bliterator found themselves looking straight into the tornopen interior of the thing the view was edged all around with sections of its stillglowing outer surface which must have been largely hollowed out to leave only a thin outer skin supported by a fragilelooking network of skinny girders cables and beams that lay between that impromptu hull and the wall of the fabricary proper about twenty metres deeper inside that too had been breached by part of the swarmers wreckage cascade so they could see all the way inside to where the ancient stuffmaking machinery and associated paraphernalia lay this was the antique alien apparatus that was not meant to have been touched or used for a couple of million years it was supposed to be lying there metaphorically cobwebbed in a cavern which was otherwise completely empty unasked the bliterator described a small circle around the main breach so that they could see into different parts of the fabricary interior through the smaller secondary hole in its hull so building up a larger picture the ship displayed the results some bits were blurred because despite the damage there was some sort of movement taking place inside the fabricary but the main image was clear what auppi sent slowly the holy fuck is that twentythree she woke up she looked around she was in a standardlooking mediumdependency medical pod in a standardlooking medical facility could be anywhere shipboard on an orbital anywhere she felt okay she was physically whole wrapped in light compression foam over almost her entire body and she had some sort of movementrestricting bandages round her head pain indicators minimal bodily damage assessment said she was recovering fast from multiple fractures of most major bones no brain damage little major organ damage widespread tissue damage healing fast she should be on her feet in two days in fragile good health the following day and back to normal a day or two after that she could flex her toes and move her arms both her hands were free of the recovery foam she could waggle them and feel the liquidic texture of the pod covering raising her right arm she could sense the compression foam taking the physical strain letting her muscles flex but leaving her knitting bones unstressed okay she said now where are we ms nsokyi a voice said it sounded like the ship or a ship or at least like something nonhuman trying to be reassuring a shipdrone bulbous and smooth like a giant pebble swung into view welcome aboard i am the culture vessel me im counting oh yime said well i was looking for you but now youve found me what of the bodhisattva severely damaged its remains are being held within my own field structure i intend to leave it with the first gsv we encounter the extent of the damage it sustained is such i suspect it will make more sense to rehouse the mind in a new ship frankly the main fabric is mostly fit for recycling in any event a point may come shortly when i may have to suggest that the mind of the bodhisattva abandon ship and throw in its lot with me allowing me to abandon the rest of the remains and so resume my habitual field structure and hence operational fitness why would that be because ms nsokyi we appear to be heading into what will shortly become if it is not already a war zone over the many many years of his sexually active life veppers had worked out how to manage the rhythms and stages of a sexual encounter all with a view to maximising his own pleasure it was definitely a skill worth having he thought of mundane nonsexual things when he wanted to hold himself back and of particularly exciting moments from earlier sexual escapades when he wanted to bring on his orgasm one of the downsides of becoming very old was that the remembered stuff was generally always better than the sex you were actually having right there and then but that was a small price to pay he reckoned that evening he was fucking diamle another of his fabulous harem troupe girls in the master bedroom of the ubruater town house while sohne looked on sohne was the other girl besides pleur who was an impressionist able to take on any appearance currently she looked like a very famous actress he was already looking forward to fucking her next right now though sweating a little his long blondwhite hair tied back in a pony tail he was concentrating on holding back aiming for an orgasm in about a minutes time that ought to be a good one this was no more than he deserved he thought hed only arrived back that morning from his trip to vebezua and beyond and was intent on making up for lost fucking time the air in the room changed there was a massive bang and he was stopped in midstroke still holding diamles perfectly formed hips while the girl herself until that point yelping and moaning with possibly pretended pleasure stared straight ahead at a small rather beautifullooking alien creature with large eyes and milky slightly pinktinged skin most of it hidden by a slimfitting grey uniform the creature had materialised where some of the great beds plumper pillows and cushions had been and had caused several of them either to split or to disintegrate either way spilling bounteous amounts of feathers and almost airlight stuffing into the air the alien looked like it was emerging from its own small snowstorm it flapped ineffectually at the feathers and stuffing gaze darting this way and that diamle screamed internally as it were this was quite a pleasurable experience for veppers not that it made the slightest bit of difference to his sense of shock violation and even betrayal sohne fell forward fainting on the bed in a dead weight her forehead thudding into one of diamles splayed calves diamle was whimpering now veppers let her go she pulled a deflated cushion cover around her and jumped off the bed stood there quivering staring at the little alien she coughed suddenly spitting out feathers the creature wobbled in the midst of the slowly falling debris then seemed to find its balance composing itself it was one of bettlescroys immediate underlings mr veppers it said it looked first at his face then down at his engorged penis gracious it said it looked back at his face overlieutenant vrept it told him nodding once answering directly to the honourable bettlescroybisspeblispin iii himself what the fuck do you think youre doing veppers said this was not funny not forgivable i have information we must talk the gfcfian said it glanced at the sprawled stillfainted form of sohne and the nolongerquivering merely gulping diamle send these persons away sir jaskens voice came distantly from the bedrooms main doors the locked handles were turned from outside then released the door thudded to knocks sir veppers pointed back towards the doors just before i have my chief of security take you away for information talk immediately the little alien said no further delay i have orders sir jasken shouted from beyond the doors again are you all right its jasken with two zei yes veppers shouted wait there he turned to diamle my robe the girl twirled scooped his robe from the floor veppers lifted sohnes head up by her long golden hair and slapped her across the face a couple of times bringing her round she sat back looking woozy cheeks reddened both of you out veppers told the women as he wrapped his robe around himself leave the door unlocked and tell jasken and the zei to wait where they are let him know whats happened here but nobody else diamle wrapped herself and sohne in sheets and helped the other girl to the doors veppers heard diamle saying something to jasken then the doors thudded shut again veppers turned to the small creature are you familiar with the phrase this had better be good overlieutenant vrept he asked kneewalking his way up the bed towards the sitting alien then looking down towering over it i am it told him this is not good though this is bad hence the urgency my commander the aforesaid honourable bettlescroybisspeblispin iii bids me inform you that there has been a security breach in the tsungarial disk one of the currently shipconstructing fabricaria was damaged during the ongoing diversionary smatter outbreak containment action and a light space craft belonging to the culture restoria mission caught recorded sight of the extemporised ship being built within said fabricary signalling this information to the rest of the culture mission within the disk which has concomitantly relayed said information beyond to other culture units while at the same time investigating other fabricaria to discover whether others amongst them are also building ships the results of this investigation being positive of course though steps have been and are being taken to neutralise the culture missions abilities in sum it is now known within the culture and feasibly beyond that certain of the disk elements are manufacturing a war fleet the fleet is still a day and a half from earliest completion excluding amfuelling several culture ships are approaching the disk the nr seem not to have been informed of the full substance of the aforesaid intelligence however they have expressed strong interest in knowing what precisely is going on in the matter of the tsungarial disk and unconfirmed reports suggest they may be moving militarily relevant assets into position that is the initial substance of my message any questions good sir or and also you may wish to enlighten the aforesaid honourable bettlescroybisspeblispin iii regarding the previously discussed but still unspecified targets pertaining to the stillbeingbuilt ships that would be appreciated veppers stared openmouthed at the little alien for at least two heartbeats then wondered if he too was about to faint well happy fucking day demeisen said he turned to lededje with a grin that extended into a broad smile she looked at him i have the feeling that what you think of as good news might not strike everybody else as being quite so smashing some nutters building a bunch of ships in the tsungarial disk demeisen sat back in the seat staring at the modules screen still smiling how is that good news its not its a fucking disaster demeisen said waving his arms thisll end in tears mark my words so stop smiling i cant there are natural okay i can the avatar said turning to her with a look of such abject sadness she instantly wanted to take him in her armoursuited arms pat his back and reassure him everything would be all right even as lededje realised quite how easily she was being manipulated and started to feel furious at herself as well as demeisen he dropped the sad look and went back to looking quite gloriously happy i can help it he admitted i just dont want to help it he waved his arms again come on this avatar naturally recognises my own emotional state and reflects it unless im deliberately trying to deceive would you rather i lied to you then what lededje asked trying to keep her voice cold and not get caught up in the avatars obvious enthusiasm is making you smile about a disaster well first i didnt cause it nothing to do with me hands clean always a bonus but its looking clearer and clearer theres going to be some heavy fucking messing hereabouts very shortly and thats precisely what im built for im going to get to strut my stuff im going to get to be me girlie i tell you i cant fucking wait we are talking about a shooting war she said well yes demeisen exclaimed sounding borderlineexasperated with her he waved his arms again he seemed to be doing this a lot she noticed and people are going to die people very likely even ships she just looked at him lededje the avatar said taking one of her armourfat hands in his own i am a warship this is in my nature this is what im designed and built for my moment of glory approaches and you cant expect me not to be excited at the prospect i was fully expecting to spend my operational life just twiddling my metaphorical thumbs in the middle of empty nowhere ensuring sensible behaviour amongst the rolling boil of fractious civs just by my presence and that of my peers keeping the peace through the threat of the sheer pandemonium that would result if anybody resurrected the idea of war as a disputeresolution procedure with the likes of me around now some senseforsaken fuckwit with a death wish has done just that and i strongly suspect i shortly get a chance to shine baby on the word shine demeisens eyebrows shot up his voice rose a tone or two and increased markedly in volume even through the armoured glove she could feel the pressure of his hands squeezing hers lededje had never seen anybody look so happy and what happens to me she asked quietly you should get back home the avatar told her it glanced at the screen where the black snowflake with too many limbs still filled the centre of the image id chuck you overboard in this shuttle right now and let you head for sichult but whatever the fuck that is might mistake you for a munition or just waste you for the target practice so id better deal with it first the avatar looked at her with a strange intense expression necessarily dangerous im afraid no getting away from it demeisen took a deep breath you afraid to die lededje ybreq ive already died she told him he spread his hands looked genuinely interested and its shit fair enough he said turning to face the screen and sitting back properly in the shuttle command seat lets put that one down as a mistake and try to stop it turning into a habit lededje watched the seat contort itself around the avatar securing his body in place with padded extensions of the chairs own legs arms seat and back she felt movement around and beneath her and realised her seat was doing the same thing enclosing her one more time another layer of confinement beyond the gel suit and the armoured outer suit she was pressed and shuffled backwards until everything fitted snugly against the contours of the seat now we get foamed demeisen told her what she said alarmed as the suits visor swung smoothly down over her face the shuttles interior went dark but the visor showed some sort of compensated image that gave her a very clear view of what looked like redglowing bubbling liquid filling up the space shed been living in for the last twentyplus days rising quickly in a dark red tide around the base of the chair flowing up and over her armoured body and then foaming all about her rapidly covering the visor and leaving her briefly blind in the darkness before she heard the avatar speak again space view or some screen entertainment to while away the time suddenly the visor was showing her the same view the screen had but wraparound the wronglooking eightlimbed black snowflake was still centreimage you might have done better to ask whether i was afraid of forced immobility and confined spaces lededje told the avatar i forgot of course the suit can just put you under for the duration of well whatever no thanks so make you mind up real space view with potential scariness or some screen gentle feelgood wistful comedy razorsharp witterage outright slapstick hilarity engrossing human drama historical epic educational documentary ambient meanderance pure art appreciation porn horror sport or news real space view thanks ill do my best might all happen too quickly if anything happens at all though prepare for disappointment and anticlimax chances are still that this particular encounter will be resolved peacefully bastarding things usually are you are astoundingly bad at hiding your feelings in such matters she told the ship i hope your spacebattle tactics are more subtle the avatar just laughed then everything went quiet for a moment she could hear her own heart beat distantly there was a noise just like a single in drawn breath and then the avatars voice said quietly okay on the screen before her eyes the black snowflake image flickered there came a time when she found the shallow valley with the iron cages where the acid rain fell to torment the howling inmates and each day the demons dragged them screaming to the canted slabs where their blood was spilled to form the gurgling stream at the valleys foot which flowed glutinously into the header pond just upstream from the little mill she beat her great dark wings over the scene watching as a giant flying beetle machine arrived to disgorge the latest batch of the badly behaved whod been appropriately terrified by their tour round hell the beetle landed in a storm of dust caking the mill and adding to the patina on the blackdark blood pond on the side of the mill the wheel revolved ponderously eliciting screams and groans from the stillliving tissues sinews and bones from which it was made every beat of her wings caused her a tiny twinge of pain chay had killed her thousand souls enveloping them to release them into oblivion this had happened some time ago she still had no idea how quickly time moved within the virtual environment of the hell for her it had been over thirteen hundred days nearly three years in pavulean terms back in the real with every death she took on a little more pain the lanternheaded uberdemon had not lied an aching tooth here a stabbing feeling in her gut there a persistent headache what felt like a trapped nerve in one hip a twinge every time she clenched her talons a cramp when she flexed her wings in a certain way a thousand almost infinitesimal little pangs and stings and sprains and strains and ulcers and chafings either adding incrementally to some established hurt or starting a fresh site she had long since stopped assuming that there were no bits of her great dark body left to experience pain there always were she remembered being the old superior near the end of her life in the refuge filled with aches and pains at least there death was always on its way a release from suffering no single ache dominated and even when taken together the sum of them was not utterly debilitating but they all nagged all had their effect filling her days with the grumbling torment of continual grinding misery all the worse on those days when she was feeling sorry for herself for being selfinflicted still she beat on though still she flew across the calamitous geographies of hell watching witnessing and worshipped she didnt wonder that she had become part of this constructed worlds emergent mythology had she still been a lost soul wandering these reeking morasses denuded fireblacked forests craterpitted concrete aprons and blasted cinderstrewn hillsides so traumatised she had started to believe there never had been a real in which shed lived she too might have worshipped something like herself praying to the halffabled occasionally glimpsed angel of death for a release from her torments she had toured the hell to its limits many tens of days flight away and beating upright by those iron walls talons scrabbling at their vast unyielding extent accepted that this was indeed not an infinite space it had its boundaries distant though they may be she established a sort of mental map of the place here were the scorched plains the poisoned marshes the arid badlands the steaming swamps the bleached salt pans the alkali lakes acid ponds bubbling mud craters and sintered lava flows amongst all the other bewilderingly varied wastelands of the place here were the tremendous peaks of ironfrozen mountains their glaciers red with blood here the encircling sea of hell which lapped at the foot of the boundary wall and teemed with voracious monsters here were the great valved doors that admitted the newly condemned here were the roads the towering juggernauts of dead and dying trundled down delivering their grisly cargoes to the vast prisons camps factories and barracks of the place here the damned were set to their slave labour within the munitions factories or condemned to wander the ruins and the wilderness or were chosen to fight in the everlasting war that consumed recycled and reconsumed lives by the thousands and tens of thousands each and every day by both sides because there were two sides to hell though youd have struggled to spot the slightest difference if youd simply found yourself set down in the midst of either the unfortunates delivered into hell were allocated sides before they even entered the place generally half going to one and half to the other there were two sets of the great valved doors only admitting impossible to exit through two vast sets of boulevards paved with wracked backs and splintered bones two whole sets and systems of prisons and factories and camps and barracks two hierarchies of demons and shed been surprised to find two of the colossal kingdemons they fought over the centre ground of hell throwing forces into the fray with a sort of manic relish uncaring how many fell because they would always be resurrected again within days for fresh punishment in the rare event that one side established military superiority over the other through simple luck or an accident of good leadership threatening the balance of territory and forces and so the continuance of the war extra recruits would be funnelled to the temporarily losing side by the simple expedient of shutting down one of the sets of gates channelling all the new arrivals to the disadvantaged side gradually restoring balance through sheer weight of numbers she thought of the gates she and prin had entered through as the eastern gate for no particularly good reason so they had been on the east side but basically every aspect of the east side in this vast dispute was replicated in the west as well and the two appeared identical in their gruesomeness from a distance anyway she was not welcome in the west smaller winged demons came up to mob her when she overflew too far beyond the front of the everlasting war so she had to keep away entirely or fly so high that the detail of what went on was denied her still she had flown to see the opposing western gates soared above the scattered dark clouds of the western hinterland and even landed on occasion usually only for a few minutes at a time on certain jagged frozen peaks well away from the most intense fighting and the greatest numbers of enemy demons whether in the west or the east she looked down from such high crags wrapped from the cold in her own galefluttering wings and watched the scudding shreds of bruisecoloured clouds move over the distant landscapes of terror and pain with a sort of horrified amusement when she had killed the thousandth soul she had taken the halfeaten body and dropped it at the feet of the great lanternheaded demon sitting in his redglowing iron throne looking out over the vast reeking valley of smokes and fumes and screams what the colossal creature boomed with one enormous foot it kicked aside the husk of body shed deposited in front of it a thousand souls she told it treading the air with deep easy sweeps of air keeping herself level with its face but too far away for it to swipe at her easily a thousand days since you told me that once id released ten times one hundred souls youd tell me what happened to my love the male i first came here with prin i said id think about it the great voice thundered she stayed where she was the black leathery wings fanning some of the valleys noxious fumes towards the uberdemons face she gazed into the gaseous impression of a face writhing and billowing behind the housesized pane of glass trying to ignore the four fat dripping candles at each of the lanterns four corners their carbuncled surfaces veined with a hundred screaming nerve clusters the creature stared back at her she kept station refused to move please she said at last long dead the vast voice burst out across her she heard the words with her wings time moves more slowly in here not faster he is barely a memory he died by his own hand ashamed penurious disgraced and alone there is no record of whether he remembered you at the end he escaped being sent here mores the pity satisfied she stayed where she was a while longer upright in the air before it beating her cloak wings like slow mocking applause huh she said at last and turned dropping swooping only to zoom again beating away up and across the valleys slope to its furthest ridge how are the pains bitchlet she heard the demon shout after her do they grow she ignored it she waited until they came back out of the mill the three demons and the one sad screaming soul who had not been released after his tour of hell the demons held the howling frantically struggling male between them one holding both front feet one each at the rear legs they laughed and talked taunting the screeching male as they carried him back to the beetleshaped flier she stooped upon them slaughtering the three demons easily the two at the rear with a single pinch of one of her great talons the unfortunate male lay quivering on the scaly ground watching the demons blood pool dustily in towards him from three different directions the beetle tried to take off she screamed at it and with a twolegged blow ripped one of its wings right off and then tipped it over onto its back it lay making clicking chirring noises when the pilot crawled out she wanted to rip him apart too but instead she let him go she picked the trembling male up with one talon and stared into his petrified face while he voided his bowels noisily on the ground beneath when you left the real she said to him what date was it eh she repeated the question he told her she asked him a couple of other questions about banal things like current affairs and civilisational status then she let him go he scurried away along the road leading from the mill she might have killed him she supposed but she had already released one soul from its torments that day all this had been a sudden inspiration brought on for some reason when shed come upon the mill she trashed the building too scattering its screaming protesting components across the valleys slope throwing wreckage splashing into the mill race and the header pond displacing sloshing tons of blood while the buildings operators ran scampering for their lives the blueglowing door was not glowing at all of course it was just a plain rough wooden door now hanging off its hinges a doorway to nowhere oddly satisfied she swept back into the grim skies with a single great clap of her wings then beat off across the valley she dropped the massive lump of wood that had been the doors lintel towards the fleeing figures of the mill operators as they ran away missing them by less than a metre she wheeled once above the valley just a collection of pains and sundered lives then struck out cloudward rising all the time heading for her roost always assuming the hapless male had been telling the truth the uberdemon had lied barely a quarter of a year had passed in the real vatueil was hanging upside down he wondered absently if there were any circumstances when this could be a good sign he appeared to be inhabiting a physical body hard to tell whether hed actually been embodied in a real one or this was just a fullsensoryspectrum virtuality he was in no pain but the blood roared in his ears due to the gravitational inversion and he felt distinctly disoriented beyond the obvious fact that he was the wrong way up he opened his eyes to see a creature like a giant flying somethingorother staring straight back at him it was also hanging upside down though unlike him it appeared to be entirely happy with the situation it was humansize had a long intelligentlooking face with large bright yellow eyes its body was covered in soft folds of goldengrey fur it had four long limbs with what looked like thick membranes of the same soft fur linking the limbs on each side of its body to each other it opened its mouth it had a lot of very small very sharp teeth you are vatchoy it said in a thick accent vatueil he corrected it looking away from the creature he seemed to be hanging in the bluegreen foliage of a great tall tree further away he could glimpse the trunks of other tall trees the tree he was in was nothing like the size of the impossible tree where he had spent many a happy holiday winged and flying but it was still too big for him to be able to see the ground the branches and trunks he could see looked substantial his feet he noticed were tied together with what looked like rope while another length of rope ran through the noose his feet were in and then right round the metrebroad branch he was hanging from vatoy the creature said close enough he conceded he felt he ought to know what this creature was what species it was part of but he had no internal access to any remote networks here he was effectively just human just meat hanging here all he had to rely on was his own alltoofallible memories such as theyd survived all the transcriptions theyd had to undergo over the years and regenerations plus whatever unexpected intervention had led to him being here his memories were anyway suspect jumbled by a hundred different reincarnations in as many different environments the vast majority virtual unreal militarily metaphorical lagoarnna the creature beside him said thumping itself on the chest yeah hello vatueil said cautiously pleased to meet you pleased meet you too lagoarnna said nodding its big yellow eyes staring at him unblinking vatueil felt a little groggy he tried to remember where hed been last where this version of himself had been last anyway a fellow could lose track when he was copied and recopied so often he started to recall sitting round a table with a bunch of aliens in had it been a ship a meeting in a ship not fighting a war then trapped in tunnels or trenches or the guts of a land ship or a sea ship or a gasgiant dirigible the shape of a gigantic bomb or finding himself downloaded into a smart battle tank or some sort of cross between a microship and a missile or his memories flickered past him detailing what certainly felt like every single time hed played a part in the vast war hed been a part of the war over the hells it made a pleasant change for his last deployment not to have involved nutsandbolts bloodandguts soldiering a meeting was a benign environment potentially just as tremendously boring as war but without the slivers of utter terror stuck in there as well on the other hand he felt he had just been read somehow all those deployments mostly indicating gradually increasing seniority of rank and importance and responsibility all flickering past in his memory all tumbling past like a pack of nearly a hundred cards that had felt like something triggered something called up meeting the meeting the meeting in the ship lots of little aliens one other panhuman big guy or at least important guy he should know the name of that species too but he couldnt remember it hed been far away for that meeting in some rarely travelled bit of the sim no hed been in the real in the real again how about that hed been given a reuseable downloadready body and hed been physically present at that meeting with the cute little aliens with the big eyes and the single larger panhuman with the hunched look and the attitude still couldnt remember the species the guy belonged to maybe hed have better luck with his name vister peppra it had been something like that important top brass in his civilian field a big wheel paprus shepris he remembered not being bored at the meeting it really had been important in fact he remembered feeling nervous excited energised feeling that something genuinely momentous was being agreed here and he was a part of it hed been beamed into that body transcripted into it he might have been transcripted back out again sent back to where hed come from his meetingattending duties over he probably had he looked at the big creature hanging beside him gazing into its staring yellow eyes how did i come to be here he asked how did you get me gufffuffkufffuff not so smart he stared at the creature he closed his eyes shook his head no sorry didnt get the first part of that at all gfcf not so smart the creature said shaking his head seemed to have helped now he could see that the creature had straps and pouches distributed across his goldengrey furred body some sort of headset thin metallic glittering like jewellery wound round the back of its skull little armatures seeming to clasp near but not in its ears and eyes and nose and mouth the gfcf vatueil said a feeling that was equal parts dread and sadness seemed to settle over him he struggled not to show it protocols in messagery lagoarnna told him gifts of knowledge from high to low not always maximally oneway that which is given may give back in time where time is potentially quite long time still less so in cases of knowledge gained by chicanery thefting and so resultingly to this and here plainly plainly ancient code buried consequencing trapdoors therefore their ignorance thereof the gfcf and the nr the nauptre reliquaria that was the name of the species lagoarnna belonged to the nauptre anyway the reliquaria bit usually referred to the machines that had taken over from them while the nauptre themselves the biological part of the superspecies prepared everyone assumed for sublimation thats what had thrown him the nr always presented as machines you never saw the original bio species except in historical contextual stuff they must have intercepted him hed been taken in some handover the gfcf had made of his personality construct his mindstate while attempting to transmit his updated downloaded soul back to the war sim he wondered how bad this was because it could be very bad if he hadnt made it back at all at least people would know there had been a problem he might only have been copied though maybe an identical copy had got back and nobody had any suspicions he tried to recall what the latest tech implied could comms be made completely proof against interception it kept changing one time they told you it was impossible to read a signal without it being obvious to whoever it had been sent to another time they seemed to have changed their minds and it was possible again even easy trivial frankly then it would go back to being impossible for a while whatever he was here when he shouldnt be and the nr or just the n just the bio nauptre though he doubted that could intercept gfcf comms because some of the code the gfcf used in their comms protocols had been given by the nauptre or stolen from them by the gfcf and it had come with holes in it ways the nr or the nauptre could listen in when they wanted to not as smart as they thought they were gufffufffuckingkufffuff shit he wondered why they were bothering to embody him either in the real or in a decent sim but then even when you had all the information sometimes it could be difficult to find the bit you really wanted embodying helped especially when you looked upon what you had downloaded as some sort of strange alien that was what he was to them an alien an alien they had refashioned from commscodeinformation into something at least resembling what resulted from genetic information a creature of flesh and blood him and now they would want the truth meeting lagoarnna said with what might have been a smile gfcf panhuman vipperz scheme war in afterlife tsung disk tsung disk the creature nodded shit it already knew too much of it had he told them that already inadvertently what more would they ask he couldnt see any obvious torture instruments about the creatures webbing and pouches but who knew please not torture why did so much of everything have to come down to pain we are creatures of pain creatures of suffering he had been through this done this not more please not more you not to worry the creature told him it gestured encompassingly is one of trillions scarnations it told him quantum stuff in one you bound to tell trute maybes this one the creature tipped its head to one side and vatueil felt a feeling of utter relief and almost boundless pleasure wash through him he knew he was being manipulated but he didnt care lagoarnna didnt want to hurt him had no intention of hurting him the nauptre had every right to the information he had all they wanted was the truth the truth all so simple just stick to the truth and it made life so much simpler just the one set of facts or assertions to remember the force of this simple truth the truth about truth hit him like a cannon shell he really was experiencing bliss this was only just short of sexual what do you want to know he heard himself say dreamily relate meeting lagoarnna said and crossed its long furmembraned arms across its chest its wide unblinking yellow eyes seeming to stare into his soul all right he heard himself say he marvelled at how relaxed and unconcerned he sounded first let me introduce myself my name is vatueil gyorni vatueil my most recent rank that i recall being that of space marshal he had never enjoyed relating anything more lagoarnna proved to be a very good listener twentyfour atdministratorcaptain quarquoachali commander of the gfcf minor destructor vessel fractious person took the priority call from legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii in his cabin as ordered the legislatoradmiral was shown sitting at his private desk a roller keyboard displayed on the surface in front of him as quar watched bettlescroy snicked a couple of keys into place then folded his elegant hands under his chin elbows on desk leaving the keyboards commit key winking he looked up at quar smiled sir quar sat as upright in his seat as he could quar good day thank you sir to what do i owe the honour quar we have never really got on have we no sir my apologies for that sir i have always hoped accepted anyway i thought that we might enter into a new phase in our professional relationship and to that end i believe i need to divulge to you something of our plans regarding the culture ship hylozoist sir this is an honour sir im sure the thing is the hylozoist has just been informed that there are unauthorised ships being constructed in the fabricaria of the disk i had no idea sir i know you didnt quar that was deliberate sir it doesnt matter ill be blunt quar we need to take action against the culture ship disable it at the very least if not actually destroy it sir you mean attack it as ever your perspicacity and tactical awareness astonishes me quar yes i mean attack it a culture ship sir are we sure we are perfectly sure quar quar swallowed gulped sir he said sitting even more upright in his seat i and the other officers aboard the fractious person are at your disposal sir however i understood the culture ship was most lately returned to the vicinity of the disk initial contact facility it still is quar we have succeeded in detaining it there with administrational drivel until now but it is about to depart again and it is as it departs that we intend to attack it sir as i say sir i and the other officers aboard the fractious person are at your disposal however we are as im sure sir is aware stationed with our sister ship the rubric of ruin on the far side of the disk from the facility it will take of course im aware of that quar unlike you i am not a complete idiot and i might inform you there is another of our ships in your vicinity standing some distance off just beyond your scanner range there is sir there is quar but i thought i was aware of our full fleet disposition sir i know but there are two gfcf fleets here quar and the ship near you that you didnt know about is part of the hidden one our war fleet our war fleet quar repeated our war fleet and when we attack the culture ship we need to make it look as though somebody else attacked it not us and one of the best ways of making that appear plausible is to have one of our own ships attacked indeed preferably completely destroyed at the same time you see war means sacrifice sometimes quar thats just the way it is im afraid we need to destroy one of our own ships we do sir we do quar the the rubric of ruin sir no not the rubric of ruin quar but close sir goodbye quar this pleases me much more than it will hurt you legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii unclasped his hands and brought one dainty exquisitely manicured finger down onto the winking commit key administratorcaptain quarquoachali was very briefly aware of an extremely bright light shining from all around him and a sensation of great warmth the broad sleek aircraft dived sideslipped one way then the other before roaring over a broad shallow river making animals on the river bank and fish in the shallows between the gravel beds all scatter the flier settled into a groundhugging lowaltitude cruise only metres above the tops of the trees on the trackway which stretched all the ninety kilometres from here the borders of the espersium estate to the great torusshaped mansion house at its centre the trackway cast a long thick shadow over the rolling pasture land to one side and the treetops were lit by a ruddy sun rising through layers of misty cloud above the horizon veppers sat in one of the hunting seats in the back of the craft looking out through the invisible barrier at the late autumn sunrise some high towers in ubruater were reflecting the first direct light of the day winking pinkly he looked at the laser rifle which was lying switched on but still stowed in front of him he was alone in the shooting gallery he didnt want anybody else around him right now even jasken was inside with the rest of the entourage in the main passenger compartment some large bird was startled out of the canopy beneath in a chaos of twigs and feathers and veppers went to grasp the laser rifle on its stand then just let his hand drop again as the bird flapped frantically away it was a bad sign he knew when he lost his appetite for hunting well shooting you could hardly dignify it with the term hunting it was an affectation he felt now using a lowflying aircraft to throw up birds to shoot at still it had been a useful affectation hed needed this excuse hed needed the trackways to be there he felt heavy as the flier zoomed to follow the slope of a hill all about to end now still hed always known it might have to end one day he watched the landscape unwind behind the aircraft and felt it too experiencing something close to weightlessness as the flier crested the hill and then followed the downslope then he was heavy again as they levelled out the hill had hidden any sight of ubruater and the sunrise had been removed by a ridge to the east veppers felt tired unsettled maybe he just needed a fuck he remembered sapultrides girl crederre straddling him bucking enthusiastically up and down in this very seat only what ten or eleven days earlier pleur maybe or one of the other girls or just get a couple of them to fuck each other in front of him that could be oddly calming but he felt somehow impatient with the whole idea of sex right now that was a bad sign too maybe just a massage he could call herrit through get him to pummel and smooth his tensions and worries away except he knew that wouldnt work either he thought about consulting scefron his substance use mediator no not drugs either holy fuck he really was out of sorts today was there nothing nothing except all this being over he guessed this was nerves he was the richest most powerful man in the entire fucking civilisation way more monied and influential than anybody had ever been ever by orders of magnitude but he was still suffering from nerves because what he was involved in now might make him much much wealthier and more powerful than even he had ever been or just possibly finish him kill him pauperise him disgrace him he had always been like this before a big deal when things were reaching a point of culmination been a while though this was crazy what was he doing risking everything you never risked everything you risked as little as possible you sold the idea of risking everything to the sort of idiot who thought that was how you got rich but you kept your own risks to an absolute minimum that way if you did make a mistake and everybody made mistakes or they werent really trying it didnt finish you let others ruin themselves there were always rich pickings in the wreckage but dont ever risk too much yourself except now he was well he sort of had before he supposed the space mirror deal hed gone into along with grautze could have bankrupted him and the whole family if it had unravelled at the wrong time that was why hed had to set grautze up so that if it did go badly grautze and his family would catch the blame and the shame not he and his originally he hadnt even meant for grautze to suffer if it did go well but then hed realised that the same mechanisms hed set up to protect himself if it went sour could equally easily double his payoff if all went according to plan so that he would come out of it with all the money all the shares all the companies and instruments and power it had just been too good a trick to resist grautze should have seen it but he hadnt too trusting too gullible too blinded by loyalties he thought were shared or at least mutual mug poor fuckers daughter had been more properly ruthless than her father had been veppers stroked his nose the tip was almost grown back now though it was still a little thin and redlooking and tender to the touch he could still feel the little bitchs teeth closing round it biting it made him shiver he hadnt been back to the opera house since hed need to get back appear fully in public again before it became some sort of ridiculous phobia as soon as his nose was fully healed the deal would complete all would go well and hed end up with even more than he already had because he was who he was a winner the fucking winner it had always worked out in the past it would work out this time okay so the war fleet had been discovered a few days early that wasnt such a disaster and hed been right still to stall he hadnt told bettlescroys message boy where to attack yet and he wouldnt not until the ships were genuinely ready to go and they would be ready they were too close to completion for anybody to stop them now the culture mission in the disk was being dealt with and apparently even the incoming culture warship could be taken on and neutralised he just hoped the gfcf knew what the fuck they were doing but then they probably felt the same way about him so dont worry dont panic and just keep your fucking head get everything ready at this end and have the courage to see it through to the end no matter what the cost cost didnt matter if you could afford it and the reward was going to be inestimably greater he reached up switched the laser rifle off and sat back no he didnt want to hunt or fuck or get stoned or anything else really he supposed he just wanted to be back at the house well he could do something about that he clicked a seat control sir the pilot said never mind terrainhugging he told her just get us there as fast as you can sir the aircraft started to rise immediately pulling up from the trackway beneath he felt heavy again for a moment but then the ride started to smooth out the flash came first he saw it light up the landscape underneath the aircraft and wondered momentarily if some coincidence of a gap in the clouds and a gap in the ridge to the east was letting a single strong beam of sunlight through to shine so brightly on the trees and low hills beneath the light seemed to blink then get brighter and brighter all in less than a second radiation aler a synthesised voice started to say radiation what was the aircraft bucked like a dinghy thrown by a tsunami veppers was crushed down into his seat so hard he felt and heard himself make a sort of involuntary grunting groaning noise as the air was forced out of his compressing lungs the view wildly insanely bright started to spin like emptied buckets of fluorescent paint swirling round a plug hole a titanic bang resounded seeming to come from somewhere inside his head he glimpsed clouded sky the clouds undersurfaces garishly lit from below then distant toobrightly shining hills and forests then just for an instant a vast boiling cloud of fire and smoke rising on a thick dark stem above a mass of darkness shot through with flame he heard what might have been screams and tearing cracking buckling noises the view through the ultraclear glass suddenly hazed all at once as though a thinveined white mesh had been hurled across the material he felt weightless again and then seemed to be about to be thrown against the ceiling or into the crazed ultraclear but the seat seemed to hold onto him a roaring noise threw a deep red haze across his eyes and he blacked out yime nsokyi took her first few unaided steps even dressed in loosefitting fatigues she felt oddly naked without the supporting net of foam shed been swaddled in for the last couple of days the bones in her legs felt delicate and a little achey it hurt to take a deep breath and her spine felt oddly inflexible only her arms felt pretty much like normal though the muscles were weak shed instructed her body to hold back on all the paincancelling mechanisms to feel how bad things really were not too bad was the answer she should be able to get through without any more antipain secretions walking at her side as she padded up and down the gently lit lounge inside the me im counting one arm extended to cup one of her elbows was himerance the ships avatar a tall thin creature with a very deep voice and a quite hairless head you dont have to do this she told him i disagree he said i feel i do this is at least partly my responsibility ill do what i can to make amends the me im counting had been the nearest ship to the bodhisattva when it had been attacked by the unfallen bulbitian coasting in towards the entity for the semiregular pickup and setdown of those going to and coming from the forgotten gsv total internal reflection it had been coincidence that it rather than one of the other ships associated with the gsv had been allocated the role of shuttle bus this time three other craft shared the rota on this occasion with nobody to drop off the ship had been coming in only to pick up when the distress call and plume event had signalled there was a vessel in distress nearby it had diverted to investigate and offer help do you still have the image of lededje ybreq yime had asked the ship as soon as shed been able to the ship had replaced the pebblesmooth drone with himerance a humanoid avatar it had been storing unused for over a decade shed half expected dust to float from himerances head when hed nodded yes hed told her in image form only may i see it the avatar had frowned i did promise not to share her full image with anybody else without her express permission hed told her id prefer to keep to that promise unless there is some circumstance that is so operationally urgent i felt compelled to break it do you especially need to see it there are plenty of highquality images of ms ybreq available from sichultian media and other easily accessible sources would you like to see some of them shed smiled no need ive seen them i was just curious i appreciate that you want to keep your word why are you interested in her the ship had asked yime had stared at it but of course it would have known nothing of what had happened to lededje servant acolyte to a dedicatedly hermitlike gsv one of the forgotten naturally it would be out of any loop that would include detailed knowledge of events in sichult the bodhisattva hasnt briefed you immediately after i rescued it it asked me to make all speed towards the sichultian enablement which i am doing though with reservations given the situation that appears to be developing there the bodhisattva then said that you might provide the reason for all this alacrity the avatar had smiled i seem to have such a reputation for eccentricity the ship thinks i am more likely to accede to a request from a human than i am to one emanating from a fellow ship i have no idea why shed explained that lededje had been murdered by joiler veppers and then revented aboard the sense amid madness wit amidst folly before being spirited away by the abominatorclass ship falling outside the normal moral constraints it was assumed she was making her way back to sichult quite possibly with thoughts of revenge and murder it was you who put the lace inside her wasnt it yime had asked himerance had been looking bemused yes the avatar had said yes that was me hed shrugged she said to surprise her and i couldnt think of anything else that would materially improve her life that was within my gift i had no idea it would lead to events of such moment i assume mr veppers still holds the position of great power he did before even greater power shed explained about the tsungarial disk and the coming culmination of the confliction over the hells now stricken with a feeling of responsibility for all this the me im counting had decided to complete the mission yime and the bodhisattva had undertaken it would take her wherever she wanted to go in pursuit of lededje ybreq the mind of the bodhisattva would come too as a part of the me im counting rather than waste time trying to rendezvous with another ship the two minds had determined to salvage all they could from the wreck of the bodhisattva and junk the rest the boxy shipdrone from the bodhisattva floated by yimes other elbow ready to help if she wobbled in its direction in the circumstances and at the moment the drone said it is anyway preferable to be contemplating an incursion into the sichultian enablement within a warship rather than a humble general contact unit it came forward a little and dipped as though peeking round yime to the humanoid avatar our friend here will have the undying gratitude of the quietus section for its action dont exalt me overmuch the avatar rumbled i am still a warship after a fashion but an old and avowedly eccentric one compared to the thing ms ybreq seemingly finds herself on i am small beer indeed ah yes the picket ship yime said it must be nearly there by now very nearly himerance told her hours out from enablement space and the tsungarial disk if thats where its headed just in time for the smatter outbreak the ships drone said that is almost too convenient i do hope we had nothing to do with that we being the culture restoria or sc yime asked wobbling a little as she reached the limit of the lounge area and turned avatar and drone both helped steady her good question the drone said it seemed content to judge the question without hazarding an answer and what about the bulbitian she asked the drone said nothing after a moment the avatar said a fast picket the no one knows what the dead think paid a call on the bulbitian some eight hours ago respectfully asking for an explanation for what happened to the bodhisattva and yourself the bulbitian denied all knowledge not only of any attack on you but also of your visit worryingly it also denies that there ever was a culture restoria or numina mission aboard it in fact it claims to have been completely without any alien visitors for as long as it can remember the fast picket begged to differ and requested leave to contact the culture personnel it knew had been on the bulbitian as recently as a couple of days earlier when that was refused it asked to be allowed to send a representative aboard to check that too was rejected no signals had emanated from the bulbitian since very shortly after the attack on the bodhisattva and no signals from the fast picket elicited any response at all theyre all going to be dead yime thought i know it i brought death to them the no one knows what the dead think then departed the bulbitians atmospheric envelope himerance continued but left behind a small highstealth droneship which attempted to access the bulbitian directly without permission using smaller drones knife and scout missiles edust and so on all were destroyed an attempt by the fast picket to displace sensory apparatus directly into the bulbitian met with no more success and resulted in an attack on the fast picket by the bulbitian forewarned and having been a warship the gou obliterating angel in its earlier incarnation more martially capable than the bodhisattva the fast picket was undamaged by the bulbitians attack and retired to a safe distance to keep watch on the entity and await the arrival of the equatorclass gsv pelagian which is five days away a continent class with sc links is also strongly believed to be en route though its keeping its arrival time quiet other speciescivs who had personnel aboard the bulbitian also report no contact or sign of their people and like us suspect that the entity has killed them yime stopped looked at himerance then at the skeletal assembly of components which was the bodhisattvas drone and with the vessels mind one of the few bits of the ship it had been worthwhile salvaging from the neartotal wreck so theyre all dead she asked her voice hollow she thought of the elegantly elderly ms fal dvelner and the terribly earnest multiplyreincarnated mr nopri very likely the drone told her im sorry was that us yime asked starting to walk again going hesitantly forward did we cause that she stopped did i cause that she shook her head there was something she said some issue some i antagonised it somehow something i said or did she knocked one set of knuckles on her temple gently what the hell was it possibly we bear some collective technical responsibility the drone said though frankly triggering an act of homicidal instability in a bulbitian is hardly proof by itself of any culpability still we are certainly attracting the blame from those alreadymentioned other species and civs who had people on the bulbitian that the entity itself is entirely to blame for an unprovoked attack and that we were its first victims and very nearly its first fatalities seems to matter little compared to the ease with which we may be blamed oh grief yime said sighing theres going to be an inquiry isnt there many probably the drone said sounding resigned before we start thinking ahead to the aftermath himerance said after clearing his throat we might do well to contemplate our immediate course ms ybreq is still our focus the bodhisattvas drone said the point may rapidly be approaching when the input or decisions of one person stops making much difference but for the moment we might hope to influence events through her if we can find her and of course himerance said mr veppers inputs and decisions almost certainly do matter considerably so do ms ybreqs yime said turning at the far end of the lounge to head back the way she had come there was no unsteadiness this time if she gets near him with a clear shot or whatever the latest we have from sichult places veppers in a place called iobe cavern city on the planet vebezua in the chunzunzan whirl the drone said there then himerance said then hesitated an expression of surprise crossed his face the culture restoria mission dealing with the smatter outbreak just discovered more ships being built within the tsungarial disk he said how many more yime asked it was the bodhisattvas drone which answered one in every fabricaria theyve looked in so far it told her yime stopped how many have they looked in she asked looking from the drone to the avatar about seventy so far himerance said as highly spread as they could manage too the drone said good representative sample doesnt that mean yime began could be all of them are making ships the drone said all of them yime felt her eyes widening certainly a very high proportion of the three hundred million fabricaria the drone said in the name of grief yime cried what do you do with three hundred million ships you could certainly start a war the drone said with that many ships himerance said you might end it too nevertheless the drone said we had best get there time to hit sprint himerance said then he nodded at the wall screen at the far end of the lounge as it lit up showing the batteredlooking remains of the bodhisattva floating within the me im countings field envelope the crippled wrecked ship didnt look that badly damaged from where they were looking a little scratched grazed crumpled and dented perhaps the most serious damage was internal last drone teams ready to clear himerance announced suggest we forget about that anterior remote stressor agreed said the drone the little machine hung very still and steady in the air giving every impression of staring at the wreck of its ship on the screen well i think you should give the command himerance said of course the little drone said the hazily shining wall of the field enclosure approached the stricken ship moved smoothly over it and left it outside exposed to the distant stars the view switched to beyond the field enclosure to where the lifeless body of the bodhisattva floated naked without any fields or shields about it at all it was drawing slowly away falling behind oh well the drone said the bodhisattva convulsed almost as though shaking itself awake after a long asleep then started to come slowly apart as though it was an exploded diagram made real a spherical mirror field appeared all about it for an instant then when it dropped the ship was ablaze light flaring from every part of it burning brighter and brighter as they watched flameless orderly still nonexplosive but searing in its intensity the pure fires raged until gradually they started to fade and go out and when they had entirely gone there was nothing left of the ship at all save lightslow radiation flowing out in every direction towards the distant suns there the bodhisattvas drone said turning to yime and the avatar full speed ahead i think himerance nodded the stars on the screen started to drift away fields at nakedhull minimum he said going to a velocity which will be tractioninjurious within about forty hours when do we get there yime asked eighteen hours himerance said the avatar stared at the screen the view had swung to dead ahead id better check my manual files see if i remember how to work as a functioning warship probably all sorts of stuff i need to do prepping shields calibrating effectors manufacturing warheads that sort of thing anything i can yime began to say then realised how absurd this would sound to a ship sorry never mind she said flapping one hand which hurt a little the avatar just smiled at her he woke to a sort of busy quietness there was a ringing noise somewhere and some distinctly annoying beeping and something else he couldnt immediately identify but it all felt terribly muffled like it was happening somewhere down the other end of a very long tunnel and he really neednt be concerned about it he kept his eyes open and looked around but nothing made sense he closed his eyes again then thought that was probably a bad idea something bad had happened and it might not have stopped happening yet he needed to keep alert keep his eyes open keep focused he felt heavy in a strange way as though his weight was being taken by his head and neck and shoulders he turned his head to one side then the other fuck he knew where he was he was in the back of the flier all this dark tipped chaos around him was the remains of the aircraft what the fuck had happened he was lying in the seat hed been in when whatever had happened had happened he wanted to shake his head to clear it but wasnt sure that was a good idea he brought one hand up to his face wiping sticky he looked at his hand that was blood he was breathing heavily his feet were up in the air pointing towards the sky which he could see through the contorted remains of the fliers rear deck where the ultraclear glass should be there appeared to be nothing stuff was falling out of the clouddark sky and landing on him landing all about him black and grey soot and ash he remembered the fireball hed glimpsed had that been a nuke had some fucker tried to nuke him had some motherfucker tried to nuke him in his own plane on his own fucking estate motherfucker he said his voice sounding heavy and slurred and far away he didnt seem to be badly injured nothing broken he glanced behind him that did hurt as though hed been bruised then pushed himself back down the seat head first grabbing onto the support for the laser rifle still on little telltale lights blinking to stop himself from falling backwards against the bulkhead which was now tipped so that it was nearer to being a floor than a wall he got himself standing upright and stood there swaying brushing the dirt and bits of glass and smears of blood off his clothes what a state he looked at the soot and ash still falling down around him through the space where the ultraclear had been hed have to climb if he was going to get out that way he brushed some of the ash and soot out of his hair fucking radioactive shit hed bet when he found whod been responsible hed have them fucking skinned alive while he hosed them with saline solution he wondered who to suspect had there been anybody meant to come on this flight whod called off at the last moment he couldnt think of anybody all present his whole entourage all his people he looked along to the door into the rest of the flier then reached up and struggled to detach the laser rifle from its stand eventually giving up felt like the flier was nose down into the ground that meant the pilots were probably dead he wondered how many of those in the main passenger compartment were still alive if any he pulled at the door more of a trapdoor now but it wouldnt open he had to get down on his knees and use both hands to pull it open cutting one of his fingers on a bit of torn metal as he did so he sucked the blooded finger licked it like a fucking animal he thought like a fucking animal skinning alive would be too good for whoever had done this hed want to think of something worse there were probably experts you could consult he lowered himself into the darkness beneath the protesting creaking door whats happening to my eyes it came out as a cry like a yelp not the calm question shed intended her eyes were getting sore feeling pressured suits getting ready to foam inside your visor the ship told her crisply gas pressure first so the foam wont come as a shock dont want detached retinas do you as ever thanks for the warning as ever apologies not big on warnings grief its so complicated keeping you humans undamaged whats happening now the suit will be using its neural inductor to set up screening images straight into your brain you may get double vision while your eyes are still working and its calibrating i meant outside with the other ship its mulling over my last communication which was basically stop following me or ill treat you as hostile reconfigured a touch to a more defensive posture i gave it half a minute to make its mind up probably too generous its one of my failings uhhuh lededje watched the eightlimbed snowflake shape unsure now whether she was seeing it with her eyes projected inside the suits helmet or somehow purely with her visual centre lensed in there directly by the suit the image shimmered again what see the ship said too long didnt even take the full halfminute what did it do fucker tried putting a shot across my bows is what it did told me to heave to and prepare for boarding in what you might call classical terms says it suspects me of being part of some swarm outbreak which is amusing if deeply implausible marks for originality the ship sounded amused also hitting me with a comms enclosure cutting me off from outside contact thats not neighbourly at all plus means its either very big and capable or its not working alone and there are at least another three ships in the vicinity i could find them plus i could just punch through it but both would mean id have to drop the liloldme torturer disguise the ship made a sighing noise going to have to foam you up lass close your eyes she closed her eyes felt the pressure and temperature on her eyelids change subtly she tried tentatively to open her eyes again but they felt glued shut disorientingly the view she had of space around the ship didnt seem to change at all i she began now your mouth what your mouth how can i talk to you if i close my mouth youre not closing it initially youre opening it so another sort of foam can get in there coats your throat in carbon fibre to stop it closing up under high acceleration then you close it the buttress foam fills your mouth and another load of foam does something similar with your nose you can still breathe normally but youre right you cant talk you just have to think the words subvocalising with your throat should help mouth open please i am not happy with this this is all very invasive you can understand that with my history im troubled by this again apologies we can always not do this but then we cant manoeuvre with the alacrity we might need to keep both you and me alive potentially this means death or discomfort death or trauma or i ditch you in the module and do it she said almost shouting i can always get counselling she muttered warm foam slid into her mouth she felt it or something somewhere numbing her mouth and throat she didnt gag didnt feel exactly where the foam went well done the ship sent now bite down lededje no rush our pursuers are giving us a countdown to compliance but theres ample time hmm finally some ident gfcf theres a surprise she bit down into the warm foam something started to tickle her nose then that sensation faded too right the ship announced breezily its voice inside her head thats you as ready as youre ever going be try sending instead of saying howowow ig diss oh fshuck how is this youre overdoing the subvocalising just do it dont think about doing it okay hows this perfect see easy now we can start behaving like a proper warship oh great itll be fine whats happening she was watching the screenlike images change the black snowflake had flicked to one side then swung slowly back to centrerear then it had flicked in the other direction before swinging back again so far she hadnt felt anything if the ship was manoeuvring hard it was preventing any trace of the accelerations affecting her physically it all felt perfectly smooth so far she suspected this was a deceptive sensation im shaking my humbletorturerclasspretending behind at them the ship told her bit more energetically than an originalspec ship could but thats still plausible most of those old ships have upgraded significantly looking like im trying to shake them off spooling up burst units for a series of breakangle turns lededje felt herself clenching without being entirely aware what she was clenching the image of the black snowflake disappeared then she saw it way off to one side it started to slide slowly back towards where it had been it flickered disappeared to another part of her field of view she still couldnt feel anything another flicksuddenlysomewhereelse motion then another she was losing the black snowflake for seconds at a time between flicks how we doing she asked successfully giving the appearance of getting desperate the ship told her really trying everything to get them off our tail apparently without result of course spooling bursters for a single maxtozero draining event and preparing to execute a whip flare with main traction means a little engine degradation but its allowable if it might get you out of a tight spot and at the moment it looks like our best shot or at least it looks like it looks like our best shot haw haw should i be reassured that you seem to be enjoying this so much absofuckinglutely watch this the black snowflake with too many limbs disappeared entirely she cast her gaze about trying to find it whered the fucker go she found herself muttering its here the ships voice told her a portion of space which she was aware was almost directly behind her and yet somehow just at the periphery of her oddly lensed vision lit up with a green circle and zoomed in to show the snowflake again much smaller and getting smaller still sorry she sent didnt mean to distract you you wont the ship sent im talking through the suit at the moment all ships own main processing powers going to manoeuvrage tactical simming and field management not to mention keeping up appearances of course subroutine here distraction impossible ask whatever you want the green circle faded as the black snowflake started to get bigger again and slide across the visual field still heading for centrerear that doesnt look so good got the fucker the ship said got it youve been firing at it ha no got it identified its a deepest regrets class probably the abundance of onslaught thought to be in this neck of the woods if not exactly hereabouts thats interesting all by itself why would that just happen to be hanging round here can you beat it she asked the black snowflake was still enlarging sliding round to centre back to backwards she supposed oh yes the ship sounded blas√© i most severely outgun outarmour and can outrun the fucker does raise the question though how many of its little friends has it brought deepest regretsers are prideofthefleet ultimate asset notmanyofthosetothehandful grade craft for the gfcf wont be here by itself kind of hints at a maternally fornicating war fleet whatre these shitkickers up to what did they know about what about the smatter outbreak and this new shipbuilding enthusiasm some bits of the disk have discovered the ship replied main local news recently wouldnt you say i suppose ah torturerclassplausible track scanner on seemingly random search finds other ship shock the ship announced bugger me theres a screen of the little fuckers they keep peeling off warcraft like this im going to have a fair fight on my hands last thing we fucking want are we in danger mhm marginally i wont pretend the ship told her theres a multiplicatory implication about the presence of a serious capital ship like a deepest regretser and about the way theyve been able to contain even something as venerable as a torturer class ancient tub but still a serious piece of ordnance for the gfcf to go up against in the normal course of events whatever the fuck is going on here this aint daytoday behaviour this sims as peaking fulcruming stuff are those swear words i dont know about sort of means somebody here might be on a riskingeverything approach that would alter the rules a bit in a good way what do you think i suspect in a bad way well done what now time to stop fucking about youre going to attack eh no you really are bloodthirsty arent you no we get you out of danger by letting slip part of the humbletorturerclass disguise and just powering away from them until they cant see what im doing then i can set you off in the shuttle actually maybe not in the shuttle maybe in one of my component shiplets given the trashing potential that seems to be floating around here at the moment you head for sichult to have words with mr veppers i stick around here to knock some sense into the gfcf hopefully only metaphorically and then get stuck into the smatter outbreak on whatever fucking scale that particular complication happens to be manifesting lately sure you can afford this shiplet yes i oh hello theyre hailing again saying heaveto or blahblahblah anyway she watched the image around her flickswivel then all the stars seemed to change colour blazing blue ahead red behind off and run the ship started to tell her then everything went dark dark she thought dark she had time to send ship before the ships voice said sorry about that the view clicked back on this time there were lots of additions within the image dozens of tiny sharp green shapes with numbers floating just in front of them and with garish coloured lines trailing after them and in different colours pointing in front of them concentric circles of varying pastel shades noded with symbols meaningless to her seemed to target each of the tiny green shapes which were rapidly accruing accompanying floating icons like stacks of cards looking at one made it blossom into nested pages of information showing as text diagrams and multidimensional moving images that made her eyes hurt she looked away took in the general view instead a thousand tiny gaudy glowflies loose in a pitchblack cathedral what happened she asked enemy action seems the fuckers want a shooting war the ship told her that hit would have smeared a real torturer class motherfuckers time for me to reply in kind sweetheart i must prepare to smite sorry but this may smart what bodyslap they call it healthy means youre still alive and im still functioning dont worry theres a subroutine monitoring your nervous system it can depain you if it starts to get really sore come on lets get on with it timesawasting just say youre ready fucking hell all right im ready like i then her entire body seemed to be hit as though every part of it had been slapped at the same time it seemed to come from one side her right but it felt like it hit every part of her it wasnt especially sore it had been too distributed but it certainly got ones attention how we doing the ship asked as another tremendous shock registered throughout lededjes body this time from her left we are doing fine thats my girl ill she started to say now hold on to your hat another titanic slap everywhere through her body she seemed to drift away then came to feeling woozy she gazed about at all the hundreds of pretty little symbols floating around her haloed with pastel colours still with us think so she sent i think my lungs are hurting is that even possible no idea anyway only calibrating shouldnt get any worse than that did they hit us hell no that was just us getting us out from under their track scanners theyve lost us now poor fuckers no idea where we are oh which means whats about to happen to them will seem to come out of nowhere watch as they say this instantly she was tipped and thrown sucked tumbling into the view as though the whole weight of the ship had grabbed her by the eyeballs pulled and hurled her into the frenzied welter of impossible colours staggering speed and infinite detail that was its riotously ungraspable sensorium she felt assaulted might have screamed if it hadnt felt the breath had just been smacked out of her immediately thankfully the whole bewildering complexity of it was reduced pared and focused as though just for her the view rushed in on one of the little green symbols and the concentric rings around it whizzed flicking this way and that symbols flickering and changing too fast to make sense of then two rings flashed and changed places the one that became the innermost ring seemed to start to flash again but this time blazed she felt her eyes trying to close up virtual eyelids shutting the flare faded left tiny granules of green where there had been a complicated shape before it had all taken less than a second she tried to watch the little spray of green bits spread but then the view whirled her away before throwing her back down again straight at another tiny green shape the rings around it snapped into a new configuration blazed it disappeared in a haze of green too she was hauled away from the contemplation of what she was starting to understand represented missiles or shells or something getting wasted each time there was no apparent moment of stillness she was jerked back from one closeup only to be flung straight back down into the next one the starscape she was in the middle of wheeling madly with each new target after about the fifth or sixth zoomflickflare event a dispersing cloud of even tinier green particles so small she was amazed she could see them and knew that with her own eyes looking at a screen she wouldnt have started crawling away from some of the little jagged green shapes they too had leading and trailing lines and were accompanied by neatly sorted banners of figures illustrations and descriptions the lines flickered hazed came steady thickening as they turned light then dark but shining blue vectors she thought quite suddenly as she was hurled towards one of the larger green shapes close enough to see that it was a ship these were ships the falling outside the normal moral constraints had been targeting and destroying not missiles the even tinier green shapes were the missiles the concentric haloes surrounding each target represented weaponchoice haloes appeared around each of the missiles like hundreds upon hundreds of tiny necklaces of beaded light they flashed all at once and when the haloes disappeared there wasnt even wreckage left behind the view pulled back a fraction the green ship shape seemed to hesitate frozen as the haloes surrounding it flicked settled flared she felt a sudden urge to look away but it was only to the next target snapped out and then back in to watch another ship freeze in the ships targeting headlights then another then another and another then two at once that felt like her brain was having its hemispheres ripped apart fucking hell she heard herself say you enjoying it the ship asked my favourite bits coming up in a moment what do you mean your favourite bit she asked it as the next hapless ship appeared transfixed in the concentric targeting weaponchoice circles ha you didnt think this is happening in real time did you the ship sounded amused this is a recording she said nearly wailed as the tiny green ship blazed and turned to what looked like minutely shredded windblown grassdust instantly the view flicked back before throwing her down again somewhere else her view wobbling to focus on another petrified target slowmotion replay the ship told her pay attention led this green target looked bigger and more complicated than the others the rings around it were larger fatter and brighter though less numerous the ship seemed to start to change taking on the appearance of the black overlimbed snowflake again then bits of it detached started to float away while each of them blossomed with rosettes of green haze altogether it filled her zoomedin field of vision dazzling at this point they still think im hitting them too late the ship murmured a violet halo she hadnt been aware of zeroed in on the central contact the halo flashed when it faded the ship was still there but it had turned violet itself now then tiny violet rings appeared around the floatingaway bits and each microscopic part of the hazy stuff so small that the green haze disappeared to be replaced with a slightly dimmer violet one everything flashed apart from the central target the earlier haze had gone the pulverised remains of the specks that had been floating away formed the haze now flashing violet and light green and dissipating filling her field of vision sumptuous scintillating in some ways it was the most beautiful firework display she had ever seen it began to end as the violet ship in the centre of the view grew in brightness going from a distinct but unshowy glow to a skysplitting glare in a few seconds much slower than anything else had reacted when it faded there was more violetlime green flashing debris scattered everywhere all slowly spreading fading going dull and disappearing leaving just the stars to be seen once more calm faint tiny far away and unchanging after the shattering psychotic tumult of flickering images that had kept her rapt shocked transfixed till now she felt herself let out a deep breath then bizarrely even shockingly demeisen was there in front of her lounging in what looked like the control seat next to hers but somehow straight in front of her against the star field he was gently lit from above his feet up on something invisible and his hands clasped behind his neck he turned to look at her nodding once there you go he said youve just seen one of the most significant military engagements of modern times doll lamentably but fascinatingly onesided though it turned out to be strongly suspect they just werent giving their ship minds full tactical authority demeisen shook his head frowned amateurs he shrugged oh well hopefully not the start of an actual proper allout war between the culture and our overcute tribute civ perish that thoughtlet but they did shoot first and it was with what they assumed would be full lethal force so i was entirely within my rights to waste the miserable triggerhappy fuckers to a soul without mercy he sighed though i am obviously anticipating the inevitable board of inquiry and i do slightly worry about being ticked off for being just a tad overenthusiastic he sighed again sounding happier this time still abominator class we have a reputation to protect fuck me the others are going to be so jealous he paused what were there people in those ships she asked gfcf navy definitely very quick deaths even given that they would have been wired in and speeded up if i may just leap in front of any nascent and entirely vicarious moral qualms you may be about to suffer from tiny human military personnel babe put themselves in harms way when they signed up just that the poor fuckers didnt know it was my harm they were putting themselves in the way of thats war doll fairness comes excluded the doubly unreal vision of the avatar floating in space looked away as though gazing contentedly round at the almost unseeably small debris floating around him thatll fucking learn the bastards lededje waited a short while but he kept on looking about him sighing happily and seemingly either ignoring or having forgotten all about her fuck me she heard him say quietly i just blighted an entire fucking fleet there without even stretching a limb squadron at the very least fuhzuckelling hellcocks im good i think id like to get back to sichult now if thats all right she told the avatar of course demeisen said turning to her with a neutral expression theres that man you want to kill isnt there veppers had to slide slowly down the carpeted floor of the corridor beyond the door it was too steep to try to walk down the first thing he found was jasken attempting to climb up towards him pushing open another dented door behind jasken there was dim light and the sound of crying and moaning a breeze rolled up the tipped corridor from behind jasken sir are you all right jasken said when he recognised veppers in the gloom alive nothing broken i think some fucker tried to nuke me did you see that fucking fireball i think the pilots are dead sir cant get into the flight deck weve a door open to the outside there are some dead sir some injured too he waved the arm that had been in the fake cast i thought it might be time to discard is there any help on the way dont know yet sir theres a hardened comms set in the compartment somewhere the two zei left are checking the emergency storage two left veppers said staring at jasken there had been four of his clone guards aboard hadnt there or had they called off at the last moment two of the zei died in the crash sir jasken told him fuck veppers said well you could always grow more he supposed though it still took time to train them who else pleur sir and herrit astles got a broken leg sulbazghis unconscious they descended into the passenger compartment it was lit by emergency lighting and the daylight from outside coming through the small oval portholes and the opened emergency door the place smelled bad veppers thought moaning sounds and people crying thankfully it was hard to see too much he wanted to get out immediately sir one of the zei said approaching them over the tipped chaos of seats and spilled possessions he was holding a comms transceiver we are glad you are alive sir he said hed bled heavily from a wound on his head and his other arm hung oddly yes thank you veppers said as the zei handed the set to jasken thats all he nodded to the zei to go the big man bowed then turned and walked back awkwardly over the seats veppers brought his mouth close to jaskens ear as the other man checked the transceiver and activated it whatever turns up first even if its an ambulance flier you and i get on it alone he told jasken understand sir jasken said blinking make sure theres enough other craft to get everybody else off but we take the first thing that arrives just us understand yes sir and where are your oculenses we might need them theyre broken sir veppers shook his head some fucker wants me dead jasken lets let them think i am lets let them think they succeeded are we clear yes sir jasken shook his head as though trying to clear it should i tell the others to say that you were killed no theyre to say that im alive injured perfectly well traumatised missing in a coma more different stories the better point is i dont show i dont appear everybody will assume theyre all lying theyll think im dead possibly you too you and i are going to hide jasken dyou ever do that when you were a kid jasken hide i used to did it a lot i was great at it so were going to do that now were going to hide veppers patted the other man on the shoulder hardly noticing that he winced when he did so shares will go into a tailspin but that cant be helped he nodded at the transceiver make the call then find me a flight suit or something to use as a disguise twentyfive auppi unstril felt very hot now the cold would win eventually though it would be creeping in from all sides making its way towards her from the bliterators hull seeping its way inwards to where she lay at the crafts centre as the vessels heat leaked away radiating into space she would be the last bit to go completely cold she was the little pit the stone at the heart of the fruit well more its soft centre the mushy middle she would be hard in time though once shed frozen in the meantime she was dying maybe from suffocation maybe from overheating the last thing theyd heard from the hylozoist had been that it had been attacked disabled it had just departed the initial contact facility got barely ten kilometres away when it had been hit by some eqt energy weapon slicing in through some hitech field disruptor its engines were wrecked field generators shattered some personnel dead it had announced it was limping back towards the facility in what had sounded like a series of simultaneous attacks the gfcf comms had lit up with alarms telling of attacks on their vessels too one of their mdvs on the other side of the disk had been blown out of the skies and other ships damaged at least temporarily disabled auppi and the bliterator had been scanning one of the fabricaria trying to see if it was one of the shipbuilding ones when the attacks had started they were studiously ignoring a nearby smatter outbreak even though they were ideally placed to tackle it and it looked like a serious one that had felt wrong the bliterator hadnt been configured as a generalpurpose mini spacecraft it was a cobbledtogether attack ship very skilfully and even elegantly cobbled together but cobbled together nevertheless single minded no nonsense leaving its weapons on standby while a smatter outbreak raged only a few minutes flight away felt wrong wrong wrong but checking a proper sample of the fabricaria for illicit shipmaking activity was even auppi had to admit more important shed wanted to take the bliterator inside the rippedopen fabricary to get a still closer look at the ship theyd found by accident but they already had the readings to show it was a serious if relatively simple bit of kit and the consensus had been that it would be too dangerous to try to enter the fabricary the fab was still singlemindedly completing the ship hull holed or not and the maker machines were still whizzing back and forth on their network of lines and cables even if theyd all been still it would have taken some delicate manoeuvring for the bliterator to thread its way inside the thing with them still darting back and forth unpredictably it would be suicide so shed ignored the scarily fascinating weird new ship and ignored the fresh enticing smatter outbreak and taken on what theyd all agreed was the most important task choose a few fabs at random over a decent spread of the disk and take a look inside using the very limited solidsscanning abilities of their little improvised attack ships it had proved easier than theyd anticipated because all the fabs theyd looked at had the same hollowskin outer hulls where there should have been a thick crust of dense raw material there was a thin outer skin supported by a light girdernet then the hull proper then lots of activity with something big growing slowly at the centre a few of the tiny culture craft had even had time to choose a fourth random fab each and investigate those too before they were hit shed been looking at her own results yup looked like another ship getting built in there when shed heard amongst the chatter on the shared open channel they were all using the hylozoist ship voice ramped fast clipped compressed in full emergency mode announce it had suffered attack been disabled would have to limp back to the facility the chatter had subsided the channel had gone almost totally quiet then hubbub as people started saying things like what the fuck did it say is this a drill that cant be before clearly over them all she heard lanyares shout hey im getting then spreading silence sometimes preceded by a shout or exclamation from all of them whats shed had time to say then the bliterator had gone quiet around her warning effector att the ship had told her probably via some preloaded backup substrate the little ship had four other fallback layers of processing below the ai core but even those needed effectorvulnerable tech to communicate with her via her suit so when everything went dark and quiet and still it went really dark and quiet and still fast there was probably some life left in the ship even now at the atomechanical or biochemical level but if there was she and it couldnt communicate and her neural lace was offline too even that had been taken out in whatever effector event had wasted the bliterator the last from it had been its signoff signal its imfucked message what shed heard described as being like a tiny brittle wire breaking in the centre of your head which had proved a fairly accurate description shed experienced a faint flat halffelt halfheard ping somewhere between the ears just so you knew you were on your own now not much comfort there she wondered why theyd bothered to incorporate the lacewasted signal in the first place better to leave the poor sap with a dead lace in their head thinking everything was still somehow all hunkydory but no that would be a lie and this was the culture so you had to be told the truth no matter how un comfortable it was no matter how much it might contribute to feelings of despair some real purists even refused drug glands and the related painmanagement systems because those were somehow untruthful too weirdos so she was stuck in here imprisoned in the suit unable to move in the gel foam and anyway locked inside the miniscule extraequipmentstuffed flight deck within a ship that would probably need cutting equipment to enter the only excitement had been when shed felt a soft bump maybe a quarterhour after it had all gone quiet that had got her hopes up maybe somebody was coming to rescue her but it had probably just been the ship clunking into the side of the fab theyd been scanning when theyd been attacked bounced off most likely tumbling surely though at a guess very slowly because she couldnt feel any sense of being spun or rotated whats as last words went it was pretty shit she hadnt had a chance to say goodbye to lan or any of the others or the ship whats just hopeless very very hot now she had been keeping a watch on the time but now even that was getting hazy everything had been getting hazy senses sense of self sense of humour as the heat had built up in her body it seemed wrong unfair somehow she was surrounded by intense cold this far out in the system from the central star and the ship was dead or as good as no longer providing energy or heat and yet she was going to die of selfinflicted heatstroke if simple suffocation didnt kill her first too well insulated inside here the cold would freeze her solid eventually but that would take days tens of days maybe more meantime her bodys own internal processes the chemical stuff that made you human were going to cook her brain because there was nowhere for the heat to go fast enough now that the suit and ship were dead what a depressing way to die it had been hours she reckoned shed had a timecount that had been accurate to the minute until not long ago but then the brainscrambling heat had made her forget it and having dropped that strand she couldnt for the life of her pick it up again at some point she realised her dead body would be back to exactly normal blood heat as it cooled down again after its selfproduced temperature spike she wondered when that would happen a lot of heat in the ship and the double suit was a very good insulator it would take a while to radiate all that warmth away days sounded about right she had cried at one point she couldnt remember when fear and frustration and a sort of primal terror at being so utterly trapped unable to move the tears had collected around her eyes unable to go anywhere else in the dead closefitting suit if the suit had still been working it would have capillaried the tears away she was still breathing very shallowly because there was a purely mechanical link to a set of tiny fingerthin tanks on the suits back and a purely chemical set of reactions going on somewhere in the system that ought to keep her alive for tens of days the trouble was the suit held her too tightly for her to breathe properly her chest muscles couldnt expand her lungs sufficiently it had to be that way of course for the suit to do its job properly when everything had been working it had to clasp her tightly or shed run the risk of getting bruised and hurt when they accelerated hard she could feel her brain closing bits of her body down cutting off blood supplies keeping her oxygenated blood needs down to a minimum but it wasnt going to be enough shed start to lose parts of her brain soon cells dying suffocated she was glanding softnow every now and again to keep herself calm no point in panicking when it would do no use if she had to die she might as well do so with a little dignity thanks be for drug glands she hoped whoever had done this got seriously fucked up by the culture or the gfcf or somebody maybe it was immature to lust after revenge but fuck that let the fuckers die horribly well let them die shed compromise that far evil wins when it makes you behave like it and all that very very very hot now and getting woozy she wondered if it was oxygen starvation making her feel woozy or the heat or a bit of both feeling oddly numb hazy dissociated dying shed be revented she guessed in theory shed been backed up everything up to about six hours ago copied replicable but that meant nothing so another body vatgrown would wake with her memories up to that point six hours ago not including this bit obviously so what that wouldnt be her she was here dying the selfrealisation the consciousness that didnt transfer no soul to transmigrate just behaviour as patterned all you ever were was a little bit of the universe thinking to itself very specific this bit here right now all the rest was fantasy nothing was ever identical to anything else because it didnt share the same spacial coordinates nothing could be identical to anything else because you couldnt share the property of uniqueness blah blah she was drifting now remembering old lessons ancient school stuff whats pathetic last words she thought of lan her lover her love probably dying just like this just like her hundreds of thousands of klicks away in the suffocating heat surrounded by the cold dark silence she thought she might cry again instead she could feel her skin trying to sweat creating a prickling feeling all over her body pain management reduced it from extreme discomfort to mere sensation her whole body crying stickily image to bow out on thank you and good night you the fella i need to talk to im not sure who exactly is it you wish to talk to whoevers in charge round here that you i am legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii it is my privilege to command the gfcf forces in this volume and you im the passingforhuman face of the culture warship falling outside the normal moral constraints you are the torturerclass vessel we heard was inbound thank goodness we the gfcf and our allies the culture here in the tsungarial disk have come under heavy and sustained attack all reinforcements are most welcome and urgently needed that was me sort of i was just pretending to be a torturer class pretending im not sure i thing is short while ago somebody jumped me whole squadron of craft one capital ship fourteen others plus ancillary units and slaved weapon platforms had to off them all bettlescroy stared at the face of the humanlooking thing regarding him from the screen on the battlebridge of the vision of hope surpassed his flagship and one of the three deepest regretsclass craft under his command bettlescroy himself had given the order for the abundance of onslaught and its flotilla of accompanying vessels to open fire on the incoming torturerclass ship communication had been lost with all the craft during the engagement which had seemed to be going well at first but then had obviously deteriorated the ships had ceased communication so rapidly it seemed impossible that they had simply been destroyed so the assumption bettlescroy and his officers were working on was that some sort of comms blackout had taken place feverish attempts to contact the ships were taking place even as he spoke if that wasnt bad enough theyd lost touch with veppers back on sichult the last thing theyd heard minutes before this unwanted call had come in had been was an unconfirmed report of a large explosion taking place on veppers estate possibly on the route his aircraft would have taken back to his house bettlescroy had been trying to keep calm and not think about what that might imply now it looked like he had something else to keep calm and not think about off them all bettlescroy said carefully that couldnt possibly mean what he dreaded could it im sorry im not cognisant of that terms official weight as it were obviously we were aware there had been some sort of engagement a little way beyond the systems outer limit i was attacked without provocation the humanlooking thing on the screen said i retaliated by the time id finished retaliating fifteen ships were gone offed deleted blown to smithereens thing is they looked remarkably like gfcf ships in every way really the biggest and most capable presented as almost exactly like that one youre on a deepest regrets class unless im mistaken weird eh how do you account for that i confess i cannot no gfcf craft would ever knowingly attack a culture vessel bettlescroy could feel his guts churning and his face burning he was this close to cutting the comms to give himself time to think if nothing else had this thing just casually obliterated nearly a third of his war fleet was it trying to get him to confess something blurt something out enrage him with its offhand attitude bettlescroy was very aware of his officers on the bridge keeping extremely quiet he could feel their gazes on him the human on the screen was talking again excuse they had was something about deeming me to be a hostile just pretending to be a culture vessel it was still sinking in hed lost a deepest regretsclass ship dear gods of old the faction within the gfcf high command which had authorised this highrisk strategy had known they risked losing vessels and materiel but no one had so much as hinted they might lose one of their capital ships not a pride of the fleet not a deepest regrets class this whole thing would all have to go fabulously well from this point on if he was to be forgiven for that i see well indeed yes i see bettlescroy said stalling while he got himself under control of course i have to point out that as you have said you are or were pretending to be a torturer class so ah i get it you think that might have been the source of the misunderstanding well you can see how it might be sure so were they your ships or not bettlescroy wanted to weep to scream to fold himself into a little ball and never talk to anyone ever again the operational status of the fleet i was given to command here within the disk comprises one mediumlevel nonmilitary vessel and a screen of eighteen smaller ships the vessel which you find me on ah has just been delivered to us in recognition of the seriousness of the threat we are facing wow thats incredibly fast work congratulate your simmingplanningdispositioning people thank you more than that i am not at liberty to say i regret so what youre saying is you cant confirm or deny those were your ships the ones that attacked me effectively though if they were ours and they did attack you it could only have been a mistake fine just thought id check also to let you know im still on my way in currently braking hard due with you guys in the disk in twelve and a half minutes just wanted to keep you informed so there wouldnt be any more misunderstandings quite well yes of course and you are the falling outside the normal moral constraints like i said and definitely a culture ship thats the main thing feel free to check my provenance and references here to help one of your allies all in this together so understand things are a bit awkward in there happy to get stuck in alongside your good selves going to let me have an interface situational with your tactical substrates so i can get a head start on the task in hand ah yes of course relevant protocols agreeing obviously obviously but i meant your class if youre not a torturer picket ship glorified nightwatchman thats me picket ship picket ship picket ship yes i see well welcome aboard if i may make so bold cheers person with you in twelve minutes bettlescroy signed to cut the connection he turned to his security chief we are supposed to be presenting as the messenger of truth how the fuck could that thing tell were actually on a deepest regrets class i have no idea sir bettlescroy permitted himself a sigh through a tight jerky smile well that would appear to be our motto at the moment wouldnt it we seem to have no idea about anything the fleet coordination officer cleared his throat and said mdv nearest the projected engagement startpoint reports incoming weapon blink and battle light sir debris spectra so far indicating ours alone bettlescroy nodded silently he turned to the disk fabricaria control section of the bridge the lead officer sat at attention tell every second fabricaria to release its ship immediately random choice bettlescroy told him one half of the remainder to let their ship go within the next quarterhour to four hours again randomly and randomly in time as well within those parameters one half of the rest to release theirs between four and eight hours and so on until it doesnt matter any more do you understand sir most of them will be unprepared and may not even function at all i know nevertheless even if they have to be physically ejected by their particular fabricary do what i have said have as many as possible of the most functional equipped with donated am from the war fleet spare nothing our ships can operate on fusion for a while not us though not this ship sir bettlescroy turned to the bridge comms section and smiled coldly at the chief communications officer get me veppers if not veppers get me jasken i know theyre missing but just find them do whatever it takes the comms connection was cut and the image of the silkily beautiful legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii of the gfcf remained frozen before them demeisen turned to lededje what do you think hes not my species she protested how should i know yeah but you must have a feeling come on lededje shrugged lying through his perfect teeth demeisen nodded same here she got fed up trying to finish her meal on the ground surrounded by fawning keening worshippers she sighed roared at them a few backed off a little most stayed where they were then tearing off a haunch she lifted wearily into the foulsmelling air carrying the piece of leg as something to gnaw on somewhere else more private each wingbeat hurt her great dark wings seeming to creak it was midafternoon by the raw chronologies of hell and something like fresh light shone from grey overcast that for once looked tentative rather than dark and heavy it was as close to direct sunlight as the place ever got and the air though still smelling of sewage and burned flesh was relatively clear the crowd of worshippers was a wide messy torus now filling slowly in as the people came forward to gaze on the remains of the one she had killed possibly looking for clues regarding what might have attracted her to that lucky individual in the first place she had long since given up trying to tell them it was pointless she chose her victims her blessed at random she flew high until she felt physically hungry sometimes then just dropped spread her wings over the first person she found other times she went to some particular place shed seen before and noted and alighted there waiting for the first one to come to her she varied where she went and which time of day she chose to make her kills there was no particular pattern to it it just happened not entirely at random but not predictable so that one of these benighted wretches could arrange to collate information on where she struck and contrive to be in the right place at the right time still people had indeed made a religion of her and her daily killings as the king of the demons had envisaged and desired she had brought a little hope back into hell she thought about stopping sometimes but never did not for more than a day she had decided at the start that she would release one of these unfortunates from their pains each day and the few times she had tried to experiment by not killing once per day had left her racked with cramps gut pains that left her nauseous and barely able to fly that had only happened three times she still only got to release one soul on the following day the earlier days unused kill didnt seem to carry over any extra she killed were as ever resurrected often almost instantaneously coming shrieking back to life in their impossibly tornopen bodies miraculously repairing and reforming themselves before her eyes while their eyes filled with looks of uncomprehending betrayal the ones she truly killed departed with a look of gratitude she had come to treasure the expressions on the faces of those who gathered round to watch were of simple envy a sort of beatific hunger laced with outright jealousy sometimes shed deliberately choose people because they were on their own or only with a few other people just so she escaped the weight of those deathdesiring gazes you could not reason with people in the grip of such a faith she had tried but failed the truth was that she could offer them release she was an angel who here really did exist and really could offer these people what they most desired it was not even really faith it was perfectly reasonable belief she climbed into the high clear air chewing on the stillwarm haunch of the one shed released only minutes earlier the crowd gathering round the body was too small to see now lost in the scabbed landscapes beneath the drifting clouds of smoke way off in the distance something shimmered in a way that she was not sure she had seen here ever before something seemed almost to shine way over there towards a line of small mountains tall cliffs and acid lakes not with flame with what could almost be watery sunlight if that wasnt an absurd idea here in hell where there contrived to be light without sun it looked like a column like a broad silvery pillar half invisible between land and cloud she took one last gulping bite then dropped the haunchbone and struck off for the distant anomaly the column only grew more mysterious the closer she got it was like a strange irregular curtain of silver draped over the land a few kilometres across maybe one deep a sort of semiregular shape of what looked like a pure mirror it had no light of its own but seemed to reflect all light that touched it flying close she saw her own dark elongated shape flickering liquidly across its surface she went up through the clouds to see that the pillar extended all the way to the iron sky tens of kilometres above the effort made it feel like her muscles were on fire she dropped back through the cloud landed her feet her legs all hurt protesting as they took her weight they always did her legs hurt when she was on the ground her wings ached when she was flying and her whole body grumbled distantly when she hung upside down to rest she just tried not to think about it there were some choppedup bodies lying right beside the shimmering curtain of silver where it met the ground it looked as though they had been cut with a very sharp blade she picked up a slicedoff leg lying on the ground threw it at the silvery barrier it bounced off as though it had hit solid metal she picked the leg back up prodded the barrier felt solid she touched it with one talon very solid iron solid to the touch it was a little cold again as cold as iron or steel would have felt one cowering creature nearby squealed as she dragged it from the poison bush it had been trying to hide within its pelt was already starting to blister the little male was emaciated missing one trunk one eye his face badly scarred by tooth marks did you see this happen she demanded shaking him towards the silent mirrorbarrier it just happened he wailed all of a sudden without warning please maam are you the one who releases us yes has anything like this happened here before she said still not letting him go she knew this area a little she tried to recall its details cliffs mountains a munitions factory set into the cliffs over there she could see the road that had served it lined with petrified very quietly shrieking statues no never seen anything like it nobody here has please sacred lady take me release me kill me please she looked round there were a few others she could see now all cowering behind whatever cover they could find she let the male go i cant help you she told him ive already killed today tomorrow then ill wait here tomorrow he fell kneeling at her feet supplicating i dont make fucking appointments she roared the male stayed where he was quivering she gazed up at the shimmering reflecting curtain wondering what to make of it still she flew back there the next day the mirror curtain was gone so was the geography she remembered from before it had been there a barren dusty plain rising smoothly replaced everything that had been within the boundary of the shimmering curtain it joined as best it could with the cliffs and mountains beyond where the mirrorbarrier had been but it looked droppedin addedon somehow a patch she didnt know what to make of it the scarred male from the day before was still there where shed left him pleading to be released she sighed landed took him into her wings and let his spirit go taking on yet another additional pain glitches in hell fucking appointments in fucking hell whatever fucking next this place is definitely coarsening me she muttered to herself as she flew off clutching another tornoff haunch the me im counting displaced yime nsokyi into the windowless suite at the rear of the very grand hotel near the centre of iobe cavern city vebezua while it kept station overhead just beyond the atmosphere arguing with the planetary near space traffic authority the boxy shipdrone serving as escort to her and himerance switched on all the lights the bedroom was vast palatial unoccupied the secret passage is hidden under the bed himerance said the drone activated the relevant motors and the giant circular bed sank out of sight they went to the edge and watched it drop that leads to the tunnel that ends up in the desert yime asked she was dressed properly in her tunic at last for the first time in days she was still not fully healed and still somewhat delicate but her hair was tidy and she felt regained yes himerance said veppers might have been absent for days though officially he never left here he probably left on a jhlupian ship but nobodys sure his entourage supposedly arrived back on sichult this morning but theres no confirmation hes with them this is the last place we can be absolutely sure he was the drone dropped into the hole left by the descending bed himerance produced a scroll screen letting it unroll and hang in the air in front of them displaying the view the drone had as it made its way up the short corridor beneath the room heading into the cliff a small underground car shaped like a fat bullet sat in front of a dark tunnel getting anything yime asked himerance shrugged nothing much he told her there is a variety of surveillance tech in here place is like a history of bugging through the ages whole tiny networks of linked spytech and outdated eavesdropping gear splattered about the entire suite lot of stuff thats probably lost forgotten about many tiny dead batteries in here ancient stuff the ship only a couple of hundred kilometres over their heads was targeting one of its main effectors on the city the hotel and the suite if there was anything useful here it would find it most recent is equivtech stuff himerance said relaying what the ship was finding passably nr stuff he looked at yime nr probably its recent himerance said and working itd be relaying what were saying now if i wasnt blocking it synched into hidden hotel cameras and commsintercept gear too himerance nodded at four different points in the room sprayed on in the wall hangings drapes on the surfaces of paintings and embedded in the rugs anything recorded no and no idea where it would have transmitted to either himerance admitted would it have registered veppers using his sinkingbed escape route maybe not himerance said gazing up at the great thick fold of curtains which could envelop and surround the bed not if these were drawn he squinted yime could almost feel the ship overhead shifting the focus of its effector by minute fractions of a degree no sprayon surveillance on those himerance confirmed and theyre a lot more hitech than the simple organic woven material they look like shield you from most interference once theyre drawn right round yime sighed i dont think hes here she said i certainly dont think she is stopping here had been an easy enough decision the direction theyd approached the sichultian enablement from vebezua had been almost directly en route sichult itself still seemed the best place to find both veppers and lededje ybreq but taking a quick look at the last place they had a definite fix on veppers had seemed to make sense and cost them only a couple of hours im still not getting whats going on with the restoria mission himerance said sounding puzzled some sort of comms blackout now somethings happening out there at the disk smatter outbreak yime asked those fabricaria ships are more than smatter himerance said as they watched the drone retrace its flight back down the tunnel towards them yime knew the ship already felt torn between taking her where she wanted to go and joining in whatever action was taking place out at the tsungarial disk theres some sort of fullon battle going on out there himerance said frowning now beyond the disk on the fringes of the enablement way too hitech for mere smatter i do so hope that isnt the abominator class arriving if it is we may genuinely have a fullscale war on our hands the drone reappeared in the hole the bed had left himerance snapped the scrollscreen closed again and tucked it inside his jacket what about the explosion on veppers estate yime asked nothing new news blackout himerance paused actually something new couple of agencies veppers doesnt control reporting members of his entourage killed and injured in some sort of flier crash survivors arriving back at ubruater at one of his private hospitals another pause hmm guess that counts as speculation what does himerance looked at her reports that veppers might be dead id better let you go you take care i mean im staying this demeisen unit right here is sticking with you but me myself i the ship i have to stick around here see whats up sleeverolling palmspitting time for me you get to stay inside the shuttle inside this element this shiplet itll take you on to sichult okay lededje said thanks for the ride so far my pleasure take care see you later i hope me too the image of demeisen waved byebye against the star field the screen inside her suits helmet showed the main body of the ship slipping away to one side fields flickering between the element she was looking from and the main body of the vessel it was still elongatedly ellipsoidal but each curved sliver of shipelement had separated slightly from the other so that the ship looked like a fat throwball knifed open from tip to tail segments teased apart as she watched the gap left by the departure of the part that she was in started to close up the other sections pulling fractionally further away from each other then they reached the ships outer field boundary and passed through opaque layers outside the falling outside the normal moral constraints was just a giant silver ellipsoid it shimmered disappeared the demeisen figure was still there seemingly floating in space he turned to her just you and me now babe and the shipsection submind of course does it have a separate name she asked demeisen shrugged element twelve thatll have to do he crossed his arms frowned now the good news first or the bad news she frowned too good she said well have you on sichult in a few hours whats the bad news this just in veppers might be already dead she stared at the image of the avatar she hadnt expected this that it she said after a moment yup you seem relatively unconcerned she shrugged i wanted him dead if hes dead good why only might what happened someone nuked his aircraft as it was flying low over his estate some of his retinue killed some injured veppers himself mysteriously unaccounted for huh i bet hes still alive id want to see the body before i believe otherwise and check it for neural laces or whatever demeisen smiled at her it was a strange unsettling sort of smile she wondered if this version of demeisen would be different to the one controlled by the main ship thought you wanted to kill him yourself he said she looked at him for a moment ive never killed anyone before she told him i dont really want to have to kill another person im not totally completely sure that i can even kill veppers i think i can and ive fantasised about it a hundred times but if he really was dead maybe that would be a relief part of me would be angry he didnt die by my hand but part of me would be grateful i get out of finding whether i could really do it or not demeisen raised an eyebrow how many times did he rape you she let a couple of controlled regular breaths pass before she answered i lost count and then he murdered you yes she said though to give him his due he only did that once when the avatar didnt say anything but simply kept looking at her she added im not him demeisen im not even like him if i get close to him and have the gun or the knife in my hand but then find that i cant do it then ill be angry at myself for not being strong enough for letting him get away with it and for giving him the chance to rape and murder again she took another breath but if i can do it if i do do it then on one level im no better than him and hell have won by making me behave like he does she shrugged dont get me wrong i fully intend to put a bullet through his head or slit his throat if i get the chance but i wont know if i can do it until the moment actually presents itself another shrug if it ever does demeisen shook his head that is the sorriest limpest most selfdefeating piece of selfmotivating i have ever fucking heard we should have talked about this before i ought to have been giving you assassin lessons for the past umpteen days how long we got now five hours demeisen slapped one hand over his forehead and eyes theatrically oh fuck youre going to die kid lededjes frown deepened thanks for your confidence hey you started it twentysix veppers dead yime nsokyi said how in that explosion or the flier crash reports remain confused himerance said lededje ybreq isnt back there already is she yime asked doubtful himerance said and i would doubt she could organise a nuke inside veppers estate either shes just a kid with a grudge not some superpowered sc agent not that a superpowered sc agent would use anything as inelegant as a bomb aimed at an aircraft or miss if they did what if the abominators helping her i would prefer not to think about that himerance said with a sigh yime frowned looked about the palatial suite can you hear that thumping noise that the ship drone said is the hotels general manager registering his disapproval at his passkey codes not allowing him entry into his finest suite when there appears to be something going on inside himerance was frowning now the ships drone fell silent hanging in the air for a moment we need to conduct a small experiment himerance said that statue the drone announced and himerance turned to look at a threequarterssized statue of a buxom nymph carrying a stylised torch in one corner of the bedroom whats going yime began as a silvery ellipsoid flickered into existence around the statue obscuring it when the ellipsoid vanished with a small pop the statue was gone and where it had stood there was a freshlooking patch of rug whats happening yime said just starting to feel worried and looking from the humanoid avatar to the shipdrone the two machines seemed to hesitate then the little drone said uhoh himerance turned to yime that was the ship attempting a displace back to it the microsingularity didnt arrive the drone told her what yime said how himerance stepped forward took yime by the elbow we need to go he said moving yime towards the suites entrance checking that tunnel again the drone said and flew quickly across the room disappearing into the hole the circular bed had left the ships being instructed to quit the system by an nr vessel himerance told yime as he hustled her into the suites main drawing room in no uncertain terms the nr think were up to something and seem by reliquarian standards extremely upset theyre intercepting any displaces the drone then himerance made a noise that was almost a yelp and covered yimes ears with his hands so fast it hurt the explosion from the depths of the bedroom blew them both over thudding into the floor himerance managed to twist in the air as they fell so that yime landed on top of him it still hurt and yimes nose which had thudded into his chin started to bleed immediately every justhealed bone in her body ached in protest the avatar dragged her to her feet as clouds of smoke dust and small floating scraps of debris came rolling out of the bedroom yime started to cough the fuck is going on she managed as himerance walked her smartly towards the suites vestibule that was the tunnel being collapsed and sealed by the nr ship himerance said what about the drone yime asked sniffing back blood as they approached the suites double doors gone himerance told her cant we reason with the the ship is reasoning as fast as it machinely can with the nr vessel himerance said to little avail thus far it will have to flee or fight very soon we are already effectively on our own the avatar looked at the doors for a moment they swung open to reveal a broad plushly decorated corridor a small man with a furious look on his face and three large men dressed in uniforms of what appeared to be a semimilitary nature the rolling cloud of smoke and dust flowed gently past himerance and yime towards the people in the corridor the small furiouslooking man stared in utter horror at the dust one of the large men levelled a thickbarrelled weapon of some sort at himerance who said im terribly sorry i have no time for this right now and moving more quickly than yime would have believed possible was suddenly smoothly after a sort of liquidic ducking motion in the midst of the three large men flicking the weapon out of the hand of the one pointing it while simultaneously and almost accidentally it appeared stabbing one elbow into the midriff of one of the other men whose eyes nearly popped from his head as he collapsed with a whooshing noise of rapidly expelled air yime barely had time to register this happening before the other two men went down too one felled after the avatar pointed the weapon at him there was a click and a hum no more while the other whod been holding the weapon was sent flying backwards into the wall behind by a single thrust from himerances nowoutstretched palm ah himerance said taking the small man by the throat and pressing the gun against his temple the small man looked more stunned and terrified than furious now some sort of neural blaster this remark seemed addressed to nobody in particular his next was as squarely aimed at the hotels general manager as the neural blaster good day sir you will kindly help us to escape himerance obviously took the mans subsequent strangled gurgle as indicating assent because he smiled relaxed his grip a fraction and looking at yime nodded down the corridor this way i think what happens now yime asked as they frogmarched the manager down the corridor how do we get off the planet she stopped and stared at the avatar do we get off the planet no well be safer here just for now himerance told her stopping at the lift doors and suggesting to the manager that he use his passkey to priorityorder an elevator car we will yime said the lift arrived the avatar took the passkeys off the manager inserted them into the elevator cars control panel pushed the manager out of the car and stunned him with the neural blaster as the doors closed himerance looked round the elevator car as they descended towards a subbasement not usually accessible to nonstaff a small puff of smoke came out of the control panel through the grille of the emergency speaker actually no we wont be safer here himerance said the ship will snapdisplace us off snapdisplace that sounds dangerous yes i know and it is though we are assuming itll be less dangerous than staying here but if the ship cant displace us now it cant displace us now because it and we are both effectively static giving the nr time to intercept the displacement whereas later itll be coming through at very high speed passing dangerously close to the planet grazing its gravity well at high translight and attempting to fit the displacement event into an ungenerous handful of picoseconds the avatar sounded remarkably casual about all this yime thought it watched the screen indicating the floors as it counted slowly down the lift cars lighting close overhead made himerances bald head gleam providing its done at sufficiently high speed that should leave the nr with insufficient time to arrange any interception of the displacement singularity the avatar smiled at her thats the real reason the ship is doing as the nr have demanded and leaving itll power up the whole way out execute a minimumradiustopower turn and come straight back in still accelerating snapping us off and then heading for sichult the whole procedure will take some hours however as the ship gathers speed both to make it look like it really is leaving and to make sure that when it passes us its going fast enough to confound the nr vessel or vessels during that time we need to remain hidden from the nr will it work probably ah the car drew to a stop probably yime found herself saying to an empty lift as the avatar moved swiftly between the opening doors she followed to find they were in a deserted basement car park full of wheeled ground vehicles yime opened her mouth to speak but the avatar pirouetted one finger to his lips as he moved towards a bulkylooking vehicle with six wheels and a body that appeared to be made from a single billet of black glass thisll do he said a gullwing door sighed open though he said as they settled into their seats oh do put your seatbelt on wont you thank you though the nr may well guess that the ship will attempt this manoeuvre and so either try to prevent or interfere with the displacement or they might attack the ship itself of course though that would be rather extreme they just destroyed the ships drone and seem to be trying to kill us isnt that fairly extreme already it is rather the avatar agreed reasonably looking at the vehicles controls until lights came on though drones avatars and even humans are one thing the loss of any is not without moral and diplomatic import of course but might be dismissed as merely unfortunate and regrettable something to be smoothed over through the usual channels attacking a ship on the other hand is an unambiguous act of war a screen flashed on filled with what looked like a city road map thank you yime said it is always salutary to be reminded of ones true place in the proper arrangement of matters himerance nodded yes i know in the distance up a short ramp a large door to what appeared to be the outside was rising open many of these are automatic too himerance muttered to himself thats useful most of the other vehicles in the car park were turning their lights on some were already moving all heading for the ramp and the doorway well leave in the middle i think he said as their vehicle made a low distant humming noise and moved smoothly off joining the line of quickly moving cars judging by the ones she could see into none of the others had any occupants are you doing this or the ship yime asked as they left the underground garage me the avatar said the ship left some ninety seconds ago outside the enormous tunnel of the city was bright with artificial lights the cupped spread of the place disappearing upwards and down into a faint haze the far side of the city a perpendicular jumble of mostly tall variegated buildings was only a kilometre or so distant but looked further away in the murk around them the driverless vehicles the avatar had set in motion were all heading off in as many different directions as they could find amongst the citys jumbled network of streets above little tethered aircraft flitted back and forth along the great cavern as yime watched one of the larger empty vehicles a short way in front of them in a sidelane slowed met with some hanging cables and was hoisted rapidly into the air were going to do the same thing himerance said shortly before their vehicle followed the other one though it then promptly headed off in the opposite direction their vehicle rose quickly amongst the hundreds of cableheld craft they had reached a steady height and held it for about twenty seconds when the avatar sucked in a breath the black glass around parted directly overhead then started to sink back into the sides of the vehicle before the retracting glass had reached shoulder level himerances arm flicked almost too fast to see as he threw the stubby tube of the neural blaster out of the vehicle immediately the glass moved back up around them moments later there was a flash from behind quickly followed by a great thudding bang which left the vehicle swinging back and forth causing it to slow automatically briefly to correct the oscillation himerance and yime looked back to see a blossoming cloud of smoke and debris rising from near the centreline of the cavern city pieces of a great bridge sundered in the middle were starting to fall slowly towards the river on the tunnels floor directly above more glowing pieces of wreckage and cinders were falling from a tiny yellowrimmed hole in the cavern ceiling echoes of the detonation slammed back and forth amongst the buildings disappearing slowly down the tunnel city himerance shook his head i beg your pardon i should have thought they might trace that somehow my mistake he said as they drew level with a tall stone tower the glass around them flowed fully down into the sides of the vehicle the vehicle was beeping irately though it was almost drowned out by multitudinous echoing sirens starting to sound around the city they bumped gently against the summit of the tower we need to get out the avatar said rising taking yimes hand and together making the small jump onto the grass beyond the towers parapet the impact hurt her knees the vehicle stopped beeping and swung away again glass panels rising back into place as the cables above whisked it back to the heights himerance hauled an old but stoutlooking trapdoor open in a flurry of earth and popping rivets they hurried down an unlit spiral staircase and had descended about two complete turns yime following himerance and trusting him to see in a darkness so profound even her moderately augmented eyes could register next to nothing when there was a distantsounding thud from outside the tower shook just a little that was the vehicle we were just in wasnt it she said it was the avatar agreed whoevers coordinating this is thinking commendably quickly nr almost certainly they thudded down more steps spiralling downwards all the time so fast yime felt she was starting to get dizzy it was hurting her knees and ankles and back too best not to tarry then the avatar said putting on a burst of speed she heard and vaguely sensed him disappearing round the curve of the winding stair i cant go that fast she shouted of course not he said stopping she thudded into him my apologies jump on my back well go faster just keep your head down she was too breathless to argue she climbed onto his back legs round his waist arms about his neck hold tight the avatar said she did they set off whirling down the steps so fast it was almost falling those who had seen the first two incursions reported seeing a cerise beam destroy first the high bridge and then the wheeled airborne cablecraft in both cases the beam simply came angling down from the ceiling of the cavern having bored through many tens of metres of rock before transfixing its target the third and the last time the beam assaulted iobe cavern city it hit an ancient ornamental stone tower part of the original central university buildings the beam struck the old tower near its base bringing the whole edifice tumbling down at first it was thought there had been no casualties until half a day later the bodies of a man and a woman were discovered still locked together her legs round his waist her arms round his neck under the hundreds of tonnes of rubble there was a house which was the shape of the galaxy it was a virtual house of course but it was very highly detailed and well imagined and although the scale on which it modelled the galaxy could vary quite a lot from time to time and from place to place within it the general effect was convincing for the beings who had brought the house into existence and at least as far as they were concerned the surroundings felt agreeably familiar the beings concerned were culture minds the very highlevel ais which were by some distance the most complicated and intelligent entities in the whole civilisation and arguably amongst the most complicated and intelligent entities in the whole galaxywide metacivilisation the house was used to indicate where the individual minds were in the real galaxy so that a mind which existed within an orbital hub close to the galactic centre would be located in the great bulbous multistoreyed centre of the house while a ship mind in a vessel currently somewhere towards the wispy tip of one of the galaxys arms would appear in one of the singleroom tall outer wings there were special arrangements for those minds who didnt want their location known by all and sundry they tended to inhabit pleasingly dilapidated outbuildings within what were effectively the grounds of the main construction communicating at a remove the house itself manifested as an echoingly vast baroque edifice of extraordinary ornamental richness every room the size of a cathedral and full of intricately carved wooden walls and pierced screens gleaming floors of inlaid wood and semiprecious stone ceilings dripping with precious metals and minerals and populated usually quite sparsely by the avatars of the minds which took on pretty much every form of being and object known unrestricted by such tiresome threedimensional constraints as the laws of perspective every one of the many thousands of rooms was visible from every other if not through doorways then through tiny iconsscreensapertures in the walls which on sufficiently close inspection let one see into those immensely distant rooms in some detail minds of course being used to existing within four dimensions as a matter of tedious daytoday reality had no problem dealing with this sort of topological sleightofhand the only realitybased restriction the galactic house modelled accurately was that produced by the deeply annoying fact that even hyperspacial light did not travel with infinite speed to carry on a normal conversation with another mind one had to be in the same room and reasonably close to it even two minds being within the same vast room but on opposite sides created a noticeable delay as they shouted back and forth being any further away meant sending messages these usually showed up as gently glowing symbols flickering disembodied in the air in front of the recipient but subject to the witheringly prodigious imaginations of minds in general and the particular and quite possibly highly eccentric predilections of the sender in particular could show up as almost anything swiftmoving ballets consisting of multiplylimbed aliens on fire and throwing shapes which just happened briefly to resemble marain symbols for example were by no means unknown vatueil had vaguely heard of this place hed always wondered what it actually looked like he gazed around astounded wondering how you would describe it how a poet might find the words to portray something of its bewildering richness and complexity in appearance he was a panhuman male tall and wearing the dress uniform of a space marshal he stood in this vast room shaped like the inside of a vast beachshell to resemble the general volume of space called the doplioid spiral fragment and watched as what looked like a substantial chandelier lowered itself from the ceiling inspected closely the ceiling was mostly composed of such chandeliers when its lowermiddle section got level with his head the chandelier a riot of fabulously intertwined multicoloured glass spirals and corkscrew shapes stopped space marshal vatueil welcome it said its voice had a sort of gentle tinkling quality appropriate to its appearance my name is zaive im a hubmind with a special interest in the quietus section ill let the others introduce themselves vatueil turned to find that without him having noticed them arriving there were two humans a large hovering blue bird and what looked like a crudely carved garishly painted ventriloquists dummy sitting on a small multicoloured balloon all standing or floating around him im the fixed grin the first human told him the avatar had silvery skin and looked vaguely female representing numina it noddedbowed the scar glamour the blue bird told him sc beastly to the animals the other humanoid avatar said a thinlooking male i represent the interests of restoria labtebricolephile the dummy may have announced having what sounded like trouble with the l sounds civilian it paused eccentric it added needlessly and that the chandelier called zaive said as the others helpfully looked off to one side is the dressed up to party the dressed up to party was a small orangered cloud hanging more or less over the hovering blue bird the dressed up to party is also nonaligned and is some nonspecific distance away its contributions will be sporadic zaive said and probably beside the point as well as trailing it the blue bird representing the scar glamour said it cocked its iridescently plumaged head to look up at the orangered cloud but there was no visible response together zaive said we make up the specialist agencies prompt response committee or at least the local chapter as it were a small number of other interested parties each no less securityconscious than ourselves will be listening in at greater removes and may contribute subsequently do you need any explanation regarding our titles or terminology no thank you vatueil said we understand that you represent the highest strategic level of command within the antihell side in the current confliction regarding the hells is that right yes vatueil confirmed so space marshal vatueil the bird said flapping its short wings lazily too slowly for it to have truly hovered had this all been taking place in the real you indicated this was both urgent and of the highest importance what is it you wish to tell us its about the war over the hells vatueil said that kind of came presupposed the bird said vatueil sighed are you aware that the antihell side is losing of course the bird said and that we attempted to hack the substrates of the prohell side we had guessed as much the thinlooking male said those attempts failed vatueil said therefore we decided to bring the war into the real to construct a fleet of ships which would destroy as many of the hellcontaining substrates as possible so the entire decadeslong confliction was for nothing the blue bird said crisply putting it on the same level as the vows one assumes you must have taken at the start of the war renouncing resort to precisely the two courses you have just outlined thats a weighty thing to have done space marshal the dummy said hinged jaws clicking as it spoke it was not a step we took lightly vatueil agreed perhaps it was not a step you should have taken at all the blue bird said i am not here to justify my actions or decisions or those of my comrades or coconspirators vatueil said i am here only to try to implicate us the blue bird said half the galaxy assumes were behind the antihell forces anyway perhaps by coming here and being allowed audience despite the earnest entreaties of some of us you intend to persuade the other half directly above the birds head the little orangered cloud had just started to rain though no moisture seemed to reach the scar glamours avian avatar im here to tell you that the antihell forces came to an agreement with the gfcf and elements of the sichultian enablement behind the backs of the nr and their allies the flekke and the jhlupians to build us our fleet using the tsungarial disk however we have received intelligence that the nr thought that they too had an agreement with the sichultia promising that they the sichultia would refuse to help the antihell side and would do whatever the nr wanted them to do to stop any war fleet being built the sichultia sound as free with their agreements as you and your fellows are with your solemn undertakings space marshal the blue bird representing sc said must you be quite so unpleasant to our guest the silverskinned avatar asked the scar glamours avatar the bird bristled its feathers and said yes we have also heard vatueil said that the nr the culture and the gfcf are currently in some way engaged in the sichultian enablement especially around the tsungarial disk assuming this is the case it was thought important that you were informed at the highest level that the sichultia are on the side which everyone assumes you wish to win in the confliction difficult though it may be for you to imagine somebody keeping their word in any circumstances space marshal the blue bird said what makes you think that the sichultia will stick to the agreement they made with you rather than the one they made with the nr the agreement made with the nr basically meant doing nothing the agreement made with us meant becoming involved with a conspiracy that would be largely under the control of others and that would proceed regardless of the sichultians initial operational involvement while exposing them to a substantial risk of being punished by the nr even if they changed their minds before their part in the conspiracy became crucial it makes no sense for them to have entered into the agreement unless they were going to see it through that does make sense zaive said voice tinkling so the thin male avatar said we should do nothing to stop the sichultia from doing whatever it is they are doing in and around the tsungarial disk vatueil shrugged i cant tell you what to do im not even going to make any suggestions we just thought you should know whats going on we understand zaive said i have some intelligence the blue bird announced vatueil turned and looked levelly at it my intelligence tells me that you are a traitor space marshal vatueil vatueil continued to look at the bird as it flapped lazily in front of him the orangered cloud above the scar glamours avatar had stopped raining vatueil turned to address zaive i have no more to report if i may be excused yes the chandelier said though there was no indication with the signal carrying you what was to be done with your mindstate following delivery of your message i think we all assumed that you were to be returned to your war sim high command but perhaps you had something else in mind vatueil smiled im to be deleted he said to avoid any further unseemly hint at complicity with the antihell forces on your part how very thoughtful the silverskinned vaguely female avatar said vatueil chose to assume that she meant it im sure we can offer you the processing space to be housed within a virtuality zaive said wouldnt you rather no thank you my original has been through more virtualities downloads and reincorporations than he cares to think about any selves he sends out such as myself are quite inured to the thought of personal deletion so long as we know our original persists somewhere the space marshal smiled and knew that he looked resigned as he did so and even if not this has been a very long war and i am very tired in all my iterations death no longer seems so terrible a thing on any level that may the blue bird said be just as well for once though its tone was less than cutting indeed vatueil said he looked round them all thank you for listening goodbye he looked at the chandelier and nodded he winked out of existence well zaive said do we take this at face value the silverskinned avatar asked it fits well with what we know the wooden dummy said better than most sims and do we trust the space marshal zaive asked the bird made a snorting sound that errant ramshackled ghost it said scornfully hes known of old i doubt he even remembers who he used to be let alone what he believes in or most recently promised we dont need to trust it to incorporate the import of its information into our calculations the silverskinned female said the thin male avatar looked at the chandelier you need to tell your accidentprone agent to stop wasting time and get to where shes supposed to get to preferably without this time getting any more innocent people killed stop the ybreq woman killing veppers the man turned to the blue bird with the orangered cloud hanging over it though of course that wont be necessary if sc would just tell the falling outside the normal moral constraints to stop indulging whatever bizarre fantasies of gallantry vicarious revenge or just devilment its currently revelling in dont look at me the scar glamours avatar said flapping indignantly that bastard excuse for a picket ships got nothing to do with me the bird cocked its head and looked up at the orange cloud youd better be listening it squawked youve got the contacts you talk to the gsv that spawned that particular abomination get it to try and bang some sense into the bugfuck shrapnel that makes up what passes for a mind in that demented machine good night good night good night a chill struck her skin she wanted to shiver but felt too lethargic all swaddled lost in a warm baking fug what sounded like a real voice came clanging in unwelcome hello anybody in there it said anybody alive huh she heard herself say great now she was hallucinating hearing voices hello yes what hello to you too she was talking not sending she realised that was weird it took a few moments but she got her eyes open unsticking them she blinked waited for everything to swim into focus light there was light dim but it looked real face plate of helmet internal visor screen currently showing just static but enough to reveal that both her inner and outer suits seemed to have expanded around her and chilly draughts of air were flowing over her exposed body raising goosebumps she could breathe she took some deep satisfying breaths luxuriating in the feel of the cold air entering her mouth and nostrils and her rib cage being able to expand as far as it could auppi unstril that right the voice said umm yes her mouth felt clogged sticky all gummed up like her eyes had been she licked her lips they felt puffy and oversensitive but just being able to lick them felt so good who you she cleared her throat who am i talking to im an element of the culture abominatorclass picket ship falling outside the normal moral constraints an element element five are you now where did you come from what abominator class she thought nobody had mentioned an abominatorclass ship was this real she still wasnt sure that this wasnt just some very lucid dream she found the nipple on the end of the helmets flexible water tube sucked on it the water was cool sweet beautiful real she told herself real water real chill on the skin real voice real real real she felt the water coursing down inside her chilling her throat oesophagus and stomach as she swallowed is where i came from relevant the voice said my whole was pretending to be a torturer class earlier if that helps ah are you rescuing me element five i am currently i have displaced nanodust working to repair what i can of your module it should be ready to power up again in a few minutes you could then make your way to the nearest base which would be the nearplanet monitoring unit five however in the light of the recent hostile actions i think it might be wiser and even safer if you join me coming within my field enclosure your choice what would you do if you were me oh id stick with me but then im bound to say that arent i i suppose you are she drank more of the precious beautiful water but i will stick with you wise choice how is everybody else are you rescuing the others there were twentythree other microship pilots and nearly forty others plus the people on the hylozoist how are they the hylozoist lost four crew one person was killed when the nearplanet monitoring unit five was damaged two of the modulemicroship pilots were killed one in a collision with a fabricary the other burning up within the atmosphere of razhir the other pilots have been are being or shortly will be rescued who were they who were the two pilots who died lofgyr inhada was the one killed in the collision with a fabricary and tersetier lanyares died when his ship burned up within the atmosphere of the gas giant backed up she thought he was backed up its all right he can come back it will take time and even though he might not be exactly the same person hell be mostly the same person of course hell still love you hed be a fool not to wouldnt he she found that she was crying bettlescroy i understand youve been looking for me indeed i have veppers you look well for a dead man the image of the gfcf legislatoradmiral on the little flatscreen comms computer wavered a little the signal was weak multiply scrambled veppers sat with jasken in a small room in one of his emergency safe houses in ubruater city a few blocks and the width of a ribbonpark away from the main town house the safe house one of several prepared long ago just in case the wrong politicians or judges got into positions of real power and started making things uncomfortable for creative buccaneering business people who didnt always do things the conventional way had shielded comms links to the systems in the town house as soon as theyd arrived both in the uniforms of paramedics veppers had taken a shower scrubbing any remaining radioactive soot or ash out of his hair and skin while jasken had woken up the slightly archaic equipment in the study and started trawling the news channels and message systems the series of urgent calls and messages from legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii had been hard to ignore thank you veppers told the angeliclooking little alien you look as you always do whats our situation a wavering smile on the little aliens face might have been distorted or exaggerated by the lofi screen your situation is that you need to tell me now veppers where our targets are it is more than urgent it is crucial all weve planned and worked for now depends on this i see all right ill tell you that comes as a great if absurdly belated relief though first i am as you might imagine quite interested in finding out who tried to blow me out of the skies on my own flier over my own estate almost certainly the nr bettlescroy said quickly waving one hand as though this was hardly worth mentioning youve obviously given the subject considerable thought ally veppers said quietly bettlescroy looked exasperated the nr seem to feel you have betrayed them in some way though just possibly it was the flekke subcontracting in some way ever anxious to please and the jhlupians might feel wronged too your friend xingre seems to have disappeared which probably means something we will do all we can with all the resources we can afford to devote to the matter to find out who might have been responsible however the targets are still by far the most important issue outstanding here agreed but first your situation ive got a little out of touch here whats happening bettlescroy seemed to be trying to control itself perhaps it said calmly i have not indicated as forcefully as i might that the target information is of vital importance right now it said almost screaming the last two words i take your point veppers said smoothly the targets will be with you very shortly but i need to know whats happening whats happening veppers bettlescroy hissed sitting so close to the screen camera at its end that its face appeared distorted almost ugly is that a fucking culture hypership that can split up to become a fleet of ships is laying waste to our fucking war fleet of ships even as we speak and even as you unbelievably continue to waste time its destroying thousands of them each minute within a day and a half there will be no more ships left and this despite the fact that i took it upon myself to order that all the fabricaria able to do so start manufacturing ships not just the proportion we originally agreed on veppers assumed a look of pretended hurt going back on our agree he began shut up bettlescroy shouted one tiny fist thudding down on the desk beneath the screen the culture vessel has also already worked out how to get the fabricariabuilt ships to set about destroying each other which might result in the ships annihilating themselves even quicker within a matter of hours it would appear only to be holding back from this course because it fears some of the ships might accidentally or mistakenly damage the fabricaria a consequence it wishes to avoid if possible to preserve the and i quote unique technocultural monument that is the tsungarial disk thats so thoughtful dont you think thats so thoughtful i think thats so fucking thoughtful bettlescroy stared out of the screen at them with a fierce unnatural smile that held no humour whatsoever however this thing this wonderful superpowerful ally that we suddenly discovered we had now blithely tells us it will hold this tactic in reserve and meanwhile continue to target the ships itself for the sake of engagemental accuracy and to minimise collateral damage though frankly my fellow officers and myself strongly suspect its really doing so because its enjoying itself so much just as it appeared quite heartily to enjoy disposing of nearly a third of our naval fleet on its approach to the tsung system i hope this is giving you some small modest indicationary idea of just how powerless we are out here at the moment veppers old fellow while we wait for your precious fucking targets meanwhile we are continuing to deal with our pretend smatter outbreak which has proved trickier than we anticipated and are ourselves even having to destroy some of the fabricariabuilt war fleet we worked so hard to create just to make it look convincing to the culture that we really are all just chums and allies fighting on the same jolly side oh and i nearly forgot an nr ship is causing havoc oninall over vebezua yes another ship possibly a culture ship possibly another culture warship was last heard of hightailing it out of the vebezua system possibly having delivered something or somebody and possibly now departing there with the intention of joining in all the fun out here at the disk and depleting our oncefine fleet of ships even quicker and the nr themselves are making deeply suspicious noises bordering on outright hostile noises when it comes both to ourselves and you veppers and are only not helping to destroy our shortlived war fleet because they want to see how fast and how ably the culture vesselfleet does so valuable intelligence we are given to understand though of course the presence and presumed hostility of the nr does mean that any of our ships that might escape from the vicinity of the disk itself may well find themselves being picked off by the nr there that is the fucking situation i face shame humiliation demotion court martial and ruin and oh please do believe me dear mr veppers if such a fate befalls me i shall do everything i possibly can to make sure that you fall with me cherished ally and coconspirator bettlescroy took a deep breath drew itself up and collecting itself it seemed made a calm expansive motion with its hands now it said i cant really imagine how many more of our ships have been laid waste while i have been speaking but i imagine the number comes to some several thousand please veppers if we are to salvage anything anything at all from what is increasingly looking like a calamitous venture and an utterly hopeless situation tell us where the targets are at least some of them at least the nearest ones given that we will have so few ships so illequipped and so slowmoving by the time you get round to finally telling us where bettlescroy paused the fucking it paused again taking another deep breath targets one last pause are veppers sighed thank you bettlescroy that was really all i wanted to know he smiled one moment he clicked the sound off at the computer and turned to jasken on the screen bettlescroy appeared to be shouting and striking the screen at its end with both hands jasken had to tear his gaze away sir jasken im absolutely famished would you mind seeing what we have in the kitchen here just a bite or two and some decent wine even water would do but do look for some drinkable wine get something for yourself too veppers grinned nodded at the comms unit where bettlescroy appeared to be trying to bite the edge of the screen i can manage here sir jasken said and left the room veppers watched the study door close then turned back to the screen and switched the sound back on where bettlescroy shrieked ready veppers asked calmly bettlescroy sat staring at the screen eyes wide breathing hard what might have been spittle disfigured its finely made chin good veppers said smiling the most important targets the only ones really worth bothering with now are easily reached and close by theyre under the trackways on my estate of espersium in fact come to think of it somebody possibly the nr as you suggest has already begun the task of destroying them when they attacked my flier anyway to reiterate every trackway is underlain by what to the untutored eye looks like some sort of giant fungal structure it isnt its substrate lowpower biobased not ultrafast running but highefficiency highly damageresistant substrate anything from ten to thirty metres thick under and amongst the roots but adding up to over half a cubic kilometre of processing power spread throughout the estate all the comms traffic to and from it is channelled through the phased array satellite links dotted round the mansion house itself the ones that everyone still thinks just control the virtualities and games thats what you have to hit bettlescroy the undertrackway substrates contain over seventy per cent of the hells in the entire galaxy he smiled again of those we know of anyway used to be slightly more but very recently i subcontracted the nr hell just to be on the safe side ive been buying hells up for over a century legislatoradmiral taking the processing requirements and legal and jurisdictional implications off other peoples hands for most of my business life the majority of the hells are right here in system on planet that is why i have always felt able to be so relaxed regarding the targeting details think you can get enough ships to sichult to lay waste to my estate truly bettlescroy said gulping still breathing deeply the targets are on your own estates why would you do that deniability bettlescroy youll have to raze the trackways wreck my lands blast the satellite links and damage the house itself maybe even destroy it that house has been in my family for centuries it and the estate are inestimably precious to me or at least so everybody assumes whos going to believe i brought all that destruction on myself and yet you no wait the little alien shook its head i have to issue the relevant orders the legislatoradmiral bent over its desk then looked up again thats all the trackways of espersium centred on the house yes veppers said target away bettlescroy took only seconds to issue the orders when it came back it was after a blankedout delay of a few more seconds during which veppers suspected the legislatoradmiral had composed itself smoothed down its scalp scales and wiped its face bettlescroy certainly seemed much more like its old glossily imperturbable self when it switched back on you would do this to yourself veppers to your familys legacy if it keeps me alive to enjoy my spoils of course and the spoils promise to be fabulous another order of magnitude greater than anything ill be losing the house can be rebuilt the art treasures replaced the trackways well id grown tired of them anyway frankly but they could be filled in and regrown i dare say the energy weapons leave negligible radioactivity hypervelocity kinetics leave even less as i understand it and the missile warheads are clean arent they thermonuclear but clean as possible designed to destroy not contaminate bettlescroy agreed there you are then its not as though i go camping in my estates at the best of times so even if some areas are a bit radio active i shant be too heartbroken lets be honest the grounds are mostly there to maintain a barrier between me and the proletarian hordes anyway if the hills and fields do end up glowing in the dark theyll work even better as insulation against the milling masses and in the end i can just buy another estate another dozen if i like and the people what people the people on the estate when it is laid waste oh yes i assume i have a few hours before any attack takes place hmm the little alien hesitated peered at its screen yes the quickest attack would come from a small squadron of the ships fitted with fleetdonated antimatter for their warp engines if they simply sped on past without attempting to draw to a stop first they could hit the targets within three and a half hours of now but their onboard weaponry targeting accuracy would not be great at that speed they would struggle to hit with less than a hundredmetre errorallowance at best missiles and smart warheads would be more precise though sichults own planetary defences would most likely intercept some of those more pinpoint accuracy would need to come from ships that had slowed down almost to a stop again your planets own defences might exact a toll though they would probably still arrive in such numbers that this would not matter say four to five hours for those to arrive one might attack the trackways themselves with the first highspeed waves and target the satellite links near the house with the laterarriving vessels so bottom line id have time to get a few people out veppers said not too many of course it still has to look convincing but i can always hire more people bettlescroy never a shortage of those ever still it is quite a toll you would ask of yourself sometimes you have to sacrifice small things in order to achieve great things bettlescroy veppers told the little alien hosting the hells has made me a great deal of money over the years but they were bound to prove an embarrassment one day or just be shut down quite possibly with talk of law suits or reparations or whatever all i have i can replace and with the funds we have agreed on and that wonderful ship you havent forgotten that wonderful ship have you bettlescroy it is yours veppers the legislatoradmiral told him it is still being fitted out to your instructions marvellous well with all that im sure i can console myself to the loss of a few trees and my country cottage so lets be clear nothing will happen for three and half hours is that correct the little alien looked at its screen again the first flyby bombardment and missile launch targeting the trackways will take place in three point fourone hours from now the missiles will impact between one and five minutes after the bombardment the second wave of ships charged with carrying out the precision bombardment of the satellite links around the house will arrive between point five and one point zero hours later we cant be any more accurate with the timing due to the inherent variability of warpengine crashstops especially that far into the gravity wells of a star and planet so sorry i trust that will afford you the time to do what you need to do hmm that will have to suffice then i suppose veppers made an expansive gesture dont look so horrified bettlescroy onward and upward dont you agree cant stand still one has to embrace change knock old stuff down to build bigger and better new stuff speculate to accumulate all that sort of thing im sure you have your own appropriate culturally relevant clich√©s the legislatoradmiral shook its small perfectly formed head what a remarkable person you are veppers i know i amaze myself sometimes he turned round as he heard the door behind him open ah jasken well done would you mind parcelling that stuff up to go as a picnic were off on our travels again twentyseven xlabtebricolephile olou eccentric me im counting child greetings i enclose a recording of certain recent proceedings involving a mindstate representation of one space marshal vatueil and a specialist agencies prompt response committee please take note and act accordingly xgsv dressed up to party ops falling outside the normal moral constraints take a look at this saprc local franchise stuff seems space marshal v our son of a bitch xps falling outside the normal moral constraints olou eccentric me im counting there was me about to call you unknown craft and wave a message beam vaguely in your direction but now a degree of signalidentity regularity appears to be infecting the locality and ive been informed you are after all some sort of proper culture ship hi me oh im mostly kicking the livingdead shit out of the biggest sortasmatter outbreak you ever did see in all the whole wide wonderful galaxy what exactly are you up to do call were close enough lets talk hello i made a possibly foolish promise to a human on a mission and must discharge that before i am able to help you with the smatter outbreak if that is what you would wish me to do and are hinting at i appreciate you are being kept busy and might be able to use some assistance i am seeing a remarkable amount of weapon blink from where i am which would appear to be on a very tight loop centred round sunny vebezua indulging in a translight comet impression well there you are im sure you have your reasons but thank you i am as you say keeping busy i would hope to join you within a few hoursheck no rush arent you the ship who took the image of ms ybreq few years ago i am hence a feeling of responsibility for what has transpired decent of you i have a presently soloing element carrying the revented ms y towards sichult even as we chat you werent thinking of trying to reunite her and the image at all were you no the image remains stored inanimate and i intend to preserve it in that state my promise was to get my human guest to where she wishes to go though my immediate concern is to avoid being attacked by the nr ship which seems aggressively interested either in whatever happens on vebezua or in what i do or possibly what my guest does or where the rescued mind from the quietus gcu bodhisattva happens to be which at the moment is within my field enclosure following the trashing of its ship by the unfallen bulbitian in the semsarine wisp the offending nr vessel is reticent regarding divulging what precisely its priorities are though they certainly seem to include threatening me much as i hate to add to your do list given your current preoccupation with clunking herds of nearmindless smatter vessels there is nevertheless this highly capable nr craft giving a fellow culture ship grief for no apparent good reason i am a humble and rather elderly limited offensive unit by inclination and declaration devoutly eccentric for many a century and hence long unused to the hurlyburly of even simulated battle and profoundly out of the circuit regarding recent advances in eqt ship weaponry and tactics subjects in which i imagine you must excel a thought merely when you have the time now i must continue trying to arrange a highspeed displace of two persons including a nonlaceequipped human from a planetary surface while an nr ship tries to stop me always assuming i can locate the two persons concerned they appear to have vanished fascinating you obviously have your fields full ill leave you to it do lets keep in touch the me im counting the ship with himerance lededje asked suddenly she was back in her room in the town house ten years earlier listening in the darkness to the tall stooped bald old man as he talked softly about taking an image of her that was faithful and precise down to the individual atom the very same demeisen said element twelve of the picket ship falling outside the normal moral constraints was bearing down on the inner system of the quyn system heading straight for a region of space a few hundred kilometres above where the city of ubruater on the planet sichult would be in just a few minutes the ship element was braking hard and negotiating even more strenuously with the relevant authorities on and around the planet it still has the image of you that it took when you were younger whats it doing here lededje asked in a suspicious tone demeisen thought they were steppedback from full foamedup ultraalert sitting in their seats on the module lededjes helmet visor lying opened so that she and the avatar could look at each other i suspect its carrying a person from quietus called yime nsokyi demeisen told her didnt mention her by name but a little research makes it highly likely its her and whats she doing here quietus might be interested in you as a revented little icicle they may feel that somehow youre their responsibility she looked at the avatar for a moment are they always this keen demeisen shook his head emphatically no theres probably some other reason care to take a guess who can say doll they may have some interest in the relationship between you and mr veppers especially as it might manifest itself in the near to medium future they may not feel that your intentions towards him are entirely peaceful and wish to forestall some untoward diplomatic incident what about you would you act to forestall this untoward diplomatic incident might do depends on the likely consequences you have my sympathies goes without saying but even i at least have to look like im taking account of the bigger picture consequences are everything the avatar nodded at the screen oh look were here sichult filled the screen a fat hazy crescent of white cloud greygreen land and streaks of glinting blue seas lay tipped and swollen across the screen they were close enough for lededje to see depth in the clear thin wrapping of atmosphere and make out the shadows of individual storm cells throwing their dark elongated shapes across the flat white plains of cloud levels extending beneath them home at last lededje breathed she did not the avatar thought sound all that pleased about it hed thought she would have shown more interest in the image of her held by the other culture ship too hed never understand humans ah found him demeisen said smiling lededje stared at him veppers demeisen nodded veppers where she asked hmm interesting the avatar said he looked at her you should dress for the occasion lets get you out of those cumbersome suits she frowned i like these suits and theyre not cumbersome demeisen looked apologetic you wont need them where were going and they do constitute culture tech sorry the seat around lededje gently released her from its grip behind her the modules bathroom had reformed yime nsokyi stood on the rimrock of the shallow jagged canyon carved into the karst above the stars wheeled slowly some long ragged lengths of clouds obscured patches of the sky and in one place the cloud was lit up as though by an enormous searchlight light spilling from an aperture above one of the outlying tributary tunnels of iobe cavern city the resulting blob of uncannily glowing light seemingly hovering just a couple of kilometres above the stillcooling desert looked unsettlingly like a ship there were people in that tower himerance said quietly at yimes side the avatar was monitoring signals from all over the planet while trying to establish contact with the me im counting there were yime asked she closed her eyes shook her head they had commandeered five more vehicles on their way out of the city to this point where finally the avatar felt they were safe himerance had commandeered them anyway using whatever effector tech was built into the humanseeming body of a ship avatar she felt like nothing more than his baggage hauled along from place to place she remembered the stone tower way back in the early evening when shed had to cling on to his back as they raced down the winding steps dashing out through a thick door in the base himerance had muttered something about it being locked from the inside at the time and then with her once more on her own feet running out across a courtyard down some more steps and into a crowded pedestrian street just as a pink beam lanced from the cavern ceiling and struck the tower bringing it down she had wanted to keep her head down and keep on walking away but of course that would have looked suspicious so they had to stop and stare with everybody else for a while how many she asked two himerance said lovers reading between the lines yime sighed looked down the canyon floor held a dirt track scribbled like dropped string between the jagged jumble of fallen rocks and scrawny lightblasted scrub one of us is spreading destruction in their wake himerance yime said and im afraid that its me i wouldnt worry about it the avatar said it looked at her im afraid i am unable to contact the ship not without alerting the nr vessel anyway i see what now then we resort to a much older form of signalling himerance said smiling there was a hint of a glow on the horizon to one side where the dawn would come soon the avatar nodded in that direction we know which direction the ship is coming from with luck and good timing this will work excuse me the avatar stepped in front of her raising his hands shallowly cupped palms outwards in front of his face oriented towards the dim predawn lightsliver over the distant hills he looked round at her you would be advised to turn your back put your hands over your eyes and close your eyelids yime held his gaze for a moment then complied nothing happened for a few seconds what are she was asking when a sudden flash distracted her it was gone almost before she registered it happening all clear himerance said quietly she turned back to find the avatar waving his hands around they were smoking the flesh on the palms and fingers was blackened he blew on them smiled at her then nodded at the ground we should assume the position he told her they squatted side by side her knees and back protesting oh shit she thought as she clasped her hands round her shins and laid her head on her knees here we go again wont be for long he said one way or the other well know quite soo i dont want him to see me lededje said i dont want him to be able to identify me ah demeisen said nodding so you might be able to surprise him later of course she remained silent so do something with your tattoo demeisen said scroll it over your face so it obscures your features may i the avatar gestured towards her face she was standing in the doorway of the modules bathroom area dressed in the sort of casual clothes shed been wearing and feeling perfectly happy and comfortable in ever since shed been brought back to life yet feeling oddly naked vulnerable and exposed now that shed taken off both the outer armoured suit and gel suit within demeisen wore pale loose casual clothes she had thought of setting the tat to transparency so that if veppers saw her he wouldnt know she had it she still had plans to use its by sichultian standards unprecedented abilities to get close to him at some point in the future when shed have a weapon let him hear of some fabulous creature with a tattoo of unheardof complexity and subtlety better and more exclusive than anything he had ever possessed and have him come calling unsuspecting all right she said she watched in a reverser field as the tattoo rearranged itself on her face in less than a second she didnt recognise herself the effect was astounding all that had happened was that the lines bunched here and thickened there became very fine here hinted at shading there at gradients that didnt really exist here and here and here cast a sort of hintedat ruddiness all over her skin and just with that with the suggestion of different planes and lines and altered surfaces colours and textures had easily done enough to make her face look quite completely different she moved her face this way and that put the reverser onto mirror all to check that the effect didnt just work from one angle or when lit only from one direction the effect of disguise remained her face looked broader and darker her brows thicker her nose flatter her lips fuller and her cheekbones less prominent she nodded that is quite good she conceded she turned to the avatar thank you youre welcome demeisen said now can we go as though i have any choice sounds like a hearty affirmation to me wait who do we say she said but then she was staring at the dim distorted reflection of her new strangers face for a moment listening to the words i am sound loud and strange in her ears before she knew it she was standing blinking in the cool pleasantly fragranced air of a large bright room in what must be a tall building the view was of afternoon sky puffy white clouds and a city across a broad wooded park the city looked like ubruater the room was very large and high ceilinged with a large desk in one corner and some tall potted plants dotted about a gleaming wooden floor strewn with beautiful rugs those items aside it was minimally furnished with large pieces in cream and grey on one long seat lounging one arm flung over the back the other holding a small cup sat joiler veppers to his side sat jasken on the other side of a low table sat a large very straightbacked middleaged woman lededje half recognised she had a child on her knee a drone like a small smooth suitcase floated near the womans shoulder a wall screen sound muted was cycling through news channels fuzzy images and clear graphics of dense fleets of ships filled the screen interspersed by wellgroomed very seriouslooking presenters the woman waved one arm languidly towards them mr veppers may i present av demeisen representative of the culture ship falling outside the normal moral constraints and guest ship mr joiler veppers mr hibin jasken the drone trachelmatis olfeshresh stidikrentra muoltz though i answer to olf the drone said with a sort of sideways bow too much spittle ruins these floors and this is my son liss the woman continued smiling ruffling the blond hair of the young child on her knee he was biting on a biscuit but spared the time to wave then he patted his hair back down im buoytepfaldsa kreit lei huen da motri the woman went on culture ambassador to the enablement she waved her arm again towards a couch across from her at right angles to the one that veppers and jasken sat on please sit down hello all demeisen said loudly radiating bonhomie lededje watched veppers watching her as she and the avatar approached the seating area he looked pretty much as he had hair and skin as full and luxuriant as ever dressed more casually and soberly than he usually was when in the city almost dully as though he was trying to blend in for once nose a little pink and thin at the tip she met his gaze only briefly tried to look unconcerned he was smiling at her she recognised that particular smile it was the one that acknowledged beauty but hinted at vulnerability the one that was meant to say i may be the richest man in the world but i can still be a little unsure of myself around beautiful women like yourself she was aware that jasken was also looking at her but she ignored him she took a couple of quick steps just before they got to the seats so that she sat closer to veppers than demeisen seemed to have intended the avatar was to her right veppers at an angle left and in front the low table held what looked like the remains of a small picnic pots small trays unfolded takeaway plates cups saucers and some scattered cutlery wont you introduce your guest demeisen the ambassador said tsk the avatar said slapping his forehead my manners eh demeisen waved one arm from lededje to veppers doll this is your rapist and murderer veppers you ghastly cunt this is lededje ybreq back from the dead there was a tiny pause lededje took only that moment to register what had just happened then she bounced out of the couch she had barely sat down on scooped up the sharpestlooking knife on the table and threw herself at veppers it was only later she understood how little chance shed really had the knife disappeared from her grip plucked away by demeisen despite the fact he was on her far side from veppers jasken moved less quickly seeming almost to hesitate for a fraction of a second but even as lededje got one hand on veppers throat he was shrinking back eyes widening as she threw herself forward jasken suddenly had her wrist in a grip like steel meanwhile the drone olfeshresh had snapped through the air to her other side whipping a blueglowing force field between her torso and veppers and gripping her left arm keeping that hand held up and away lededje heard herself make an anguished strangling noise as she tried to close her fingers round veppers throat she heard a brief deep humming noise and experienced a sort of coldness wash over her making her skin crawl then her hand still clutching at veppers throat as he thudded back into the back of the couch she felt herself being grabbed round the waist she tried to kick but her legs seemed to have lost contact with her brain she felt hopelessly childishly dizzy her hand was forced back and she was pulled away across the low table in a further scatter of food crockery and cutlery to be plonked down on the couch not where she had been but with demeisen between her and veppers who was sitting back up now and rubbing his throat demeisen had an arm across lededjes upper chest pinning her against some flattened cushions one of his legs was trapping both her legs under the couch gasslikunt said a small voice kreit huen glared at the avatar see what youve done she muttered she cuddled the boy to her patting the nape of his neck and back of his head with her hand motherf lededje began struggling mightily to get out from under demeisens limbs then trying to reach the avatars face with her fingers to tear his eyes out or scratch him or do anything at all to hurt him spirited little thing isnt she veppers said calmly waving jasken away as the other man tried to fuss over him behave demeisen said quietly levelly to lededje ill f she spat heaving herself towards him she got her back about a centimetre away from the couch before she was thrown against it again led the avatar said a small smile on his face you were never going to get a clear shot at him now sit still and behave yourself or i will have to stun you again and more than just your legs this time he loosened his grip on her a little tentatively she sat still looked at him with an expression of cold loathing you unmitigated piece of ordure in human shape she said very quietly why did you lead me on why did you give me any hope at all things change lededje the avatar told her sounding reasonable he withdrew the arm and leg that had been restraining her circumstances and likely consequences thats just the way it is lededje glanced at huen and her child go and stuprate yourself she whispered to the avatar he shook his head made a tsk sound again veppers looked at huen why is this psychotically rude man trying to convince me that this even more berserk young woman is the late lamented ms ybreq and why are they even here he may believe that she is ms ybreq huen told him she turned to the drone handing the child up to it olf please take liss to the playroom this was a mistake im an idiot gasslikunt liss repeated cradled in rubyred fields as the drone took the child and swept away towards the doors huen smiled as she gazed after the boy waving when the doors closed she turned back to veppers i am not entirely sure why av demeisen thought to bring this young lady with him but i wanted him here because he represents the most powerful vessel in the vicinity with the power to overturn any agreement we might make if he doesnt concur we need him onside joiler veppers had a sort of calculating look about him demeisen thought he was also going on heartrate capillary contraction and skin moisture readings profoundly rattled though hiding it extremely well the mans gaze shifted eyes hooded a little from the ambassador to lededje but im still being asked to believe that this person is some sort of reincarnated version of ms ybreq he said as his gaze alighted on demeisen and this offensively rude lying young man allegedly representing a powerful culture spacecraft is allowed to make outrageous and obscene accusations without i presume being subject to any of the legal sanctions i would seek to impose on anybody else saying anything so utterly mendacious and potentially if anybody else was sufficiently demented to take his ravings seriously so horrendously damaging to my reputation is that right about the size of it demeisen agreed cheerily clearing up some of the mess lededjes lunge across the table had caused jasken still with one wary eye on the girl was sorting some of the debris on his side you like to take your women from behind lededje said quietly staring at veppers usually while facing a mirror sometimes especially when you are drunk you like to lean forward and bite the right shoulder blade of the woman you are fucking always the right never the left i have no idea why you mutter ah yesss fucking take it sometimes when you orgasm you have a small black mole just under the fold of your right armpit which is the only blemish you have allowed to remain on your body purely for the purposes of identification you scratch the right corner of your mouth when you are worried and trying to decide what course of action to take you secretly despise peschl your lawyer because he is gay but keep him on because he is very good at his job and it is important to you to make people think that you are not homophobic i think you may have had some sort of homosexual experience at school with your friend sapultride you think the screen director kostrle is grotesquely overrated though you fund his works and advance him at every opportunity because he seems fashionable and you desire his yes yes yes veppers said youve done your research well done clever girl still demeisen noticed veppers involuntary stress signs had peaked again and jasken was suddenly trying hard not to stare at either his master or lededje veppers turned to huen madam can we get to the point of things here demeisen turned quickly to lededje are you mad he asked her quietly burning my boats you treacherous fuck she said her voice sounding quiet and hollow if i cant kill the bastard maybe i can unsettle him a little its all youve left me she barely looked at the avatar as she said this av demeisen the ambassador said sitting up straight and brushing some crumbs from her fingers you need to listen to this she nodded to veppers veppers looked at the avatar he took in a breath then expelled it glanced at huen this person really does represent a culture ship youre sure yesthe ambassador said watching demeisen rather than looking at veppers as she addressed him get on with it veppers shook his head oh well he smiled insincerely at the avatar who smiled just as insincerely back the smatter is a diversion veppers told him i made one agreement with the flekke and nr to stay out of any conflict regarding the hells smokescreen i never intended to keep it i made another agreement with the gfcf to provide them with targets for a fleet of ships they would build in the tsungarial disk while the culture and anybody else who might have interfered was tied up with the smatter outbreak that is the agreement that i intend to keep so long as nothing untoward befalls me those targets are the hellswell the substrates running them the vast majority of them at any rate all the important ones and they are here huen said on sichult is that right veppers smiled at her here or hereabouts huen nodded slowly the latest reports i have indicate that a substantial number of the disk built ships have surprisingly escaped the confines of the tsung system possibly powered by unexpected amounts of power no one thought they might possess and are headed this way she said glancing at demeisen to sichult sudden rush of antimatter to the engines the avatar said nodding vigorously ive an element or two running them down but a number will likely get through their targets are in or around sichult veppers said ill call in the exact locations when theyre closer demeisens eyes narrowed really thats cutting it awfully fine isnt it timing is everything veppers said smiling the point is he said sitting forward on his couch towards demeisen who sensed lededje tensing and without looking put one arm out and behind him across her chest preventing her from moving that im on your side sailor boy veppers directed another perfectly insincere smile at the avatar who this time did not reciprocate on my sayso veppers continued if im around to give it and enough ships get through to deliver the killer blows all those nasty horrible hells will get wasted and all the poor tortured souls will be released from their torment veppers tipped his head to one side interrogatively so what we need from you is some sort of guarantee that you wont interfere with any of this maybe youll even help the ships get through or at least stop anybody else the nr say from interfering with them veppers glanced at lededje before looking back to the avatar deal good grief yes demeisen said reaching across the table to the sichultian deal he nodded vigorously sorry for any earlier remarks nothing personal he kept his hand stuck out and nodded at it veppers looked at demeisens open waiting hand youll forgive me he told the avatar i prefer not to shake hands one never knows where other peoples have been totally understand demeisen said withdrawing his hand without any apparent selfconsciousness i have your word veppers said looking from huen to demeisen both of you i have your word your personal and representational guarantee that ill come to no harm yes absolutely ambassador huen said given a deal is a fucking deal demeisen agreed youll suffer no harm from me i swear the avatar looked round at lededje sitting simmering on the couch behind him or my little pal here he took her by the shoulders with one arm shook her she looked into his eyes liar she said softly demeisen appeared not to hear he sat back grinning veppers found some unspilled infusion in an insulated pot poured a little into his cup and sat back sipping it gazing levelly at lededje he smiled at her shrugged oh come on whoever you are this is just how things are done those of us with advantage will always seek to increase it and those wishing to make deals will always find somebody like me on the other side of the table who else would you expect veppers gave a small nasal laugh like a single halfsnorted breath through his healing nose life frankly is mostly meetings young lady he told her he favoured her with a more relaxed smile lededje i should say if that really is you he frowned looked at huen of course if she really is who she says she is she does rather belong to me huen shook her head no she doesnt she said veppers blew unnecessarily on his infusion really my dear ambassador that may have to be settled through the courts im afraid no it wont demeisen told him grinning veppers looked at lededje before he could say whatever it was he had been going to say lededje said your last words to me were i was supposed to appear in public this evening remember veppers smile faltered only briefly were they now he glanced at jasken who quickly looked down how amazing he pulled an oldfashioned watch from one pocket heavens is that the time those ships are just about upon us huen said i know veppers said brightly and where better to be when they arrive than with the culture ambassador under the protection of a culture warship he gestured from huen to demeisen who nodded few hundred got through demeisen said inner system and outer planetary defences somewhat struggling to cope modicum of panic amongst the cluedup societal strata thinking this might be the end masses happily ignorant danger will have passed by the time they find out about it demeisen nodded seemingly with approval well he said apart from that second wave of ships obviously that might cause some excitement later isnt it about time you told them where their targets are huen said veppers appeared to consider this there are two waves he said sensing some rather premature glitterage from the city there demeisen muttered waving towards the buildings across the park the wall screen was cycling through some blank hazed staticfilled channels now the rest were still concentrating on graphics and talking heads displays of sparks like daylight fireworks and some thin beams of light directed straight up seemed to be issuing from the summits of some of the higher skyscrapers in ubruaters central business district huen looked sceptically at demeisen glitterage she asked the avatar shrugged veppers looked at his antique watch again then at jasken who nodded briefly veppers stood well things to do time to go he announced madam he said nodding at the ambassador fascinating to meet you he said to demeisen he looked at lededje i wish you peace young lady he smiled broadlyat any rate a pleasure he and jasken who nodded a trio of his own goodbyes made their way to towards the doors the drone olfeshresh floated nearby having reappeared earlier without anybody noticing thing veppers said to it as he passed the two men passed beyond the doors moments later sudden bursts of light stuttered in the evening sky beyond the city the wall screen flickered hazed then went to standby hmm demeisen said his own estate he looked at huen surprise to you too profoundly she said demeisen glanced at lededje he flicked her nearest knee with one finger snap out of it babe its not about your little revenge trip were getting hells destroyed for free not even on our conscience seriously who do you really think matters most here you or a trillion people suffering fucking get grownup about it wont you your man veppers skipping off with a jaunty smile on his admittedly eminently punchable face is a small price to pay a roar from overhead announced veppers flier departing demeisen looked round at lededje you lying inconstant philandering fuck she told him the avatar shook his head looked at the ambassador kids eh twentyeight she was in her sleeping pod the aching fruit within its dark enfolding confinement when whatever happened happened she had been slowly stretching herself extending one wing and then the other creakingly with much jointgrumbling and tendongrating and what felt like even the leathery fabric of her wings protesting then rotating her neck as best she could against what felt like the gravel filling her vertebrae then flexing first one leg and then the other hanging by a single clawed talon each time then without warning there was a sort of shiver in the air as though the shock wave of a great explosion far away had just passed by the pod around her started to shake then it froze somehow as though the blow that had struck it had been cancelled from reality rather than allowed to ring on through the fabric of her great dark roost she knew immediately there was something odd and unprecedented about it something that hinted at outside at an existential change to her surroundings maybe even to the hell itself she thought of the glitch the silver mirrorbarrier the patch where the landscape had been deleted smoothed over she had lost count of how many thousands she had dispatched since she had been brought back here she had meant to keep count but had baulked at scratching a mark for each death on the interior surface of her roost she had considered this because it just seemed so cold shed attempted to keep count in her head but then lost it a few times and then for a long time had thought that it didnt matter the last figure she remembered was three thousand eight hundred and eightyfive but that had been a long time ago she had probably killed at least that number again since the pain grew each time after each killing each release every day she existed in a sort of continual haze of aching limbs and oversensitive skin and grinding sinew and evercramping internal organs she liked to think that she ignored it but she couldnt really it was there all the time from when she woke to when she fell moaning grumbling asleep it was there in her dreams too she dreamed of bits of her body falling off or developing their own lives tearing themselves off her and flying or falling or walking or slithering away leaving her screaming bereft bleeding and raw every day it was a struggle to let go of the upsidedown perch quit her roost pod and scour the blackened poxaddled lands beneath for a fresh soul to release she was getting later and later these days once she had flown for the joy of it because flight was still flight even in hell and felt like freedom for somebody who had grown up a devoutly grounddwelling quadruped providing one got over ones fear of heights of course which somehow since the longago days when shed grown old within a convent perched on a rock she had once she had loved to go exploring fascinated to find the parts of hell she hadnt discovered before she was almost invariably horrified by what she found no matter where she looked but she was fascinated nevertheless just the geography then the logistics then the hatefully sadistic inventiveness of it all was enough to captivate the inquiring mind and she had made full use of her ability to fly over the ground that lesser unfortunates had to crawl limp stagger and fight over no longer she rarely flew far from her roost to find somebody to kill and eat and usually waited until she felt such pangs of hunger that she no longer had any real choice in the matter it was a delicate balance and a tricky choice trying to decide whether her grumbling empty guts were causing her more discomfort as the day went on than the everpresent shoals and flocks of aches and pains that seemed to squall through her like some bizarre parasitic infection her status as a soulreleasing angel had slipped she suspected people came from all around to be blessed by her but there was not the same level of worship she had enjoyed before she no longer appeared almost anywhere to anyone now you had to be able to make your way to near where she lived that changed things she had become a localised service she suspected the demons had finally got wise and were arranging for certain individuals to be more or less presented to her for death and release she did not want to think what unlikely favours or perverse rewards the demons exacted for this and frankly she no longer cared she was glad that it really did seem to release this or that particular soul from its suffering but all the same it was just what she did what she had no choice but to do the last interesting thing had been when shed gone to see the uberdemon shed been wondering about the glitch shed discovered the patch of hill and cliff and factory that had simply disappeared and after what had felt like weeks of mulling it over had finally summoned up the strength to fly to where the vast demon sat and ask it what had happened a failure hed roared at her as shed flapped painfully in front of him still careful not to get too close to those terrible bodycrushing hands something went wrong wiped everything from that area landscape buildings demons the tormented all just ceased to be released more of the undeserving wretches in a blink of an eye than youve set free in all the time youve worked for me ha now fuck off and stop troubling me with matters even i have no control over now this she felt different the pod she was hanging in felt different and it was as though all the pain she had taken on was evaporating a sort of backsurge of relief wellbeing almost sexual nearly orgasmic in its contrasting intensity washed through her sloshing back and forth within her as though she was the hollow presence here not the podroost the sensation slowly lost energy and dampened down leaving her feeling clean and good for the first time in longer than she could recall she found that she had let go of the perch but was still hanging where she had been her body seemed different too no longer so great and terrible and fierce no longer hells dark angel of release trying to look at it she realised she couldnt really see what she had become instead either it was as though everything about her had become pixelated smoothed out she had some sort of body but it somehow contained all the possibilities

fixated on simple continual multiplication that they had not yet decided what to become she floated to the limit of the pod it all looked and felt different smaller quieter completely silent and without the stink she realised had been in her nostrils for as long as shed been back the air in here now was probably completely neutral odourfree but that absence smelled like the sweetest freshest mountain meadow breeze to her after what shed been used to for so long there was however no exit no way out of the pod even where the hole at the foot had been this troubled her less than she would have anticipated the walls of the pod were neither soft nor hard they were untouchable she reached for them but it felt as though there was some perfectly clear glass between her and them she struggled even to tell what colour the walls were such relief such relief no longer to be in pain she closed her eyes feeling things wind up wind down go into a sort of static stored steady state something was happening something had happened she would not even start to think about what it might be or what it might imply or mean hope she recalled had to be resisted at all costs a sort of

better definition on the main screen of veppers hired flier though the amount of signal scrambling was still obvious was back to looking as calm as usual the first wave seems to have done what was required of it the legislatoradmiral conceded the pursuing element of the culture capital ship has also continued on past sichult and appears set on hunting down all the ships they wont be returning bettlescroy shook its head smiled the image broke up a little struggling to cope with such dynamism there is going to be a lot of space debris around the quyn system veppers far less than in the tsung system of course but more troublesome due to the higher amounts of daytoday traffic around sichult the legislatoradmiral glanced at another screen youve already lost numerous elements of your soletta some important satellites actually almost all your satellites both close and synchronous have had their orbits altered at least temporarily by the gravity wells of the passing ships and at least two small manned space vehicles including one carrying a party of twentyplus college students would seem to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when the ships went past i hope youve been watching the skies should have been quite a pretty display veppers smiled happily i own most of the major spacedebrisclearing satellite and shipbuilding and solettamaintenance companies i expect many lucrative government contracts i imagine my sorrow for your loss will prove containable are you on your way to your estate house the latest estimates have the second wave arriving between forty and fifty minutes from now nearly there veppers said think we saw the last of the missiles landing close in a few minutes ago he watched jaskens side of the screen where a dark only halffamiliar landscape was still unrolling towards them slowing as the flier braked on either side of the aircraft what looked like gigantic black hedges kilometres high rose up still growing into the evening sky at their bases spattered wavy lines of craters some still glowing were surrounded by the remains of smashed and burning trees blackened still smouldering fields of crops smaller copses woods and forests just catching alight and the occasional wrecked and burning farm building the smoke appeared to hem the flier in and rise even higher the closer they got they had seen various ground vehicles on the estate roads all sensibly fleeing towards the perimeter veppers had thought hed recognised at least one of them after catching a fleeting glimpse of a sleek yellow blob heading away fast along the estates main access road thats my fucking limited edition whiscord hed muttered watching the slim shape disappear behind them through the smoke i dont even let myself drive it that fast thieving bastard somebodys in a lot of trouble on the comms there was silence jasken had been trying to contact people at the house since theyd set out but without success elsewhere it was chaotic a combination of the disturbed satellites electromagnetic discharges and pulses associated with the energy weapons hypervelocity kinetics tearing through the atmosphere and nukes had left the area around espersium in utter communicative disarray and sent a systemsderanging shock through the comms of the whole planet well i wouldnt delay bettlescroy said the remaining ships of the second wave are being severely harried by the culture shipelement following them and may not have as much time as we would like to carry out the most precise of attacks id aim to be tens of kilometres away along or up when they drop by just in case duly noted veppers said as ahead he caught the first glimpse of the mansion house in the distance surrounded by walls of smoke ill grab a few precious items tell any remaining staff theyre free to leave if they wish and be gone within half an hour he glanced at jasken as he cut the connection with bettlescroy weve got that have we sir jasken said veppers regarded his security chief for a moment i want you to know this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do jasken hed delayed telling jasken what was going to happen to the estate until the last moment hed thought the man would accept this as just correct standard needtoknow security procedure but now he thought about it he supposed even the ultraprofessional jasken might feel a little miffed hed been kept in the dark for so long these are your lands sir jasken said your house yours to dispose of as you wish he glanced at veppers was there some warning for the people on the estate sir none whatsoever veppers said that would have been idiotic anyway who wanders the trackways ive been keeping them as devoid of people as i can for over a century veppers sensed jasken wanting to say something more but holding back this was all i could do jasken he told him sir jasken said tightly not looking at him veppers could tell the other man was struggling to control his feelings he sighed jasken i was lucky to be able to offload the nr hell back to them theyre one of the few civs still willing to host their own and not care who knows it everybody else seems to have got cold feet nobody else i took them from would take them back they were happy and relieved to get rid of them decades ago thats why i got such lucrative deals in the first place they were desperate i even looked into placing them elsewhere quite recently gfcf put me in touch with something called a bulbousian or something but it refused the gfcf said it would have been too unreliable anyway id never have got the approval of the hells owners youve no idea how tied my hands are here jasken i cant even just close the substrates down there are laws that our galactic betters have seen fit to pass regarding what they think of as living beings and some people in the hells are there voluntarily believe it or not and thats without taking into account the penalty clauses in the agreements i signed taking responsibility for the hells which are prohibitive even punitive believe me and even if i did ignore all that the substrates under the trackways cant be switched off theyre designed to keep going through almost anything even cutting down all the trees would only make them switch to the bio energy theyve stored in the root systems take decades to exhaust youd have to dig it all up shred it and incinerate it or hit it with nukes energy weapons and hyperkinetics jasken said sounding tired as the flier rocked through a tumbling wall of smoke exactly veppers said whats happening here counts as force majeure gets us off that contractual hook he paused reached over and touched jasken on one shoulder i have thought all this through jasken this is the only way they had avoided most of the slowdrifting smoke until now it was rising almost straight up shifted only a little by faint and fitful breezes though the fires now starting to take hold were creating their own winds outside beneath this close to the house it was almost midnight dark here at the centre of all the destroyed and still flaming remains of the strewn cratered trackways they crossed the circle of satellite plinths where once domes had stood and now prone stippled phased array plates lay processing the comms which linked the house and all that had been around it to the the rest of the world the enablement and everything beyond part of himself veppers realised wanted to call a halt now enough damage had been done the trackways and the substrates they had hidden were gone or going the comms didnt matter without what they had to communicate the hells were erased or so reduced they werent worthy of the name any more but he knew that what had happened so far wouldnt be enough it was all about perception when the smoke cleared figuratively as well as literally he needed to look like the victim here it wouldnt seem that way if the house got away unscathed and only the lands about it were hit some landscaping bit of decontamination and then copious treeplanting whod give him any sympathy just for that still jasken said as they passed above game courts lawns and the corner of the great maze all mostly dark lit only by a few bright embers that had drifted in from the burning lands all around they might have expected a little more sir another glance the people i mean sir your people theyve given yes my people jasken veppers said watching as the fliers landing legs deployed and the craft floated down through darkness fire and confusion towards the flamelit torus of espersium house who like you have always been well paid and looked after and known the kind of man i am yes sir he watched jasken as they passed over the roofs of the mansion the cladding was dotted with scattered bits of flaming twigs and small branches which a few of the staff were running around trying to put out rather pointless veppers thought the roof was fireproof still people needed to do something he supposed the flier poised ready to drop into the central courtyard of the house there isnt anyone special to you that i dont know about here is there jasken veppers asked on the estate i mean youve hidden it very well if there is no sir jasken said as the flier descended into the empty heart of the torusshaped building no one special well thats as well veppers glanced at the antique watch as the skids touched the flagstones of the courtyard and the craft settled we need to be back aboard in twentyfive minutes he pushed the seat restraints aside and stood lets go ill stay with you if you want demeisen said i dont want lededje told him just go right guess id better stuff to shoot ambassador huen held up one hand wait you dont think we need any extra protection when that second wave comes through she asked looking sceptical i another bit of me might have run them all down before they can get here demeisen said i strongly suspect ill account for a few myself in passing on the way back to the main event out at tsung plus the inner system and planetary boys will be better prepared and have longer this time this lot look like theyre preparing to crashstop which also implies greater accuracy from them should be safe enough he nodded towards the city where a little smoke was drifting lessening all the time from the summits of some of the towers and skyscrapers last resort thats what your glitterage is for he looked quizzically at the ambassador performed a curtsy by your leave maam huen nodded thank you pleasure demeisen turned grinning to lededje he winked at her youll get over it then he was a silvery ovoid stood on its end it vanished with a faint popping noise lededje felt herself let out a breath huen looked at the drone olfeshresh then closed her eyes for a moment as though tired ah she said finally we get the official version she looked at lededje im told you are indeed ms ybreq in that case i am glad to see you again lededje though given the circumstances of your death murder lededje said standing and going to the window looking over the park to the city her back to the other woman and the drone floating at the ambassadors shoulder beyond the city in the dimming evening light more flashes lit up distant dark clouds that had not been there before murder then huen said the rest of what demeisen alleged all true huen was silent for a few moments then i am very sorry i truly am lededje i hope you realise we had little choice to let veppers go i mean and to treat with him lededje stared at the distant buildings watching the little wisps of smoke die her eyes full of tears she shrugged flapped one hand in what she hoped looked like a sort of dismissal she didnt trust herself to say anything in the reflection she saw huen turn her head fractionally towards the drone olfeshresh the ambassador said tells me you are in possession of considerable funds controlled by a card in one of your pockets i was going to ask what you intended to do now but then another silvery ovoid appeared just where the one that had taken demeisen had stood it was gone in an instant while lededje was still turning round and demeisen was standing there again lededje almost yelped suddenly busy round here demeisen said to huen he spared lededje the briefest of nods youve more visitors id better stick around for a few moments say hi huen looked at the drone the exloume im counting of the ulterior olfeshresh announced just arrived two more silvery ellipsoids came and went revealing two tall panhuman but most certainly not sichultian people a man and an androgynous figure that looked slightly more female than male the man was bald and dressed in severelooking dark clothes lededje recognised him though he looked more alien than the last time theyd met the other person wore a sort of suit even more formallooking in grey prebeignfrultesa yime leutze nsokyi dam volsh the drone announced and av himerance of the exlou me im counting ms ybreq himerance said softly bowing to her good to see you again do you remember me lededje swallowed wished shed had time to dry her eyes and did her best to smile i do good to see you too himerance and demeisen exchanged looks then nods demeisen stared at yime nsokyi gaze flicking over her from boot sole to high collar you know he said im sure ive seen somebody else in quietus wearing exactly the same clothes as youre wearing now its called a uniform av demeisen yime told him patiently it is what we wear in quietus no we feel it shows respect for those on whose behalf we work really demeisen looked thunderstruck fuck me i had no idea the dead could be so demanding yime nsokyi smiled the tolerant smile of those longused to such remarks and executed a sort of noddingbow to lededje ms ybreq i have come a long way to meet with you are you well lededje shook her head not great demeisen clapped his hands well riotous fun though this is i really need to be putting some heliopauses between me and here see you all around ambassador huen held up one hand delaying demeisen to his obvious annoyance do you think veppers told the truth earlier she asked when he implied he had yet to reveal the targets for this second wave of ships of course not can i go now i mean im going to go but may i with your permission given we seem to be observing excruciatingly correct protocol huen smiled and gave a small nod there was just about a delay between huen nodding and the silvery ellipsoid forming and collapsing the popping noise was more of a bang this time huen saw lededjes shoulders relax again the girl shook her head muttered excuse me and went back to looking out of the window are we clear olf huen asked the drone we are maam the machine told her ms nsokyi av himerance the ambassador said to what do we owe the honour i have been sent by quietus to check on ms ybreq as she is a recent reventee yime nsokyi said and i promised to bring ms nsokyi here himerance said though i also thought it would be pleasant to pay my respects to ms ybreq there was an anguished noise from near the window where lededje was staring at her reflection her nose almost pressing against the glass while the fingers of her right hand stabbed at the skin on the inside of her left wrist they all looked she whirled round now the fucking tats stopped working she looked round all of them meeting mostly blank looks huen sighed looked at the drone olfes would you calling demeisens image appeared translucent on the polished wooden floor just bright enough to throw a reflection now what the image said waving its arms gaze directed at lededje i thought you couldnt wait to get rid of me whats happened to my tat she demanded what are you talking about its stopped working the image appeared to squint staring at her hmm it said see what you mean looks like its frozen well that will happen probably from when i had to halfstun you to stop you ripping veppers throat out collateral damage sorry my apologies well fix it cant heading fast for tsung have to displace you and the tat and im already too far away and getting further away too quickly ask the drone beyond my ken olfeshresh said ive had a quick look i cant even see how it works come back lededje wailed fix it its stuck the way it was the image nodded okay will do not right now though day or two later the image had disappeared by the time the word later reached lededjes ears she buried her face in her hands and roared huen looked at the drone which made a shaking motion not picking up it said quietly is there anything i can do we can do yime said lededje collapsed onto her haunches face still hidden in her hands huen looked thoughtfully at her then raised her gaze to the quietus agent and the avatar perhaps she said there is let me explain the situation before you do that demeisens voice said from huens desk may i add something oh for fucks sake lededje breathed taking her hands away from her face and rolling backwards to lie on the floor staring up at the ceiling is there no getting away from this fucking machine huen was frowning at the drone i thought we were clear she said as did i the machine said aura field purplegrey with embarrassment well couldnt help overhearing demeisens voice said liar huen muttered and i thought you might like to hear this just dropped into my inbox at it were theoretically anonymous but it definitely came from my new best chum the bright and breezy nr bismuth category ship partial photic boundary slightly lofi after a lot of processing demanglement but i think youll forgive it that its from about three hours ago between mr v and legislatoradmiral bettlescroybisspeblispin iii the bod in charge of the gfcf forces here in the enablement here we go anyway veppers voice said also coming from whatever comms gear was hidden in huens desk to reiterate every trackway is underlain by what to the untutored eye looks like some sort of giant fungal structure it isnt its substrate lowpower biobased not ultrafast running but highefficiency highly damageresistant substrate anything from ten to thirty metres thick under and amongst the roots but adding up to over half a cubic kilometre of processing power spread throughout the estate all the comms traffic to and from is channelled through the phased array satellite links dotted round the mansion house itself thats what you have to hit bettlescroy the undertrackway substrates contain over seventy per cent of the hells in the entire galaxy of those we know of anyway used to be slightly more but very recently i subcontracted the nr hell just to be on the safe side ive been buying hells up for over a century legislatoradmiral taking the processing requirements and legal and jurisdictional implications off other peoples hands for most of my business life the majority of the hells are right here in system on planet that is why i have always felt able to be so relaxed regarding the targeting details think you can get enough ships to sichult to lay waste to my estate truly another voice said the targets are on your own estates why would you do that deniability bettlescroy youll have to raze the trackways wreck my lands blast the satellite links and damage the house itself maybe even destroy it that house has been in my family for centuries it and the estate are inestimably precious to me or at least so everybody assumes whos going to believe i brought all that destruction on myself and so on demeisens voice told them then theres this really good bit and the people what people the people on the estate when it is laid waste oh yes i assume i have a few hours before any attack takes place theres a bit of blahblahblah here from our boy bettlescroy demeisens voice said then so bottom line they heard veppers say id have time to get a few people out not too many of course it still has to look convincing but i can always hire more people bettlescroy never a shortage of those ever fascinating what demeisens voice said from huens desk specially the bit about handing the nrs themepark of woe over to somebody else before all the other hells got wasted bet he thought that was being clever getting the nr off his back just like the gfcf thought they were being clever swiping all that nr comms knowledge back in the wheneverwhen never thinking it might come with trapdoors the nr could tap into and copy their comms any time they wanted dont you think its hilarious when people think theyre being terribly clever i know i do just as well some of us genuinely fucking are or wed be in a hell of a fucking state well my work here is done mostly anyway still more smatterships to smashify be seeing you there was silence in the room for a while the drone olfeshresh made a shaking motion well it said to huen again i think were clear and its gone but then i thought that the last time on the floor lying loosely spread shaking her head lededje sighed huen looked up from her to yime and himerance obviously she said there are things we ought not to be doing or taking part in here either for firstprinciple moral reasons or due to the regrettable exigencies of realpolitik she paused however twentynine the scoudenfrast i think no jasken thats a scundrundri the scoudenfrast is the one alongside the purple one with the yellow splodges i always did think scundrundri was overrated besides with these gone the rest i have in the town house will be worth more nolyen give mr jasken a hand with these out to the flier would you sir quickly both of you sir jasken said he lifted an armful of old masters and headed for the end of the long curved gallery followed by nolyen similarly laden it was gloomy in the place the house was relying on its emergency lighting and not even all of that was functioning properly nolyen a big dim country lad from the kitchens dropped one of the paintings he was carrying and struggled to pick it up again jasken came back and used his foot to help lever the thing back up into the boys hands veppers watched all this sighing he was actually a little bit disappointed in his staff and their commitment hed expected to find more people here in the house worried over the fate of their master they still thought he might be dead after all and determined to help save the house from the surrounding and encroaching fires instead hed discovered that most of them had already fled the place theyd taken to the wheeled vehicles that the estate used on a daytoday basis and to those from veppers own collection of automotive exotica stored and cared for in some of the mansions underground garages there were some fliers left dotted about the place but it looked like theyd fallen victim to the same stray radiation pulses that had knocked out the local comms nolyen had greeted them joyfully as theyd left the flier and somebody had shouted a gladyouresafesir or something similar from the roof as theyd walked across the courtyard but that was about it ingrates veppers had muttered as they made their way to the gallery with the most expensive paintings four minutes and ill see you at the number three strongroom veppers called after jasken who arms full of paintings just turned and nodded veppers supposed they could have cut the paintings from the frames like thieves did but that had seemed wrong somehow veppers jogged along the gallery down a radial corridor towards some splendidly tall windows my there was a lot of smoke and even some flame out there and it was far too dark for the time of evening and let himself into his study he sat at his desk the study was dark in the patchy emergency lighting he allowed himself the poignant luxury of one last look round the place thinking how sad and yet also how oddly exciting it was that it might all soon be gone then he started opening drawers and compartments the desk selfpowered identifying him by his smell as well as by his palm and fingerprints made soft sighing snicking noises as it obeyed him a little familiar oasis of calm and reassurance in all the chaos he filled a small hide carrybag with all the most precious and useful things he could think of the last thing he lifted after a slight hesitation was a pair of knives sheathed in skinsoft hide that had belonged to his grandfather and before that to somebody elses a wind seemed to be getting up judging from the way smoke was moving on the far side of the barely visible formal gardens however despite all the commotion outside little sound got through the multiply glazed and bulletproof windows he was just closing the last drawer ready to go when he heard a noise like a faint pop he looked up and saw a tall dark alien figure standing looking at him from near the closed doors for a moment he thought it might be ambassador huen but it was somebody else thin with a toostraight contortedlooking back dressed in different shades of dark grey can i help you he said putting the stillopen hide bag down at his feet where he sat and dipping one hand into it feeling around he made a waving distracting gesture with his other hand for example with your manners we tend to knock first here mr joiler veppers my name is prebeignfrultesa yime leutze nsokyi dam volsh the figure said in an oddly accented voice that might have been female but that definitely didnt appear to be entirely in synch with its lipmovements i am a citizen of the culture i am here to apprehend you on suspicion of murder will you come with me how can i put this he said raising and firing the alientech gun in the same movement the gun made a loud snapping noise light flared in the dim study and the alien disappeared in a silvery shimmer the doors immediately behind where it had been standing burst open against their hinges swinging broken and hanging into the corridor beyond in a flurry of black dust a semicircular hole punched in each circumferenced with glowing yellowwhite sparks veppers looked at the gun a present from the jhlupian xingre long ago then at the stillswinging smoking doors and finally at the patch of rug where the figure had been standing hmm he said he shrugged stood stuffed the gun into his waistband snapped the hide bag shut and waved some of the noxious fumes away from his face as he exited through the wrecked doors which were starting to burn jasken he heard the female voice pronounce his name behind him and knew it was her he placed the paintings carefully on the floor of the flier and turned nolyen had stopped in the doorway of the flier he was staring over the top of the paintings he held at the young woman standing by the door to the flight deck perhaps he was intimidated by the scrollwork of faint tattooed lines covering her face miss jasken said nodding to her it is me jasken i know he said he turned his head deliberately nodding to nolyen leave those nolyen never mind anything else just leave get well away from the house nolyen set the paintings down he hesitated get away nolyen jasken said sir the young man said then turned and left lededje watched him go then turned back to jasken you let him kill me hib jasken sighed no i tried to stop him but in the end all right i could have done more and i suppose i could have killed him after he killed you so im as bad as he is hate me if you like i dont claim to be a particularly good person led and there is such a thing as duty i know i thought you might feel some towards me my first is towards him whether either of us likes it or not because he pays your wages and all i did was let you fuck me no because i pledged myself to his service i never said anything to you that contradicted that no you didnt did you she gave a wan smile i suppose i should have spotted that how very correct of you even while you were despoiling his property all those little whispered words of tenderness about how much i meant what we might hope for in the future were you always reviewing them as you said them running them past some lawyer bit in your brain looking for inconsistencies something like that jasken told her meeting her gaze he shook his head we never had a future led not the sort you wanted to imagine more quick couplings while his back was turned hidden from everyone until one of us got bored or he found out you belonged to him for ever didnt you ever understand that we were never going to be able to run away together he looked down then back up into her eyes again or are you going to tell me you loved me because i always thought you took me as a lover just to get back at him and have me onside for the next time you tried to escape didnt fucking work did it she said bitterly you helped him hunt me down i had no choice you didnt have to run as really thats not how it felt to me as soon as you did i had to do what my duty to him demanded so none of it meant anything she was crying a little now but quickly wiped both cheeks with the back of her wrists tears smeared across the tattoo lines more fool me because i didnt come back just to kill veppers i needed to ask how she stopped swallowed did it mean nothing to you jasken sighed of course it meant something a sweetness moments ill never forget it just couldnt mean what you wanted it to mean she laughed without hope or humour then i am a fool am i not she said shaking her head i really did think you might love me he gave the smallest of smiles oh i loved you with all my heart from the very first she glared at him he stared at her eyes bright its just that love is not enough led not always not these days maybe not ever and never around people like joiler veppers she looked down at the floor of the flier brought her arms up and hugged herself jasken glanced at the time display on the fliers bulkhead could be as little as a quarter of an hour till the second wave arrives he said his tone was concerned even kind you seemed to get here pretty fast can you get away again just as quickly she nodded she sniffed back her tears wiped her cheeks and eyes again do one thing for me she said what he asked go go i cant just now just leave take the flier and go save the servants and staff all you can find but leave him here with me she looked into his eyes jasken hesitated his jaw working she shook her head hes finished hib she said the nr the nauptre they know they can intercept whatever passes between him and the gfcf they know about his agreement about how he tricked them the culture know everything too the hells are gone so he cant use those to save himself now he wont be allowed to get away with all hes done even if the enablement can turn a blind eye to something on this scale hes got the nr and the culture to answer to she smiled a small halfdespairing smile he finally found people more powerful than he is to fall foul of she shook her head again but the point is you cant save him all you can save now is yourself she nodded towards the open door of the flier and anybody else you can find out there jasken looked out through one of the highlevel ports in the flier at the skies above the dully lit mansion a wall of smoke like the end of the world was lit from beneath by flames what about you he asked i dont know she said ill try to find him now it was her turn to hesitate i will kill him if i can not pretending otherwise he wont be an easy man to kill i know she shrugged perhaps i wont have to a condition of me getting this chance was that one of the culture people went to confront him give him the chance to turn himself in jasken gave a small snorting laugh think thatll work no she tried to smile failed jasken looked into her eyes for a little while then he reached behind his back and brought out a small gun holding it by the barrel as he passed it to her try the number three strongroom she took the gun thank you their hands hadnt touched as the weapon passed from him to her she looked at the gun will it still work she asked the ship was going to disable all the electronic weapons most are already fried jasken told her but that onell work just metal and chemicals ten shots safety catch is on the side facing you move that little lever till you can see the red dot he watched her take the safety off he realised shed probably never handled a gun in her life take care he told her another hesitation as he seemed to think about coming towards her hugging or holding or kissing her but then she said you too and turned and left walking out of the flier and across the courtyard jasken looked at the floor for a moment then along it to the paintings in their ornate frames lededje found the young servant nolyen in the archway leading to the main vestibule crouched on his haunches you were supposed to leave nolyenshe said i know miss he said he looked like hed been crying too go back to the flier nolyen she told him mr jasken will need help looking for people to take to safety now quickly still time nolyen ran back towards the flier and helped jasken throw the paintings out before they took off to look for people to save he jogged down the stairs to the basement the stairwell was poorly lit and hed forgotten how far down the level holding the deepest strongrooms was hed rung for a lift up in the house but even as hed stood watching the floorindicator display winking on and off with an error code hed realised he shouldnt step into an elevator car in the circumstances even if one did arrive he stopped on the last landing above a pool of darkness beneath and dug inside the hide bag pulling out a pair of nightvision glasses lighter less bulky but also less sophisticated versions of the oculenses jasken had worn they werent working either he threw them away next thing he tried was a torch but the flashlight refused to work too he smashed it against the wall that felt good at least the bag was getting lighter he felt his way down the last few stairs and opened the door to the betterlit corridor beyond pipes and conduits covered the ceiling the floor was concrete and a few large metal doors were the only adornments to the roughcast walls a few very dim lights were on constantly others were flickering he was a little surprised jasken wasnt here already he supposed time seemed to move oddly when everything was getting this fraught he checked the antique watch at least twelve minutes to go the strongroom door was a massive circular metal plug as tall as a man and a metre thick the display hed forgotten it even had a display was blinking an error message cunt he screamed smashing one fist on the door he rolled the code in anyway but the noises the mechanism made didnt even sound right and the display didnt alter certainly there was no series of reassuring clicks from umpteen places round the doors circumference as there would have been if it was unlocking itself he tried the levers and handles that then had to be moved but they wouldnt budge he glimpsed movement further down the long curve of the corridor near a set of doors leading to another stairwell jasken he called it was hard to tell in the dim inconstant light maybe it was the culture lunatic whod come to apprehend him again he pulled the jhlupian gun out no the figure moving towards him moved normally looked sichultian jasken he shouted the figure stopped maybe thirty metres away it raised its arms level in front of it gripping something a gun he realised as something flashed he started to fall into a crouch there was a smack and a whine from somewhere way overhead and to his left then a barking roar came ringing down the corridor crouched on one knee he aimed the jhlupian gun at the figure and pulled the trigger nothing happened he tried again the figure fired the gun once more and a bullet kicked off the top of the strongroom door whining away behind him as another thunderclap of noise pulsed down the corridor he could see smoke swirling round the figure smoke what were they firing a fucking musket but at least their gun still worked unlike the jhlupian blaster like a knife would still work fuck fuck fuck he said throwing the useless gun away and scrabbling to his feet holding the hide bag between him and the figure down the corridor as he ran for the doors hed just come through there was something round lying on the floor of the first landing he discovered this when he trod on it and his foot went out behind him dropping him and banging his knee on the next step up he howled in rage limped on up the steps the fucking gun hadnt worked it had worked before but it had stopped was it some fucking stupid ceremonial piece of junk that only had one fucking shot in it xingre the bastard had told him it could stop a tank bring down aircraft and keep on firing till you grew old lying motherfucking alien cunt he was one flight down from the ground floor when he heard the doors at the foot of the stairwell bang open and steps come hurrying up towards him fuck everything else then just get to jasken get to the flier cut and run what fucker would dare fire a fucking gun at him anyway probably only the demented little bitch claiming to be ybreq she was about as good a shot as hed have expected his lungs and throat felt like a blast furnace after running up all those steps his knee was hurting really badly but he just had to ignore it he threw open the door to the main groundlevel corridor and ran for the nearest courtyard doors the flier wasnt there he could see this twenty or more steps away from the doorway because there was a large open reception area with huge windows looking straight out at the courtyard but he kept on running for the doors not believing what he was seeing and threw the doors open anyway in time to see the flier pulling away overhead as though it had just taken off from the roof of the mansion jasken he screamed the force of it tearing at his throat he looked frantically round the circular courtyard this couldnt be happening the flier couldnt have gone it just couldnt he needed it he needed it to be here needed it so he could get away that must have been another similar flier hed just seen above the rooftops it couldnt have gone it just wasnt possible he was depending on it so it had to be here it couldnt disguise itself could it go seethrough or something freakish could it it was just a hired civilian flier nothing military or alien best money could hire built by one of his own companies but it couldnt turn fucking invisible he stared round the courtyard willing the aircraft still to be there but all that he could see was a halfcollapsed pile of paintings nothing and nobody else he glimpsed movement through the windows to one side in the corridor hed just run down he ran for the nearest archway leading through the house to the grounds a gun he needed a gun an old fashioned chemicalexplosion gun what had happened to jasken jasken had a gun he always carried several weapons he had a little handgun that had no sight or screen or electrics in it at all just as a last resort dear fuck it wasnt jasken chasing him was it he ran through the tall archway leading towards the outside his steps echoing in the arch high overhead he glanced back saw the figure pursuing him but stumbled and nearly fell as he did so no not jasken too small and slim to be jasken and jasken wouldnt have missed not twice it had to be the little bitch claiming to be ybreq she must have tricked jasken had an accomplice maybe the culture maniac whod tried to arrest him theyd be flying the aircraft the fucking culture a gun where would he find a gun he ran out onto the flagstone circle which encompassed the house the world was on fire walls of smoke filled the sky making a night lit up like hell flames leaping from a hundred different places trees and outbuildings all on fire or silhouetted against the fires beyond gun he needed a gun there were oldfashioned ancient even antique guns splattered liberally over the walls of the house just like there were swords and spears and shields but none of them worked none of them were any fucking use who the hell still used oldfashioned guns for fucks sake gamekeepers they used lasers like everybody else didnt they he wasnt even sure where the gamekeepers cottages were hadnt they been moved when hed had the raceball court put in he limped on breath wheezing knee aching wondering if he could hide in the maze maybe jump out on whoever was pursuing him slit their throat using one of the two knives he still had he sort of remembered the layout of the maze he thought he looked at where the maze ought to be and saw its central tower on fire flames waving wildly like orange banners from its wooden superstructure he looked desperately around searching for the flier or another aircraft he should have headed for the garages he thought maybe some of the cars were still there and working he patted the pocket where his antique watch had been but it was gone tall skinny towers and linked soaring arches stood out black against a distant roaring wall of yelloworange flame off to one side the fucking battleships they had chemical guns there were explosives rockets grenades bullets all that stuff there he couldnt think of anything else he ran for the battleship area he looked back briefly the figure sprinted out of the archway heading towards him then seemed to slow looking about maybe they couldnt see him he was wearing mostly dark clothes thank fuck throat on fire legs like jelly knee like a spike had been driven into it he scrabbled around inside the hide bag found a soft double sheath pulled it out and stuck it and the pair of knives it held into his jacket he threw the bag and everything else away she had never fired a gun before never even held one she used both hands hoping this was right the noise of the old explosivebased weapon going off was so great and the kick against her arms so hard she thought it had blown up in her hands she half expected to find shed lost fingers she didnt see where the bullet went but now veppers was on one knee pointing something at her the gun and her fingers were intact she coughed on the acrid gas the gun had given off fired it again another earringing detonation she couldnt believe it was meant to be this noisy shed missed again at least she saw where this shot hit well above veppers near the top of the great circular door of the strongroom she knew these old reaction weapons had significant recoil but shed always assumed it happened after the bullet had left the barrel on its way to wherever it had been aimed maybe it didnt work that way veppers turned and ran crashing through the doors to the stairs she set off after him when she got to the doors she kicked them open in case he was hiding just behind them the stairwell was a little dimmer than the corridor but she could see okay bits of a smashedup torch were strewn across the first landing on the first step up lay the antique watch veppers had looked at in ambassadors huens office she ran on up seeing and hearing veppers a handful of flights above running along the corridor she saw him hesitate in the courtyard staring frantically about then he ran off through the main archway and not running quite perfectly limping outside once shed exited the tall archway she stopped for a moment taken aback by the sheer apocalyptic scale of the fiery roaring chaos swirling around the mansion a ragged tearing wind that seemed to have come out of nowhere howled beneath a cauldron of nightblack skyobliterating smoke manically leaping furiously rolling flames spilled everywhere the air was full of whirling burning debris numerous as leaves in the first storm of autumn the shock was almost physical the heat on her face from the ubiquitous flames as strong as that from an equatorial sun she slowed to a trot without realising she shook herself out of it quickly looked around for a moment she thought shed lost him then she saw him half running half staggering in the direction of the water maze he was silhouetted against flames for a moment and she aimed at him nearly fired but then decided he was too far away the gun was for close range and she was anyway no marksman eight shots left down a grassed bank clattering against a chainlink fence hidden from the mansion by the slope running along the path making for the gates that led to the network of channels around the lakes the gates the fucking gates what if they were closed locked then he saw something ahead glinting in the flames and running towards it found a crashlanded flier one of the estates runabouts snouted into the path and the fence at one end of a trough of ploughedup earth the fence had tipped fallen lay flat on the ground just beyond the crumpled nose of the craft he leapt onto the fliers stubby front canard jumped over the fractured nose and was in the battleship ground pumping and wheezing along the internal path beneath the towers and arches of the raised system of canals the sheds where the ships were kept were on the far side of the grounds away from the mansion near the trees crazy crazy crazy what was he doing the fucking sheds would be locked but maybe not there were people there a lot of the time and hed been planning a battleship tournament in a few days so the engineers and technicians would have been working on the vessels testing them readying them it hadnt been night when all this chaos had kicked off even though it felt like midnight now it had been afternoon people would have been in and around the ships and sheds and what were the odds in the midst of all this mayhem that theyd carefully packed everything away and locked up everything they were meant to lock up not a chance see hed been vindicated this had been the right place to come his instinct had been smack on the money he not this mad bitch running after him with a miniature cannon would come out of this ahead hed survive hed win he was the winner he had the history of success he was the one who knew how to triumph fuck if it really was her hed already killed her once what did that tell you a burning tree storeys high already half uprooted was slowly falling thirty metres ahead of him it came thudding through the fence crashing and rolling off a flying buttress in a storm of sparks and splashing into a watery channel smothering the path with flame the buttress seemed to hesitate then started to crumple and fall crashing down in a welter of stone and water creating billows of steam the way ahead was blocked he ran instead for the nearest wading point leading to the first of the islands he could see the layout of the lakes and channels in his head knew it better than the hedge maze because hed looked down on it so many times the wading points surfaced with meshcovered slabs under the water were located in the middle of each islands shore line they stretched as far as one island away from the pool in front of the maintenance area and the sheds he could wade through the mudbottomed pool or even swim the rest she saw him leap into the water maze over the front of the crashed flier saw the great tree fall she followed vaulting the buckled nose of the flier catching up as he took splashing to the water wading from the mainland to the nearest island burning embers and curtains of smoke were blowing across the water maze darkening and lighting the miniature landscape alternately revealing and concealing the running limping figure ahead of her as he headed for who knew where maybe he was thinking of the sheds where the ships were kept perhaps he saw himself jumping into one and firing all its pretend little guns at her she followed via the wading point the water in the channel cold round her legs dragging at her slowing her it was like tying to run in a dreamin the centre of the channel the water reached as far up as her hips before shallowing again veppers had crossed the island beyond and was wading the next channel to one of the larger islands by the time she hauled her protesting legs out of the water he disappeared as a dark rolling cloud of smoke flowed between them when it cleared hed gone she ran panting across the island splashed across the next wading point and went stumbling up onto the next island she looked all about terrified that shed lost him or that he might be lying in wait for her she had to wave burning floating scraps of twigs and leaves away from her face a copse of trees forty metres away suddenly caught and flamed casting a fierce yelloworange glow over the whole low humpback island something glinted down and to one side in the reed bed close to her and she turned hed fallen slipping on something as his knee had given way and his foot went out from under him sending him skidding and plunging down the muddy slope into the reeds that lined the island wading the channels had taken the last of the strength from his legs he doubted hed be able to stand let alone run any more his back had hit some solid ground just before his feet and legs splashed into the dark water and he was half winded bouncing from the impact and turned onto his side behind he saw a wall of black smoke just clearing and realised it had been between him and her as hed slipped she might not have seen him fall for an instant there hed despaired thinking hed never get to where he was going and shed catch him but now he thought no i can use this to my advantage shes the one who has to watch out im going to win here not her even upsets and what looked like misfortune could be turned to advantage if you had the right mindset the right attitude if the universe was somehow always subtly on your side just because you fitted it better than anybody else knew its true and secret workings better than anybody else he lay partially concealed by the reeds around him waiting for her he dug inside his jacket where the knives were pulling one of them out of its sheath when she came stumbling up onto the island panting and dripping he could see that she had lost him he had his advantage he raised himself up a little on one elbow threw the knife with all his might knifethrowing wasnt one of his skills and the knives werent throwing knives anyway the weapon somersaulted a couple of times flashing in the orange light from the fires that raged all around them she must have caught a glimpse of it coming at her because she started to duck and instinctively began to raise the hand nearest the knifes trajectory to fend it off the handle of the knife caught her hard on one temple grazing her and the hand shed raised to try and protect herself the hand holding the gun went on up past her head an instant after the knife struck her head the gun roared flashing in the night its detonation flatter and less sharp than it had been in the tunnel beneath the house he saw the gun fly from her hand as she staggered stumbled and started to fall hed seen where the gun had landed though it had disappeared again after bouncing into some longer grass over the other side of the island still he knew where it must be he scrambled to his knees then his feet finding renewed strength from somewhere hands clawing at the mud and grass and earth until he was in a crouch most of the way upright and could throw himself across the grass as the girl pirouetted nearby staggering like a drunk staring at him as he limped and hopped past a few metres away heading for where the gun must be he should just have knifed her he realised he had the other knife hed fixated on getting a gun but that wasnt really what was important what mattered was killing her before she killed him the gun hadnt really mattered at all what had he been thinking of he was an idiot then he saw the gun lying at the edge of the reed bed a hands breadth from the dark glinting water he dived hand outstretched thudding into the ground hand closing round the barrel of the gun desperately slapping at it and trying to turn it as he brought his other hand up finally grasping it properly he rolled over expecting to find her running towards him leaping on top of him clutching the knife hed thrown at her or just with her clawed hands reaching for his throat shed gone he sat up as quickly as he could legs quivering chest heaving breath whistling to and fro inside his throat he stood shakily and saw her down by the reeds a little way off just starting to pull herself back out onto dry land off to one side more trees were catching fire sending flames leaping and boiling into the darkness they lit up the sheds where the miniature battleships were kept he could see some of the vessels themselves one on a wheeled cradle on the dockside another floating in the water by the quay some of the sheds were surrounded by burning grass and fallen branches flames starting to lick up their metal walls and curl over their shallowpitched roofs a burning bough fell from a tree and crashed through the roof of the nearest shed in a shower of sparks he walked slowly legs shaking breath raw and ragged in the warm fireparched air to where the girl was trying to pull herself out of the mud and the crushed flattened reeds blood was running down her face from where the knife had hit her part of him wanted to tell her he still didnt believe that she was who she said she was but even if it was true well tough winners won the successful succeeded aggression and predation and ruthlessness tended to win out what a surprise just the way life was nothing personal well actually everything fucking personal but he didnt really have the breath for any of it fuck you he said at her as she crawled in front of him and he stood over her pointing the gun at her stragglehaired head hed said it as loud as he could but it still came out as more of a wheeze than anything else she swung at him one arm and hand whirling round shed found the knife hed thrown at her had gone into the reed bed to find it the blade whacked into his leg into the calf just below his good knee sending pain darting up his leg and spine and detonating in his head he screamed staggered back held the gun in both hands and nearly fell as the girl collapsed to one side unbalanced by the need to wield the knife that was now sticking out of his leg fucking little he shrieked at her he steadied straightened despite the pain aimed the gun at her and squeezed the trigger the trigger was stuck he heaved at it tried again to pull it but it just wasnt moving felt like his finger couldnt move he tried to move the gun to the other hand but even that was difficult it was as though his hands were so cold they werent obeying orders he heard himself make a mewling whimpering noise he glanced at the side of the gun looking for a safety catch but it was already off he tried the gun again but it just wasnt happening he tried to throw it away but then it was as though it was stuck to his hand finally it sailed off into the darkness he fumbled in his jacket for the second knife then staggering feeling like he was about to black out realised he could pull out the one sticking into his leg he girl was still on the ground near his feet she seemed to be trying to get up again then she collapsed back thudding down onto her rump one arm going behind to steady herself he found the second knife inside his jacket pocket pulled it from its sheath somewhere off to one side there were lots of little explosions like fireworks light flickered everywhere stuff was whining and zipping overhead he took a step towards her as she looked woozily up at him then he was caught steadied by something that wasnt him rooted to the ground unable to move as though every part of him had seized up muscles skeleton everything the girl looked up at him and something changed in her face it seemed to relax and her shoulders and chest shook once almost as though she was laughing ah she said and got her legs beneath her pushing herself up until she was kneeling she felt at the side of her head where the blood was looked at the darkness of it on her hand in the flickering orange light she looked back to him he couldnt move he simply could not move he wasnt para lysed he could feel his muscles straining trying to move him but he was stuck as though enchanted utterly immobile look at your hands veppers the girl told him over the noise of more explosions stuttering light flared against her mudstreaked face and wet bedraggled hair he could still move his eyes he looked down at his hands they were covered in fine silver lines glinting in the firelight where had ayeaye said a male voice nearby pleasant evening for it what a tall toothin man in pale loose clothes strolled past when he glanced back he saw that it was demeisen the avatar spared him a glance then went to stand by the girl you okay never better thought youd left yup that was the idea need a hand up give me a moment happily the man turned and looked at veppers folding his arms this isnt her doing this he told him its me veppers couldnt get his mouth or jaw to work even his breathing was difficult then a thousand tiny fierce pains sprang up as though hundreds of hairfine wires were wrapping every centimetre of him and were starting to shrink cutting into every part of his body a bubbling wheezing whine escaped his mouth the man glanced down at the girl again unless you want to finish him of course he said to her he looked back at veppers frowning a little i wouldnt though conscience can be a terrible thing he smiled so i hear he shrugged unless youre something like me of course he murmured i dont give a fuck the girl looked up into veppers eyes as the wires of the tattoo device cut slowly into him he had never known such pain never guessed that anything could hurt so much quickly she said and coughed as more smoke and burning embers sailed past the three of them what the avatar said quickly she said dont draw it out just the avatar gazed into veppers eyes and nodded down at the girl see he said good kid really the pain already intolerable increased wildly just around his neck and head the coup de gr√¢ce was veppers head twisting right round an almost comical expression filling his already bloodflecked face as the tattoo lines flicked into a spiral rose up and shrank inwards all at once so that his head seemed to crumple and shrink into itself becoming a fartoothin tall cylinder that disappeared in a spray of blood lededje had to look away she heard what sounded like a whole big bowl full of rotten fruit being emptied onto the ground then heard and felt the body thump into the grass beside her a moment later she opened her eyes to see it twitch a couple of times blood still pumping from the garrotted twistedopen neck she felt she was going to faint she put both arms out behind her neat trick she said watching arcs of flame and little sprays of fire burst from the miniature docks and the sheds where the model battleships were kept as they burned and blew up shells and rockets whizzing everywhere it moved over from you to him when you tried to strangle the fucker in ambassador huens office demeisen told her going over to kick the body once as though testing it was real left you with nothing but a glorified sun tan she coughed again looked around at the sheer lunatic devastation going on all around them other ships she said soon need to no we dont demeisen said stretching and yawning no second wave none left he stooped plucking the knife out of the leg of the headless body which had stopped twitching now left the last handful for the planetary defence guys to give them something to feel heroic about he told her as he inspected the knife weighing it in his hand twirling it a couple of times a furious whizzing noise barely following a flash of light was a shell from one of the stricken fireconsumed battleships the avatars arm moved blurringly fast and he batted it away from his face without even looking still admiring the knife the fizzing shell slapped into the nearest reed bed and blew up in a tall fountain of water orangetinged white on grubby black i did think of letting just one through or even stomping the relevant targets myself just for the heck of it demeisen said and pretending but in the end i thought not better to leave more of the evidence on the ground plus some of the hells have only gone dormant still storing personalities might be able to save some if theres anything sane left to save the avatar held one arm straight out and the tattoo glinting pristine uncurled itself from veppers body spiralling lazily up into the air like a twisterwind in a stubble field and wrapping itself round the avatars hand like spun mercury disappearing as it flowed over his skin and up his arm was that thing alive all the time she asked yup not just alive intelligent so fucking smart its even got a name she held up one hand while he was drawing his next breath im sure it has she said but spare me demeisen grinned slapdrone personal protection weapon all of the above he said stretching again as though the tattoo had spread itself all over him and he was testing how it fitted his body he looked down at her you ready to go back if youre coming back she sat arms out behind her blood in one eye aching everywhere feeling like shit she nodded i suppose want this offering her the knife handle first better she said taking it then struggling to her feet helped by his other hand family heirloom she looked at the avatar frowning there were two she said he shook his head tsked stooped and pulled the other knife from where it had stuck in the ground he took the double sheath from veppers jacket presenting it and both blades to her with a bow a scalemodel battleship still tiedup to its quayside on fire from stem to stern lifted suddenly in the middle breaking its back as it blew up dispensing fire and flames debris and shrapnel and angrily buzzing and whining shells and rockets all about the first keelsundering gout of fire briefly lit up two silvery ovoids stood on their ends on a small low island nearby before they vanished almost as quickly as they had appeared dramatis personae ambassador huen jumped before she was pushed as was trad itional even the very limited amount of interfering shed suggested and sanctioned was somewhat more than

albino dwarf with a speech impediment and double incontinence quickly cleared of all but the most allowable and for an abominatorclass expected malfeasance it returned to its usual standby task of punctuated loneliness sitting generally in the middle of cold nowhere waiting for stuff to happen and trying not to be too disappointed when nothing did it received from its fellow abominatorclass and other sc ships precisely the sort of congratulations and plaudits it might have expected for its actions around tsung and quyn all deeply tinged with envy it treasured them almost as much as the exquisitely rendered recordings of the engagements it spent quite a lot of time in or around the larger classes of gsvs just for the company its avatar demeisen continued to behave appallingly joiler veppers reputation survived more or less intact for a few weeks but then as the weeks became months and the months years it all fell apart as stories of his cruelty greed and selfishness and the extent of his callousness towards his own people and even his own planet became clear it was over a decade before the first revisionist rightwing historian attempted to restore his reputation and even then to no lasting effect yime nsokyi really had been an sc plant deep within quietus for all that time even if in a sense she hadnt known it herself after shed both agreed to be so and then consented to have the memory of that agreement deleted in any event given that even in one of the most successful specialist agenciesled interventions in recent centuries she had been largely relegated to a supporting role she resigned from the quietudinal service more in frustration than disgust but she resigned all the same she returned to her adopted home orbital and began a successful political career starting with the position of emergency drill supervisor on her home plate and eventually becoming the representative for the entire orbital as with all hierarchic positions within the culture it was almost entirely an honorary figurehead role but she found the achievement highly satisfying all the same her personal life ended up consisting of a sort of cycle of being neuter female and male in turn each for a decade or so she found that she was able to establish tender meaningful relationships with an agreeable physical component when she was not neuter at every stage but would have been

existed beneath the trackways of the espersium estate on sichult and placed into a temporary recuperative afterlife in a substrate on her home planet of pavul she met prin twice thereafter the first time when he came to see her during her convalescence and once much later she had discovered that she had no desire to come back to the real she had become whatever the virtual equivalent of institutionalised was and there could be no returning another chay already lived in the real who had never been through all that she had and in many ways that person was the real chay she herself had become something entirely different she still felt something for prin and wished him well but she had no need to be part of his life prin eventually established a happy lasting relationship with

lived in happy congenial afterlives and who tired even of their many lifetimes lived after biological death were ready to dissolve themselves into the generality of consciousness that underlay heaven

and volatile variety of peoples beings and endemic moralities involved the culture of hells already irredeemably reduced following the events on sichult and the testimony of people like prin became something of an anathema pretty much throughout the civilised galaxy and indeed within a single average biogeneration their very absence became accepted almost without question as part of what

orbital called hursklip where in her middletoold age she built largely by hand a fullsize replica of the battleship grounds that she had known as the water maze complete with working miniature battleships they could be humanpowered but each incorporated a wellarmoured survival pod which kept their occupant safe no matter what the feature became an enduring tourist attraction she never did return to sichult or meet jasken again though he tried to get in touch she had five children by as many different fathers and ended up with over thirty greatgreatgreatgrandchildren which by culture standards was almost disgraceful epilogue vatueil revented once more and back to using what he liked to think of as his original name even though it wasnt sipped his aperitif on the restaurant terrace he watched the sun set across the dark lake and listened to the crick and chirp of insects hidden in the bushes and vines nearby he checked the time she was late as usual what was it about poets what a long terrible war that had been he thought idly he really had been a traitor of course hed been planted in the antihell side long ago by those who wished to see the hells continue for ever a cause hed supported at the time partly out of sheer contrarianism and partly out of that despair he felt sometimes periodically during this long long life at the sheer selfhurtful idiocy and destructiveness of so many types of sentient life especially the metatype known as panhuman to which he had always had the dubious honour of belonging you want suffering pain and horror ill give you suffering pain and horror but then over time fighting away again and again yet again hed changed his mind cruelty and the urge to dominate and oppress started to seem childish and pathetic once more the way hed accepted they were long ago but had somehow turned away from in the meantime so hed spilled all the beans implicated all those he knew about who deserved to be implicated and had been quite pleased to see so much of what he had pledged to fight for crumble away into disgraced and piecemeal nothing hell mend them there would be people who would never forgive him for betraying them but that was just too bad they ought to have guessed of course but people never did that was the thing about traitors they were people whod already changed their minds at least once he made a mental note never again to insist on working his way up through the ranks hed finally convinced himself hed learned all the relevant lessons already probably many times over and the process was starting to smack too much of outright masochism the sun brightened slowly as it settled against the horizon subsiding beneath a long sinuous line of intervening cloud to blaze through a channel of clear air with a languid dying glory hazy orangered against a thin yellow arc of sky he watched the stars disk as it started to fall behind a line of dark distant hills far across the plains closer to him fringed by its still hush of trees the lake had gone dark as ink he drank in the sunlights slow dwindling from the first glint of dawn and for the rest of the day the sun was too bright to look at he thought you could only gaze steadily upon it only truly see it regard it inspect and properly admire it when it was at its most filtered half hidden by the thickness of the atmosphere with its cargo of the days dust and
