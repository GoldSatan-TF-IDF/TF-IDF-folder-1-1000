federations an anthology of stories edited by john joseph adams cover art by sergoe cover design by stephen h segal ebook design by neil clarke introduction john joseph adams its safe to say that without star wars and star trek i might have never become a science fiction fan when i was a kid it was those movies and television shows that first interested me in the genre and when i tested the waters of science fiction reading some of the first books i bought with my own money were star trek and star wars novels in a sense these properties and their tiein novels acted as a kind of gateway drug to the wider genre of science fiction for me since reading those first books i have expanded my tastes and interests but my fondness for the trektype of narrative has remained and so to me the idea of doing an anthology that builds on those same tropes and traditions held great appeal that more than anything is the reason this book exists but of course it is not just star trek and star wars that explore the vastness of interstellar galaxyspanning societiesof governments not of countries but of worlds or entire groups of worlds sf literature has a great many examples of it as well there are classics like isaac asimovs foundation ursula k le guins hainish cycle and frank herberts dune series in fact the tradition in print sf goes back long before star trek and star wars all the way back to the days of the pulps when writers like e e doc smith was writing his lensman novels these classic federations have revealed and shaped much of american life but with this anthology we look to see what comes next what will the interstellar federations of the future look like now that our society accepts for the most part racial and gender equality president barack obama himself was a trek fan as a child now he is the first africanamerican president something that even optimists like gene roddenberry might have had a hard time imagining there will always be federations on the horizon in our future describing who we wish we were or might become over the decades writers have continued to develop new and exciting takes on this themeindeed contemporary writers like alastair reynolds and lois mcmaster bujold have crafted some of the finest examples of interstellar science fiction of all time work that will likely be considered classic in the future writers like them and the others in this book are keeping the tradition alive building on what the generations before have laid out innovating to keep the subgenre fresh and vital in the pages that follow you will find a mix of allnew original fiction alongside selected reprints from authors whose work exemplifies what interstellar science fiction is capable of mazer in prison orson scott card orson scott card is the bestselling author of more than forty novels including enders game which was a winner of both the hugo and nebula awards the sequel speaker for the dead also won both awards making card the only author to have captured science fictions two most coveted prizes in consecutive years his most recent book is another entry in the enderverse ender in exile mazer in prison which first appeared in cards webzine intergalactic medicine show takes place prior to the events in enders game and follows mazer rackham a war hero in the first formic war as he travels alone through space experiencing relativistic travel those familiar with the series will recognize several characters and will come to have a deeper understanding of how battle school came to be for newcomers this story is a glimpse into military bureaucracy and one mans sacrifice for the human race being the last best hope of humanity was a lousy job sure the pay was great but it had to pile up in a bank back on earth because there was no place out here to shop there was no place to walk when your official exercise program consisted of having your muscles electrically stimulated while you slept then getting spun around in a centrifuge so your bones wouldnt dissolve there wasnt much to look forward to in an average day to mazer rackham it felt as though he was being punished for having won the last war after the defeat of the invading formicsor buggers as they were commonly calledthe international fleet learned everything they could from the alien technology then as fast as they could build the newly designed starships the if launched them toward the formic home world and the other planets that had been identified as formic colonies but they hadnt sent mazer out with any of those ships if they had then he wouldnt be completely alone thered be other people to talk tofighter pilots crew primates with faces and hands and voices and smells was that asking so much no he had a much more important mission he was supposed to command all the fleets in their attacks on all the formic worlds that meant he would need to be back in the solar system communicating with all the fleets by ansible great a cushy desk job he was old enough to relish that except for one hitch since space travel could only approach but never quite reach three hundred million meters per second it would take many years for the fleets to reach their target worlds during those years of waiting back at international fleet headquartersifcommazer would grow old and frail physically and mentally so to keep him young enough to be useful they shut him up in a nearlightspeed courier ship and launched him on a completely meaningless outbound journey at some arbitrary point in space they decreed he would decelerate turn around and then return to earth at the same speed arriving home only a few years before the fleets arrived and all hell broke loose he would have aged no more than five years during the voyage even though decades would have passed on earth a lot of good hed do them as a commander if he lost his mind during the voyage sure he had plenty of books in the onboard database millions of them and announcements of new books were sent to him by ansible any he wanted he could ask for and have them in moments what he couldnt have was a conversation he had tried after all how different was the ansible from regular email over the nets the problem was the time differential to him it seemed he sent out a message and it was answered immediately but to the person on the other end mazers message was spread out over days coming in a bit at a time once his whole message had been received and assembled the person could write an answer immediately but to be received by the ansible on mazers little boat the answer would be spaced out a bit at a time as well the result was that for the person mazer was conversing with many days intervened between the parts of the conversation it had to be like talking with somebody with such an incredible stammer that you could walk away live your life for a week and then come back before he had finally spit out whatever it was he had to say a few people had tried but by now with mazer nearing the point where he would decelerate to turn the ship around his communications with ifcom on the asteroid eros were mostly limited to book and holo and movie requests plus his daily blipthe message he sent just to assure the if that he wasnt dead he could even have automated the daily blipits not as if mazer didnt know how to get around their firewalls and reprogram the shipboard computer but he dutifully composed a new and unique message every day that he knew would barely be glanced at back at ifcom as far as anyone there cared he might as well be dead they would all have retired or even died before he got back the problem of loneliness wasnt a surprise of course they had even suggested sending someone with him mazer himself had vetoed the idea because it seemed to him to be stupid and cruel to tell a person that he was so completely useless to the fleet to the whole war effort that he could be sent out on mazers aimless voyage just to hold his hand what will your recruiting poster be next year mazer had asked join the fleet and spend a couple of years as a paid companion to an aging space captain to mazer it was only going to be a few years he was a private person who didnt mind being alone he was sure he could handle it what he hadnt taken into account was how long two years of solitary confinement would be they do this he realized to prisoners whove misbehaved as the worst punishment they could give think of thatto be completely alone for long periods of time is worse than having to keep company with the vilest stupidest felons known to man we evolved to be social creatures the formics by their hivemind nature are never alone they can travel this way with impunity to a lone human its torture and of course there was the tiny matter of leaving his family behind but he wouldnt think about that he was making no greater sacrifice than any of the other warriors who took off in the fleets sent to destroy the enemy win or lose none of them would see their families again in this at least he was one with the men he would be commanding the real problem was one that only he recognized he didnt have a clue how to save the human race once he got back that was the part that nobody seemed to understand he explained it to them that he was not a particularly good commander that he had won that crucial battle on a fluke that there was no reason to think he could do such a thing again his superior officers agreed that he might be right they promised to recruit and train new officers while mazer was gone trying to find a better commander but in case they didnt find one mazer was the guy who fired the single missile that ended the previous war people believed in him even if he didnt believe in himself of course knowing the military mind mazer knew that they would completely screw up the search for a new commander the only way they would take the search seriously was if they did not believe they had mazer rackham as their aceinthehole mazer sat in the confined space behind the pilot seat and extended his left leg stretching it up then bringing it behind his head not every man his age could do this definitely not every maori not those with the traditional bulk of the fully adult male of course he was only halfmaori but it wasnt as if people of european blood were known for their extraordinary physical flexibility the console speaker said incoming message im listening said mazer make it voice and read it now male or female asked the computer who cares said mazer male or female the computer repeated random said mazer so the message was read out to him in a female voice admiral rackham my name is hyrum graff ive been assigned to head recruitment for battle school the first step in our training program for gifted young officers my job is to scour the earth looking for someone to head our forces during the coming conflictinstead of you i was told by everyone who bothered to answer me at all that the criterion was simple find someone just like mazer rackham mazer found himself interested in what this guy was saying they were actually looking for his replacement this man was in charge of the search to listen to him in a voice of a different gender seemed mocking and disrespectful male voice said mazer immediately the voice changed to a robust baritone the trouble im having admiral is that when i ask them specifically what traits of yours i should try to identify for my recruits everything becomes quite vague the only conclusion i can reach is this the attribute of yours that they want the new commander to have is victorious in vain do i point out that i need better guidelines than that so i have turned to you for help you know as well as i do that there was a certain component of luck involved in your victory at the same time you saw what no one else could see and you actedagainst ordersat exactly the right moment for your thrust to be unnoticed by the hive queen boldness courage iconoclasmmaybe we can identify those traits but how do we test for vision theres a social component too the men in your crew trusted you enough to obey your disobedient orders and put their careers if not their lives in your hands your record of reprimands for insubordination suggests also that you are an experienced critic of incompetent commanders so you must also have very clear ideas of what your future replacement should not be therefore i have obtained permission to use the ansible to query you about the attributes we need to look foror avoidin the recruits we find in the hope that you will find this project more interesting than whatever it is youre doing out there in space i eagerly await your reply mazer sighed this graff sounded like exactly the kind of officer who should be put in charge of finding mazers replacement but mazer also knew enough about military bureaucracy to know that graff would be chewed up and spit out the first time he actually tried to accomplish something getting permission to communicate by ansible with an old geezer who was effectively dead was easy enough what was the senders rank mazer asked the console lieutenant poor lieutenant graff had obviously underestimated the terror that incompetent officers feel in the presence of young intelligent energetic replacements at least it would be a conversation take down this answer please said mazer dear lieutenant graff im sorry for the time you have to waste waiting for this message no scratch that why increase the wasted time by sending a message stuffed with useless chat then again doing a whole bunch of editing would delay the message just as long mazer sighed unwound himself from his stretch and went to the console ill type it in myself said mazer itll go faster that way he found the words he had just dictated waiting for him on the screen of his message console with the edge of graffs message just behind it he flipped that message to the front read it again and then picked up his own message where he had left off i am not an expert in identifying the traits of leadership your message reveals that you have already thought more about it than i have much as i might hope your endeavor is successful since it would relieve me of the burden of command upon my return i cannot help you he toyed with adding god could not help you but decided to let the boy find out how the world worked without dire and useless warnings from mazer instead he said send and the console replied message sent by ansible and that thought mazer is the end of that the answer did not come for more than three hours what was that a month back on earth who is it from asked mazer knowing perfectly well who it would turn out to be so the boy had taken his time before pushing the matters time enough to learn how impossible his task was probably not mazer was sitting on the toiletwhich thanks to the formics gravitic technology was a standard gravitydependent chemical model mazer was one of the few still in the service who remembered the days of airsuction toilets in weightless spaceships which worked about half the time that was the era when ship captains would sometimes be cashiered for wasting fuel by accelerating their ships just so they could take a dump that would actually get pulled away from their backside by something like gravity lieutenant hyrum graff and now he had the pestiferous hyrum graff who would probably be even more annoying than nullg toilets erase it i am not allowed to erase ansible communications said the female voice blandly it was always bland of course but it felt particularly bland when saying irritating things i could make you erase it if i wanted to go to the trouble of reprogramming you but mazer didnt say it in case it might alert the program safeguards in some way read it male voice female snapped mazer admiral rackham im not sure you understood the gravity of our situation we have two possibilities either we will identify the best possible commanders for our war against the formics or we will have you as our commander so either you will help us identify the traits that are most likely to be present in the ideal commander or you will be the commander on whom all the responsibility rests i understand that you little twit said mazer i understood it before you were born would you like me to take down your remarks as a reply asked the computer just read it and ignore my carping the computer returned to the message from lieutenant graff i have located your wife and children they are all in good health and it may be that some or all of them might be glad of an opportunity to converse with you by ansible if you so desire i offer this not as bribe for your cooperation but as a reminder perhaps that more is at stake here than the importunities of an upstart lieutenant pestering an admiral and a war hero on a voyage into the future mazer roared out his answer as if i had need of reminders from you would you like me to take down your remarks as id like you to shut yourself down and leave me in a reply finished the computer ignoring his carping peace mazer sighed take down this answer im divorced and my exwife and children have made their lives without me to them im dead its despicable for you to attempt to raise me from the grave to burden their lives when i tell you that i have nothing to tell you about command its because i truly do not know any answers that you could possibly implement im desperate for you to find a replacement for me but in all my experience in the military i saw no example of the kind of commander that we need so figure it out for yourselfi havent any idea for a moment he allowed his anger to flare and leave my family out of it you contemptible then he decided not to flame the poor git delete everything after leave my family out of it do you wish me to read it back to you im on the toilet since his answer was nonresponsive the computer repeated the question verbatim no just send it i dont want to have the zealous lieutenant graff wait an extra hour or day just so i can turn my letter into a prizewinning school essay but graffs question nagged at him what should they look for in a commander what did it matter as soon as they developed a list of desirable traits all the bureaucratic buttsniffs would immediately figure out how to fake having them and theyd be right back where they started with the best bureaucrats at the top of every military hierarchy and all the genuinely brilliant leaders either discharged or demoralized the way i was demoralized piloting a barelyarmed supply ship in the rear echelons of our formation which was in itself a mark of the stupidity of our commandersthe fact that they thought there could be such a thing as a rear echelon during a war in threedimensional space there might have been dozens of men who could have seen what i sawthe point of vulnerability in the formics formationbut they had long since left the service the only reason i was there was because i couldnt afford to quit before vesting in my pension so i put up with spiteful commanders who would punish me for being a better officer than they would ever be i took the abuse the contempt and so there i was piloting a ship with only two weaponsslow missiles at that turned out i only needed one but who could have predicted that id be there that id see what i saw and that id commit career suicide by firing my missiles against ordersand then id turn out to be right what process can test for that might as well resort to prayereither god is looking out for the human race or he doesnt care if he cares then well go on surviving despite our stupidity if he doesnt then we wont in a universe that works like that any attempt to identify in advance the traits of great commanders is utterly wasted incoming visuals said the computer mazer looked down at his desk screen where he had jotted desperation intuition test for that sucker tolerance for the orders of fools insane sense of personal mission yeah thats the list graffs hoping ill send him and now the boy was sending him visuals who approved that but the head that flickered in the holospace above his desk wasnt an eagerbeaver young lieutenant it was a young woman with lightcolored hair like her mothers and only a few traces of her fathers partmaori appearance but the traces were there and she was beautiful stop said mazer i am required to show you this is personal this is an intrusion all ansible communications later this is a visual and therefore has high priority sufficient ansible bandwidth for full motion visuals will only be used for communications of the mazer gave up just play it father said the young woman in the holospace mazer looked away from her reflexively hiding his face though of course she couldnt see him anyway his daughter pai mahutanga when he last saw her she was a treeclimbing fiveyearold she used to have nightmares but with her father always on duty with the fleet there was no one to drive away the bad dreams i brought your grandchildren with me she was saying pahu rangi hasnt found a woman yet who will let him reproduce she grinned wickedly at someone out of frame her brother mazers son just a baby conceived on his last leave before the final battle weve told the children all about you i know you cant see them all at once but if they each come into frame with me for just a few momentsits so generous of them to let me but he said that you might not be happy to see me even if thats true father i know youll want to see your grandchildren theyll still be alive when you return i might even be please dont hide from us we know that when you divorced mother it was for her sake and ours we know that you never stopped loving us see heres kahui kura and pao pao te rangi they also have english names mirth and glad but theyre proud to be children of the maori through you but your grandson mazer taka aho howarth insists on using the name you went go by and as for baby struan maeroero hell make the choice when he gets older she sighed i suppose hes our last child if the new zealand courts uphold the hegemonys new population rules as each of the children stepped into frame shyly or boldly depending on their personality mazer tried to feel something toward them two daughters first shy lovely the little boy named for him finally the baby that someone held into the frame they were strangers and before he ever met them they would be parents themselves perhaps grandparents what was the point i told your mother that we had to be dead to each other she had to think of me as a casualty of war even if the paperwork said divorce decree instead of killed in action she was so angry she told me that she would rather i had died she was going to tell our children that i was dead or that i just left them without giving them any reason so theyd hate me now it turns out she turned my departure into a sentimental memory of sacrifice for god and country or at least for planet and species mazer forced himself not to wonder if this meant that she had forgiven him she was the one with children to raisewhat she decided to tell them was none of his business whatever helped her raise the children without a father he didnt marry and have children until he was already middleagedhed been afraid to start a family when he knew hed be gone on voyages lasting years at a time then he met kim and all that rational process went out the window he wantedhis dna wantedtheir children to exist even if he couldnt be there to raise them pai mahutanga and pahu rangihe wanted the childrens lives to be stable and good rich with opportunity so he stayed in the service in order to earn the separation bonuses that would pay to put them through college then he fought in the war to keep them safe but he was going to retire when the war ended and go home to them at last while they were still young enough to welcome a father and then he got this assignment why couldnt you just decide you bastards decide you were going to replace me and then let me go home and have my heros welcome and then retire to christchurch and listen to the ringing of the bells to tell me gods in his heaven and alls right with the world you could have left me home with my family to raise my children to be there so i could talk pai out of naming her firstborn son after me i could have given all the advice and training you wantedmore than youd ever use thats for sureand then left the fleet and had some kind of life but no i had to leave everything and come out here in this miserable box while you dither mazer noticed that pais face was frozen and she was making no sound you stopped the playback said mazer you werent paying attention said the computer this is a visual ansible transmission and you are required to im watching now said mazer pais voice came again and the visual moved again theyre going to slow this down to transmit it to you but you know all about time dilation the bandwidth is expensive too so i guess im done with the visual part of this ive written you a letter and so have the kids and pahu swears that someday hell learn to read and write she laughed again looking at someone out of frame it had to be his son the baby he had never seen tantalizingly close but not coming into frame someone was controlling that someone decided not to let him see his son graff how closely was he manipulating this or was it kim who decided or pahu himself mother has written to you too actually quite a few letters she wouldnt come though she doesnt want you to see her looking so old but shes still beautiful father more beautiful than ever with white hair andshe still loves you she wants you to remember her younger she told me once i was never beautiful and when i met a man who thought i was i married him over his most heartfelt objections her imitation of her mother was so accurate that it stopped mazers breath for a moment could it truly be that kim had refused to come because of some foolish vanity about how she looked as if he would care but he would care because she would be old and that would prove that it was true that she would surely be dead before he made it back to earth and because of that it would not be home he came back to there was no such place i love you father pai was saying not just because you saved the world we honor you for that of course but we love you because you made mother so happy she would tell us stories about you its as if we knew you and your old mates would visit sometimes and then we knew that mother wasnt exaggerating about you either that or they all were she laughed you have been part of our lives we may be strangers to you but youre not a stranger to us the image flickered and when it came back she was not in quite the same position there had been an edit perhaps because she didnt want him to see her cry but he knew she had been about to because her face still worked before weeping the same way as when she was little it had not been so very long for him since she was small he remembered very well you dont have to answer this she said lieutenant graff told us that you might not welcome this transmission might even refuse to watch it we dont want to make your voyage harder but father when you come homewhen you come back to usyou have a home in our hearts even if im gone even if only our children are here to meet you our arms are open not to greet the conquering hero but to welcome home our papa and grandpa however old we are i love you we all do all and then almost as an afterthought please read our letters i have letters for you said the computer as the holospace went empty save them said mazer ill get to them you are authorized to send a visual reply said the computer that will not happen said mazer but even as he said it he was wondering what he could possibly say if he changed his mind and did send them his image some heroic speech about the nobility of sacrifice or an apology for accepting the assignment he would never show his face to them would never let kim see that he was not changed he would read the letters he would answer them there were duties you owed to family even if the reason they got involved was because of some meddling jerk of a lieutenant my first letter said mazer will be to that git graff its very brief bugger off gitling sign it respectfully yours bugger is a noun git is a substandard verb and gitling is not in any of my wordbases i cannot spell or parse the message properly without explanation do you mean leave this place alien enemy i made gitling up but its an excellent word so use it and i cant believe they programmed you without bugger off in the wordbase i detect stress said the computer will you accept mild sedation the stress is being caused by your forcing me to view a message i did not want to see you are causing my stress so give me some time to myself to calm down incoming message mazer felt his stress levels rising even higher so he sighed and sat back and said read it its from graff right always use a male voice for the gitling admiral rackham i apologize for the intrusion the computer baritoned once i broached the possibility of letting your family contact you my superiors would not give up on the idea even though i warned them it would be more likely to be counterproductive if you hadnt agreed in advance still it was my idea and i take full responsibility for that but it was also clumsily handled without waiting for your permission and that was not my responsibility though it was completely predictable because this is the military there is no idea so stupid that it wont be seized upon and made the basis of policy and no idea so wise that it wont be perceived as threatening by some paper pusher wholl kill it if he can or claim complete credit for it if it works am i describing the military you know clever boy thought mazer deflect my anger to the if make me his friend however the decision was made to send you only those letters that you would find encouraging youre being handled admiral rackham but if you want all the letters ill make sure you get the whole picture it wont make you happier but at least youll know im not trying to manipulate you oh right said mazer or at least im not trying to trick you said the computer im trying to persuade you by winning your trust if i can and then your cooperation i will not lie to you or leave out information in order to deceive you tell me if you want all the letters or are content with the comfortable version of your familys life mazer knew then that graff had wonmazer would have no choice but to answer and no choice but to request the omitted letters then he would be beholden to the gitling angry but in debt the real question was this was graff staging the whole thing was he the one who withheld the uncomfortable letters only so he could gain points with mazer for then releasing them or was graff taking some kind of risk scamming the system in order to send him the full set of letters or did graff a mere lieutenant have a degree of power that allowed him to openly flout the orders of his superiors with impunity dont send the buggeroff letter said mazer i already sent it and receipt has been confirmed im actually quite happy that you did that said mazer so heres my next message send the letters gitling within a few minutes the reply came and this time the number of letters was much higher and with nothing else to do mazer opened them and began to read them silently in the order they were sent which means that the first hundred were all from kim the progression of the early letters was predictable but no less painful to read she was hurt angry griefstricken resentful filled with longing she tried to hurt him with invective or with guilt or by tormenting him with sexually charged memories maybe she was tormenting herself her letters even the angry ones were reminders of what he had lost of the life he once had its not as if she invented her temper for this occasion she had it all along and he had been lashed by it before and bore a few old scars but now it all combined to make him miss her her words hurt him tantalized him made him grieve and often he had to stop reading and listen to somethingmusic poetry or the drones and clicks of subtle machinery in the seemingly motionless craft that was hurtling through space in the physicists assured him a wavelike way though he could not detect any lack of solidity in any of the objects inside the ship except of course himself he could dissolve at a word if it was from her and then be remade by another i was right to marry her he thought again and again as he read and wrong to leave her i cheated her and myself and my children and for what so i could be trapped here in space while she grows old and dies and then come back and watch some clever young lad take his rightful place as commander of all the fleets while i hover behind him a relic of an old war who lived out the wrong cliche instead of coming home in a bag for his family to bury it was his family who grew old and died while he came back still still young young and utterly alone purposeless except for the little matter of saving the human race which wouldnt even be in his hands her letters calmed down after a while they became monthly reports on the family as if he had become a sort of diary for her a place where she could wonder if she was doing the right thing in her raising of the childrentoo stern too strict too indulgent if her decisions could have a wrong outcome or a wrong motive then she wondered constantly if she should have done it differently that too was the woman he had known and loved and reassured endlessly how did she hold together without him apparently she remembered the conversations they used to have or imagined new ones she inserted his side of the conversation into the letters i know youd tell me that i did the right thing that i had no choice of course youd say you always told me im still doing the same old the things that a widow would tell herself about her dead husband but widows could still love their husbands she has forgiven me and finally in a letter written not so long agolast week half a year agoshe said it outright i hope you have forgiven me for being so angry with you when you divorced me i know you had no choice but to go and you were trying to be kind by cutting all ties so i could go on with life and i have gone on exactly as you said i should let us please forgive one another the words hit him like threeg acceleration he gasped and wept and the computer became concerned whats wrong the computer asked sedation seems necessary im reading a letter from my wife he said im fine no sedation but he wasnt fine because he knew what graff and the if could not have known when they let this message go through graff had lied to him he had withheld information for what mazer had told his wife was that she should go on with life and marry again thats what she was telling him somebody had forbidden them to say or write anything that would tell him that kim had married another man and probably had more childrenbut he knew because thats the only thing she could mean when she said i have gone on exactly as you said i should that had been the crux of the argument she insisting that divorce only made sense if she intended to remarry him saying that of course she didnt think of remarrying now but later when she finally realized that he would never come back as long as she lived she wouldnt have to write and ask him for a divorce it would already be done and she could go ahead knowing that she had his blessingand she had slapped him and burst into tears because he thought so little of her and her love for him that he thought she could forget and marry someone else but she had and it was breaking his heart because even though he had been noble about insisting on the divorce he had believed her when she said she could never love any other man she did love another man he was gone only a year and she no he had been gone three decades now maybe it took her ten years before she found another man maybe i will have to report this physical response said the computer you do whatever you have to said mazer what are they going to do send me to the hospital ori knowthey could cancel the mission he calmed down thoughbarking at the computer made him feel marginally better even though his thoughts raced far beyond the words he was reading he did read all the other letters and now he could see hints and overtones a lot of unexplained references to we and us in the letters she wanted him to know send this to graff tell him i know he broke his word almost as soon as he gave it the answer came back in a moment do you think i dont know exactly what i sent did he know or had he only just now realized that kim had slipped a message through and now graff was pretending that he knew it all along another message from graff just heard from your computer that you have had a strong emotional response to the letters im deeply sorry for that it must be a challenge to live in the presence of a computer that reports everything you do to us and then a team of shrinks try to figure out how to respond in order to get the desired result my own feeling is that if we intend to trust the future of the human race to this man maybe we ought to tell him everything we know and converse with him like an adult but my own letters have to be passed through the same panel of shrinks for instance theyre letting me tell you about them because they hope that you will come to trust me more by knowing that i dont like what they do theyre even letting me tell you this as a further attempt to allow the building of trust through recursive confession of trickery and deception i bet its working too you cant possibly read any secret meanings into this letter what game is he playing which parts of his letters are true the panel of shrinks made sense the military mind find a way to negate your own assets so they fail even before you begin to use them but if graff really did let kims admission that she had remarried sneak through knowing that the shrinks would miss it then did that mean he was on mazers side or that he was merely better than the shrinks at figuring out how to manipulate him you cant possibly read any secret meanings into this letter graff had said did that mean that there was a secret meaning mazer read it over again and now what he said in the third sentence took on another possible meaning to live in the presence of a computer that reports everything you do to us at first he had read it as if it meant reports to us everything you do but what if he literally meant that the computer would report everything mazer did to them that would mean they had detected his undetectable reprogramming of the computer which would explain the panel of shrinks and the sudden new urgency about finding a replacement for mazer as commander so the cat was out of the bag but they werent going to tell him they knew what he had done because he was the volatile one who had done something insane and so they couldnt believe he had a rational purpose and speak to him openly he had to let them see him and realize that he was not insane he had to get control of this situation and in order to accomplish that he had to trust graff to be what he so obviously wanted mazer to think he was an ally in the effort to find the best possible commander for the if when the final campaign finally began mazer looked in the mirror and debated whether to clean up his appearance there were plenty of insane people who tried pathetically to look saner by dressing like regular people then again he had let himself get awfully tanglehaired and he was naked all the time at least he could wash and dress and try to look like the kind of person that military people could regard with respect when he was ready he rotated into position and told the computer to begin recording his visual for later transmission he suspected though that there would be no point in editing itthe raw recording was what the computer would transmit since it had obviously reported his earlier reprogramming i have reason to believe that you already know of the change i made in the onboard computers programming apparently i could take the computers navigational system out of your control but couldnt keep it from reporting the fact to you which suggests that you meant this box to be a prison but you werent very good at it so i will now tell you exactly what you need to know youor by now your predecessorsrefused to believe me when i told them that i was not the right man to command the international fleet during the final campaign i was told that there would be a search for an adequate replacement but i knew better i knew that any search would be perfunctory or illusory you were betting everything on me however i also know how the military works those who made the decision to rely on me would be long since retired before i came back and the closer we got to the time of my return the more the new bureaucracy would dread my arrival when i got there i would find myself at the head of a completely unfit military organization whose primary purpose was to prevent me from doing anything that might cost somebody his job thus i would be powerless even if i was retained as a figurehead and all the pilots who gave up everything they knew and loved on earth in order to go out and confront the formics in their own space would be under the actual command of the usual gang of bureaucratic climbers it always takes six months of war and a few dreadful defeats to clear out the deadwood but we dont have time for that in this war any more than we did in the last one my insubordination fortunately ended things abruptly this time though if we lose any battle then we have lost the war we will have no second chance we have no margin of error we cant afford to waste time getting rid of youyou the idiots who are watching me right now the idiots who are going to let the human race be destroyed in order to preserve your pathetic bureaucratic jobs so i reprogrammed my ships navigational program so that i have complete control over it you cant override my decision and my decision is this i am not coming back i will not decelerate and turn around i will keep going on and on my plan was simple without me to count on as your future commander you would have no choice but to search for a new one not go through the motions but really search and i think you must have guessed that this was my plan because you started letting me get messages from lieutenant graff so now i have the problem of trying to make sense of what youre doing my guess is that graff is trained as a shrink perhaps he works as an intelligence analyst my guess is that he is actually very bright and innovative and has got spectacular results at at something so you decided to see if he could get me back on track only he is exactly the kind of wild man that terrifies you hes smarter than you and so you have to make sure you keep him from getting the power to do anything that looks to you like it might be dangerous and since everything remotely effective will frighten you his main project has been figuring out how to get around you in order to establish honest communication between him and me so here we are at something of an impasse and all the power is in your hands at this moment so let me tell you your choices there are only two of them the first choice is the hard one it will make your skin crawl some of you will go home and sleep for three days in fetal position with your thumbs in your mouths but theres no negotiation this is what youll do youll give lieutenant graff real power dont give him a high rank and a desk and a bureaucracy give him genuine authority everything he wants he gets because the whole reason he is alive will be this to find the best possible commander for the fleets that will decide the future of the human race to do this he first has to find out how to identify those with the best potential youll give him all the help he asks for all the people he asks for regardless of their rank training or how much some idiot admiral hates or loves them then graff will figure out how to train the candidates he identifies again youll do whatever he wants nothing is too expensive nothing is too difficult nothing requires a single committee meeting to agree everybody in the if and everybody in the government is graffs servant and all they should ever ask him is to clarify his instructions what i require of graff is that he work on nothing but the identification and training of my replacement as battle commander of the international fleet if he starts bureaucratic kingdom buildingin other words if he turns out to be just another idiotill know it and ill stop talking to him in exchange for your giving graff this authority is that once im satisfied he has it and is using it correctly then ill turn this ship around immediately ill get home a few years earlier than the original plan ill be part of training whatever commander you have ill evaluate graffs work ill help choose among the candidates for the job if you have more than one that might potentially do the job and all along the way graff will communicate with me constantly by ansible so that everything he does will be done with my counsel and approval thus through graff i am taking command of the search for our war leader now but if you act like the idiots who led the fleet during the war i won and try to obfuscate and prevaricate and procrastinate and misdirect and manipulate and lie your way out of letting graff and me control the choice and training of the battle commander then i wont turn this ship around ever ill just sail on out into oblivion our campaign will fail the buggers will come back to earth and theyll finish the job this time and i in this ship will be the last living human being but it wont be my fault it will be yours because you did not have the decency and intelligence to step aside and let the people who know how to do the job of saving the human race do it think about it as long as you want ive got all the time in the world but keep this in mind whoever tries to take control of this situation and set up committees to study your response to this vidthose are the people you need to assign to remote desk jobs and get them out of the if right now they are the allies of the buggerstheyre the ones who will end up getting us all killed i have already designated the only possible leader for this program lieutenant graff theres no compromise no maneuvering make him a captain give him more actual authority than any other living human stand ready to do whatever he tells you to do and let him and me get to work do i believe youll actually do this no thats why i reprogrammed my ship just remember that i am the guy who saved the human race and i did it because i was able to see exactly how the buggers military system worked and find its weak spot i have also seen how the human military system works and i know the weak spot and i know how to fix it ive just told you how either youll do it or you wont now make your decisions and dont bother me again unless youve made the right one mazer turned back to the desk and selected save and send when he was sure the message was sent he returned to his sleeping space and let himself think again about kim and pai and pahu about his grandchildren about his wifes new husband and what children they might have what he did not let himself think about was the possibility of returning to earth to meet these babies as adults and try to find a place among them as if he were still alive as if there were anyone left on earth for him to know and love the answer did not come for a full twelve hours mazer imagined with amusement the struggles that must be going on people fighting for their jobs filing reports proving that mazer was insane and therefore should not be listened to struggling to neutralize graffor suck up to him or get themselves assigned as his immediate supervisor trying to figure out a way to fool mazer into thinking they had complied without actually having to do it the answer when it came was from graff it was a visual mazer was pleased to see that while graff was in fact young he wore the uniform in a slovenly way that suggested that looking like an officer wasnt a particularly high priority for him he wore a captains insignia and a serious expression that was only a split second away from a smile once again admiral rackham with only one weapon in your arsenal you knew right where to aim it i had two missiles the first time said mazer do you wish me to record began the computer shut up and continue the message growled mazer you should know that your former wife kim arnsbrach rackham summersand yes she does keep your name as part of her legal namewas instrumental in making this happen because whenever somebody came up with a plan for how to fool you and me into thinking they were in compliance with your orders i would bring her to the meeting whenever they said well get admiral rackham to believe some lie or other she would laugh and the discussion would pretty much end there i cant tell you how long it will last but at this point the if seems to be ready to comply fully you should know that has involved about two hundred early retirements and nearly a thousand reassignments including forty officers of flag rank you still know how to blow things up there are things i already know about selection and training and over the next few years well talk constantly but i cant wait to take actions until you and i have conferred on everything simply because theres no time to waste and time dilation adds weeks to all our conversations however if i do something wrong tell me and ill change it ill never tell you that weve already done this or that as if that were a reason not to do it the right way after all i will show you that you have not made a mistake in trusting this to me the thing that puzzles me though is how you decided to trust me my communications to you were full of lies or i couldnt have written to you at all i didnt know you and had no clue how to tell you the truth in a way that would get past the committees that had to approve everything the worst thing is that in fact im very good at the bureaucratic game or i couldnt have got to the position to communicate directly with you in the first place so let me tell younow that no one will be censoring my messagesthat yes i think the highest priority is finding the right replacement for you as battle commander of the international fleet but once weve done thatand i know thats a big ifi have plans of my own because winning this particular war against this particular enemy is important of course but i want to win all future wars the only way we canby getting the human race off this one planet and out of this one star system the formics already figured it outyou have to disperse you have to spread out until youre unkillable i hope they turn out to have failed i hope we can destroy them so thoroughly they cant challenge us for a thousand years but by the end of that thousand years when another bugger fleet comes back for vengeance i want them to discover that humans have spread to a thousand worlds and there is no hope of finding us all i guess im just a bigpicture guy admiral rackham but whatever my longrange goals are this much is certain if we dont have the right commander and win this war it wont matter what other plans anybody has and you are that commander sir not the battle commander but the commander who found a way to get the military to reshape itself in order to find the right battle commander without wasting the lives of countless soldiers in meaningless defeats in order to find him sir i will not address this topic again but i have come to know your family in the past few weeks i know now something of what you gave up in order to be in the position youre in now and i promise you sir that i will do everything in my power to make your sacrifices and theirs worth the cost graff saluted and then disappeared from the holospace and even though he could not be seen by anybody mazer rackham saluted him back carthago delenda est genevieve valentine genevieve valentines fiction has appeared in or is forthcoming in strange horizons journal of mythic arts fantasy magazine farragos wainscot diet soap shimmer sybils garage and escape pod she is a columnist for torcom and fantasy magazine her appetite for good costumes and bad movies is insatiable obsessions she tracks on her blog glvalentinelivejournalcom valentine says that her favorite parts of old war movies are the nights before or the moments between battles when tension is building and character is revealed in the short silences between engagements this story sprang from the concept of this overnight waiting presented on a galactic scale what happens after hundreds of years of waiting for something based on a beautiful promise wren hexyemenni woke early they had to teach her everything from scratch and there wasnt time for her to learn anything new before she hit fifty and had to be expired watch it the other techs told me when i was starting out you dont want a hex on your hands by then we were monitoring wren heptayemenni she fell into bed with dorado ambassador though i dont know what he did to deserve it and she didnt even seem sad when he expired when they torched him she went over with the rest of the delegates and they bowed or closed their eyes or pressed their tentacles to the floors of their glass cases and afterwards they toasted him with champagne or liquid nitrogen before we expired hepta later that year she smiled at me make sure octas not ugly okay just in casefor wren octayemenni hates him so its not like it matters its worse early on octa and dorado stop short of declaring warno warring country is allowed to meet the being from carthage when it arrives those are the rulesbut it comes close every time she goes over to the dorado ship she comes back madder once she got him halfway into an airlock before security arrived we reported it as a chem malfunction i took the blame for improper embryonic processes a liethey were perfect and the dorado accepted the apology no questions dorado killed himself way back they know how mistakes can happen octa spends nights in the tech room scanning through footage of heptayemmeni and dorado like shes looking for something like shes trying to remember what hepta felt i dont know why she tries she cant none of them can they dont hold on to anything thats the whole point the astronomers at the institute named the planet carthage when they discovered it floating in the oort cloud like a wheel of garbage they thought it was already dead but the message came from there its how they knew to look in the cloud to begin with there was a message there in every language singing along the light like a phone call from home it was a message of peace they say its confidential most people never get to hear it i wouldnt even believe its real except that all the planets heard it and agreedevery last one of them threw a ship into the sky to meet the ship from carthage when it came every year they show us the video of wren alphayemennithe human the originaltaking the oath stretched out behind her are the ten thousand civilians who signed up to go into space and not come back to cultivate a meeting theyd never see i wren alphayemenni delegate of earth do solemnly swear to speak wisely feel deeply and uphold the highest values of the human race as earth greets the ambassador of carthage at the end she smiles and her eyes go bright with tears the speech goes on but i just watch her face theres something about alpha thats more alive than the copies they designated her with a letter just to keep track but it suits her anywaythe alpha the leader the strong first octa has a little of that sometimes but shell probably be expired by the time carthage comes and who knows if it will ever manifest again octa would never be alpha anyway theres something in alphas eyes thats never been repeatedsomething bright and determined excited happy it makes sense i guess shes the only one of the yemennis who chose to go everybody sent ships everybody wed never heard of half the planets that showed up you wonder how amazing the message must be to get them all up off their asses dorado was in place right away that whole planet is kissasses which is why they were already on iteration when we got there doradoan machines have to pop out a new one every twenty years my ancestors did better work on our machines they generate a perfect yemenni every fifty years on the dotexcept for poor hex theres always one dud dorado spends their time trying to scrounge up faster tech or better blueprints and we give our information away because those were the rules in the message but they just takethey havent given us anything since their dictionary wx from sextansa sent their royal house an expendable younger son and his wife and a collection of nobles to keep the bloodline active until the messenger arrived we dont deal with themthey think its coarse to clone ngc we cant pronounce it and sometimes its better not to try came out of canis major and surprised everyone since we didnt even think there was life out there theyve only been around a few years hepta never met them their delegate is in stasis whenever that poor sucker wakes up hes going to have some unimpressed ambassadors waiting to meet him they should never have come with only one xpelhi who booked it all the way from cygnus keep to themselves their atmosphere is too heavy for people with spines they look like jellyfish no mouths and it took us a hundred and ten years to figure out their language the dictionary they sent us was just an anatomical sketch hepta cracked it because of something tetrayemenni had recorded about the webs of their veins shifting when they were upset the xpelhi think were a bunch of idiots for taking so long which is fine i think theyre a bunch of mouthless creeps it evens out neptune sent a thinktank themselves like they were a real planet and not an earth colony theyve never said how they keep things going on that tiny ship if its cloning or bioreproduction or what every generation they elect someone for the job and i guess whenever carthage shows up theyll put forward the elected person and hope for the best brave bunch neptune better them than us centauri was the smartest planet they sent an ai you know the ai isnt sitting up nights worrying itself into early expiration its not bothered by a damn thing octa makes rounds to all the ships shes the only one of them who does it and it works canis major sent us help once when we had the ventilation problem on the storage levels she didnt ask for help theyre not obligated to share anything but information but when she came back an engineer was with her trust me i know everything about refrigeration he said and after the computer had translated the joke everybody laughed and shook his hand octa stood beside him like a mother until they had taken him into the tunnels and then she tucked her helmet under her arm like she was satisfied theyre good people she said to the shuttle pilot who was making a face with no ambassador to keep them going they must feel so alone give them a chance to do good ive got the scan ready i said i scan her every time she comes back from somewhere else its a precaution you never know whats going on outside your own ship lets be quick then she said already walking down the corridor i have to make some notes and then i need to talk to centauri centauris ai is octas favorite ship shes there far more often than she needs to be easier to come to decisions when its just a matter of facts she said octa did a lot of planning early on like she had a special purpose beyond what alpha had promisedlike time was short of all the copies she was the only one who ever seemed to worry that her clock was ticking down all the yemennis have been different which is unavoidable even though each one has all the aggregated information of previous iterations without the emotional hangover it can get messy like hepta and dorado human error in every copy its the reason her machines all have parameters instead of specs some things you never can tell poor hex its hard on them of courseafter fifty years it all starts to fall apart no matter what you do and you have to shut one down and start againbut its the best way we have to give her a lifetime of knowledge in a few minutes and we dont want carthage to come when were unprepared i dont know whats in the memories what they show her each time she wakes thats for government guys techs mind their own business theres a documentary about how they picked alpha for the job four hundred years back one man went on and on about the human aesthetic and put up a photo of what a woman would look like if every race had an influence in the facial features almost perfect its like they chose her for her looks he says laughing like carthage is going to know if shes pretty carthage is probably full of big amoebas and when they meet her theyll just think shes nasty and fragile and full of teeth they have a picture of alpha up in the lab anyway for reference no one looks at it any morenobody needs to when i look in the mirror i see a yemenni first and then my own face i have my priorities straight wren yemenni is why were here and the reason none of us have complained in four hundred years is because she knows what she owes us shes seen the video too with those ten thousand people who gave up everything because someone told them the message was beautiful no matter what her failings are she tries to learn everything she can each time to move diplomacy forward to be kind except to dorado but we all hate those asskissers so it doesnt matter she knows what shes here to do its coded deeper than her iq than her memories somewhere inside her we cant even reach duty is built into their bones alpha passed down something wonderful to all of them octa doesnt look like alpha not at all just before dorado hits his twentyyear expiration he messages a request that octa accompany him on an official visit to the xpelhi theres something he wants to show them he thinks theyll be interested everyone asks her to go when they have to talk to xpelhi we gave everyone the code once we cracked it we promised to exchange information fair and square but no one else is good at it and they need the help the yemmenis have a knack for language i hate him she says as i strap her into her suit its newour engineers made it to withstand the pressure in the xpelhi ship its the most amazing human tech weve ever produced earth will be proud when they get the message if peace didnt require me to go she says frowns i hope they see that what hes offering wont help anyone it never does she sounds tired i wonder if shes been up nights with the playback again its okay i say you can hate him if you want no one expected you to love him like the last one did its better not to carry the old feelings around you live longer hes different she says its terrible how its changed him all clones feel that way sometimes i say peril of the job heres your helmet she takes it and smiles at me a thankyou before she pops it over her head and activates the seal i feel like a snowman she says which is what hepta used to say i wonder if anyone told octa of if she just remembered it from somewhere i stay near the biomed readout while shes on the xpelhi ship if anything starts to fail the suit tells us if her lungs have collapsed from the pressure theres not much we can do but at least well know and we can wake up the next one her heart rate speeds up quick sharp spikes on the readout like shes having a panic attack but that happens whenever dorado says something stupid after a while its just a little agitation and soon shes safely back home she stands on the shuttle platform for a long time without moving and only after i start toward her does she wake up enough to switch off the pressure in the suit and haul her helmet off i stop where i am i dont want to touch her ive worked too hard on them to handle them everything all right shes frowning into middle space not really seeing me theres nothing on the ship we could use as a weapon strange question i guess we could crash the shuttle into someone i say i can ask the engineers no she says no need it was part of the message the first rule no war before carthage comes we dont even have armed security just guys who train with their hands ready in case octa tries to shove any more people in airlocks she hasnt done that in a while shes getting worn down it happens to them all nearer the end theres been no war for four hundred years she says as we walk shaking her head have we ever gone that long before without fighting any of us nope i grin carthage is the best thing that hasnt happened to us yet her helmet is tucked under one arm and she looks down at it like it will answer her the delegate meeting happens every decade it wasnt mandated by carthage wren tetrayemenni began it as a way for delegates to have a base of reference and to meet no one has even seen the new neptunian elect since they picked her two years back and they have to introduce dorado were not allowed to hear what they talk aboutits none of our business its government stuffbut we hang around in the hallways just to watch them filing in the humanoids and the xpelhis puttering past in their cases the centauri ai has a hologram that looks like a stick insect with wings and it blinks in and out as the signal from his ship gets spotty i cover my smile thoughthat computer sees everything on the way in dorado leans over to octa you wont say anything will you it would be war no she says i wont say anything its just in case he goes on like she didnt already give him an answer theres no plan to use them were not like thatits not like that you never know what carthages plans are is all then more quietly i trusted you trusted me she says you want someone to trust you try the next yemenni watch it he says a warning after a second she frowns at him how can you want war after all this effort he makes a suspicious face before he turns and walks into the reception room with the rest of them octa stands in the hall for a second before she follows him shoulders back and head high yemmenis know their duties after the delegate meeting octa takes a trip to the centauri ai shes back in a few hours she didnt tell anyone why she was going just looks sad to have come back sometimes i think octas mind is more like a computer than any of them even more than alpha i wonder if i made her that way by accident wishing better for them wishing for more in the mess the pilots grumble that it was a waste of shuttle fuel that program shows up anywhere they need it to one of them says why did we have to drive her around like shes one of the queens on sextan they should expire these copies before they go crazy man maybe she was trying to give us break from your ugly face i say and theres a little standoff at the table between the pilots and the techs until one of the language ops guys smoothes things over i stay angry for a long time the pilots dont know what theyre talking about yemennis do nothing by mistake alpha was the most skilled diplomat on the planet they dont say so in the documentary they talk about how kind she is and how smart she is and how she looks like a mix of everyone and if you just listened to what they were saying youd think she hardly deserved to go there were a lot of people in line astronauts and prime ministers and bishops all clamoring for the privilege and she got herself pickedshe got picked above every one of them she was the most skilled diplomat who ever lived she could work out anything i bet theres an engineer down five levels who looks good to me is smart enough and we get married we have two kids someone will have to watch over the yemennis when im gone someone with my grandfathers talents for calibrating a needle weve been six generations at wren yemmenis side we celebrate four hundred years of peace all the delegates put a message together to be played in every ship for the civilians for some of them its the first theyve heard of the other languages everyone on the ship twelve thousand strong watches raptly from the big hangar and the gymnasium level from the tech room and the bridge they go one by one and i recognize our reception room as the camera pans from one face to another they talk about peace about their home planets about how much they look forward to all of us knowing the message when carthage comes wren octayemenni goes last i hope that as we today are wiser today than we were so tomorrow we will be wiser than we are she says dorado looks like he wants to slap her she says i hope that when our time comes to meet carthage we may say that we have fulfilled the letter and spirit of its great message and we stand ready for a bright new age everyone in the tech room roars applause yemennis know how to talk to a crowd just before the video shuts off it shows all the delegates side by side octa is looking out the window towards something none of us can see one night a year before shes due to be expired i find octa in the development room shes watching the tube where ennea is gestating enneas almost grown and it looks like octas staring at her own reflection four hundred years without a war she says all of us at a truce talking and learning waiting for carthage carthage will come i promise glancing at enneas ph readout i hope we dont see it she says frowns into the glass i hope when it comes all of us are long dead and better ones have taken their places some people twist on themselves if you give them any time at all deka and hendeka are in tubes behind us smaller and reserved eyes closed theyre not ready we wont even need them until im dead though it shouldnt matter i care less for them than i do for ennea less than i do for octa whos watching me octa who seems to think none of them are worthy of carthage at all shes been losing faith for years none of these copies are like alpha they all do their duty but she believed at the fiftyyear mark octa comes in to be expired she hands over the recording device and the government guys disappear to their level to put together the memory flux for ennea who will wake up tonight and need to know you shouldnt keep doing this she tells me as we help her onto the table and adjust the iv there are no restraints the yemennis dont balk at what they have to do duty is in their bones but octa looks sad even sadder than when she found out that the one before her had loved someone who was already dead its fine i say its the best wayone session of information and shes ready to face carthage but she wont remember something if i dont record it she wont know octas always been a little edgyi try to sound reassuring no she wont feel a thing forget dorado theres nothing to worry about octa looks like shes going to cry what if theres something she needs to know ill get you a recorder i say and start to hold up my hand for the sound tech but she shakes her head and grabs my sleeve i drop my arm surprised no one else has even noticed theyre already starting the machines to wake up the next one and octa and i might as well be alone in the room after a second she frowns drops my hand makes fists at her sides like shes holding back the iv drips steadily and around us everyone is laughing and talking excited they seem miles away octa hasnt stopped watching me her eyes are bright her mouth drawn have you seen the message she must know i havent i shake my head i hold my breath wondering if shes going to tell me ive dreamed about it my whole life wondering what alpha knew that made her cry with joy four hundred years ago its beautiful she says and her eyes are mostly closed and i cant tell if shes talking to me or just talking the iv is working sometimes they say things she says i dont know how anyone could take up a weapon again after seeing the message without thinking i put my hand over her hand she sighs then so quietly that no one else hears octa says i hope that ship never comes her face gets tight and determinedshe looks like alpha exactly like and i almost call out for them to stopits so uncanny something must be wrong but nothing is wrong she closes her eyes and the biofeed flatlines the tech across the room turns off the alarm on the main bank and its over we flip on the antigrav and one of the techs takes her down to the incinerator he comes back says the other delegates have lined up in the little audience hall outside the incinerator waiting to clap and drink champagne its always a long night after an expiration but its what were here to do and its good solid work moving and monitoring and setting up the influx for yemennis first night nobody wants a delay between delegates you never know when the carthage is going to show up we think another four hundred years but it could be tomorrow stranger things have happened wren enneayemenni needs to be awake just in case shell have things to do when carthage comes lifesuspension l e modesitt jr l e modesitt is the bestselling author of the saga of recluse the spellsong cycle the corean chronicles and several other series as well as a number of standalone novels such as the eternity artifact the elysium commission and a new book haze thats due out in june his short fiction has appeared in a number of anthologies and was recently collected in viewpoints critical lifesuspension is set in a future where interstellar travel is possible but where there is warfare over who controls the lines of interstellar communication its a story that shows how thin the lines between all human passions are especially in war modesitt said i was a military pilot and ive tried to capture the feel of those situations and the contrast between the times of action and the quiet civility of officers in between action i the srs amaterasu had left kunitsu orbit station less than three hours earlier and flight captain ghenji yamato was more than ready to eat when the junior officers wardroom opened at kmt he wasnt the first enteringthat would have been most impolitebut he was far from the last when he took his seat halfway down the second table hed barely seated himself when his eyes registered a flash of white and he glanced up the officer who had just entered the mess caught his eyes immediately not because she was fullfigured which she was not boyish as her frame was but because her shortcut hair was pure white and her pale white face was almost unearthly in its beauty he almost laughed at the thought unearthly none of them would ever see earthand probably not even kunitsuagain for years objective years not subjective he reminded himself he found himself still looking at her for all the white hair she was probably younger than he was he couldnt help but stare before he looked down abruptly she was ships crewthat was certainand not one of the attack pilots for the mission ahead because he knew most of them except for the transfers and replacements although her hair was cut every bit as short as that of the women pilots in his squadron yet for all that he knew he had never seen her before there was something about her he just didnt know what it was he ate almost mechanically although he did enjoy the black tea probably a variant from the nintoku islands as he left the mess after the meal he glanced back but he didnt see the whitehaired captain as he looked to the corridor ahead leading to the attack operations spacesthere she was waiting and looking at him her eyebrows were also white as were her eyelashes but she had deep black eyes and red lips hello he offered im ghenji yamato flight captain i know your name that is and your reputation as the monk the monk ghenji knew the allusion but wasnt about to admit it the flight captain utterly devoted to his duties once hes shipside she smiled im rokujo rokujo yukionna she smiled im in lifesupport he thought he ought to recognize her name but he hadnt checked the roster of ships officers hed also never paid that much attention to names or where they came from his educational background had been engineering but hed been fortunate if one could call it that to have been accepted by the service for training as an attack needle pilot the current tour was his fourth and afterwards hed be eligible for promotion to majorand squadron commander or the equivalent with the timedilation effect even with military pay discounting hed even be able to retire not that hed ever considered that ghenji glanced at her green skinsuitmedicaland the senior captains insignia on the collars of her shipvest doctor or technical does it matter she laughed ruefully at least you asked most of the pilots just assume tech because i look so young youre in charge of he thought hed recovered as gracefully as possible very good im a recovery specialist but im chief of the suspension and support a most necessary specialty especially for attack pilots he said with a smile he couldnt have met her before but the sense of familiarity remained you didnt study at edo institute did you no fumitomo then heian for my residency why did you decide on the service i like the specialty it fits me and where else would i get this kind of experience all planetside suspension facilities are either geriatric wards for the wealthy or holding pens for clonereplacement therapy and there arent many of the latter ghenji nodded in a way its like attack flying if you want to pilot anything outside the service all you are is a tram driver all in all they talked for close to two stans before he had to leave to stand an opswatch not that doing so meant more than watching the system indicators ghenji didnt see rokujo the next day but when he woke the following morning and rolled out of his cubicle he decided that he would make an effort to encounter her while he had time to get to know her even though that was unlike him but she did fascinate him perhaps because of the calm almost unblinking way she viewed him as if she were focused on him and him alone still the amaterasu would enter deep jump in three days and in two ghenji yamato would climb into a cocoon and be hibernated until the ship reentered normspace not that he knew that destination only that it was in the area disputed by the mogulate and the republic after that his real tasks would begin for all his engineering background he still found it hard to understand a universe where instantaneousor nearinstantaneousinterstellar communications were possible but where interstellar travel was far slower it did make for an interesting galaxyand one that required the space service and one ghenji yamatoor other pilots like him despite his interest in rokujo with his own duties and schedule it was just before the evening meal when he saw her standing just outside the officers lounge adjoining the junior officers wardroom good afternoon rokujo good afternoon i was looking for you earlier at lunch we were running tests and i didnt get away since seating was not strictly by rank except at the formal mess dinners they sat together and talked you know your names are almost contradictions of who you are she said taking a quick mouthful of rice i hadnt thought about it im an engineer yamato was an emperor filled with courage and willing to commit the most treacherous acts possible in search of honor ghenji was a schemer and a lover and the first nondivine shinto romantic heroas depicted by a woman you certainly have courage but your honor is that of a monks and i doubt you could betray anyone thats a fault i didnt say that it was so long as honor doesnt preclude love what about you let us just say that i have two natures hot and cold and im always seeking balance while believing in absolutes after spending the meal mainly listening and just watching her ghenji realized that it was one of the more enjoyable he had spent in a service wardroom in years if ever unfortunately afterwards rokujo hurried off to deal with some sort of system glitch in the suspension diagnostics but that as ghenji knew all too well was more than typical for anyone who had to deal with systems his turn would come once they entered the combat zone he turned debating whether to stay and play speedchess when another pilot approached i saw you with captain yukionna offered hotaru the flight captain in charge of kamathree what about her asked ghenji cautiously oh nothing what youre not telling me isnt nothing replied ghenji with a grin well if you want to be with her dont even think about being with anyone else oh for ghenji the implications were appealing hed never liked it when women especially officers played off men against each other is that a return flight if youre hers shes yours and no one elses ill see you later ghenji stood watching he thought he heard hotaru murmur something else but he wasnt certain what was certain was that hotaru could have said more there was also no doubt he had no intention of doing so on threeday after his shift on the combat simulator ghenji cleaned up and made his way down to the lifesupport deck with the rows and rows of cocoons he found rokujo systemlinked and sat down on the deck crossleggedmonkfashion he supposedto wait how long have you been here she asked as she finished delinking from the system not long he stood and gestured toward the console what were you doing i was checking diagnostics on the medical suspension cocoons theres not a problem is there no thats why now is a good time to check everything in detail after you and the other pilots start flying missions well need themthat isnt the time to find out somethings wrong that makes sense he paused would you like to join me for some tea if you can and if how could he ask what he really wanted to know she smiled amusedly are you trying to find out if im committed to someone in some way im not and yes id love some tea even what passes for it in the wardroom then well see ghenji hadnt made that offer although it was what he had in mind ii the space service was practical but not given to more than acknowledging that humans particularly with mixed crews did require a certain privacy cubicles for one officer would fit two but not with all that much room to spare rokujo lying in ghenjis arms or on his right arm looked up officers cubes have a crosssection thats almost bellshaped it helps get rid of excess heat he replied languidly or traps it my notsomonkish lover he stroked her short silky brilliant white hair i need to go she said i do have the medsection midwatch you didnt i wasnt about to your monkish concern with duty would have had you protesting that you didnt want to interfere with mine almost absently she licked her lips before smiling at him this way youll get a good nights sleep he had to admire the seemingly boneless way in which she slithered into her uniform skinsuit and shipvest before leaving him and the cubicle he lay back amazed at what had happened in a way she had almost coiled around him he reflected yet cool as she seemed and as cool as her touch was she also radiated warmth how could anyone look so cool even feel so cool and then pour forth such heat but then she had said that her nature was both hot and cold later alone in his small cubicle he finally drifted into an uneasy sleep knowing that before long hed be in suspension in transit to the combat zone even if he had no idea where it was or exactly what the mission would be he dreamed and the dream was like all the others he was awake and trapped in his cocoon and just as the shakes and shivers began to subside the temperature began to plunge once more he could not move and at that moment the face of a woman with flowing white hair and skin as white as porcelain and lips like cherries appeared above him and bestowed a loving kiss upon himand the ice encased him with whiteness he woke not sweating but chill the face in his dream had been that of rokujo the chill in his soul intensified as he realized that it had been her face all along every dream about lifesuspension hed ever had was exactly the sameand it had always been her face he just hadnt known it surely he was just backprojecting he had to have been hed never met rokujo yukionna before embarking on the amaterasu iii ghenji didnt know whether to be relieved or disappointed when the cocoon opened and a thin techie glanced down at him signs are green flight captain you know the drill ser thank you ghenji eased his way out of the cocoon and sat on the stool sipping the special postsuspension tea waiting until the monitors showed that he was clear to resume duty after the evening spent with rokujo he hadnt seen her again before hed entered suspension not because he hadnt looked but because their work and watch schedules had simply not coincided in any practical fashion he checked the shiplinkthree point four standard years since theyd pushed off from kunitsu orbit station two and who knew how many more before they returned if they returned four stans later he was in the squadron ready room with the other flight captains listening to operations commander togata in less than forty hours well begin the attack on the first mogul station flight captain nokamura will lead kamaone flight captain yamato will lead kamafour full briefings are on all consoles togata gave a brisk nod to the flight captains releasing them to study the attack profiles the briefing consoles were enclosed booths set against the bulkhead on the starboard side of the flight operations center ghenji sat down in the nottotallycomfortable padded seat and lowered the hood waiting while the ops system verified his identity and then began the briefing the mission itself was simple the mogulate had already begun to change the planetary dynamics of the uninhabited system into whose outer reaches the amaterasu had recently emerged if the parthindians completed the reengineering they would disrupt the clearlinkcomm line used by the republic that connected the upper galactic west section to the east section of the inhabited republic solar systems the amaterasus needles were just to take out the two central engineering installations in the system at the very least that would cost the mogulate another ten years of investment and resources at best the parthindians would abandon the project and attempt some other form of havoc the mission required two separate attacks roughly one to two days apart in the centuries since the diaspora warfare like everything else had changed and with information and knowledge as the basis for technological societies intersystem communications had become more and more paramount for a system that lacked that connection could falter technologically and become vulnerable so warfare involved attacks on the linklines as much as attacks on systems and planetsand had also become rooted more and more in convictions of rightness not that righteousness and truth hadnt been prime motivations behind battle from the first knapped flint spear afterward ghenji went to the wardroom and had a large mug of green tea hed always felt cold inside and out after a console briefing then he went back to the ops center and began to study the possible attack vectors from the drop spot and particularly the lastinstant options before he finished it was time to eat but he was late and didnt see rokujo until she was already seated between several others members of the ships crew as soon as he could he hurried to meet her before she escaped to the medcenter or wherever she stood waiting smiling id almost hoped to see you when i came out of suspension he confessed you dont want that she replied with a laugh im only there when theres trouble the snowmaidenwoman if you will her voice dropped except im no maiden as you well know ghenji blushed she took his hand everything would have been perfect except after she left his cubicle he dreamed the suspension dream againand the face was indeed that of rokujo and she was trying to tell him something something urgent iv ghenji had run through the checklist and waited in his needle monitoring the operations net with his armor tight and restrainers locked as the amaterasu began to spew forth the attack needles kayone stand by for release standing by sunbase control launch one kayone is clear flight kaytwo to position before long the four needles of kamafour were in position in the massdrivers launch four the brutal jolt of acceleration pinned ghenji and his armor into the needles couch as the amaterasus mass drivers hurled the four needles of his flight downward toward the solar engineering facility orbiting the f star that the mogulate was working to turn into a facsimile of a nova kayfour release on schedule affirm kayfour on line and alpha victor ghenji beamed back concentrating on the mental display fed to him by the needle ai showing his four needles on courseline aimed directly at the mogulate installation they were traveling energyblanked hurled out by the sunlike power of the amaterasu without energy emissions the mogulate edis would detect nothing until the needles were within enhanced visual range and by then effective reaction would be difficult not impossible because nothing could conceal that a ship had entered the system and that it had released a single blast of energy but the defenders could only estimate what sort of attack might be coming on what vectors and when there was always the possibility that the launch blast had been a decoy designed to lure defenders into position wasting time and energy and even putting them in the wrong location even so ghenji kept checking the edi and detectors for any signs of defender vessels fourteen and a half minutes later he had visual on the mogulate installationas well as edi on more than a dozen hotscoutsthe highpowered and heavilyshielded mogulate defenders the kamafour needles had certain advantagesfar higher downsystem absolute velocity than the defenders could ever match greater numbers and until they began to use their drives to maneuver virtual invisibility the disadvantages were that the defenders knew where the kama needles had to go in order to plant their torps and that the defenders individually had greater firepower seconds later his sensors could pick out a gap between two of the hotscouts not linked by defense screens too obvious he tweaked the drives and angled for a narrower space above and to the right of the central hexagonal energy net maintained by the parthindian defenders almost as soon as hed committed he was through the gap and releasing his four torps the rear screen display only rear in the sense that his mind identified it as such showed the fading energy flares that had been republic attack needles initially he could see that three of the four needles in his flight had survived the defense barrage torp energy lines seemingly from everywhere converged on the hollowedout nickeliron asteroid that would have been one of two energy fulcrums used to change the stellar dynamics of the f sun that dominated one quadrant of his edi then the entire edi screen flared before blanking to avoid overloading both the nanotronics of the needle and the brain cells of the pilot ghenji checked his departure vector against the projected track of the amaterasu if the giant needlecarrier followed the projected track if then he was home free that was all there was to it in a sensean approach in which the less maneuvering required the greater the possibility of success and survival a window of between nanoseconds and seconds in which to launch torps and the selection and execution of an escape vector that would take the pilot back to the needlecarrier that had launched him or her in the end nanoseconds were all that separated success and failure kayfour lead kayfourdelta massive damage vectoring on you open slave link within his armor ghenji winced but immediately activated his slave acquisition system then he checked the inputs from the damaged needle the drives had kicked the needle onto the departure vector before fusing but outside of the separate slave transmitter the delta needle was halfjunk and habitability was nil he could only hope that kashiwagis emergency lifesuspension system had functioned as designed ghenji used his steering drives to link with the damaged needle but even hulltohull could get no feedback another seventeen minutes passed before ghenji had lockon with the amaterasu sunbase control kayfour lead approaching from your eightseven amber level kayfour lead interrogative status kayfour lead and beta green kayfour gamma strike at target kayfour delta on slavelink and tow status unknown standing by for linkrecovery for delta couplers ready suggest decel in ten sunbase control affirm decel in ten operations control took kashiwagis needle first and then the two remaining kamafour needles with ghenji last before he powered down and left the cradle he linked to ops interrogative status kayfour delta recovery successful pilot in suspension thank you sunbase ops he finished the shutdown checklist and then eased himself out of the restrainers and then out of the needle through the flexible umbilical tube later there would be a complete debrief after operations correlated all the information but once he finished the postflight and mech report he checked the mission status out of sixty needles launched seven had been lost and four had returned with various stages of damage to the needles and their pilots he noddedthe stats were close to operational norms he still had time before the flight leader debrief and he needed to check on lieutenant kashiwagi the lieutenant was one of his pilots tired as ghenji was he headed up to the medical section as he neared the two technicians stationed at the master suspension consoles he couldnt help but overhear the quiet words between them snowwoman got him but he should make it bring em back from a block of ice not medically possible she can snowwoman ghenji stepped forward can you tell me about lieutenant kashiwagi ser both stiffened neither spoke for a moment then one finally said dr yukionna could best tell you and it will be a while ill wait he stood there pacing back and forth for close to a stan before he saw a flash of short brilliant white hair youre here because of one of your pilots rokujos words were barely a question kashiwagi kamafourdelta will he make it she offered a faint smile its likely he did suffer explosive decompression before lifesuspension fully kicked in thats in addition to major organ failures we dont have the facilities to rebuild him here but theres a good chance that we can keep him alive in suspension until we return to kunitsu likely that didnt sound good most of those who are likely to survive do and if they survive the medsystems at kunitsu orbit station can return almost all to full function that was the best ghenji could hope for he nodded later he asked it might be much later but yes the quick smile that burst through the formal frosty exterior was gone almost as soon as it had appeared but ghenji had seen it v immediately after the needle recovery the amaterasu withdrew and began the maneuvers to move into position for the second attack ghenji had appreciated rokujos company the evening after the first attack but he did not see her again until the evening meal the following shipday she was looking for him though as she entered the wardroom how is kashiwagi he asked hes under suspension theres no way to tell now not until they bring him out when we return how are you concerned now that ive thought about it there should have been more defenders at the last installation they settled near the end of the second table you think therell be more at the next maybe they thought wed attack it first he shook his head enough of that do you prefer the art of calligraphy representation or actuality that should spark some discussion since it had been more than a little controversial on kunitsu just before they had left in part because one of the artmonks had used a molecular shredder to destroy an entire actuality exhibit at the national museum at oharano claiming that the actuality school did not practice art but merely plagiarized reality i tend toward representation she smiled especially when embellished by calligraphy as she talked occasionally gesturing turning her hand in the indirect light of the mess ghenji thought he saw the faintest pattern of white on her white skin white on white almost diamondlike or he wasnt quite certain he thought there might be the same pattern on her neck as well but then again much much later as they lay there together in ghenjis cubicle he did not wish to think about the next day hed never really worried about missions and duty not before hed met rokujo so he tried to think of something anything that would divert her and him you said you were the snowwoman and so did one of the techs ghenji didnt want to turn his statement into a question thats because of my billet and my name the name is the same as one from an old legend and you know what i do im responsible for bringing people out of suspension out of the cold or putting them into it if necessary she absently licked her lips red but thin and as he had discovered more than mobile ghenji couldnt help watching closely they were very close and when shed done that it had looked to him almost as though shed flicked her tonguea rather pointed tongue he wanted to shake his head that wasnt possible and the white hair she just shrugged in that incredibly sinuous and sensual fashion that fascinated him the hair goes a long ways back to old earth at least its always run in my family ive been told the women are an odd mixture what else runs in your family ghenji tried to keep his tone light besides passion he grinned jealousy she bent forward and nibbled his ear we dont share ever that was fine with ghenji then he thought what about duty you do have to share me with duty youre fortunate one of my ancestors didnt understand that i do mostly she wrapped her arms around him coiling herself about him at that moment ghenji had no more interest in biographical questions when he woke she was gone vii once more flight captain ghenji yamato waited in his needle monitoring the net within his armor he felt hot and clammy yet cold and chill why what had happened to the warriormonk kayfour stand by for release standing by sunbase control he pulsed back launch four the sudden acceleration slammed ghenji and his armor into the needles couch as the amaterasus mass drivers hurled his needle out and away he and the remaining two needles of his flight slashed upward at an angle toward the second component of the mogulate solar engineering facility ghenji checked vectors and relative speeds sunbase control affirm kayfour online he forced himself to concentrate on the mental display while he kept checking the edi and detectors for the first signs of the parthindian defenders less than twelve minutes later he had both visual and full edi on the mogulate defensesand he didnt like what he saw there were close to forty hotscouts comprising a defense net with four energyscreen hexagons and all were lined up almost perfectly to block the amaterasus needles he mentally checked the options scanned the offshoots and pulsed to his flight kayfour course change follows execute now the two quick heading changes would do nothing to the flights projected target release point but they would change the angle of penetration of the defense screenenough ghenji hoped to allow a successful torp release he wasnt so sure about whether they could correct enough afterwards assuming they did penetrate to regain a departure vector that would allow successful recovery there were no real gaps in the defense screens not given the speeds and vectors involved and ghenji angled his needle toward the lowest energy concentration level in the screens with the least course deviation possible then just in the nanosecond when the needle impacted the screens the system shifted all power to ablation and defense the needle was through the mogulate defenses and nothing lay between it and the second hollowedout asteroid ghenji released all four torps in his mental display ahead of him his screens showed far fewer energy lines impacting the parthindian installation than during the first mission and behind him far greater numbers of energy flares that had once been republic attack needles at that instant the edi screen blanked in overload protection nearly simultaneously the needle bucked and shudderedand the diversion screens crumbled that was trouble at the velocities his needle carried anything at all that struck the needle could now turn it into a mass of scrap composite and metal a second shudder rattled the needle and ghenji couldnt help but wince as fire shot through his back and down both legs then he felt nothing below his waist nothing not heat or chill ignoring what he couldnt do anything about ghenji forced himself to study the needles diagnostics the shield generators had already gone red the converter blinked amber then red and stored power reserves running down barely enough for a return to the amaterasu on residual velocity he funneled almost all the remaining power into the steering drives trying to get the needle back at least close to the departure vector for rendezvous with the amaterasu if he didnt get close enough then injuries and habitability didnt matter the fading screens did show him that the mission had been successfulwhere the second installation had been was a rapidly expanding mass of energy and mass then needle system after system began to shut down ghenji quickly crosschecked his departure vector against the projected track of the amaterasu close but was it close enough there were no other needles from flight four that had made it through and the closescreens didnt show any needle nearby enough to slave to on his courseline and velocity eta with the amaterasu was a good fortythree minutes away and something like forty would be without power he triggered a burst comm sunbase control kayfour lead all systems red on track for pick up eta plus fortythree will activate beacon mission accomplished within less than five minutes he could feel the chill beginning to creep above his waist a sure sign of far greater damage to his needle and armorand himselfthan hed realized he hated the idea but there was no help for it he triggered the emergency suspension system as the cold rose around him the shakes and shivers began if only in his upper body and he could not move somewhere in the mist beyond there was the face of a woman with flowing white hair and skin as white as porcelain and lips like cherries appeared above him speak of this to no one else and you will be spared eternal winter she said and bestowed a chilling kiss upon himand the ice encased him with whiteness viii ghenji blinked as the cocoon opened and rokujo smiled at him bending down and brushing his lips with herswarm and merely applered rather than chill and cherry red you gave even me quite a bit of trouble she murmured but youll be fine youre not he remembered the words of the snowwoman in whiteso like if not identical to rokujoand he forced a smile i am what i am and you have a very good memory for which im grateful she kissed him gently once more besides you really dont believe in those ancient legends do you her white eyebrows arched just slightly but sinuously this time after her kiss his body and blood did not turn to ice terraexulta s l gilbow s l gilbow is a relatively new writer with three stories published to date all in the magazine of fantasy science fiction he debuted in the february issue with red card a dystopian sf story in the vein of shirley jacksons the lottery gilbow taught college english for a few years in the early nineties but claims that he hasnt had much training in writing fiction he says hes currently writing the great american novel hes only got one line so far but says to trust him its definitely going to be great and its definitely going to be american this story is about language and how words can be created and used it was inspired by the word grimpting which was made up in junior high by gilbows wife her sister and a childhood friend gilbow says he and his wife use it to describe those things that are so bad you cant think of another word for them so add that one to your vocabulary just dont use it in reference to any of these stories i submit the following translation to the galactic society of ancient languages in response to the absurd assertion made at our last conference although we all agree that archaic planetary english can be translated into our galactic standard some still hold that the process cannot be effectively reversed therefore i submit the following sample of my work as evidence that such a translation is indeed possible i have selected a transmission at random from my files so that none can accuse me of selecting text based solely on its simplicity i have chosen to retain some words in galactic standard but only those few which cannot be logically translated however rest assured the text below and even this introduction written in that ancient language could have been understood on earth so very long ago i hope once and for all this puts this issue to rest doctor galwot kradame linguist my good doctor kradame may this transmission find you safe warm and well it is difficult to believe seventeen years have passed since last we met where does time flow i plan to return to the old system within the halfyear and hope to see you once again i will soon complete my latest project and begin the long journey home to earththat place i left so very long ago i have been gone far too long it is now time to return i read your recent article in interstellar linguistics with great enthusiasm your proposal to translate our language into archaic planetary english fascinates me if you want for material i welcome you to use one of my works to complete your exercise i recommend two of my articles for your consideration terrology made simple and my vision my worlds i await with great curiosity to see if such a translationas academic as it may becan actually be accomplished i also enjoyed your superb study of languages in this partlet us call it my partof the galaxy your analysis was brilliant as always and i delighted in seeing the information i provided you regarding dead languages proved helpful i appreciate the eloquent way you put it experience is surpassed only by more experience in your previous transmission you asked me to identify all the words i have coined that are now a permanentif anything is permanentpart of our wonderful language as you know well my career has been long and my writings voluminous so attempting to track down every word i have createdintentionally or unintentionallywould prove futile nevertheless as a lover of language like you i treasure the opportunity to highlight a few words which come to mind certainly the word i must first mention is grimpting to define grimpting would of course be ludicrous it is so common now i might as well define planet terraship or lubradroid nevertheless it is the word for which i am best known so with your kind indulgence i will tell you how this word first came to be it is a story i seldom relate truth is truth so i must admit that i was not the first to use the word although to the best of my knowledge i was the first to form it into writing i initially heard the word grimpting from a young worker of mine while i headed the kolome project although you are by decades younger than i i am sure you have heard stories of what a difficult project that turned out to be i can assure you there is much truth in those storiesand many lies what a troubling project what a troubling time kolome provided some unique challenges we had not previously encountered this was long ago back when we were still working out many of the protocols for terraforming planets and our federation was still youngwhen the various species scattered across the galaxy were just learning to work with one another in my defense i arrived on the project quite late well after things had grown complicated but i can assure you we began making steady progress soon after my arrival one daywith day being relative of coursei was leading a meeting on a capitalclass terrology station orbiting kolome this was no ordinary gathering of petty busicrats no faclicants or holoreps were allowed only those who had proven themselves worthy were invited and all the representatives each carefully selected had traveled very far some came from our most newly developed planets the rest came all the way from earth such was their profound commitment to this project i held the meeting in the stations main conference room where a long table stood before an enormous window looking out over kolome a beautiful red drop in the distance outside the window six klarmond ships even now considered the finest terraships ever built were lined abreast in construction formation have you ever seen a klarmond ship doctor kradame nothing else made by man possesses such power two klarmond ships can transform a small planet in a halfyear they can level mountains or empty seas move continents or cleanse a chlorine atmosphere initially i ordered the klarmond ships to kolome merely to illustrate my resolution initially i had no intention of actually using them the meeting turned out to be quite a challenge five senior leaders seven adjuncts a full team of my engineers and i were struggling with some delicate issues but things were going very well and some wonderful ideas were being tossed about just as i made an excellent point a pointyou must understandwith which almost everyone agreed one of the engineers sitting next to me slammed her hand down on the conference table making a sound as deafening as a continental klarmond shot i assure you i have been in many meetings in my life and that is the only time i have ever witnessed such uncivilized behavior but she did she hammered the table with the blunt of her hand and shouted much to my embarrassment this is the most grimpting thing i have ever heard in my life i stopped i stopped talking i stopped listening for a few seconds i stopped breathing i think my heart was even still the fruitful discussion we had been having and the excellent progress we had been making immediately ceased we all just stared at her not really sure how to react i sensed that i could lose control of the meeting if i did not act quickly this was not just a disruption this was a challenge a challenge to my very authority the senior leaders all wise and gerbunctious looked at me after all she was my employee and it was my meeting i could have had her ejected immediately but i did no such thing i just looked as her and thought for a moment and then i said as calmly as i could what do you mean what do i mean she asked she did not look well she was pale and trembled like a baby limik even now i attribute her behavior to some undetected illness the regulian flu perhaps just look she whispered just look at what you are proposing just stop for a second and look at it no i said obviously the young woman had completely missed my point another sign of her illness i assume what do you mean by grimpting i asked her eyes widened and she stared at me as if i had spoken in a language she could not comprehend two of the leaders at the table smiled at me and one of the adjuncts even laughed so i seized the opportunity i leaned towards her moving as close as i could without leaving my seat her breath was hot on my face are you making up words i asked a few more joined the adjunct in laughter are you sure youre well i added the young woman turned as red as a glamik and explained that she and her sister had made up grimpting as children and that to define it would be difficult they had in fact never defined it they had merely used it she looked down at her hands and then she looked at mine finally she said quite seriously i believe but whatever the hell it means i am sure it is entirely appropriate the young woman rose from her seat and ran from the room after the laughter had faded we composed ourselves and continued our excellent progress i must admit i owe much to that young woman i cannot remember her name and really do not know whatever happened to her she was off the station within two hours and i can assure you she is no longer a terrologist but that young woman made me keenly aware of language she made me aware of how easily words can be created how they can be crafted and used i have uttered the word grimpting or one of its various formsgrimpts grimpter grimptel grimpted almost every day since i last saw that young woman what wonderful words they all are as i look back on the kolome project i realize that it provided many fine words to our language to avoid wandering into a topic that cannot be easily covered in one short transmission please allow me to limit my discussion to the words that emerged from my work with that single planet i am not sure of how familiar you are with kolome i certainly do not remember it coming up in any of our conversations so please indulge me while i recount a little history if you need more information i encourage you to read my early work on the subject kolomewhen rumors meet truth kolome was the eighth planet outside our solar system we had attempted to settle a remote planet kolome is best remembered for being the first planet we colonized with indigenous life already on it by the time i was brought onto the project humans had been living on kolome for almost two years initially there was no plan to terraform kolome at all the atmosphere was breathable and the temperature although frodeling was warm enough to sustain human life water was scarce but enough could be extracted from minerals to negate the need to import more all in all it was a decently hospitable planet the first colonists established one settlement in the north and one far to the southwith north and south being relative of course the equatorial region warm and lush could have much more easily sustained human life but the first settlers avoided the region in order not to conflict with the numerous life forms that already thrived there for almost two years the colonies survived without any problem at least nothing more than the usual challenges of settling an alien world the northern settlement grew to more than seventhousand inhabitants and showed signs of economic potential the southern colony although not quite as prosperous began to expand to the north things seemed to be going very well very well indeed until inexplicably one of the indigenous species started to migrate toward the southern pole the migrating species was red and long but no wider than the tip of your little finger they looked like quick ribbons fluttering about close to the ground their migration started slowly no more than a few kilometers a week but by the time i was summoned the creatures had come within fifty kilometers of the southern settlements primary base they did not seem particularly aggressive and the colonists initially assessed them to be quite harmless unfortunately initial assessments are frequently wrong as the creatures neared one of our outposts many colonists there grew ill it started with a few isolated cases of fever and hallucinations the doctors on kolome initially thought they could contain the disease but it rapidly spread into an epidemic incapacitating the entire southern settlement most patients recovered after a few days for some the illness lingered for weeks for a few but far far too many the disease proved fatal at first the colonists did not draw a connection between the illness and the migrating species they initially thought the symptoms might be a delayed reaction to one of the native plantlike species the colonists fed upon the food had been thoroughly tested years before but was studied again and found to be quite harmless as initially assessed the finest physicians in that part of the galaxy were brought in but none of them could cure the disease or even determine its cause in the end we could only assume the illness had something to do with the migration of the little red creatures by the time i arrived almost twohundred colonists in the south had perished there was talk of abandoning the settlement some even proposed leaving kolome altogether i will not go into the details of how we resolved the problem for that is not my purpose here i fear i have already digressed i will try to restrict myself to the subject at hand the words which arose from my work on the kolome project i must admit that i saw the little creatures only once and that was during a brief excursion to kolomes surface i had traveled over a hundred kilometers north of the southern settlement some of the colonists had encouraged me to take a faclicant to help me properly assess the situation as it is on this excursion i preferred to travel as one trusting my instincts an ancient philosopher once said when a man is alone he is alone truth is truth and i must admit i have never felt so isolated even with the settlement only ten minutes away by galaride while i surveyed what i can only describe as a hopelessly barren landscape one of the creatures came flitting by alternately displaying its crimson back and its underside flecked with orange and yellow as the creature passed within halfaten meters i heard it make a highpitched singing sound the first colonists understandably entranced with the creatures had named them trillbrights as i watched the trillbright dance over that desolate landscape i realized the challenge i faced the problems that lay before me the creature was as i had feared quite beautiful more beautiful than the holopics could ever portray as the trillbright twisted its way into the distance i knew what i would have to do i knew i would have to change the trillbrights name after days of deliberation i decided upon slaggerbug truth is truth so i must admit the creatures actually had very little in common with insects except size but it was not the accuracy of the word that was important to me with a little coaxing slaggerbug became the accepted term among the colonists and scientists in the region i correctly assumed that if i could change the word used by the local population the rest of the galaxy would follow their lead soon afterwards i wrote an article for galactic science in which i coined another worddelinction delinction was i proposed the methodical elimination of a harmful or useless species we had to acknowledge i argued that we no longer had life on a single planet to contend withor even a handful of planets for that matter we had an entire galaxy potentially teeming with life we had to recognize that just because something did exist it did not necessarily mean it should exist the article i am proud to say was well received in this part of the galaxy of course language rarely resolves problems by itself it is only one of many tools used to address difficult issues and i used all my tools to help persuade others to see the logic in my argument but it is language i am addressing here so i will try to restrict myself to that topic of course things are never as simple as they first appear many believe that terraforming is merely using powerful equipment to shape reform and refine a planet in reality terraforming is about managing cause and effect about judging consequences when you are working on a planetary scale every action will have a dramatic reaction often one you did not predict it is the terrologists job to assess those reactions and respond accordingly kolome is an excellent case in point once the slaggerbugs were gone the small gray plantlike organism which had sustained the colonists began to perish it was not completely unexpected but many busicrats grew angry when what we had already identified as a possibility actually occurred i took however another approach the organism had originally been named calobush so i merely asserted that if we were going to use plant analogies referring to the organism as a bush was not entirely accurate i rationally recommended changing the organisms name to caloweed i also pointed out that although the caloweed was capable of sustaining life much more flavorful and nutritious food could be grown on kolome i argued that since the caloweed was already perishing and could be replaced it would be logical to speed up the process once the caloweed was gone the remaining species declined as well the glushworm and testimite were gone within a year the cessfish hung on a little longer this brings us to the word retoration retoration would be i asserted simply the removal of all life from a planet in order to repopulate it with other life forms to create a more balanced ecology but of all the words which arose from the kolome project i believe my personal favorite is terraexulta during the first year of the transformation things were extremely difficult the planet had to be temporarily abandoned while the klarmond ships did their work many argued not to return to kolome at all i countered by saying that although things were difficult in the end the result would be terraexulta a perfect world an ideallyconstructed planet in the end i worked on the kolome project for over five years after four years kolome was once again a viable planet but you should see it now it has little resemblance to the frigid wasteland i visited long ago the entire planet thrives full of life and features you would quickly recognize even though it was one of my early works i am especially proud of it since that time i have worked on many planets and with each project came new challenges and new words the walgard project brought us anaclam fecateria glomoration reimmolate and elimitest the glaman project itself spawned seventeen new nouns six verbs and one of my favorite words ecoviserate oh how i could go on for the list is almost endless i have as it is written far more than i intended i hope you find this information useful as you continue your studies please let me know if you need any more information for i do so enjoy reminiscing as i said at the beginning of this transmission i will soon be returning to the old system i am excited about once again seeing the places i left behind so very long ago i have heard that mars grows greener with each passing day and the moons rivers run deep and clean it warms my heart to see the positive changes my profession can make such works bring tears to the eyes of even the most seasoned terrologist but what i have heard of earth is quite disheartening the air is thin and the seas are thick and hot i have also heard the population has become quite grimpting unfortunately as most of our human race grows strong there are regrettably some few who do not earths viability falls with each passing day and there is some talk out here of redoing it for it is out here among the various scattered species of the galaxy among those new planets that we have marked with the gifts of my profession that we have truly perfected the art of terraforming i have made some proposals modest ones i assure you for improving earth and anxiously await a response for is it not obvious that when a planet fails some form of dilinction is in order can we not see what a positive influence a retoration can have on even the most ancient of our treasured worlds should we not work to ecoviserate those few who are not functioning as they should and replace them with the stronger species that have grown even flourished out here on the fringes of civilization will we not take the effort to turn the birthplace of what is now a welltraveled speciesa galactic speciesinto a true terraexulta i have already taken the liberty of ordering eight klarmond ships to head toward earth it will be my gift to humanityusing those talents i have developed out here so very far from solto turn our ancestral home into the terraexulta it deserves to be what a wonderful opportunity who knows what new words will spring from this new project give my love to the family humbly yours harald k jeribob terrologist aftermaths lois mcmaster bujold lois mcmaster bujold is a fivetime winner of the hugo award and the winner of three nebula awards she has published nearly two dozen novels including several in her popular barrayar series which mostly feature aristocrat and interstellar spy miles vorkosigan the first of these the warriors apprentice appeared in but she made her debut a few years earlier in when she sold a short story to twilight zone magazine over the years she hasnt written much other short fiction so this one is a rare treat although bujolds career started off in science fiction lately shes turned her hand to fantasy writing first the chalion series then moving onto the sharing knife volume four of that series horizon came out in february learn more about her and her work at wwwdendariicom this story which takes place in her barrayar milieu takes a rather grim look at some of the professions that will arise in the wake of interstellar war the shattered ship hung in space a black bulk in the darkness it still turned imperceptibly slowly one edge eclipsed and swallowed the bright point of a star the lights of the salvage crew arced over the skeleton ants ripping up a dead moth ferrell thought scavengers he sighed dismay into his forward observation screen picturing the ship as it had been scant weeks before the wreckage untwisted in his minda cruiser alive with the patterns of gaudy lights that always made him think of a party seen across night waters responsive as a mirror to the mind under its pilots headset where man and machine penetrated the interface and became one swift gleaming functional no more he glanced to his right and selfconsciously cleared his throat well medtech he spoke to the woman who stood beside his station staring into the screen as silently and long as he had theres our starting point might as well go ahead and begin the pattern sweep now i suppose yes please do pilot officer she had a gravelly alto voice suitable for her age which ferrell judged to be about fortyfive the collection of thin silver fiveyear service chevrons on her left sleeve made an impressive glitter against the dark red uniform of the escobaran military medical service dark hair shot with gray cut short for ease of maintenance not style a matronly heaviness to her hips a veteran it appeared ferrells sleeve had yet to sprout even his firstyear stripe and his hips and the rest of his body still maintained an unfilled adolescent stringiness but she was only a tech he reminded himself not even a physician he was a fullfledged pilot officer his neurological implants and biofeedback training were all complete he was certified licensed and graduatedjust three frustrating days too late to participate in what was now being dubbed the hundred and twenty day war although in fact it had only been days and part of an hour between the time the spearhead of the barrayaran invasion fleet penetrated escobaran local space and the time the last survivors fled the counterattack piling through the wormhole exit for home as though scuttling for a burrow do you wish to stand by he asked her she shook her head not yet this inner area has been pretty well worked over in the last three weeks i wouldnt expect to find anything on the first four turns although its good to be thorough ive a few things to arrange yet in my work area and then i think ill get a catnap my department has been awfully busy the last few months she added apologetically understaffed you know please call me if you do spot anything thoughi prefer to handle the tractor myself whenever possible fine by me he swung about in his chair to his comconsole what minimum mass do you want a bleep for about forty kilos say one kilo is the standard i prefer one kilo he stared are you joking joking she stared back then seemed to arrive at enlightenment oh i see you were thinking in terms of wholei can make positive identification with quite small pieces you see i wouldnt even mind picking up smaller bits than that but if you go much under a kilo you spend too much time on false alarms from micrometeors and other rubbish one kilo seems to be the best practical compromise bleh but he obediently set his probes for a mass of one kilo minimum and finished programming the search sweep she gave him a brief nod and withdrew from the closetsized navigation and control room the obsolete courier ship had been pulled from junkyard orbit and hastily overhauled with some notion first of converting it into a personnel carrier for middle brasstop brass in a hurry having a monopoly on the new shipsbut like ferrell himself it had graduated too late to participate so they both had been rerouted together he and his first command to the dull duties he privately thought on a par with sanitation engineering or worse he gazed one last moment at the relic of battle in the forward screen its structural girdering poking up like bones through sloughing skin and shook his head at the waste of it all then with a little sigh of pleasure he pulled his headset down into contact with the silvery circles on his temples and midforehead closed his eyes and slid into control of his own ship space seemed to spread itself all around him buoyant as a sea he was the ship he was a fish he was a merman unbreathing limitless and without pain he fired his engines as though flame leapt from his fingertips and began the slow rolling spiral of the search pattern medtech boni he said keying the intercom to her cabin i believe i have something for you here she rubbed sleep from her face framed in the intercom screen already what timeoh i must have been tireder than i realized ill be right up pilot officer ferrell stretched and began an automatic series of isometrics in his chair it had been a long and uneventful watch he would have been hungry but what he contemplated now through the viewscreens subdued his appetite boni appeared promptly sliding into the seat beside him oh quite right pilot officer she unshipped the controls to the exterior tractor beam and flexed her fingers before taking a delicate hold yeah there wasnt much doubt about that one he agreed leaning back and watching her work why so tender with the tractors he asked curiously noting the low power level she was using well theyre frozen right through you know she replied not taking her eyes from her readouts brittle if you play hotshot and bang them around they can shatter lets stop that nasty spin first she added half to herself a slow spin is all right seemly but that fast spinning you get sometimesit must be very unrestful for them dont you think his attention was pulled from the thing in the screen and he stared at her theyre dead lady she smiled slowly as the corpse bloated from decompression limbs twisted as though frozen in a strobeflash of convulsion was drawn gently toward the cargo bay well thats not their fault is itone of our fellows i see by the uniform bleh he repeated himself then gave vent to an embarrassed laugh you act like you enjoy it enjoy no but ive been in personnel retrieval and identification for nine years now i dont mind and of course vacuum work is always a little nicer than planetary work nicer with that godawful decompression yes but there are the temperature effects to consider no decomposition he took a breath then let it out carefully i see i guess you would getpretty hardened after a while is it true you guys call them corpsesicles some do she admitted i dont she maneuvered the twisted thing carefully through the cargo bay doors and keyed them shut temperature set for a slow thaw and hell be ready to handle in a few hours she murmured what do you call them he asked as she rose people she awarded his bewilderment a small smile like a salute and withdrew to the temporary mortuary set up next to the cargo bay on his next scheduled break he went down himself drawn by morbid curiosity he poked his nose around the doorframe she was seated at her desk the table in the center of the room was as yet unoccupied uhhello she looked up with her quick smile hello pilot officer come on in uh thank you you know you dont really have to be so formal call me falco if you want he said entering certainly if you wish my first name is tersa oh yeah i have a cousin named tersa its a popular name there were always at least three in my classes at school she rose and checked a gauge by the door to the cargo bay he should be just about ready to take care of now pulled to shore so to speak ferrell sniffed and cleared his throat wondering whether to stay or excuse himself grotesque sort of fishing excuse myself i think she picked up the control lead to the float pallet and trailed it after her into the cargo bay there were some thumping noises and she returned the pallet drifting behind her the corpse was in the dark blue of a deck officer and covered thickly with frost which flaked and dripped upon the floor as the medtech slid it onto the examining table ferrell shivered with disgust definitely excuse myself but he lingered leaning against the doorframe at a safe distance she pulled an instrument trailing its lead to the computers from the crowded rack above the table it was the size of a pencil and emitted a thin blue beam of light when aligned with the corpses eyes retinal identification tersa explained she pulled down a padlike object similarly connected and pressed it to each of the monstrositys hands and fingerprints she went on i always do both and crossmatch the eyes can get awfully distorted errors in identification can be brutal for the families hm hm she checked her readout screen lieutenant marco deleo age twentynine well lieutenant she went on chattily lets see what i can do for you she applied an instrument to its joints which loosened them and began removing its clothes do you often talk tothem inquired ferrell unnerved always its a courtesy you see some of the things i have to do for them are rather undignified but they can still be done with courtesy ferrell shook his head i think its obscene myself obscene all this horsing around with dead bodies all the trouble and expense we go to collecting them i mean what do they care fifty or a hundred kilos of rotting meat itd be cleaner to leave them in space she shrugged unoffended undiverted from her task she folded the clothes and inventoried the pockets laying out their contents in a row i rather like going through the pockets she remarked it reminds me of when i was a little girl visiting in someone elses home when i went upstairs by myself to go to the bathroom or whatever it was always a kind of pleasure to peek into the other rooms and see what kind of things they had and how they kept them if they were very neat i was always very impressedive never been able to keep my own things neat if it was a mess i felt id found a secret kindred spirit a persons things can be a kind of exterior morphology of their mindlike a snails shell or something i like to imagine what kind of person they were from whats in the pockets neat or messy very regulation or full of personal things take lieutenant deleo here he must have been very conscientious everything regulation except this little vid disc from home from his wife id imagine i think he must have been a very nice person to know she placed the collection of objects carefully into its labeled bag arent you going to listen to it asked ferrell oh no that would be prying he barked a laugh i fail to see the distinction ah she completed the medical examination readied the plastic body bag and began to wash the corpse when she worked her way down to the careful cleaning around the genital area necessary because of sphincter relaxation ferrell fled at last that woman is nuts i wonder if its the cause of her choice of work or the effect it was another full day before they hooked their next fish ferrell had a dream during his sleep cycle about being on a deepsea boat and hauling up nets full of corpses to be dumped wet and shining as though with iridescent scales in a huge pile in the hold he awoke from it sweating but with very cold feet it was with profound relief that he returned to the pilots station and slid into the skin of his ship the ship was clean mechanical and pure immortal as a god one could forget one had ever owned a sphincter muscle odd trajectory he remarked as the medtech again took her place at the tractor controls yes oh i see hes a barrayaran hes a long way from home oh bleh throw him back oh no we have identification files for all their missing part of the peace settlement you know along with prisoner exchange considering what they did to our people as prisoners i dont think we owe them a thing she shrugged the barrayaran officer had been a tall broadshouldered man a commander by the rank on his collar tabs the medtech treated him with the same care she had expended on lieutenant deleo and more she went to considerable trouble to smooth and straighten him massaging the mottled face back into some semblance of manhood with her fingertips a process ferrell watched with a rising gorge i wish his lips wouldnt curl back quite so much she remarked while at this task gives him what i imagine to be an uncharacteristically snarly look i think he must have been rather handsome one of the objects in his pockets was a little locket it held a tiny glass bubble filled with a clear liquid the inside of its gold cover was densely engraved with the elaborate curlicues of the barrayaran alphabet what is it asked ferrell in curiosity she held it pensively to the light its a sort of charm or memento ive learned a lot about the barrayarans in the last three months turn ten of them upside down and youll find some kind of good luck charm or amulet or medallion or something in the pockets of nine of them the highranking officers are just as bad as the enlisted people silly superstition im not sure if its superstition or just custom we treated an injured prisoner oncehe claimed it was just custom that people give them to the soldiers as presents and nobody really believes in them but when we took his away from him when we were undressing him for surgery he tried to fight us for it it took three of us to hold him down for the anesthetic i thought it a rather remarkable performance for a man whose legs had been blown away he wept of course he was in shock ferrell dangled the locket on the end of its short chain intrigued in spite of himself it hung with a companion piece a curl of hair embedded in a plastic pendant some sort of holy water is it he inquired almost its a very common design its called a mothers tears charm let me see if i can make outhes had it a while it seems from the inscriptioni think that says ensign and the dateit must have been given him on the occasion of his commission its not really his mothers tears is it oh yes thats whats supposed to make it work as a protection doesnt seem to be very effective no well no ferrell snorted his irony i hate those guysbut i do guess i feel sort of sorry for his mother boni retrieved the chain and its pendants holding the curl in plastic to the light and reading its inscription no not at all shes a fortunate woman how so this is her death lock she died three years ago by this is that supposed to be lucky too no not necessarily just a remembrance as far as i know kind of a nice one really the nastiest charm i ever ran across and the most unique was this little leather bag hung around a fellows neck it was filled with dirt and leaves and what i took at first to be some sort of little froglike animal skeleton about ten centimeters long but when i looked at it more closely it turned out to be the skeleton of a human fetus very strange i suppose it was some sort of black magic seemed an odd thing to find on an engineering officer doesnt seem to work for any of them does it she smiled wryly well if there are any that work i wouldnt see them would i she took the processing one step further by cleaning the barrayarans clothes and carefully redressing him before bagging him and returning him to the freeze the barrayarans are all so armymad she explained i always like to put them back in their uniforms they mean so much to them im sure theyre more comfortable with them on ferrell frowned uneasily i still think he ought to be dumped with the rest of the garbage not at all said the medtech think of all the work he represents on somebodys part nine months of pregnancy childbirth two years of diapering and thats just the beginning tens of thousands of meals thousands of bedtime stories years of school dozens of teachers and all that military training too a lot of people went into making him she smoothed a strand of the corpses hair into place that head held the universe once he had a good rank for his age she added rechecking her monitor thirtytwo commander aristede vorkalloner it has a kind of nice ethnic ring very barrayaranish that name vor too one of those warriorclass fellows homicidalclass loonies or worse ferrell said automatically but his vehemence had lost momentum somehow boni shrugged well hes joined the great democracy now and he had nice pockets three full days went by with no further alarms but a rare scattering of mechanical debris ferrell began to hope the barrayaran was the last pickup they would have to make they were nearing the end of their search pattern besides he thought resentfully this duty was sabotaging the efficiency of his sleep cycle but the medtech made a request if you dont mind falco she said id greatly appreciate it if we could run the pattern out just a few extra turns the original orders are based on this average estimated trajectory speed you see and if someone just happened to get a bit of extra kick when the ship split they could well be beyond it by now ferrell was less than thrilled but the prospect of an extra day of piloting had its attractions and he gave a grudging consent her reasoning proved itself before the day was half done they turned up another gruesome relic oh muttered ferrell when they got a close look it had been a female officer boni reeled her in with enormous tenderness he didnt really want to go watch this time but the medtech seemed to have come to expect him idont really want to look at a woman blown up he tried to excuse himself mm said tersa is it fair though to reject a person just because theyre dead you wouldnt have minded her body a bit when she was alive he vented a little macabre laugh equal rights for the dead her smile twisted why not some of my best friends are corpses he snorted she grew more serious id sort of like the company on this one so he took up his usual station by the door the medtech laid out the thing that had been a woman upon her table undressed inventoried washed and straightened it when she finished she kissed the dead lips oh god cried ferrell shocked and nauseated you are crazy youre a damn damn necrophiliac a lesbian necrophiliac at that he turned to go is that what it looks like to you her voice was soft and still unoffended it stopped him and he looked over his shoulder she was looking at him as gently as if he had been one of her precious corpses what a strange world you must live in inside your head she opened a suitcase and shook out a dress fine underwear and a pair of white embroidered slippers a wedding dress ferrell realized this woman was a bona fide psychopath she dressed the corpse and arranged its soft dark hair with great delicacy before bagging it i believe i shall place her next to that nice tall barrayaran she said i think they would have liked each other very well if they could have met in another place and time and lieutenant deleo was married after all she completed the label ferrells battered mind was sending him little subliminal messages he struggled to overcome his shock and bemusement and pay attention it tumbled into the open day of his consciousness with a start she had not run an identification check on this one out the door he told himself is the way you want to walk i guarantee it instead timorously he went over to the corpse and checked its label ensign sylva boni it said age twenty his own age he was trembling as if with cold it was cold in that room tersa boni finished packing up the suitcase and turned back with the float pallet daughter he asked it was all he could ask she pursed her lips and nodded itsa helluva coincidence no coincidence at all i asked for this sector oh he swallowed turned away turned back face flaming im sorry i said she smiled her slow sad smile never mind they found yet one more bit of mechanical debris so agreed to run another cycle of the search spiral to be sure that all possible trajectories had been outdistanced and yes they found another a nasty one spinning fiercely guts split open from some great blow and hanging out in a frozen cascade the acolyte of death did her dirty work without once so much as wrinkling her nose when it came to the washing the least technical of the tasks ferrell said suddenly may i help certainly said the medtech moving aside an honor is not diminished for being shared and so he did as shy as an apprentice saint washing his first leper dont be afraid she said the dead cannot hurt you they give you no pain except that of seeing your own death in their faces and one can face that i find yes he thought the good face pain but the greatthey embrace it someone is stealing the great throne rooms of the galaxy harry turtledove harry turtledovewho is often referred to as the master of alternate historyis the hugo awardwinning author of more than eighty novels and a hundred short stories his most recent novels are the man with the iron heart after the downfall and give me back my legions in addition to his sf fantasy and alternate history works hes also published several straight historical novels under the name h n turteltaub turtledove obtained a phd in byzantine history from ucla in given the seriousness of much of turtledoves work it might surprise people what a great sense of humor he has in his career hes written several humorous works such as this one which explores the adventures of a space cadet who happens to be a hamster and the galaxys last best hope warning it contains fowl language er actually it contains rodent language what i mean to say is its full of puns but its funny anyway i promise if you disagree i give you permission to call it grimpting when thieves paralyzed the peoplewell the saurian humanoidsinside the palace on the main continent of gould iv and made off with the famous throne room and the somewhat less famous antechamber it made a tremendous stir all over the continent when pirates paralyzed the peoplewell the ammoniaice blobsinside the palace on the chief glacier of amana xi and made off with the magnificent throne room and the somewhat less magnificent antechamber it raised a tremendous stink all over the planet when robbers paralyzed the peoplewell the highly evolved and sagacious kumquatsinside the palace on the grandest orchard of alpharalpha b and made off with the precociously planted throne room and the somewhat less precocious antechamber it caused a sour taste in mouths all over the sector and when brigands paralyzed the peoplewell the frenchinside the palace of versailles in a thirdrate country on a secondrate continent with a splendid future behind it and made off with the baroque throne room and the somewhat less baroque antechamber it caused shock waves all over the galaxy as earth has always been it remains the sleazymedia center of the galactic empire anything that happens there gets more attention than it deserves just because it happens there and so there was an enormous hue and cry something must be done who got to do it why the space patrol of course specifically space cadet rufus q shupilluliumash a bon of bons a noble of nobles a fat overgrown hamster with delusions of gender and when cadet rufus q shupilluliumash last name best sung to the tune of fascinatin rhythm got the call he was as fate and the omniscient narrator would have it massively hung over from a surfeit of fermented starflower seeds the hero who gave him the call space patrol captain erasmus z utnapishtim last name best sung to the tune of on wisconsin was a member of the same species and so understood his debility this is not to say the illustrious space patrol captainanother fat overgrown hamstersympathized oh no youre a disgrace to your whiskers shupilluliumash he cheebled furiously sorry sir rufus q shupilluliumash answered at that particular moment he rather hoped his whiskers and the rest of his pelt would fall out captain utnapishtim knew there was only one way to get to the bottom of things the right way the proper way the regulation way the space patrol way go find out who is stealing the great throne rooms of the galaxy he ordered find out why arrest the worthless miscreants and make the mischief stop right sir cadet shupilluliumash said miserably wishing utnapishtim were dead or he himself were dead or the omniscient narrator were dead no such luck shup babyany way at all to escape from this silly story and the pain in his pelt where do i start sir start on earth captain utnapishtim told him earth is the least consequential planet in the galaxy and all the inhabitants talk too bloody much if you cant find a clue there youre not worth your own tail like you sir i am a fat overgrown hamster the space cadet replied with dignity i have no tail well if i remember my briefings neither do earthmen the space patrol officer said now get your wheel rolling yes sir shupilluliumash said resignedly and headed off to check out a patrol speedster the ps habitrail now you should know that there are many kinds of space drives to span the parsecs of the galaxy you should yes but since you dontyou cant fool the omniscient narrator otherwise he wouldnt be omniscientyou have to sit through this expository lump there is the hyperspace drive traditional but effective there is the hopskipandajump drive wearing but quick there is the overdrive there is the underdrive there is the orthodontic drive which corrects both overdrive and underdrive but is hellishly expensive there are any number of othersoh not any number but say fortytwo and particularly for fat overgrown hamsters there is the wheel drive the wheel drive translates rotary motion into straightahead ftl by a clever mechanism with whose workings the omniscient narrator wont bore you the on knows you have a low boredom threshold and you wont sit still for two expository lumps in a row suffice to say that space cadet shupilluliumash jumped in his wheel ran like hell and almost before hed sweated out the last of his hangover he found himself landing outside of parissort of like lindbergh long before but much fuzzier he got full cooperation from the french authorities once local galactic officials secured his release from jail he went to versailles to view the scene of the crime this is a very ugly building he said with the diplomacy for which his race was so often praised after local galactic officials secured his release from jail againit took longer this timethey told him the french tend to be emotional so do i rufus q shupilluliumash said especially about the food in thereits terrible and such small portions the galactic officials chorused how did you know shup asked in genuine surprise or do they bust everybody never mind the officials said not quite in harmony go back to versailles observe take notes for gods sake dont talk oh all right the hamster space cadet grumbled go back he did observe he did take notes he did talk he didnt for gods sake except for two missing rooms and an enormous rd spraypainted on the side of the palace nothing seemed out of the ordinary frustrated rufus q shupilluliumash hopped into his wheel and departed for alpharalpha b home of the sagacious kumquats so what kind of jam are you in he asked them after local galactic officials secured his release from the thornbush he proceeded with his investigation you see what they have done a sagacious kumquat cried showing him the ruins of the royal palace looks like the throne room and the antechamber are gone all right shup agreed sagaciously what are those big squiggles on the wall there they stand for the characters you would call rd the kumquat replied they do do they looks like it might be a clue rufus q shupilluliumashs sagacity score went right off the charts with that observationin which direction it is better to specu late than never the space patrol didnt raise any dummies but sometimes it found one and took him in and made him its own what will you do you must get the sacred structures back the kumquat keened how will our sovereign root in peace without them somebody did something pretty seedy to you all right the space cadet said after local galactic officials secured his release from the thornbush againit took longer this timethey told him perhaps it would be better if you pursued your investigations somewhere else otherwise the kumquats warn they will soon be pursuing you some peoplewell highly evolved and sagacious kumquatsare just naturally sour rufus q shupilluliumash complained neverthenonetheless and entirely undisirregardless of the slavering mob of fruit salad at his furry heels he made it into the patrol speedster and got the hatch shut just in the proverbial nicholas of time even with the wheel drive its a long long way from alpharalpha b to amana xi our intrepid space cadet put the time to good use but after a while even porn began to pall and he decided to do some research instead he googled rd how he could get online while far beyond the normal limits of space and time may well be known to the omniscient narrator i mean after all what isnt but he aint talking what the space cadet found youll see eventually keep your shirt on before climbing out of the airlock on amana xi rufus q climbed into his coldsuit otherwise all he would have needed was a stick shoved up the wazoo to become the galaxys first hamstersicle but he would have been too damn frozen to shove a stick where it needed to go so its just as well he remembered the suit tell me he said to one of the ammoniaice blobs awaiting his arrival at the spaceport are your females frigid once local galactic officials had secured his release from the hotbox the space cadet was rather vexed at them the ammoniaice blobs of amana xi tormented convicts by subjecting them to heat well above the freezing point of water and were also inblobane enough to make them endure an oxygenenhanced atmosphere some of the munchies were stale but it was the best digs ol rufus q couldve found on the whole planet he got back into his coldsuit for a whirlwind tour of the devastated palace once the whirlwind subsided he saw on the icy wall now exposed to the elementsand compoundssome writing in an alien script he couldnt begin to read whats that say he asked in your symbology it would stand for rd the nearest ammoniaice blob answered probably doesnt mean research and development then rufus q shupilluliumash sighed thatll teach me to hit the i feel lucky button even if i did what are you going to do the blob demanded do you not see the magnificence despoiled reminds me more of the inside of a root freezer without the goddamn roots the forthright space cadet replied he was by then quite looking forward to seeing the inside of the hotbox once more the ammoniaice blobs appeared overjoyed to oblige him too his only real complaint was that the seeds they fed him still werent of the freshest he stuffed his cheek pouches full even so once local galactic officials had secured his release from the hotbox again they gently suggested his investigation might proceed more promisingly elsewhere he was inclined to agree with them hed discovered that spitting seed casings inside a coldsuit was an exercise in sloppy futility thus it was that cadet rufus q shupilluliumash reboarded the redoubtable habitrail spun the wheel up to translight speed and sped off to gould iv and its saurian humanoids past walking on their hind legs they didnt particularly remind him of frenchmen of course they were even less hamsteroid which might have colored his opinion as far as he was concerned anything with a long scaly tail at one end and a big mouth full of sharp teeth at the other was not to be trusted one of the saurians at the spaceport eyed him and remarked you look like youd go down well with drawn butter shup drew not butter but his trusty blaster you look like youd look good on my wall he replied cheerfully in this galaxy nothing is certain but death and taxidermy he belonged to the patrol he had the right to carry any weapon he chose if he killed he was assumed to know what he was doing the galaxy as you will have figured out was in deep kimchi but this isnt that kind of story this is the kind of story where the saurians would have jugged him not for toting lethal hardware but as punpunishment and since it is that kind of story you may rest assured they did once local galactic officials had pulled the cork from the jug a somewhat chaster he was alone after all and not even bullhamster horniness could make the saurians sexy but unchastened rufus q shupilluliumash emerged he didnt even have to draw his blaster againwhich was just as well since he was no artistto get the saurians to take him to their royal palace so he could view the missing throne room and antechamber or rather view that they were missinghe couldnt very well view them while they were missing could he and what he was coming to think of as the inevitable graffiti there seemed to be rather more of them this time what do they say he inquired of his guide a stalwart shamrockgreen gouldian named albert osaurus albert seemed to have inherited a full set of teeth from each parent and a set from each grandparent too maybe for luck royal drive he answered next stopgalactic central sinister organ chords rang out in the background or at least in the space cadets perfervid imagination a clue quoth he faith what a brilliant deduction albert osaurus saidthe gouldians didnt find sarcasm illegal immoral or fattening and how did you come up with it now rufus q shupilluliumash eyed the saurian well its not exactly a cloacaanddagger operation he replied once local galactic officials had pulled the cork from the jug againit took longer this time as second offenses and offensive offenses were commonly punpunished by devourmentthey encouraged him to spread his talents widely across the sea of stars if you stay here any longer one of them said the gouldians will eat you with mustard the hamster space cadet made a horrible incisorfilled face cant stand mustard he said tata im off me and the baked beans where will you go the official inquired galactic central i do believe rufus q shupilluliumash answered ah galactic central i could go on for pages or even reamsthe disadvantage of being an omniscient narrator but this isnt that kind of story either and i will pause while you thank your local deity or demon that it isnt there are you finished now good we can go on what you do need to know about the fabulous galactic central and what you will most likely probability hows that for omniscient have figured out for yourself is that it boasts the grandest and spiffiest palace in all the galaxy that being where the galactic emperor and empress hang out said palace boasts the most garish and overthetopexcuse me most colorful and extravagantthrone room in all the galaxy and also the most likewise and likewiseexcuse me most likewise and likewiseantechamber in all the et cetera i bet the bad guys are going to try and steal them for the royal drive shup said as he powered up the habitrails wheel then he said what the hell is the royal drive except for the graffiti on gould iv hed never heard of it google had never heard of it either rufus q shupilluliumash wondered whether he was accessing the chinese system but no it wascue the portentous music againsomething new though his electronic aids failed him the dedicated space cadet persevered he had one major advantage over the others whom erasmus z utnapishtim remember him might have chosen to save the galaxy or at least its throne rooms and antechambers not only was he a hamster he was a punster as well as he had proved to the dismay and discomfiture of ammoniaice blobs and shamrockgreen saurian humanoids alike and as he neared galactic central he suddenly slowed on the wheel in astonishmentand almost pitched the ps habitrail back into normal space in an abnormal place that wouldnt have been goodso he didnt actually do it what he did do was cry out eureka why the name of a not very large city in northern california should have become the cry for discovering something rufus q shupilluliumash did not know but it had the patrol could be a traditionboundeven a traditiongaggedoutfit sometimes he spun the wheel up to an almost blistering pace then when his feet and little front paws started to hurt he slowed down againbut not so much this time as to endanger his speedster he thought furiously which was odd because he wasnt particularly furious it must work that way he said this story wont run long enough for a lot of wrong guesses if hed guessed wrong there he might have found himself trapped in a novel but the speedster wasnt a fforde so he escaped that fate anyhow he shook his head and snuffled his whiskers at the iniquity of the throneroom and antechamber thieves i must foil them he declared and checked his supplies of aluminum tin and silver he was so transfixed by his fit of analytical brilliance that he almost wheeled right past galactic central and back out into the galactic boonies but he didntthis story wont run long enough for a lot of mistakes either being a space cadet helped him get through the entry formalities in jig timewhich since he didnt dance was more than a little challenging a day and a half later the freedom of galactic central was his as long as the gps and radiological tracking devices surgically implanted near his wazoo gave answers the powers that be approved of otherwise the tiny nuke implanted near that very same sensitive place would sadly spoil our upcoming dénouement to say nothing of half a city block so we wont he hopped on the closest available public transport discovered it was going the wrong way seewe did have room for a mistake after all hopped off and got on this time as luck and the necessities of plotting would have it going toward the sublime or something residence of the beloved or something galactic emperor and empress no sooner had he arrivedtalk about timing i mean reallythan a giant chainsaw suddenly appeared in the sky and started carving away at are you surprised the throne room and the antechamber people screamed people ran people coughed from flying sawdust people of several different flavors got turned into hamburger of several different flavors people inside the palace caught by the paralyzer ray that went with the saw didnt do much of anything guards outside the palace started shooting at the parts of the chainsaw crunching through the walls quickthinking rufus q shupilluliumash fired at the power button instead a dot a centimeter wide three kilometers up in the air being a patroltrained markshamster and luckier than lucky pierre he hit it dead on the very first try the chainsaw stopped chainsawing it fell out of the sky and smashed one of the ritziest neighborhoodsactually several of the ritziest neighborhoods because that was a big mother of a chainsawof galactic central to cottage cheese our bold space cadet cared nothing for that though he was doing his duty and he was damned if hed let common sense stand in his way dashing toward the chainsaws survival capsule how did he know where it was he just knew this is that kind of story he was rufus q shupilluliumash on the spot when a saurian humanoid an ammoniaice blob in a hotsuit a kumquat and a frenchman came staggering out youre under arrest he shouted covering them with his everreliable blaster suspicion of firing a chainsaw without a license and operating an unauthorized space drive within city limits dont nobody move nobody didnt move or something like that what do you know about the royal drive the frenchman sneered how do you know its unauthorized it must be unauthorized because i couldnt google it and i know the royal drive uses the hellacious energy output from mixingour space cadet paused to build the moment for he was indeed punster as well as hamsterchamber and antechamber to propel your spacecraft across the galaxy in pursuance of your nefarious ends but now youre busted space scum the frenchman the kumquat and the saurian humanoid blanched rufus q shupilluliumash presumed the ammoniaice blob did tooit is after all what selfrespecting villains do under such circumstancesbut the hotsuit kept him from being sure palace guards came up behind him what do we do with them sir they asked respectfully take them away the hamster replied grandly they will trouble the spaceways no more your omniscient narrator also has the pleasure to report that shortly thereafter space cadet rufus q shupilluliumash became ensign rufus q shupilluliumash with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto of course he knew that wouldnt happen didnt you our space cadets actions in this case were deemed to be in the highest tradition of the space patrol prisons kevin j anderson and doug beason

teams novel assemblers of infinity was a finalist for the nebula award prisons first published in amazing stories explores the repercussions of a revolt on a prison planet and shows how one persons existence influences the decisions of those in power it examines black market trade brainwashing and how far some will go for revenge i am still called the warden the prisoners consider it an ironic jest barely a meter square the forcewalls form the boundaries of my holographic body once this felt like a throne an isolated position from which i could control the workings of bastille now though i must look out and watch my former prisoners laughing at me this projection has been an image of authority to them since living on this prison world was too great a punishment to inflict upon any real warden or guards my artificial personality was entrusted to watch over this compound i am based on a real persona great man i thinka proud man with many accomplishments but i have failed here amu led the prisoners in their revolt he convinced them that bastille is a selfsufficient planet after all their forced terraforming work for the federation they have survived all federation attempts to reoccupy the world keeping the invaders out with the same systems once intended to keep the prisoners in besides the prisoners i am the only one left once i ran the environmental systems here the production accounting the resources inventory i monitored the automated digging and processing machinery outside i controlled the fleet of tiny piranha interceptors in orbit that would destroy any ship trying to escape but now i am powerless amus lover theowane comes to taunt me every day to gloat over her triumph she paces up and down the corridor outside the forcewalls to me she is flaunting her freedom to go where she wishes i do not think it is unintentional at the time of the revolt theowane used her computer skills to introduce a worm program that rewrote the control links around my personality leaving me isolated and helpless if i attempt to regain control the worm will delete my existence i feel as if i have a knife at my throat and i am too afraid to act at moments such as this i can appreciate the sophistication of my personality which allows me to feel the full range of human emotions it allows me to hate theowane and what she has done to me theowane makes herself smile but the warden refuses to look at her it annoys her when he broods like this i am busy he says leaving him to dwell on his fate theowane crosses to the panorama window huge remotely driven excavators and haulers churn the ground rearing up crunching rock and digesting it for usable minerals at least she thinks bastilles resources are put to our own use not exported for someone else lavender streaks mottle the indigo sky blotting out all but the brightest stars a dimesized glare shows the distant sun too far away to heat the planet to any comfortable temperature but overhead dominating the sky rides the cinnamoncolored moon antoinette so close to bastille and so nearly the same size that it keeps the planet heated by tidal flexing on some of the nearby rocks patches of algae and lichen have taken hold these have been genetically engineered to survive in bastilles environment to begin the longterm conversion of the surface of the atmosphere on a human timescale though they are making little progress farther below theowane sees the oily surface of the deadly sea where clumps of the ubermindist weed drift a few floating harvesters ride the waves but the corrosive water and the sulfuricacid vapor in the air cause too much damage to send them out often that does not matter since they no longer need the drug as a bargaining chip amu has refused to continue exporting ubermindist extract despite a black market clamoring for it theowane finds it bitterly ironic that she and so many others sentenced here for drug crimes had been forced by the federation to process ubermindist the federation supports its own black market trade keeping the drug illegal and selling it at the same time after taking over the prison planet amu cut off the supply using the piranha interceptors to destroy an outgoing robot ship laden with ubermindist the federation has gone without their precious addictive drug since the prison revolt when the intruder alarms suddenly kick in they take theowane by surprise she whirls and places both hands on her hips her closecropped reddish hair remains perfectly in place what is it she demands of the warden he is required to answer one ship unidentified has just snapped out of hyperspace it is on approach the wardens image straightens as he speaks lifting his head and reciting the words in an inflectionless voice activate the piranha swarm she says the warden turns to her let me contact the ship first we must see who they are no bastille has been quarantined by the rest of the federation any approaching ship can only mean trouble shortly after the prison revolt the praesidentrix had tried to negotiate with bastille then she sent laughable threats by subspace radio demanding that amu surrender under threat of severe punishment the threats grew more strident over the weeks then months finally after the sudden death of her consort in some unrelated accident the praesidentrix became brutal and unforgiving the mans death had apparently shocked her to the core the negotiator turned dictator against the upstart prisoners she sent an armada of warships to retake bastille theowane had been astonished not thinking this hellhole worth such a massed effort amu had turned loose the defenses of the prison planet the piranha swarmso effective at keeping the prisoners trapped insideproved just as efficient at keeping the armada out the piranhas destroyed twelve gunships that attempted to make a landing two others fled to high orbit then out through the hyperspace node but amu is certain that the praesidentrix especially in her grieving unstable state will never give up so easily piranha defenses armed and unleashed the warden says five of the fingerprintsmeared screens beside the wardens projection tank crackle and wink on viewing through the eyes of the closest piranha interceptors theowane sees different views of the approaching ship sleek yet clunkylooking a paradox of smooth angles and bulky protuberances incoming audio the warden says transmission locked video in phase and verified the largest screen swirls belches static then congeals into a garish projection of the ships command chamber the captain falls out of focus sitting too close to the bridge projection cameras in peace for peace we bring our message of happiness and hope to bastille we come to help we come to offer you the answers theowane recognizes the metallic embroidered chasuble on the captains shoulders the pseudorobe uniforms of the other crew visible in the background she snorts at the acronym peacepassive earth assembly for cosmic enlightenment a devout group that combines quantum physics and eastern philosophy into from what theowane has heard an incomprehensible but pleasantsounding mishmash of ideas it has appealed to many dissatisfied scientists ones who gave up trying to understand the universe peace has grown because of their willingness to settle raw worlds places with such great hardship that no one in his right mind would live there voluntarily theowane sees it already upon hearing of the prisoners revolt some peace ship conveniently located on a hyperspace path to bastille has rushed here hoping to convert the prisoners to gain a foothold on the new world and claim it for their own they must hope the praesidentrix will not retaliate allow me to stop the piranhas the warden says this is not an attack summon amu she says but do not call off the defense theowane lowers her voice this could be as great a threat as anything the praesidentrix might send she hunkers close to the screens and watches the lumbering peace ship against a background of stars the deadly pinpoints of piranha interceptors hurtle toward it on a collision course the first secretary enlarges the display on his terminal so he can read it better with his weakened eyesight across from him the praesidentrix sits ramrod straight in her chair she waits a scowl chiselled into her face the praesidentrix looks as if she has aged a decade since the death of her consort but still she insists on keeping her family matters and all details of her personal life private the way her policies have suddenly changed though tells the first secretary just how much she had loved the man the first secretary avoids her cold gaze as he calls up his figures here it is he says i want you to know that your attempts to retake bastille have already cost half of what we have invested in bastille itself on the diagram herehe punches a section on the keypadyoull see that we have thirteen equivalent planets in the initial stages of terraforming most of them under development by the penal service two by private corporations several dozen more have gone beyond that stage and now have their first generation of colonists overhead the praesidentrix chooses the skylight panels to project a sweeping ochrecolored sky from a desert planet the vastness overwhelms the first secretary his skin is pale and soft from living under domes and inside prefabricated buildings all his life he doesnt like outside he prefers the cozy sheltered environment of the catacombs and offices he is a born bureaucrat so the praesidentrix asks the first secretary flinches so is it worth continuing especially he thinks with more important things to worry about such as raising the welfare dole or gearing up for the next election six years from now yes its worth continuing she says without hesitating then changes the subject her dark eyes stare up at the artificial desert sky have you learned how one prisoner managed to take over the warden system he has a very shrewd simulated personalityhow did they bypass him i thought computer criminals were never assigned to selfsufficient penal colonies for just that reason the first secretary shrugs thinks about going through an entire chain of who was to blame for what but then decides that this is not what the praesidentrix wants thats the problem with computer criminals theowane was caught and convicted on charges of drug smuggling although all of her prior criminal activity seems to have involved computer espionage and embezzlement why was this not noticed arent the records clear no the first secretary says raising his voice a bit she altered them all we didnt know her background nobody checked nobody could the first secretary draws a deep breath to calm himself but i think you are following a false trail madame theowane only implemented the takeover on bastille amu is the mind behind all this hes the one who convinced the prisoners to revolt hes the one who refuses to negotiate she turns making sure she holds his gaze i have already set a plan in motion that will take care of him once and for all and it will get bastille back for us the praesidentrix leans back in her purple chair as it tries to conform to her body her graythreaded hair spreads out behind her she was a beautiful woman once the first secretary thinks the rumors have not died about her dead consort the first secretary makes a petulant scowl its obvious you dont trust me with your plans madame but will you at least explain to me why you are doing this it goes beyond reason and financial responsibility he purses his lips is it because the prisoners are in the ubermindist loop i find that hard to believe its just another illegal drug cutting off the supply will upset a few addicts more than that and cause some unrest he continues as well as some reshuffling on the black market but theyll adjust within a few years well have an equivalent drug from some other place perhaps even a synthetic why is bastille so important to you the coldness in her gaze is worse than anything he could have imagined from her two months before the ubermindist is only one reason the praesidentrix says the other is revenge i feel as if i am watching my own hand plunge a sword into the chest of a helpless victim the piranha interceptors are part of me controlled by my external systemsbut i cannot stop them now theowane has given the order i watch through the eyes of five interceptors as they home in for the kill using their propellant to increase velocity toward impact with their kinetic energy they will destroy the vessel i receive alarm signals from the peace ship but i ignore them am forced to watch the target grow and grow as the first interceptor collides with a section amidships i see the hull plate pitted with micrometeor scars swell up huge and then wink out a fraction of a second before the interceptor crashes rupturing the hull and exposing the inner environment to space another interceptor smashes just below the bridge i hear a transmitted outcry from the captain begging us to stop the attack two more interceptors strike one a glancing blow alongside the hull the shrapnel tears open a wider gash the peace ship continues its own destruction as air pressure bursts through the breaches in the hull as moisture freezes and glass shatters the fifth interceptor strikes the chemical fuel tanks and the entire ship erupts in a tiny nova from the debris a small target streaks away i recognize it as a single escape pod i detect one life form aboard of all the people on the ship only one the escape pod descends but then my own reflexes betray me as another interceptor also detects the pod aligns its tracking and streaks after it both enter the atmosphere of bastille now amu arrives in the control center i can tell he is upset by his expression by his elevated body temperature his head is shaved smooth but his generous silvery beard and eyebrows and eyes give him a charismatic appearance he is raising his voice to theowane but i cannot pay attention to their conversation the peace escape pod heats up leaving an orange trail behind it as it burrows deeper into the atmosphere it seems to have evasive capabilities and it knows the piranha is behind it the interceptor also picks up speed bearing down on the escape pod but their velocities are so well matched that the piranha causes no damage when it bumps its target a few moments later the interceptorwith no shielding to protect it from a screaming entry into the atmospherebreaks into flying chunks of molten slag amu seems mollified when theowane explains to him that the intruder was a peace ship i know amu wants nothing to do with religious fanatics he has had enough of them in his past i pinpoint the splashdown target for the escape pod without waiting for an order i dispatch one of the floating ubermindist harvesters across the oceans of bastille no matter how great a hold theowane has over my simulated personality she can do nothing against my lifepreservation overrides except when the security of the colony is at stake ostensibly to allow it greater speed but actually just out of spite i tell the harvester to dump its cargo of ubermindist before it churns off across the sea to reach the pod amu stands in the holding bay of the cliffside tunnels his bald head glistens in the glare of glowtablets recessed in the ceiling his eyes flash a second rinse sprays the outside of the escape pod black streaks stain the hull from its burning descent but the craft appears otherwise undamaged after its dunking in the corrosive seas amu waits for purified water to purge the acidity theowane follows him into the chamber amu listens to the last trickles of water come out of the spray heads drips run through a grate on the floor where the rinse water will be detoxified and reused for the hours it has taken the floating harvester to retrieve the escape pod amu has waited in silence with theowane he keeps his anger toward her in check sensing his displeasure she twice tries to divert his thoughts normally he would acquiesce just to please her she has been his lover since before the revolt but he doesnt like her making such important decisions on her own it sets a bad example for the rest of the prisoners on the other hand amu knows that theowane tried to keep bastille free of the peace ships and he approves both of amus parents had been involved in a violent fanatical sect and had raised him under their repressive teachings grooming him to be a propagator of the faith he had absorbed their training but eventually his own wishes had broken through he fled later to use those same charismatic and mobfocusing skills to whip up a workers revolt on his home planet if the revolt had succeeded amu would have been called a king a savior but instead amu had ended up here on bastille he wants nothing more to do with religious fanatics now this one peace survivor presents him with an unpleasant problem theowane runs her fingers over the access controls ready she says she keeps her voice low and her eyes averted amu stands to his full height in front of the escape pod open it as the hatch cracks a hiss of air floods in equalizing the two pressures then comes a cough then sputtering annoying words a young boy wrestles himself into a sitting position and snaps his arms out flexing them and shaking his cramped hands what took you so long youre as bad as peace theowane steps back amu blinks but remains in place the boy is thin with dark shadows around his eyes his body appears bruised his hands raw as if he has been trying to claw his way out of the escape pod amu cant stop himself from bursting out with a loud laugh the boy whirls to him outraged but after a brief pause he too cracks a grin that contains immense relief and exhaustion with this one response he proves to amu that he is no peace convert why didnt you let yourself out theowane asks isnt there an emergency release inside the boy turns a look of scorn to her i know whats in the air on bastille and in the water i couldnt see where i was it might be bad to be cramped in this coffin for hoursbut it would be plenty worse to take a shower in sulfuric acid he pauses for just a moment and speaking of showers can i get out of here and take one after the boy has cleaned and rested himself amu summons him for dinner the other prisoners on bastille have expressed their curiosity but they will have to wait until amu decides to make a statement dybathia the boy says when amu asks his name i know it sounds noble and highborn my parents had high expectations of me he stops just long enough for amu to absorb that but not long enough for him to ask any further questions i ran away from home dybathia says it took me a week to make it to the spaceport when i got there i slipped onto the first open ship and hid in their cargo bay i didnt care where it was going and i didnt plan to show myself until we were on our way into hyperspace i figured anyplace was better than home right he snickers it turned out to be a peace ship they wouldnt let me off they kept me around constantly quoting tracts at me trying to make me convert do my eyes look glazed am i braindamaged amu allows a smile to form but he does not answer dybathia says they shut off their servomaintenance drones and made me do the cleaning scrubbing down decks and walls with a solvent that should have been labeled as toxic waste look at my hands the captain said monotonous work allows one to clear the mind and become at peace with the universe theowane breaks into the conversation why were you the only one who got to an escape pod amu looks up at her sharply but she doesnt withdraw the question dybathia shrugs i was the only one who bothered the rest of them just sat there and accepted their fate this rings so true with amu from his memories of his parents that he finds himself nodding dybathia looks at the mindscanning apparatus this will be the most dangerous moment for him the device is left over from the first days of bastille when human supervisory crews had established the colony that month had been the only time when nonprisoners and prisoners cohabited the planet as a precaution they had used intensive search devices and mental scanners which had remained unused since those other humans had turned bastille over to the warden you do understand why we have to do this amu asks dybathia sees more concern on the face of the leader than he expects this is going better than he had hoped yes i understand perfectly he flicks his gaze toward theowane then back to amu its because shes paranoid theowane bristles as he expects her to she makes each word of her answer clipped and hard your story is too convenient how do we know youre not an assassin what if youve been drugged or hypnotized we cant know what the praesidentrix might do knowing it is imperative for him to allay their suspicions dybathia submits to an intensive physical search that scans every square centimeter of his body probes all orifices uses a sonogram to detect any subcutaneous needles poisongas capsules perhaps a timedrelease biological plague they find nothing because there is nothing to find the psyche assessor wont hurt you amu says just stick your head within its receiving range how does it work dybathia asks he frowns skeptically how do i know this isnt one of those machines to condition prisoners i dont want to end up like a peace convert explain it to him theowane amu smiles at her as if he knows how it will rankle her theowane blows air from her lips everyone has a basic mental pattern like a normal position that can never change however certain trainingbrainwashing youd call itcan superimpose another set of reactions on top of it if youve been brainwashed or specially trained to do anything to amu or bastille it will show up here she adjusts her apparatus dybathia rolls his eyes amu smiles at that dybathia knows he is easing past the leaders defenses lets just get this over with without a word the boy leans into the psyche assessors range theowane makes no other comment as she works with the apparatus and takes her reading she asks him a series of questions designed to break down mindblanking techniques dybathia answers them all without resisting finally theowane shrugs its clear she says no ones been messing with his mind he has no special training he hasnt been brainwashed i could have saved you trouble if you had just listened to me in the first place amu claps a hand on the boys shoulder ill let you know when ive thought of a suitable way for theowane to apologize when the survivor of the peace ship comes through with theowane and amu i receive the unmistakable impression of tourist and tourguides no that is not quite correct more like a visiting dignitary being shown points of interest inside the forcewalls i watch them true i have a million different eyes around bastille optics to observe through from monitoring cameras around the corridors to the remote sensors of automatic digging machines but my real eyes are here purposely i think amu ignores me as he brings the boy down the corridor he points to the auxiliary control systems explaining them with deceptive ease making them sound simpler than they are the three keep their backs pointedly turned and walk to the viewing window outside of which the diggers continue their relentless excavations the sky swirls with dark oily colors over the hostile sea its going to be generations before anybody can bask under the bastille sun but at least it is now ours amu says then lowers his voice and we arent going to give it back when this world becomes habitable is it going to be worth the wait the boy asks pushing his face close to the thick glass i flick my concentration to one of the digger machines outside looking through a different set of eyes but the coarse optics and the glass distort the boys face through the window amu shrugs and rubs a hand on his silvery beard theowane spends hours down here staring out the window actually i think she just likes to taunt the warden finally they turn toward me i am too familiar with theowanes closecropped reddish hair and her narrow hard eyes amu carries much more capacity within himan extraordinary person with charisma and intelligence and compassion that allows him to do virtually anything he wants to but he has chosen a path that society deems unacceptable the boy is the last to turn away from the sprawling view he looks at me directly i see him i know him he has counted on me recognizing him instantly i flash through a handful of buried newsclips quick photographs shaded by the promise of anonymity but it is enough it augments my suspicions i can remember few details of the person on whom i myself have been based but some things are impossible to erase i remember i wonder what he is up to why is he here and what am i supposed to do about it the three visitors say no word to me as they continue their tour i am left with the absolute conviction that the fate of bastille and perhaps the praesidentrixs federation depends upon me recognizing this boy understanding what he wants and acting accordingly i can no longer avoid the risk to myself i must save my son amu sits across from dybathia for another meal the boy fascinates him he reminds amu of himself as a young boy or what amu wanted to bescrappy irreverent and intelligent amu serves the two plates himself prisoners in the kitchen have prepared a tough pancakelike dish from cultured algae and protein synthesizers they are trying to develop a pseudosteak but they are several years from perfecting it no matter amu is used to it and it is after all nutritious what more can they ask for with their limited supplies its tough you might need to use your knife to cut it he says dybathia frowns at the crude knife in his hand but amu continues it is easy to get mush from the hydroponics tunnels but we keep striving for something with a firm texture its only been in the last month or two that weve been able to have something tough enough to cut dybathia works at the food on his plate i was looking at the knife the blunt instrument is barely serviceable amu smiles it is the winning smile he uses when making converts to his various causes a holdover from prison life that was long ago dybathia says yes and things have changed now dybathia lifts an eyebrow were here alone with no nonprisoners for us to worry about knives are no longer any threat and the warden is nicely contained but we like to remember what we are and where we are we manufacture these knives and they serve the purpose amu lowers his voice maybe if the meat gets a little more meatlike well need better ones amu looks across the table at dybathia the boy seems fascinated with everything about bastille and amu waits for him to ask the obvious question but over several days it has not been forthcoming finally amu breaks down and answers it anyway i grew up on new kansas and left my parents and their religious sect he burns inside thinking of the peace converts dybathia smiles amu dims the lights bathing the room in a softer glow it is storytime new kansas was a young planet the soil somewhat unstable we had planted grassland across entire continents wheat alfalfa and prairie grass with some used as rangeland for imported animals but threequarters of what we grew the landholders exported offplanet they were a handful of people who had financed the first colony ships and therefore claimed to own all of new kansas we were forbidden to leave our holdings but i had learned how to whip my followers into a frenzy of religious devotion we fought for our freedom the colonists had come to new kansas to start a fresh life they felt that the federation owed them at least a chance at autonomy i knew how to galvanize them they burned their fields the fires swept across the plains for dozens of kilometers pouring smoke into the sky that you could see from landholding to landholding the others rose up amu speaks with a sense of wonder paying little attention to the boy my people were ready to die for me can you imagine that holding people so much in the palm of your hand amu extends his fist across the table opening it so that dybathia can see the callouses from his hard lifethey were ready to die for me and we almost succeeded amu lowers his eyes and pushes his plate away from him almost ive had enough dybathia says he has eaten most of his pseudosteak but amu stares at the wall seeing in his memories the visions of burning grass and the bodies of his followers after the landholders had called in federation reinforcements he doesnt notice as dybathia stands and slips toward the door im going to sleep the boy says ill see you in the morning amu nods and blinks his eyes but they are filled with water and sting as if from smoke theowane enters the control center alone she moves with precise steps as if stalking she wants to know what is going on she will catch the warden she will get the information together and then she will take it to amu the holographic warden looks at her from his glasswalled cage his expression remains dubious fearful with a layer of contempt theowane says nothing as she casually walks over to the panorama window she gazes across the blasted ground though the diggers continue to reform the landscape she never sees any actual improvement theowane stares for a few moments longer then turns to meet the wardens eyes you pride yourself so much in having human emotions and human reactions warden but youre naive you dont know how to hide things from other people i can read your reactions as clearly as if they were spelled out on a screen the warden blinks at her i do not understand i caught you yesterday he extends his hands forward until the image fuzzes near the edge of the forcewalls what do you mean the boy theowane says you recognized him it was painfully obvious you know who he is you know why hes here and it isnt because of that crazy story he told us explain it to me now the warden hesitates a moment then hardens his face into a stoic mask i dont know what you are talking about theowane raises her eyebrows she reaches out and caresses the control panel i can turn the worm loose and delete you that doesnt seem to frighten the warden she has used the same threat too many times before then you will lose whatever information you imagine i have perhaps i can find some way to make you feel pain she says the warden shrugs i am not afraid anymore in all her taunting theowane has taught the warden as much about herself as she has learned from him he knows exactly how to infuriate her ill inform amu she says trying to regain her composure that will stifle whatever plans you are hatching theowane straightens away from the window and sees the warden turn his head flicking his glance to look outside sensing something hearing a muffled sound too close she whirls around the giant automatic digger rears up and plunges through the glass with its great scooping and digging gears churning it claws out the pouredstone and insulation ripping girders and breaching the wall theowane stumbles back sucking in a breath to scream as the deadly aciddrenched air of bastille rushes inside youre quiet today amu says as he leads the boy down into one of the lower levels smells of oil dirt and stale air fill the tunnels introspective dybathia corrects he thinks that word will better disarm amu he has not thought his silence and uneasiness would be so noticeable but then he remembers that amu is a master at studying other people ah introspective is it amus lips curl in amusement i have been through a lot in the last few days amu accepts this and continues leading him down to where the corridors widen into larger chambers hewn from the rock amu spends hours showing him distillation ponds that remove the alkaloid poisons from the seawater like a proud father amu demonstrates the rows of plants growing under garish artificial sunlight piped in and intensified through opticalfiber arrays stretching through the rock to surface collectors other prisoners work at their tasks and seem to move more quickly when amu watches them dybathia wonders how they can consider this to be so different from working under another kind of master amu continues to talk about his grand vision how they have made their colony selfsufficient it has been difficult at first without supply ships from the federation but they have overcome those obstacles and now have everything they did beforeexcept their prison then amu speaks in a dreamier voice explaining about the terraforming activities how he has switched the diggers to mining materials useful for their own survival rather than supplying ubermindist offplanet the floater harvesters are spreading algae and earth plankton that have been tailored to bastilles environment they are resculpting the atmosphere of the planet making it a place where humans will one day be able to walk outside and in peace amus longterm goals and his naive sense of wonder disgust dybathia but he keeps his feelings hidden the boy will know when the time has come amu says something he thinks is funny dybathia isnt paying attention but automatically snorts in response amu nods approvingly when alarm klaxons belch out and echo in the tunnel the noise startles dybathia even though he has been expecting it my lifepreservation overrides force me to close the airlock on the other end of the corridor to keep bastille air from penetrating farther into the complex i do not resist the impulse i know it will trap theowane inside she sprawls on the floor trying to crawl forward the floor is smooth and slippery and she cannot get enough purchase to move herself her eyes are wide with horror her lips turn brown then purplish as she gasps and the sulfuric acid eats out her lungs i force myself to watch for all the times she has watched me the digging machine sensing that it has been led astray stops clawing and churning then uses its scanners to reorient itself the big vehicle clanks and drops clods of dirt and shattered rock as it backs outside theowane croaks words openopen door sorry theowane that would endanger the colony before i was afraid of the worm which forbade me to do anything against theowane and the other prisoners but the worm though deadly is not intuitive and is unable to extrapolate the consequences of my actions i will take the risk for my son i can do much damage while doing nothing overt i have used an old sensorloop taken from the archives of the digging machines daily logs broadcasting this sensorloop along with an override signal to one nearby digger i made the machine think it saw a different landscape where the route of choice led it directly through the viewing window the chamber has filled with bastilles air and i begin to see static discharges as the corrosive atmosphere eats into the microchips the layers that form the computers brain my simulated personalityand the worm but the auxiliary computer core lies deep and unreachable below the lower levels bastilles acid atmosphere will destroy the main system here where the worm has been added but within a fraction of a second my own backup in the auxiliary computer will kick in i should lose consciousness for only an instant before i am recreated my only wonder is whether the other me will be me after all or only a simulated personality that thinks it is theowane lies dead but twitching on the floor sprawled out in front of me blotches cover her skin it is difficult for me to see anything now with the images growing distorted and fuzzy breaking up i feel no pain only a sense of displacement in the last moment even the forcewalls seem to be gone i have conquered the worm dybathia watches amu closely as the alarms sound the leader stiffens and looks around the other prisoners run to stations amu claps his hands and bellows orders at them his face looks concerned he doesnt understand what is happening dybathia gives him no time to understand amu bends down to him weve got to get you to a safe place i dont know whats going on in that moment dybathia brings up the prison knife taken from amus table pushing all the wiry strength of his body behind it he drives the dull point under amus chin tilting it sideways and slashes across his throat he has only one chance he has no special training only his heritage blood sprays out amu grunts falling to his knees and backward scarlet spatters the silver of his beard and the whites of his eyes grow red from burst capillaries he reaches out with a hand but dybathia dances back holding the dripping knife in his hand amus expression is complete shock shadowed with pain and confusion he tries to talk but only gurgles come out dybathia kneels and hisses how is that what youre trying to say how are you amazed because your psyche assessor detected no brainwashing you forgot to consider that maybe i wasnt brainwashed that maybe i wanted to do this because i hate you so much i am free to act i have no special training the light fades behind amus eyes but the confusion seems as great dybathia continues my father was a great man an important mana fleet commander he became an ubermindist addict and that was a great secret does that mean i am not supposed to love him that i wasnt supposed to try to help him do you know what happens when an ubermindist addict is cut off from his supply dybathia kneels beside the dying man to make sure his words come clear the withdrawal fried my fathers nerves he lost all muscle control he went into a constant seizure for eight dayshis mind took that long to burn out he went blind from the hemorrhages his body was snapped and broken by his own convulsions you caused that amu you did that to him and now i did this to you my choice my revenge but amu is already dead dybathia does not know how much he understood at the last the only sound dybathia hears is his own breathing a monotonous wheeze that fills his ears the boy stands without moving as several other prisoners shout and come running toward him inside her office the praesidentrix has chosen a honeycolored sky with a brilliant white sun overhead she finds it soothing for the first time in ages she feels like smiling the first secretary stands at the doorway interrupting her reverie you asked to see me madame she turns to him for a moment he wears a fearful expression as if he thinks she has caught him at something she nods to make him feel at ease ive just received word from the warden on bastille we have two gunships in orbit and all prisoners are now subdued amu and theowane are both dead the first secretary takes a step backward in astonishment he looks for someplace to sit down but the praesidentrix has no other chairs in her office but how he raises his voice how i placed an operative on bastille a young man an operative but i thought amu had equipment to detect any training alterations the praesidentrix pulls her lips tight the young mans father died from ubermindist withdrawal after the prison takeover i believed he had sufficient motivation to kill amu he was free to act the first secretary sputters and keeps looking for a place to sit but how did you know what did you do he acted as a catalyst to spur the warden into taking a more drastic action than he was likely to take on his own with nothing else at stake remember we built the wardens artificial personality i knew exactly how he would react to certain pressures she waves a hand anxious to get rid of the first secretary so she can use the subspace radio again i just thought youd like to know youre dismissed he stumbles backward unable to find words he stops and turns back to the praesidentrix but she closes the door on him the subspace projection chimes announcing an incoming transmission she sighs with a pride and contentedness she has not felt in quite some time he has called her even before she could contact him the wardens image appears in front of her like a painful memory it is as she remembers her consort when he was a dashing and brave commander streaking through hyperspace nodes and knitting the federation together with his strength the warden is only a simulation though intangible and far away but that would not be much different from their original romance with her consort flitting off through the galaxy for threequarters of the year while she held the reins of government at home she had rarely held him anyway but they had spoken often through the private subspace link they greet each other in the same breath and then the widowed praesidentrix begins catching up on all the things she has wanted to say to him repeating all the things she did tell him while he writhed in delirium from his withdrawal while she had concocted a false story about his fatal accident in order to avert a scandal but first she must say how proud she is of their son different day k tempest bradford k tempest bradfords fiction has appeared in or is forthcoming from electric velocipede podcastle and strange horizons in addition to writing shes worked in the editorial trenches of several magazines and is currently the managing editor for fantasy magazine bradford says that shes an unfan of how sf on television and film often depicts each alien race as a monoculture when characters go to alien planets they generally deal with one government one group of people one culture as if that planet is made up of one huge happy group who work together and have no internal differences she said so she started thinking about what it would be like if the aliens that came here had the same problems we havefighting between groups and cultures and such i also thought it would be nice to show that they wouldnt necessarily come to america first she said or if they did it wouldnt be because they think were superior i didnt pay much attention to the aliens at first oh if you mean like that first week then yeah we were scared and hiding and shit like everyone else but once the whole thing calmed down and everything went back to normal i didnt spend that much time thinking about them its all well and good to come down from space and promise you can fix the ozone or whatever but any group of peoplealiens sorrythat come to this planet and start out by talking to our government have to be seriously doubted all the countries on all the continents and they think were the most likely to care about cleaning up the environment ha ha yeah right anyway like i said after that first scare i didnt pay a lot of attention to them not like my daughter with her tshirts and webpages and all that my little corner of the world wasnt going to change dont get me wrong im not a headinthesand kind of guy i read newspapers from all over on my google news i knew about how other countries were mad that thosewhatchacallem byernamyan yeahthem byernamian aliens were making deals with us like america has some kind of power to decide stuff for the whole planet thing is no matter how many threats they make i live in mason fucking ohio nothing ever happens here until its happened somewhere else at least five times aliens or not i still have to be at work on monday and take my son to karate on tuesdays and thursdays it got really messed up when the other aliens came though the other ones you know the ah deb debachhhkwhatever i cant make that soundneither can anyone on cnn my wife and i call them the african aliens because they have that weird head shape i was pulling an allnighter here at the storecorrecting the bedroom set inventory my stupid nephew screwed upwhen i heard nelson mandela on the radio announcing that hed been negotiating with aliens too and that they were from the same planet as the byerwhosits but a different tribe or somethin and you know that it was no mistake that shit was broadcast when it was am here now see that was when i started paying attention cuz those first aliens had promised to do something about global warming but here the african aliens come to tell us that they were lying flat out those byernams dont even have access to the technology and here wed given them what half of the global soy crop already for nothing i tell you though even though they freak me out a little i gotta respect those african aliens they deal with mandela and the dalai lama and only them two they did their homework before showing up here mandela and the lama are the only two guys on the planet i would trust not to screw everybody else over of course my wife is pissed that they dont have a woman in there too knowing her shed probably want it to be oprah hey look all im sayin is that if the african aliens are as powerful as they say they are then i want someone with a little global perspective negotiating with them this new president hes got his head on straight yeah but he has enough to deal with cleaning up after the last administration a messed up economy the constitution used for toilet paper all that crap about tortureyou know almost every other country hated us before president dipshit made that bad deal now they all do maybe mandela and the lama can fix the mess he made without starting another damn war then again if the byernamers hadnt made such a big show of making first contact in the middle of the super bowl halftime show the government probably wouldnt have ever told us about them or the soy deal wed be just as clueless as the chinese wereand dont tell me you werent floored when that bit came out about mao being in contact with that other other tribe of aliens years ago and no one knew for all this time i cant believe that dude is still alive somewhere out in space and you notice how quick the chinese got their asses out of tibet after the dalai lama talked about it on al jazeera makes me wonder what else they dont want us to know no you know what it makes me worry all these different aliens showing up and putting us in the middle of their fights thatve been going on for centuries something tells me we wont come out ahead no matter what we do we had enough problems of our own before any of them showed up now we have to deal with international and inter space relations who has the right to talk to who and negotiate what and all else and we still have global warming the aliens dont care though theyre too busy fighting its like what they came here to get out of us is secondarythey still have to learn how to get on with each other you know i used to think that the best part of space travel would be getting away from folk you cant stand just put all your people on a spaceship and go whats the use if you all just end up in the same places arguing over the same ol shit so no im not letting my daughter sign up for that colony thing the african aliens are setting up she just turned sixteen and thank god for that parental consent requirement this whole cultural exchange thing to fix global warming it just doesnt sit right what do they need with a million people to go off to some planet and do what for who we wont even be able to communicate with them for five years i dont think so not my daughter we should have been solving our own problems instead of counting on some damn handout from the sky so you know what i told her no dont make the same mistakes they did i said itll just be the same shit different planet and if you have to deal with the same old shit no matter where you go so you might as well stay right here and do it at home yeah shes mad at me now but shell have other chances wont be long before all the other aliens out there show up a billion stars in the sky theres got to be more than just three kinds twilight of the gods john c wright john c wright is the author of nine novels including the recent nulla

attempt to tell the story of wagners the ring of the nibelung in space all three tales take place in a common background or future history where the human race has discovered the secret of immortality on ophiuchi wright said only an incentive such as eternal youth in my opinion could motivate the human race to overcome the nearinfinite expense and hardship of interstellar travel tall golden doors loomed up behind the dais of the throne behind those doors it was said the main bridge of the twilight of the gods reposed a chamber dim and vast with many altars studded all with jeweled controls set before the dark mirrors of the computer but acting captain weston ii found the chamber oppressive and did not like the mysterious dark mirrors of the computer watching him and so since his fathers death many years ago this white high chamber before the golden doors was used as his hall of audience the chamber was paved in squares of gold and white with pillars of gold spaced along white walls hanging between the pillars were portraits of scenes from somewhere in the ship the captain had never seen fields of green plants some taller than a man growing for some reason along the deck rather than in shelves along the walls in the pictures the deck was buckled and broken rising and falling in round slopes perhaps due to damage from a weapon of the enemy with major leaks running across it the scenes took place in some hold or bay larger than any acting captain weston ii had seen or could imagine the overhead bulkhead was painted light blue some sort of white disruption like steamclouds floating against it in many pictures the blue overhead was ruptured by a large yellow manyrayed circular explosion perhaps again of a weapon in most pictures were sheep or other animals and young crewmen and women out of uniform blissfully ignoring the explosion overhead and doing nothing to stop the huge leaks one of which had ducks swimming in it acting captain weston ii found the pictures soothing but disturbing he often wondered if the artist had been trying to show how frail and foolish men are that they will trip lightly through their little lives without a thought to the explosions and disasters all about them perhaps he preferred this chamber for that reason what the original use and name of this chamber had been in days gone past no man of the captains court could tell not even his withered and aged computerman the chamber now was bare except that the computerman approached the throne and knelt to weston my lord he said his face was worn and haggard his garb simple rough and belted with a hank of rope the computermans eyes showed red and staring a certain sign of the many long nightwatches he had spent writhing in the grip of the holy drug which allowed his brethren to commune with the computer why do you come unbidden unto me weston asked sternly i know you await another the computerman replied it is to warn you against that other that i am come the acting captain raised his hand but the computerman said swiftly bid me not to go unless you would not heed the will of the computer in this thing the computer which knows all indeed even things most secret and shameful the captain had a troubled look upon his face and sat back with one hand clutching the front of his jeweled coat as if to hide something behind his hand something perhaps on a necklace hidden beneath his tunic what shame he said every child knows the story of the ring of last command the computerman said of how when the sixth barrage destroyed the lights and power of the second hundred decks and weapon of the enemy opened the great chasm in the hull reaching from the stars below almost to the thousandth deck the first captain valdemar capitulated to the enemy and allowed a boarding party to come in from the void below the hull decks three hundred through seven hundred seventy rebelled and followed bright alverin into battle against the traitor captain but the captain was not found and his ring of final command was lost the ring they say can waken the computers all again and send the weapons of the twilight down into the void childrens fairytales the captain said yet i deem they tempt you the computerman said the captain was silent this prisoner which the giant brings he had a ring inscribed with circuits did he not a ring which matches the descriptions of the command ring you dream of learning the secret word which controls that ring and of conquering the world of driving back the tall elves from decks above where they fly and know no weight and compelling the twisted dwarves from engineering to obedience to your reign and one day who knows you think you will drive forth the destroyers and the servants of the enemy who infest the many antispinward decks and hurl them down into the void from whence they came you dream a dream of vile pride you are corrupted with temptation the captain rose angrily from his throne stop do you think your holy office will protect you from my wrath were there such a ring as legends say for certain i would seize it to my own and who would dare deny me you you but the computerman bowed in all humility and said my lord knows there can be no such ring a ring to waken the computers indeed our faith informs us that the computers do not sleep that their screens are not dark not to eyes that keep the faith i and my brethren commune with the computers each nightwatch and it gives us secret knowledge my father told me the computer screens once were bright to every eye and a voice like a mans voice spoke from them every man even the humblest could hear that voice before the fifth barrage in his youth he had seen them shining and heard the voice men knew less sin in those days my lord at that moment came a noise at the doors before them not the golden doors of the bridge but the silver doors leading to the outer part of the palace and to the corridors and warrens of the great city of forecomcon the silver doors swept wide here were twenty pikemen of the gatewatch dressed in blue and silver and here garbed hugely in the graygreen of the ancient order of marines strode in the giant the giants shoulder was taller than a tall mans head but his hair and beard were white with age for he was the last of his kind born to serve as a marine created by the lost arts of the medical house back when the twilight was young his name was carradock in one hand carradock held a mighty weapon like a spear made by ancient and forgotten arts the weapon could shoot bullets like a musket except that it could fire many at a time yet the bullets were slow and would not pierce the bulkheads or damage the equipment and so the weapon was lawful according to the weapons law in carradocks other hand was a chain bound by that chain manacled and fettered was a strange dark man wearing a uniform of silverwhite unlike any uniform known to westons lore the man had pale hair like an upperdeck elf and like them he was tall but he was darkened and scarred by radiation like the dwarves of engineering or like those who lived near the great chasm the lesser chasm or the hole or near any other place the weapons of the enemy had blown up through the world he was muscled like a downdeck dwarf with thicker muscles than weston had ever seen except perhaps for those on carradock the gatewatch lieutenant spoke up out of turn coming forward and saying my lord i pray you let not this man alone in audience with you he has the strength of three men then let him be bound with three mens chains but i will speak alone to him the prisoner in silverwhite stood face calm staring at the captain his face was still his demeanor quiet he seemed neither proud nor humble but he stood like a man surrounded by a great silent open space wherein nothing could be hidden from him nor anything approach to harm him when he did not kneel the gatewatch pikemen struck him in the back of his knees with the butts of their spears but the muscles of the prisoners legs were strong and did not bend when struck three of the gatewatch put their hands on his shoulders to force him down the prisoner watched them calmly but would not budge leave him stand the captain ordered the men stepped back then the captain said where are his wounds he has no new scars i ordered him put to torment bring forth the apprentice torturer but the lieutenant said sire the apprentice torturer fled after you ordered the master torturer tortured to death after none of the lesser torturers would approach this prisoner they refused to obey your order the computerman was still standing near the throne he leaned forward and whispered sire why did you order the master torturer put to the question i guess this this prisoner told you that he had told the master torturer the words which command the ring the master torturer denied it you conceived a jealous suspicion and feared the master torturer craved the ring and knew the word do i guess aright the captain stood leave me all of you except my giant leave me you as well computerman the lieutenant said sire shall we bring the other prisoner in now as well the blind man we found wondering the inner corridor what care i for wandering beggars leave me all but the computerman would not leave until the gatewatch came to drag him away the computerman was shouting beware the thing you covet beware it is a thing accursed all who do not possess it will crave it it will drive you to madness it will drive you to destroy your trusted servants as you have destroyed your torturer eschew this thing cast it away the computer cannot be controlled by it but by then the gatewatch had gently pulled the old man out of the chamber and closed the door behind them acting captain weston ii sat upon his throne again and bent his gaze upon the dark scarred man before him the man did not fidget or stir but stood calm and silent and the giant stood waiting behind him speak ordered weston the man said i have nothing more to say his voice was soft and pleasant to the ear the old code requires you to speak to a superior officer what is your name and station rank and duty i am henwas son of himdall i come from starwell my rank is watchman i am come to report to the true captain there are no watchmen the order is defunct after the boarding by the enemy all the outer hull was laid to waste no you are no watchman you have the look of an aftman farmer about you i was not born a watchman indeed i was born a farmer my village is called aftshear in the secondary engine core near the axis where the world has no weight my youth was spent tending the many plants and green growing things from whence come our air and life but i was captured by the enemy and for a time was a slave i escaped and fled below decks where every step is a crushing weight and the air is poisoned by the radiations of the seventh barrage the servants of the enemy feared the radiation and could not tolerate the weight and did not pursue me crawling i went still lower till i was nearly crushed then i came upon a place where nothing was below me except for the stars there i was found by himdall last of all watchmen in the midst of a deserted place and empty corridors a chamber lit and filled with sweet air although surrounded by darkness and poison on every side himdall nursed me back to health and taught to me his art and showed to me the starwell at whose deep bottom the stars underfoot turn and turn again and i became a watchman in truth and was adopted as his son and for long years i kept watch on the enemy stars and saw the slow grave motions weston asked and do you believe the heresy which says the stars which move are not mere colored lights but the ships from which the enemy in ancient times came forth i do and yet among those lights are four ships friendly to our own sent out as we were in ages past from earth their names i think you know the götterdämmerung the apocalypse the armageddon and the ragnarök weston stirred uneasily upon his throne i tell you the original captain betrayed the crew and fled this happened when my father was a boy he was acting captain now i am the acting captain by what right do you call yourself so weston shouted angrily by right of blood succession then he was quiet and he said quietly you may give any report you must give to me very well said henwas watchman and he recited all he had said when first he had been brought before weston the eighth barrage which has been approaching for so many years has turned aside and seeks now to strike the armageddon the missiles and small ships of that barrage shall smite their target starting twelve years hence with a bombardment lasting a year or two peaking fourteen years hence and diminishing thereafter we shall not be struck by it presumably the masters of enemy now know we were boarded by the sixty armies from the landing party from the dreadnought kzalcurrangachai which in our speech is named the hungry indeed for battle i further report that our escort ships the revenge and the vendetta were destroyed between thirteen and seven years ago by picket ships launched from the tzazalkiurung which in our speech is named ready to do grave harm this ship is presently four lightminutes off our port bow where it has remained for seventy years no doubt waiting to see if it must render aid to the kzalcurrangachai yet the main sweep of the destroyer fleet has passed beyond us and done us no hurt we are in the midst of some eighty dreadnoughts and four motile planets their crown ships are within eight lightminutes of us now and have not maneuvered to avoid us by a further distance asteroids from the shattered planet called war storm are all about us in each direction and perhaps hide us from the main body of the enemy and from the crown ships which take no heed of us but proceed against the armageddon and the götterdämmerung of the apocalypse there has been no sign for thirty years the ragnarök is hidden by a great light either she maneuvers or she is in full retreat the captain was sarcastic and you believe all this that the fate of our world depends on the motions of these little colored lights i have one thing further to report the escort ship hermes trismegistus out from the götterdämmerung has entered an orbit of the enemy planet called promise of destruction she maneuvers without any flare and will not be seen by the enemy the orbit will carry the hermes trismegistus to us before the decade ends it is a rescue ship when the officers from the hermes come aboard power and light will be restored to all sections the wounded and the poisoned will be healed by their knowledge and those who have not kept faith will be punished if you have been disobedient you will be taken before the court martial the captain sneered my nurse when i was but a babe would terrify me with tales of the court martial and the day of judgment that would come when the earthmen would come up from heaven underfoot but you shall not live long enough to find the truth of these things unless the medicine of the earthmen knows how to resurrect the dead the watchman said simply i have lived near the radiations of the outer hull i have the disease i know the hour of my death is not far off why else would i be willing to bear the cursed ring weston drew on a chain around his neck up from inside his jeweled coat he drew out the ring it was gold inscribed with delicate circuitry and set with gray stone in the middle of the stone gleamed a strange light which showed that the power of the ring still lived tell me the word which commands this ring i may only tell the captain i am captain i am he there is no captain valdemar he is myth even were there such a man he would be long dead a hundred years or more gone by i am the true captain a true captain would use the power not for himself but to complete the mission and discharge the great weapons the stories say our world carries at its axis the watchman said softly and if that were my intention then you would not have chained me said the watchman rattling his manacles the captain sat until he felt his anger cool within him then he spoke in a voice most reasonable and even watchman if i could persuade you that there are no worlds hanging in the void beneath our world no dreadnoughts of the enemy no war except for the wars fought with the enemy aboard our ship between here and midline darkhall and spinward toward the lesser chasm what then if there is no world outside our world no weapons to fire what reason have you them to withhold from me the ring of final command no reason said the watchman if there were no worlds below our feet i would give the rings commands to you then reckon this if you are right and there is a war in space below us then this ship and all aboard were sent into that war to fight perhaps to die all in order to defend the ship called earth from our great enemy earth is not a ship it is a planet earth is inside out for the crew there live on the outer hull and their air is outward from them on earth gravity is backwards and draws them toward their axis so that they stand with their feet on the hull with their heads looking down toward the stars be that as it may the earthmen sent these great ships far out into space to fight their wars not so this they did with all wisdom and intention knowing that even the swiftest flight across the void would take generations not so it is so i ask you then in all candor how could this be who but a madman would dispatch his armies to fight across the void sending them to battlefields so far that the grandchildren of those sent out would be the only soldiers on the field i know not yet it was done leaving us ignorant of all no one has even seen the enemy stars nor do we know them how have we become so ignorant so soon my master said once that the computer spoke to all the children and instructed them when the computer fell silent there were no written things aboard with which to teach the children much was lost more was lost in the confusion of the wars and darkenings what we know we know by spoken lore but in the past all men knew the priestly arts and could read the signs weston waved his hand impatiently as if this were nothing to the point heed me i tell you i have led men into battle not once but many times both against the rebel elves of alverin and against the enemy will you take me at my word that no battle could be fought nor any force commanded unless the soldiers are willing to die for one another or for their home corridors i believe it now then who aboard this ship is willing to die for earth which no one has ever seen or is willing to die for those aboard the other ships of which myths speak the götterdämmerung or the apocalypse are the crews and peoples of those mythic worlds willing to die for us if so why perhaps their greatgrandfathers knew our greatgrandfathers back when earth first made us but who knows them now do you see wars over such length of time cannot be possible but the watchman said the medicine of those times past was much greater than our own and men expected lives many hundreds of years in length due to things they had put inside their bodies things we do not have and cannot make with our scant arts to the immortals wars no matter how long are done with swiftly the captain knew a moment of doubt his gaze rested on his giant a man made huge and strong by arts the captain knew had been lost he also knew the old tales which said that before the medical house was destroyed during the second barrage all officers were young and ageless able to see in the dark like cats strong as dwarves and instantly cured of any wound poison or hurt even were there such a war the captain slowly said if we are as you say deep in the ranks of the enemy overlooked and ignored to fire our weapons now would mean the destruction of this world if not now then in the time of our children at that moment came a great commotion at the silver doors a sound of trumpets and alarms there came a banging at the doors and the lieutenant rushed in his sword drawn sire called the lieutenant the rebels from abovedecks attack in great force alverin himself leads them already he has been struck by a dozen arrows each time he plucks them forth and laughs the men the men are saying he is an earthman rally the men draw down the great doors at spinhall common fork and at the underroad flood the stairwells leading to deck eight thirty six with oil then withdraw the men behind the great barrier wall and close the high gate use hand pumps to withdraw some part of the air from the circular approach corridor this will seal all doors beyond the power of any batteringram to breach but if he brings unlawful weapons explosives fool alverin has never broken the weapon law never cheated a treaty never lied why do you think his rebellion does so poorly they must be mad things to attack us now will you come to lead us presently first i must do otherwise go and when the man had left weston said to the watchman henwas with this ring i could call upon the computer to close and open doors at will extinguish lights drain corridors of air tell me the words but henwas said you did not think to hide the ring when your lieutenant entered here he saw it if he craves its power as much as you he will be gathering men to lead against you here to seize the ring there is no more time for talk say the words or i will order my giant to snap you like a wire you cannot escape the curse of the ring whoever does not have the ring craves to have it so my master himdall was told by the strange blind man who gave it first to him strange blind man perhaps he thought the curse would be alleviated if the ring were given to so remote a hermit as my master and did your master say what this mans appearance was many times for he was most peculiar the wanderer he wore his hair long like those of the lower decks but walked with a staff like an upperdeck man not used to our weight he wore a widebrimmed hat like the men of the greenhouses where the light controls never dim their fierce glare but he wore cusps of black glass before his eyes like a darklander out here where lights still glow on each shoulder he carried a bird like men who walk in fear of poisoned corridors who when they see their pets keel over flee carradock go tell the gatewatch to bring the other prisoner in the description matches it is he when the giant was at the door speaking to the guard the watchmen flexed his muscles hugely and the chains about his wrists snapped free he bent down and tugged the chains about his ankles the links bent and broke but by then the giant had seen and flung himself back across the room to fall upon the watchman with his full strength for a moment they strove against each other limbs intertwined muscles knotted their strength was equal yet the aged giant was more cunning in the art of wrestling the giant twisted and flung the watchman to the ground and fell atop him by this time the guards from the door had run forward and stood with pikes ready but could find no opening and dared not strike for fear of hitting the giant when he rose the giant had the watchmans arms pinned painfully behind his back his hands twisted up the giant was grinning you are a worthy opponent he whispered panting you also said the watchman as blood trickled down his face a moment later a second group of knights and pikemen came in the chamber escorting an old man in a broad black hat the old man walked leaning on a staff two black birds clung to the shoulders of his long cape the cape was fastened with a steel ornament shaped like a spiked wheel lieutenant why does he come before me unchained garbed in no uniform holding his stick were these things not taken from him at the door of his cell sire stammered the lieutenant we found him now not in his cell but walking the corridors leading to the palace singing a carol a carol the stranger lifted his head as the hat brim tilted up weston saw the man wore round disks of black glass before his eyes the stranger sang woe my child woe is me my son was born while falling free cannot endure earth gravity he never shall come home not he but evermore forevermore shall fly the airless deep fly free that is an old song said weston i am an old man the stranger replied i think you are valdemar said weston then why do you not salute me valdemar was a traitor then why do you not embrace me as a brother my fellow traitor what treason do you say i do asked weston the same as mine you covet the ring but i cannot use it when the chief engineer alberac learned i had let the enemy aboard he bound all the main circuits of the computer to a single overall command and wrought that command into the ring you hold leaving all other systems on automatic lauren the ships psychiatrist and i we traveled to the engine room and we deceived poor alberac and seized the ring but alberac had wrought more cunningly than i had guessed and had programmed the ring such that whenever it was used any other member in the computer then would know from where and from whom the rings commands had come the enemy would bend all their forces toward its capture were there any enemy aboard you see the ultimate power of command yet it can be used only by someone not afraid to die where to find such absolute devotion to ones duty many years i searched the halls of this great ship from the ventilation shafts where pirates aboard their giant kites fly the hurricanes from level to level down to the swamps and stench of the sewermen who silently take the dead away and in the darkness use secret arts to recycle all foul things to air and light again only one man i found had not deserted his post himdall last of the watch and most faithful surrounded by the enemy abandoned alone yet true to his duty and look here is his son equally as faithful as is he equally as doomed henwas called out captain i wish to report the enemy crown ships are nigh to us believing our world conquered and desolate and are presently vulnerable to the discharge of our weapons several of the knights stared at the blackcloaked stranger in awe it is valdemar said one captain another whispered and a third said can it be he one of the pikemen in the room was looking not at valdemar but at weston this pikeman spoke out saying my lord you have the command ring but there was envy in his eyes and he stepped toward the throne but a knight dressed all in ribbons and fine clothes drew his rapier and touched that pikeman on the shoulder with the naked blade so that the man was frightened and stopped the knight spoke to weston saying the rumor of the ring draws alverin and all his tall frail men this old dribbler if he is valdemar came also for its lure i think the squat and surly dwarves who serve the fat lord of engineering cannot be far behind the ring is surely cursed my lord it were better cast into a pit a second knight this a tall man from cargobay said my lord the stranger rambles at length he hopes for delay perhaps he is in league with alverins people the giant said to the stranger captain valdemar i am carradock son of cormac my father died in the battle of foresection seven hold killing the great champion of the enemy my father was an earthman born beneath blue skies and he did not desert his post even at his death by his name and in return for the vengeance i owe you for his death at the hands of the enemy whom you allowed aboard i ask this question why broad question why what why did you surrender to the enemy and allow them to land sixty armies into our halls is that your full question are you not also going to ask why on the day of the last burn did our drive core suddenly accidentally ignite why the enemy vessel was struck amidships with a line of flame a hundred miles long sterilizing half their outer decks why to this day they have not landed a thousand armies more and why can they barely keep the empire to our antispinward supplied with arms and food and that with picket ships which till recently were kept at bay by our escort ship revenge why they dare not bombard the twilight into flaming ruin for fear of striking dead their own armies and best of all why does the sirdaremperor aboard this ship the son of the leader of the boarding party why has he reported to his masters that the ship is taken this last question i can answer the destroyers would certainly annihilate this vessel with their great weapons were they to learn that we still lived and fought and still ruled the inner decks as far spinward as waterstore and forward as airbay and greenlitfield watchman said the giant if you will promise not to escape i will release one arm of yours and i will trust your promise knowing that of all orders and ranks of men watchmen are the most true and trustworthy for the good of the ship relies on the honesty of their reports why do you wish to let go my hand the watchman asked so that my own hand shall be free to salute my captain as he has asked i agree said the watchman and the carradock raised his huge hand and saluted valdemar there were tears in carradocks eyes weston was livid tell me the word to unleash the power of the ring tell or i swear you die this moment traitor valdemar said i know many secret words of high command words to open doors or trigger circuits which only open to my voice doors leading down into secret corridors accessways and crawlspaces where no designers ever meant a human being to go every inch of all thousand decks of this vast ship i know for it is mine and i have never renounced my claim to it i know words to darken lights and still the airs to silence or to send them rushing up again but one word i do not know the word which himdall whispered to ring when he took it for his own now a group of twelve computermen came into the chamber carrying staves and bludgeons the pikemen in silver and blue lowered their lances but confusedly some pointing at the computermen some at the black stranger and one or two at the watchman whom the giant still gripped three pikemen began walking toward the throne in a menacing fashion but when the lieutenant called sharply out to them these three hesitated and stood uncertainly the chief computerman was near the silver doors he waved his truncheon and called out weston give up the ring it is false and has no power do not dream you can control the doors and lights and weapons of the world only the computer can control these things and it heeds only our holy order it that so indeed spoke the dark stranger he pointed his staff at the silver doors and spoke a single harsh syllable immediately the silver doors swung shut and there was a sound of great bolts slamming home the computerman jumped forward to avoid the doors no doubt hissed valdemar these doors reacted of their own accord from a wish to keep mere riffraff and sweepings of the corridors from blowing in to botch the brew edgal sindal garvoris called out weston to three of his knights kill valdemar upon this instant if he knows not the word to command the ring then he is not any use to me other words i know valdemar mildly replied and he shouted the chamber dimmed into utter darkness during the moment as the lights failed henwas saw valdemar leap and spin lightly into the air surrounded by a great gray circle of cloak and by the flutter of his two dark shrieking birds with one hand as he leaped valdemar drew out a breathing tube from his collar and put it to his mouth and nose his other hand drew a hidden swordblade from his staff the staffend which had been the scabbard fell away smoking valdemar spun disemboweling one oncoming knight with a kick hidden knives unfolding from his boot spurs in one smooth motion it was done and the two other knights rushing forward missed him with their pikes as he leaped swirling his cloak about the head of one of them while the man was tangled in the weighted net hidden below the cloak valdemar slashed him to death with a stroke of his shining sword which he held under his palm against his forearm after the fashion of blindfighters then it was dark there came a noise and shattering explosion of light in the flare of the explosion the corpse of the one knight standing near where the smoking caneend had been abandoned could be briefly seen headless bloody arms flailing as it fell the hollow tube had contained some shrapnel which had been scattered among the pikemen and guards their chests and faces were bloody screams were starting one man was blubbering like a baby henwas heard a hiss smelled the fetid dizzying smell of poisonous gas radiating from the corner of the chamber where valdemar had been all was noise screams horncalls darkness confusion the stench of blood the smell of poison henwas was awed by the destruction was the captain truly blind there was another flare of light the lieutenant stood with an illegal handweapon blazing in his fist his face bloodred contorted with murderous wrath he was shouting suffer not to live who breaks the weapon code who kills the ship kills all the lieutenant had been driven beyond all reason by the traitorcaptains use of poisons and explosives which could damage air filters and bulkhead seals he reckoned nothing for the illegality of his own weapon the ornament which valdemar had used as a cloakpin spun shining out of the darkness and struck the lieutenants hand the disk was razorsharp it severed the lieutenants fingers the handweapon fell again it was dark weston shouted carradock save the watchman and then he cried out in great pain having betrayed his location by his shout someone struck at henwas with a bludgeon with his free hand for the other was still gripped by the giant henwas reached out and seized the arm wielding the bludgeon and the bones broke under the strength of his fingers at first he was amazed and angered for he did not think that any in that chamber would risk his harm but under hand he felt the roughspun cloth of a computerman then the giant was dragging him to one side henwas heard a clash of blades a hoarse cry where he had just been standing now the giant held him still by some odor or noise or pressure close at hand henwas felt an intuition that valdemar was nearby silent in the darkness the giant still had him by one arm but even so henwas did not move or speak for fear of someone hearing there was a ruckus in the blackness all around them the clash of arms henwas suspected that the computermen or the pikemen were in rebellion and thought under cover of darkness and confusion to steal the ring valdemars voice slithered out of the blackness carradock i ask you by your ancient oaths now to be obedient to me and bring the watchman to the throne where weston is we will seize the ring when you call to him he will answer thinking you loyal henwas was amazed that any man who used explosives aboard the ship could say words like oath and loyalty and not be choked but he feared a coming tragedy carradock and valdemar both were resolute brave men he knew the giant would not break fealty with weston who however unworthy was his lord he knew as well that valdemar who might admire the giant would not hesitate an instant to cheat deceive or murder him the moment that such crimes became useful to his grand design the giant made no noise henwas was not surprised valdemar spoke again unfortunate that you must betray weston who is your lord but the mission goals require it fret not treason is only bitter at first the soul grows easily accustomed carradock lashed the bayonet of his weapon through the air toward the voice he struck nothing by some trick or sleight valdemar had made his voice seem to come from where it was not henwas valdemar whispered sounding very near call out that i may hear where the giant stands and slay him but henwas did not want the giant to die and did not answer henwas carradock both of you have disobeyed my direct command in time of war for this i instantly condemn you i now release the deadly vapor breathe and perish henwas knew this was some feint to compel them to move or act so he doubted and stayed still and perhaps the giant suspected this a ruse as well but staked no chance on it carradock discharged his weapon straight up into the air in the momentary muzzleflare valdemar could be seen crouching like a great black bat near the floor white blade in his hand point poised across his back like the sting of a scorpion the giant dropped the barrel of his weapon and fired again valdemar flopped and fell limply the giant fired many times at that moment the great gold doors behind the throne opened a crack there was a weak light from the main bridge beyond dusky blue servicelights said to burn forever silhouetting against that light henwas could see the staggering figure of acting captain weston who was pierced and bleeding by the slim crack of light from the door the huddled figure of valdemar could be seen bleeding terribly accept my surrender whispered valdemar for i am wounded unto death the giant stepped forward i repent that when finally i had found a man worth serving the true captain from the young days of the world he sullied his hands with unlawful weapons your surrender i accept for memory of the nobility once you had a pause then can you hear me and when he bent over the huddled figure valdemar hearing the sound of his voice flung up his hand and threw a poisoned dagger into the open mouth of the giant piercing the roof of his mouth nothing is unlawful nothing noble in war valdemar screamed in anger the whitehaired and ancient giant staggered forward and fell onto the supine body of captain valdemar crushing him down and perhaps the giant falling had struck down with his knife or hands for the body of valdemar was crushed and was not seen to move again as the giant fell valdemar cried a single word of command and then was silent the moment the giant had unhanded him henwas bounded across the chamber toward weston a knight rose up before him like a ghost in the gloom brandishing a rapier but henwas scarred by radiation knew no fear came forward was stabbed in the shoulder painfully but struck in the knights skull with his fist he nearly had his hands on the wounded weston who sobbing was crawling through the golden doors into the vast dark chamber beyond when a pikestroke from behind henwas cut into the muscles of his leg and toppled him in a moment the pikeman had him by the hair and was pressing a dirk against his throat even as henwas hands closed around the braceletringed ankle of westons jeweled boot weston drew a bloody hand out from underneath his gemstudded coat this is my deathwound he panted staring in horror at the hearts blood in his palm i am slain meanwhile valdemars last spoken word had its effect there was a noise like that of bolts being drawn back and of doors opening and the pictures which lined the walls swung free in their frames and from half a dozen secret doors lights and trumpetnoise issued forth into the chamber from these secret doors came suddenly the tall pale men of overdeck garbed all in green some with breastplates and helms of polished steel carrying bows and tall spears and slim straight swords the knights of the aboveworld were tall and fair and terrible to look upon and they were singing their warsong not one of them was pockmarked or scarred or showed any sign of the radiation diseases which those who live on lower decks to their sorrow know only too well before them came the white starbanner of alverin many carried bows and crossbows for although the overmen are weaker in their legs and bodies than are other men their arms are sinewy and their eyes are keen alverin himself came forth his uniform as green as leaves and from his wide shoulders hung one of the fair white winged cloaks those who live at the axis of the world use to steer themselves in flight his hair was as yellow as the corn his people grow in greenhold his eyes were blue and bright and shone with a light of stern command now alverin raised his straight slim sword and called upon those within the chamber to surrender saying whoso lays down his arms shall be spared and set free i vow suffering no hurt nor any dishonor because the rumor of alverins honesty and clemency was so well known the knights and pikemen in that chamber instantly threw down their swords and polearms none had heart to fight seeing their leader weston lay swooning with his life blood bubbling out of him the weapons fell ringing to the chamber floor but one of the computermen seized up a pike and with a terrible cry cast it straight into alverins breast alverin staggered backward pierced through the heart and lungs in that same instant of time the man who had cast the pike was stricken through his arm by three arrows yet these shots were not illaimed for alverins men by custom spoke before they struck wounded rather than slew alverin drew the pikehead out from his bloody chest and wiped the blood away the wound closed up into a scar and then alverins chest grew fair and smooth again he cast the bloody pike aside i am an earthman i was born beneath blue sky he called out to the wounded man he said the knowledge of the men who made this entire world have made me as i am and i am not to be slain by your small weapons and he ordered his physician to tend to the wounded among the enemy even the man who had smitten him alverin turned he saw valdemar laying motionless his body crushed beneath the fallen giant so alverin whispered these secret paths you showed to us were not a trap did you play us true this once old liar if so where is the ring now he turned again in the threshold of the golden doors leading to the main bridge a pikeman still crouched above henwas the watchman a steady knife still touching the prone mans throat henwas was bleeding at the shoulder and the leg and yet his face was remote and calm as if no wound nor pain could trouble him alverin stepped forward till he could see lying in the shadow of the door dying acting captain weston ii and in his bloodstained hand the ring beyond was the bridge a large dimly lit cathedral of a space surrounded on all sides by the darkened screens of the computer weston croaked pikeman slit the watchmans throat if the rebelking steps forward one step more weston said alverin in a soft stern voice yield up to me the ring i will restore to all the world the light the power and the justice which by right should have been ours you have my solemn promise that all your men shall be dealt with justly should i believe a mutineer you betrayed valdemar hissed weston wearily after he surrendered to the enemy free men follow leaders into battle and render him the power of command only while he does their will in pursuit of a just war or in defense against hostility that power of command incapable of destruction returned to the free men of this ship upon valdemars abdication of it by their fair and uncoerced election i was tendered the command and so am captain that trust i hold sacred render me the ring and i shall see this world prosper prosper are we not surrounded by enemy worlds weston asked softly we are too humble for their attention alverin said if we do not offend them they will pay us no more heed and if the ring is used to launch the fabled weaponry at worlds core weston now raised himself on one elbow his face was pastywhite his eyes wild and sick then the world dies if not in this generation then in the next the lieutenant his hand being bandaged by a tall pale doctor spoke up sire yield the ring to alverin even we so many years his foe acknowledge his justice wisdom and trueheartedness if any man is deserving of empire it is such a man as this but henwas who still had him by the ankle said a voice of calm command in your last moment sir i pray you be a captain truly use the ring or give it me to complete the mission of the twilight of the gods we both are dying you of wounds me of radiation poison and disease should we in such a time as this abandon our posts and sue for peace this whole world was made for war pikeman stand away here watchman take the accursed thing do your duty kill all my enemies you them everyone and be damned to you all with a curse on his lips weston slid into death and his cold hand gave the ring to henwas henwas came up to his knees and thrust the pikeman down across the dais stairs such was the strength of his arm that the man was flung many yards away alverin and the elves started forward suddenly but henwas leaning inward from the golden door reached and touched the shining ring against the dark cold mirrored corner of the nearest of the many computer screens which filled the huge black bridge he spoke the words eternal fidelity i am forever loyal and all the mirrors flamed to life and shone with purest light on each screen images appeared words symbols strange letters and equations and everywhere the thousand shining lights of all the enemy stars a pure and perfect voice like no voice ever to be made by lips or tongue of man rang out ready several of the computermen screamed in fear or shouted with joy one sank down to his knees and cried out oh that i have seen this day even the knights and guards of westons and alverins tall men stood speechless eyes wide but the chief computerman called out for the men to avert their eyes this is a deception of the enemy the computer cannot speak to men except through us but one of the knights smote him across the face with his fist the chief computerman fell to the deck and lay sullen wiping his mouth weeping and afraid to speak again one of the overman knights raised his bow and spoke in a soft clear voice noble lord alverin we have heard the word which can command the ring one shot and all the world shall be yours nay elromir spoke alverin not even to win empires will i have such a blow be struck against a man wounded and unarmed the watchman kneeling said computer are there weapons at this worlds core ready to strike out against our enemies all weapon systems at ready targets acquired firing sequences ready to initiate standing by alverin said watchman i pray you wait you will unleash a storm of fire none save me aboard this ship even recall the origins of this war its purpose or its cause why do you condemn all the nations lands and peoples here aboard the twilight to be obliterated think of those born innocent years after this dreadful ship of war was launched our captain betrayed us we have surrendered let it rest at that henwas said when the stranger whom i now know to have been valdemar gave my master himdall this dread ring he did so with these words you alone shall know when the waiting is completed when the enemy grows lax and deems us dead only now do i understand the captains purpose after all these years even from before my birth the other ships we know only as names of glory these ships are hard beset by that great foe which ruined and overthrew our world so long ago and our true world earth though we have forgotten it still calls to us to fight in her defense the captain expected us to fight and die for the glory of the fleet to die if need be to have all the twilight die if it would forward the mission goals and accomplish our duty alverin said but those aboard the other ships why do you give such love and loyalty to them that you are willing to call destruction down on all our world for the sake of those whom you have never seen and do not know i will not live to see salvation yet i know it comes said henwas i never knew the other men who serve aboard those other ships yet i know that there are those aboard them who would gladly do for me what i now do for them that knowledge is enough for me one of the knights evidently realizing the henwas meant to do an act which would provoke the enemy to destroy the world stooped picked up a fallen dagger and before any of alverins men could think to stop him threw it the dagger spun and landed fair on the middle of henwas back henwas back arched eyes blind with pain now shouted computer shut these doors acknowledged all stations notified of override command location the men in the room swept forward like a tide but too late the golden doors fell to and shut in their faces alverin raised his hand and cried out with a great voice to rally his men alberacs curse has told all the computer screens now where the ring hides the enemy will sweep this area with fire exploding all the decks below us if they need be come we must be gone it may be already too late and he set his men passing swiftly out of the chamber he and his paladins stood on the dais before the golden doors unwilling to depart till all the men had gone before them and as they stood so through the doors they heard the great chiming and inhuman voice call out weapons free initiating launch warheads away there came a noise like thunder and a great voice echoing from every wall rang out and it was the watchmans voice tremendously amplified and echoing throughout every corridor of every nation of the great ship they heard the watchman call out saying i have seen it i have seen it and the heavens are consumed with light then more softly they heard the great voice say father if you see this you shall know i did not leave my post and then even more softly computer now destroy this ring and let its curse be ended and return all functions to their proper stations and commands light returned to the chamber where they where and they heard as from far off a great noise of wonder as of many voices of people near and far all crying out at once and they knew that light returned to darkened places which had known no light for years beyond count one of the knights took hold of alverins cape sire look and he pointed to where the giant carradock lay of valdemars body there was no sign he was gone look there one of the knights in wonder pointed upward to where the two black birds were huddled among the pillartops bundles of black feathers croaking they are his magpies said alverin softly even in ancient times from before he was blind he always kept such birds near him to remind him of what he dared not forget and to himself he murmured or perhaps since all this was arranged by his cunning perhaps it is i who am blind or who have forgotten one of the black birds croaked and spoke in a voice like a mans voice no matter what the cost the mission goals must be accomplished no matter what the cost the other black bird croaked and said alls fair in war alls fair alls fair alverin and his men departed from that place and did not look back warship george r r martin and george guthridge george r r martin is the bestselling author of the song of ice and fire epic

again gold he was the last of the crew and his strength was waning first dutyman lewis akklar found solace in those facts an emotion he felt but could not explain something similar to what he once had felt toward the paintings of degas and renoir he was sitting in the command chair his eyes dull now a smile creased his lips turned the left corner of his mouth slightly upward back and forth slowly back and forth he continued to swivel the chair the smile broadened his legs were outstretched and his pants plastic and sweatsoaked clung wetly to his legs his face throbbed with heat his temperature he knew was about degrees his hairstraight blackwas unkempt and it occurred to him he needed a shave and shower some sleep that too he found ironic except for the low humming of the instrument panel and an occasional click as a switch cut in the bridge around him was empty on three sides the silent impersonal instruments winked their multicolored lights off and on in everchanging patterns above him the viewscreen revealed its endless stars an expanse of coldness and loneliness he knew sol was the bright yellow star in the lower righthand corner of the screen somehow he did not give a damn anymore so this was how it was to end belford petrovovich captain doria lieutenant judanya kahr all his friends and shipmateskilled by disease though capable of firing some of the most sophisticated weaponry ever installed in a spacecraft the crew had not realized until too late for retaliation that the sarissi emissaries had smuggled aboard a biological agent now only akklaf a clerkholographer remained again he was conscious of the viewscreen the galaxy seemed adazzle with pinpricks of light stars knots in a salmon net faces in a classroom his mind had insisted upon those comparisons ever since he had volunteered for the international draft back home in the republic of the aleutians yet the loneliness he felt toward those images had preceded that induction by several years it had been loneliness he now knewnot wanderlustwhich in midsemester had taken him from those schoolchildren and set him upon the greaseblackened deck of the ulak out of cold bay the nets piled at his feet overlay upon neat overlay the sea slapping the hull and the gulls cawing overhead as they waited to alight wings lifting should the cook dump the garbage he had loved the ship the chilling constant fog the fishing voyage had neither erased nor intensified his loneliness but at least had given him reason for it he pressed a button in a console next to the chair the door nearest the central controlpanel hummed open he rose hands clutching the armrests to steady himself and stumbled across the room paused at the doorhands against the jamb then wildeyed and smiling he staggered down the dimly lit corridor judanya he said he pressed a wall button a second door opened twenty sheeted figures most on mattresses on the floor lay within the small sickbay lieutenant kahr was near the rear wall an oxygen tent enclosing her a sheet tucked neatly under her arms she was the only one of the dead whose face was uncovered the oxygen tent crinkled when he folded back the side he had been unable to force himself to close her eyelids she gazed toward him unseeing his form blackly mirrored within the pupils with the back of his hand he touched her cold cold cheek her lips were thin her nose sharply angular made her face appear narrow except for a mohawklike mane of black hair she was bald the sight of her head slightly startled him somehow he had thought death would overtake style and her hair would grow back as long as it was when she had first boarded the ship two years earlier he combed the hair with his fingers judanya he whispered light shone upon her forehead he drew the sheet down over her breasts her abdomen down over her legs he looked upon her as he had many times before wanting her not wanting her though she had sometimes slept with him she had never loved him lengthy cohabitations between officers and enlisted had been discouraged and she had refused to jeopardize her career for what she considered the insipid emotions he associated with sexuality she needed orgasms she had told him once merely to relax on his knees as though before an idol he folded the sheet overlay upon neat overlay at her feet her pubic triangle looked at him he bent forward and pressed his lips to her kneecap his fingertips squeezing the back of her leg judanya tears welled back home he knew people were dying laughing loving such was the terror of it all the terror and the loneliness he had felt within that crowded classroom back in dutch harbor the knowledge that whatever joy or sorrow he experienced there existed emotions and happenings beyond his comprehensionpeople he could neither know nor touch nor even really imagine life would go on whether he was alive or not unless of course the ship fell into sarissi hands or if the members of an earth ship contracted the disease and brought it home with them then all earth would know of him if only to hate all would die in a wayperhaps he told himself it was the feverthe notion appealed to him loneliness had brought him here here in death his loneliness could end it was for judanyanot for himself or humanitythat he would place the charges for judanya who had been all duty and dispassion judanya who to him was the ship he left her went to the armory for plastic explosives and an armload of looped fusewire then returned to the control room he flopped down in the command chair so exhausted and feverish he could hardly breathe and sat with his head in his hands finally straightening he sighed and lifted the vocoder from its cradle in the console except for his perfunctory remarks earlier in the day the log had not been kept for weeks transcription of first dutyman lewis akklar continuing at he glanced at his watch sixteen thirtyone hours i have just come back from sickbay having said goodby to my shipmates he paused and for a few moments just sat staring at the blankness of the forward wall at last he shook himself from his daydreams and resumed speaking the computers analyzed the disease as some sort of virus how the sarissi smuggled the agent on board remains a mystery we took all normal precautions against such a danger including standard sterilization and quarantine procedures the plague had an extremely long incubation period the first outbreak was five weeks ago nearly two months after we began the return trip to earth but once it struck it spread rapidly killing within a period of fortyeight hours after the first symptomsfever and a rawness about the eyesappeared the reception delegation including captain doria died first the med scanners failed to isolate the cause of the disease or to devise a workable cure or preventative both of the ships doctors died early gradually all efforts to combat the disease ceased he stopped suddenly and rubbed his left eye the pain was growing worse his hand went to the control panel and the soft blue lighting dimmed to darkness the damned plague isseemsunbeatable after half the crew was dead acting captain kahr took extreme steps to save the rest of us she cut the stardrive engines and retrofiring slowed us to a stop then she had the bodies jettisoned we moved the remaining crew from room to room and opened outside hatches and interior doors hoping the vacuum would kill the disease finally lieutenant kahr even jettisoned some of those who had shown symptoms there wasa mutiny we killed those who fought but it was no use it was all for nothing all that blood for nothing he frowned in the darkness as the memories came flooding back people just kept dying he said maybe the contagion had already spread to everyone during the incubation period nearly everyone had had contact with everyone else at least indirectly during our return flight or maybe it spread through the air ducts even after we switched to the backup system i dont know i just dont know all the med facilities this ship hasyet nothing worked there was a long silence akklar watched the lights blink on and off listened to the hum of the instruments smelled the clean heavy smell of machine he set the vocoder down carefully on the armrest and looked a final time at the viewscreen filled with stars i should close with some some memorable last words he said not lifting the vocoder but pushing the onbutton with his thumb his voice sounded hollow but i seem to have run out of words a moment passed and he looked out into the stars saw childrens faces a salmon net saw the ship within that net not struggling but hanging by its gills like the time the net had torn and the fishing crew had spent all afternoon taking but one sixpound king no he said i dont have any final words at all slowly standing he walked quietly from the roompassing this time through a door to his left the door closed behind him with the softest of whispers he moved along the corridors toward the ships belly planting plastic explosives in various niches and linking up the fuse wire he thought he heard fire doors close behind he told himself it was only his imagination the firecontrol panel along the baseboard began to hiss by the time he reached the warhead vault the steam from the panel had turned to foam and lay like giant puffy snakes around his legs the vault door openedhalfway immediately closed again the hissing grew louder the foam was now up to his thighs and climbing rapidly he tried the door button again still no response he found it ironic that the ship was malfunctioning just at the time the last of the crew was about to die but the fact that the door would not open did not matter anyway the chain reaction from the plastic explosives would trigger the warheads whether or not the door was open he mashed a handful of explosive into the corner of the door jabbed in both the relay and detonator fuses and stepped back sloshing through the foam he paused trying unsuccessfully to remember judanyas face the foam was to his chest he squeezed the detonator a dull faraway boom echoed through the ship and back on the bridge all the multicolored lights on the instrument panels went black on the main viewscreen the stars quite suddenly winked out finally she has rid herself of the last of themthe humans the diseased vermin and she has saved herself from becoming a crippled hulk the fire doors buffered the explosion the flooding of herself shortcircuited all but one of the wads of explosive now her intelligence moves through herselfchecking rechecking relays click circuits buzz signals indicate a jagged hole in hull subsection c instantly she activates her selfrepair units liquid sealant oozes and hardens to plug minor holes duralloy plates are rigged and methodically secured to close the major one her secondary monitor system then surveys damage to all systems and files extensive reports with her central computer banks again she sets the selfrepair units to humming and one by one the damaged areas are repaired or replaced damage to the seversstardrive engines has been extensive this too is corrected now she checks her position alarms sound she is off course and hanging dead in space reports and corrections flow through herself in a steady stream time passes scanners and mediprobes scrutinize those bodies still aboard ship all are lifeless the plan has been successful all crew members having been exposed to the virus all were expendable she could not allow possible contagion to occur by bringing them home to insure that she sucked the virus spores into her air ducts transferred them each time kahr ordered an airlock opened infected the food and water supply whenever possible a low rumbling begins climbs to a piercing shriek as she starts her great seversstardrive engines on the bridge the lights dance dizzily as she calculates the course

lee yoon ha lees work has appeared in the magazine of fantasy science fiction clarkesworld fantasy magazine ideomancer lady churchills rosebud wristlet farragos wainscot and sybils garage shes also appeared in the anthologies twenty epics years best fantasy and science fiction the best of a new story is forthcoming in electric velocipede lee says that she plays several instruments and composes as a hobby learning to use a piece of music software called logic studio gave her some ideas about how musicians in the future might compose which helped in the development of this story swanwatch is about the intersection of life and music and black holes in the story lee explores the notion of an interstellar society that holds suicide art in high esteem and what could be more perfect for that purpose than a black hole officially the five exiles on the station were the initiates of the fermata unofficially the concert of worlds called them the swanwatch the older exiles called themselves dragon and phoenix tiger and tortoise according to tradition based in an ancient civilizations legends the newest and youngest exile went by swan she was not a swan in the way of fairy tales if so she would have had a history sung across the galaxys billions of stars of rapturous beauty or resolute virtue she would have woven the hearts of dead stars into armor for the concerts soldiers and hushed novae to sleep so ships could safely pass however she was as befitted the name they gave her a musician swan had been exiled to the station because she had offended the captain of a guestship from the scintillant core in a moment of confusion she had addressed him in the wrong language for the occasion through the convolutions of concert politics she wound up in the swanwatch the captain sent her a single expensive message across the vast space now separating them it was because of the message that swan first went to dragon dragon was not the oldest and wisest of the swanwatch that honor belonged to tortoise but dragon loved oddments of knowledge and he could read the calligraphy in which the captain had written his message you have good taste in enemies dragon commented as though swan had singled out the captain dragon was a lanky man with skin lighter than swans and he was always pacing or whittling appallingly rare scraps of wood or tapping earwormrhythms upon his knee swan bowed her head id rather not be here and be back with my family she didnt say so out loud though that would have implied a disregard for dragons company and she was already fond of dragon can you read it she asked of course i can read it although it would help if you held the message right side up swan wasnt illiterate but there were many languages in the concert of worlds this way swan asked rotating the sheet dragon nodded what does it say dragons foot tapped it says i look forward to hearing your masterpiece honoring the swanships should i read all his titles too dragons ironic tone made his opinion of the captains pretensions quite clear they take up the rest of the page swan had paled no thank you she said the swanwatchs official purpose was as a retreat for artists its inhabitants could only leave upon presenting an acceptable masterwork to the judges who visited every decade in practice those exiled here lacked the requisite skill the captains message clearly mocked her like many privileged children swan had had lessons in the high arts music and calligraphy fencing and poetry she could set a fragment of text to a melody if given the proper mode and play the essential three instruments the zither the flute and the keyboard but she had never pursued composing any further than that expecting a life as a patron of the arts rather than an artist herself dragon said kindly its another way of telling you your task is impossible swan wondered if dragon was a composer but would not be so uncouth as to ask thank you for reading me the letter she said it was my pleasure dragon said it was obvious to him that swan was determined to leave the initiates and return home however difficult the task and however much home might have changed in the interim kind for a second time he did not disillusion her about her chances tiger was a tall woman with deceptively sweet eyes and a rapacious smile when swan first met her she was afraid that tiger would gobble her up in some manner peculiar to the initiates but tiger said only how are you settling in swan had a few reminders of her home things she had been allowed to bring in physical form a jewelry box inlaid with abalone inherited from her deceased mother a silver flute her best friend had given her the official who had processed swans transfer to the station had reminded her to choose carefully and had said she could bring a lot more in scanned form to be replicated at the station but where homesickness was concerned she wanted the real item not a copy swan thought about it then said ill adjust tiger said we all do she stretched joints creaking youve seen the duty roster i trust theres a swanship coming in very soon shall i show you what to do although swan could have trusted the manuals she knew she would be sharing swanwatch with tiger and the others for a long time if tiger was feeling generous enough to explain the procedures to her best not to offend tiger by declining together tiger and swan walked the long halls of their prison to the monitoring room you can do this from anywhere on the station tiger said the computers log everything and it only requires a moments attention for you to pray in honor of the swanships valor if you believe in that at all once youve been here a while youll welcome the ritual and the illusion that you matter they do value ritual where you come from dont they yes swan said how much of the fermata did you see on your way here they wouldnt let me look in fact swan had been sedated for her arrival new initiates sometimes attempted escape they said id have plenty of time to stare at the graveofships as an initiate quite right tiger said a little bitterly doors upon doors irised before them until at last they reached the monitoring room to swans surprise it was a vast hall lined with subtly glowing banks of controls and projective screens tiger grasped swans shoulder firmly and steered her to the center of the hall the graveofships tiger said adding an honorific to the phrase look swan looked all around them were the projected images of swanships in the first blush of redshift those who had cast themselves into the fermata and left their inexorably dimming shadows the concert of worlds highest form of suicide art in any number of religions the swanships formed a great fleet to battle the silence at the end of time some societies in the concert sent their condemned in swanships to redeem themselves while others sent their most honored generals the ship doesnt need our assistance does it swan said what in plunging into a black hole tiger said dryly not usually no tiger muttered a command and all the images flickered away save that of the incoming swanship and its escort of three the escort peeled away the swanship flew straight toward the fermatas hidden heart indicated in the displays by a pulsing point swan did not know how long she watched that fatal trajectory tiger tapped swan on the shoulder breathe cygnet its not coming back youll just see the ship go more and more slowly as it approaches the event horizon forever and you dont want to pass out how many people were on the ship swan said you want statistics tiger said approvingly tiger swan would learn was a great believer in morbid details she showed swan how to look up the basic things one might wish to know about a swanship its crew and shipyard of origin its registry the weapons it brought to the fight at the end of time i had thought it would be more spectacular swan said gazing back at the swanships frozen image even if i knew about thethe physics involved what were you expecting cygnet falsecolor explosions and a crescendo in the music of your mind tiger saw swan bite her lip it wasnt hard to guess how youd try to escape little musician its too bad you cant ask tortoise to write music for your freedom but all tortoise does anymore is sleep i wouldnt ask that of tortoise swan said but i have to understand the swanships if i am to compose for them poor cygnet tiger said youll learn to set hope aside soon enough tiger kissed swan on the side of the mouth not at all benevolently then walked away in the silence swan listened to the ringing in her ears and shivered after her nineteenth swanship swan hunted through the stations librariesupdated each time a swanship and its entourage came throughfor material on composition she read interactive treatises on music theory for six hours skipping lunch and dinner modes and keys time signatures and rhythms tones and textures hierarchies of structure the result was a vile headache the concert of worlds was as rich in musical forms as it was in languages and despite swans efforts to be discriminating she ran into contradictory traditions swan returned to the three instruments she knew zither flute and keyboard the station replicated the first and third for her according to her specifications drawing upon the classics she had memorized in childhood and the libraries collection of poetry she practiced setting texts to music sometimes she did this in the stations rock garden the impracticality of the place delighted her absurdly dragon often came to listen offering neither encouragement nor criticism rather than applauding he left her the figurines he whittled swan decorated her room with them are you an artist she asked dragon once after botching her warmup scales on the flute no dragon said i could play a chord or two on your keyboard but thats all swan turned her hand palmup and stepped away from the keyboard offering smiling he declined and she did not press him after fiftyseven swanshipsmonths as the station reckoned timeswan asked the others if she could move her keyboard into the observation room dragon not only agreed but offered to help her move it knowing that swan felt uneasy around the stations mechanical servitors phoenix said she supposed there was no harm in it tiger laughed and said anything for you cygnet swan was horribly afraid that tiger meant it tortoise didnt respond which the others assured her was a yes swan wrote fragments of poetry for each ship thereafter and set them to music the poetry itself was frequently wretchedswan was honest enough with herself to admit thisbut she had some hope for the music she was briefly encouraged by her attempts at orchestration bright brassy fanfares for ships that had served in battles shimmering chords for ships built with beauty rather than speed in mind the menacing clatter of drums for those rare ships that defied their fate and swung around to attack the station tiger deigned to listen to one of swans fragments despite her ordinary impatience for musical endeavors orchestrate a battle orchestrate a piece of music this isnt the only language that uses the same verb for both your battle cygnet is a hundred skirmishes and no master plan if you plan to do this for every swanship that is and has ever been youll die of old age before youre finished im no general swan said but i have a battle to fight and music to write i cant decide whether your persistence is tiresome or admirable tiger said but she was smiling and although she didnt seem to realize it her foot was still tapping to the beat swan had already returned to the keyboard sketching a theme around the caesuras of an ancient hymn lost in visions of ships stretched beyond recognition she did not hear tiger leave phoenix had held herself aloof from swan after their initial introduction this was not a matter of personal illwill as dragon told swan phoenix didnt hold anyone but herself in high regard and she locked herself away in pursuit of her own art painting perhaps swans diligence impressed phoenix at last it was hard to say tiger paid as little attention to phoenix as possible and urged swan to do likewise shes forever painting nebulae and alien landscapes then burning the results tiger said contemptuously whats the point then dragon said that everyone was entitled to a few quirks tiger remarked that anyone would say that of a former lover at that point swan excused herself from the conversation i have heard that you started the first movement of your symphony i should like to hear it phoenix said to swan through the stations most impersonal messaging system so swan invited her to the observation room at an hour when no swanships were scheduled to arrive she played the fluteher best instrumentto the stations recordings of the other parts the libraries had included numerous sequencers phoenix applauded when swan had finished her expression was reluctantly respectful gravely she said this captain of yours hes not mine swan thought although perhaps i am his do you know anything of his musical preferences swan shook her head i tried to find out she said after all if the captain had possessed enough influence to send her to the swanwatch he might also be able to influence the selection of judges he commissioned a synesthetic opera once which i have no recording of beyond that who knows how he interprets the graveofships and if i am to do each swanship justice shouldnt i draw upon the musical traditions of their cultures some of them contradict each other how am i to deal with this in a single finite symphony phoenix lifted an eyebrow and swan felt ashamed of her outburst do you know why were here swan she asked she was not referring to their official mission of contemplating the fermata to further their art it seemed impolite to ask swan said tiger is a war criminal phoenix said tortoise is a scholar who resigned and came here to protest the policies of some government that has since been wiped out of time it might even have done some good in the strand of society where he was famous i of course am here as unjustly as you are she did not elaborate and dragon phoenix smiled thinly you should ask dragon yourself it might make you think twice about your symphony swan wouldnt have realized anything was wrong if tiger hadnt sent her a message while she was in the middle of working on her second movement the idea had come to her in the middle of her sleep shift and she was kneeling at the zither adjusting the bridges urgent message from tiger the station informed her go ahead swan said absently trying to decide what mode to tune to tigers voice said hello cygnet its tortoises watch but he seems to be asleep as usual and you might be interested in going to the observation room tigers tone was lazy but she had flagged the message as urgent what was going on station swan said whos in the observation room now no one it said is there a swanship scheduled to arrive soon there is an unscheduled swanship right now swan rose and ran to the observation room tiger had been correct about the importance of ritual no matter how smoothly a ship descended into the fermata swan always checked the ships status swanships did occasionally arrive offschedule but she wondered why tiger had sounded concerned so she looked at the ship which was tiny with an underpowered sublight drive and its crew a single person gazhien of the circle of swords she knew that name although ages had passed since she had used it it was dragon she asked the station what the circle of swords was it had been a swanship nearly a century ago and all but one member of the crew had passed into the fermata on it swan to dragon she said to the tiny ship which was one of the stations shuttles swan to dragon please come back after a heartstopping moment dragon replied ah swan swan could have said what do you think youre doing but they both knew that instead she asked why now and not tomorrow or the day before why this day of all days after a century of waiting you are as tactful as ever dragon said even about the matter of my cowardice please dragon dragons voice was peculiarly meditative your symphony reminds me of my duty swan i came here a long time ago on the circle of swords it was one of the proudest warships ofwell the nation has since passed into anarchy i was the only soldier too afraid of my fate to swear the sacred oath to sing always against the coming silence as punishment they left me here to contemplate my failure forever separated from my comrades dragon swan said theyre long gone now what good will it do them at this end of time for you to die the concert teaches that the fermata is our greatest form of immortality dead is dead swan said at this end of time what is the hurry the door whisked open swan looked away from the ships image and met tigers curious eyes damn zhien tiger said respectfully so you found the courage after all thats not it swan said the symphony wasnt supposed to be about the glory of death loftily tiger said oh id never perform suicide art theres nothing pretty about death you learn that in battle after a silence dragon said what did you intend then swan the question brought her up short she had been so absorbed in attempting to convey the swanships grandeur that she had forgotten that real people passed into the fermata to send their souls to the end of time ill change my music she said ill delete it all if i have to please dont dragon said i would miss it greatly a faint swelling of melody his ship was playing back one of her first stumbling efforts youll miss it forever if you keep going a bargain then dragon said i was never an artist only a soldier but a hundred years here have taught me the value of art dont destroy your music and ill come back swans eyes prickled all right tiger and swan watched as dragons ship decelerated then reversed its course returning to the station youve sacrificed your freedom to bring him back you know tiger said if you finish your symphony now it will lack conviction anyone with half an ear will be able to tell i would rather have dragons life than write a masterpiece swan said youre a fool cygnet only then did swan realize that in her alarm over the situation she had completely forgotten the theme she had meant to record dragon helped swan move the keyboard out of the observation room and into the rock garden im glad youre not giving up your music he remarked she looked at him really looked at him thinking of how she had almost lost a friend im not writing the symphony she said he blinked im still writing music swan assured him just not the captains symphony because you were right its impossible at least what i envisioned is impossible if i dwell upon the impossible i achieve nothing but if i do what i can where i cani might get somewhere she wasnt referring to freedom from the swanwatch dragon nodded i think i see and swan he hesitated thank you its been a long day she said you should rest like tortoise he chuckled perhaps i will he ran one hand along the keyboard in a flurry of notes then he sat on one of the gardens benches and closed his eyes humming idly swan studied dragons calm face then she stood at the keyboard and played several tentative notes a song for dragon and phoenix and tiger a song for the living spirey and the queen alastair reynolds alastair reynolds is the author of eight novels and about thirty short stories his fiction frequently shares the setting of his novel revelation space his stories have appeared mostly in the british magazine interzone but also in several anthologies such as the new space opera eclipse two one million a d and constellations he is a winner of the british science fiction award and his work has often been reprinted in the various bestoftheyear annuals in his collection zima blue and other stories reynolds says that spirey and the queen was a pig to write and that it was a relief to get it out of his system the motor of plot only kicked in when i started looking at the story in thriller terms spies defectors that kind of thing he said and added that he always had the vague intention of returning to the milieu someday if only to find out what happens after the last line of the story space war is godawful slow mousers longrange sensors had sniffed the bogey two days ago but it had taken all that time just to creep within killrange i figured it had to be another dud with ordnance fuel and morale all low we were ready to slink back to tigers eye anyway let one of the other thickships pick up the sweep in this sector sostill groggy after frogsleepi wasnt exactly wetting myself with excitement not even when mouser started spiking the thick with combatreadiness psychogens even when we went to attackconone all i did was pause the neurodisney i was tripping hellcats of solar war three since you asked slough my hammock and swim languidly up to the bridge junk i said looking over yarrows shoulder at the readout war debris or another of those pisspoor chondrites betcha sorry kid everything checks out hostiles nope positive on the exhaust dead ringer for the stolen ship she traced a webbed hand across the swathe of decorations that already curled around her neck want your stripes now or when we get back you actually think thisll net us a pair of tigers damn right it will i nodded and thought she isnt necessarily wrong no defector no stolen military secrets reaching the royalists ought to be worth a medal maybe even a promotion so why did i feel something wasnt right all right i said hoping to drown qualms in routine how soon missiles are already away but shes five lightminutes from us so the quacks wont reach her for six hours longer if she makes a run for cover run for cover thats a joke yeah hilarious yarrow swelled one of the holographic displays until it hovered between us it was a map of the swirl tinted to show zones controlled by us or the royalists an enormous slowly rotating disk of primordial material au edge to edge wide enough that light took more than four days to traverse it most of the action was near the middle in the lighthour of space around the central star fomalhaut immediately around the sun was a materialfree void that we called the inner clearing zone but beyond that began the swirl proper metalrich lanes of dust condensing slowly into rocky planets both sides wanted absolute control of those planetforming feeding zonesprime real estate for the day when one side beat the other and could recommence mining operationsso that was where our vast armies of wasps mainly slugged things out we humansroyalist and standardist bothkept much further out where the swirl thinned to metaldepleted icy rubble even hunting the defector hadnt taken us within ten lighthours of the feeding zones and wed become used to having a lot of empty space to ourselves apart from the defector there shouldnt have been anything else out here to offer cover but there was big too not much more than a half lightminute from the rat practically pissing distance yarrow observed too close for coincidence what is it splinter icy planetesimal you want to get technical not this early in the day but i remembered how one of our tutors back at the academy put it splinters are icy slag spat out of the swirl in a few hundred thousand years therell be a baby solar system around fomalhaut but therell also be shitloads of junk surrounding it leftovers on millionyear orbits worthless to us yarrow said scratching at the ribbon of black hair that ran all the way from her brow to fluke but evidently not too ratty what if the royalists left supplies on the splinter she could be aiming to refuel before the final hop to their side of the swirl yarrow gave me her best withering look yeah okay i said not my smartest ever suggestion yarrow nodded sagely ours is not to question spirey ours is to fire and forget six hours after the quackheads had been launched from mouser yarrow floated in the bridge fluked tail coiled beneath her she resembled an inverted question mark and if id been superstitious id have said that wasnt necessarily the best of omens you kill me she said an older pilot called quillin had been the first to go sirenfirst to swap legs for tail yarrow followed a year later admittedly it made sense an adaptation to the fluidfilled environment of a highgee thickship and i accepted the cardiovascular modifications that enabled us to breathe thick as well as the biomodified skin which let us tolerate cold and vacuum far longer than any unmodified human not to mention the billions of moleculesized demons that coursed through our bodies or the combatspecific psychomodifications but swapping your legs for a tail touched off too many queasy resonances in me had to admire her nerve though what i said that neurodisney shit isnt a real space war good enough for you yeah except i dont think this is it when was the last time one of us actually looked a royalist in the eye she shrugged something like four hundred years point made at least in solar war three you get some blood see its all set on planetary surfacestitan europa all those moons theyve got back in sol system trench warfare handtohand stuff you know what adrenalin is yarrow managed without it until now and theres another thing dont know much about greater earth history but there was never a solar war three its conjectural i said and in any case it almost happened they almost went to the brink almost its set in a different timeline she grinned shaking her head im telling you you kill me she made a move yet i asked what the defector oh were back in reality now yarrow laughed sorry this is going to be slightly less exciting than solar war three inconsiderate i said think the bitch would give us a run for our money and as i spoke the weapons readout began to pulse faster and faster like the cardiogram of a fluttering heart how long now one minute give or take a few seconds want a little bet yarrow grinned sallow in the red alert lighting as if id say no spirey so we hammered out a wager yarrow betting fifty tigertokens the rat would attempt some lastminute evasion wont do her a blind bit of good she said but that wont stop her its human nature me i suspected our target was either dead or asleep bit of an empty ritual isnt it what i mean the attack happened the best part of five minutes ago realtime the rats already dead and nothing we can do can influence that outcome yarrow bit on a nicotine stick dont get all philosophical on me spirey wouldnt dream of it how long five seconds four she was somewhere between three and four when it happened i remember thinking that there was something disdainful about the rats actions she had deliberately waited until the last possible moment and had dispensed with our threat with the least effort possible that was how it felt anyway nine of the quackheads detonated prematurely far short of killrange for a moment the tenth remained zeroing in on the defectorbut instead it failed to detonate until it was just beyond range for long moments there was silence while we absorbed what had happened yarrow broke it eventually guess i just made myself some money she said colonel wendigos hologram delegate appeared momentarily frozen before shivering to life with her tooclear tooyoung eyes she fixed first yarrow and then me intelligence was mistaken she said seems the defector doctored records to conceal the theft of those countermeasures but you harmed her anyway just said yarrow her quackdrives spewing out exotics like spirey after a bad binge no hull damage but assessment making a run for the splinter wendigo nodded and then shell set down and make repairs yarrow paused added radar says theres metal on the surface mustve been a wasp battle there before the splinter got lobbed out of the swirl the delegate nodded in my direction concur spirey yes sir i said trying to suppress the nervousness i always felt around wendigo even though almost all my dealings with her had been via simulations like this yarrow was happy to edit the conversation afterward inserting the correct honorifics before transmitting the result back to tigers eyebut i could never free myself of the suspicion that wendigo would somehow unravel the unedited version with all its implicit insubordination not that any of us didnt inwardly accord wendigo all the respect she was due shed nearly died in the royalist strike against tigers eye fifteen years agothe one in which my mother was killed actual attacks against our two mutually opposed comet bases were rare not happening much more than every other generationmore gestures of spite than anything else but this had been an especially bloody one killing an eighth of our number and opening citysized portions of our base to vacuum wendigo was caught in the thick of the kinetic attack now she was chimeric lashed together by cybernetics not much of this showed externallyexcept that the healed parts of her were too flawless more porcelain than flesh wendigo had not allowed the surgeons to regrow her arms story was she lost them trying to pull one of the injured through an open airlock back into the pressurized zone shed almost made it fighting against the gale of escaping air then some nobrainer hit the emergency door control and when the lock shut it took wendigos arms off at the shoulder along with the head of the person she was saving she wore prosthetics now gauntleted in chrome shell get there a day ahead of us i said even if we pull twenty gees and probably gone to ground by the time you get there too should we try a live capture yarrow backed me up with a nod its not exactly been possible before the delegate bided her time before answering admire your dedication she said after a suitably convincing pause but youd only be postponing a death sentence kinder to kill her now dont you think mouser entered killrange nineteen hours later a wide pseudoorbit three thousand klicks out the splinterseventeen by twelve klicks acrosswas far too small to be seen as anything other than a twinkling speck like a grain of sugar at arms length but everything we wanted to know was clear topology gravimetrics and the site of the downed ship that wasnt hard quite apart from the fact that it hadnt buried itself completely it was hot as hell doesnt look like the kind of touchdown you walk away from yarrow said think they ejected no way yarrow sketched a finger through a holographic enlargement of the ship roughly coneshaped vaguely streamlined just like our own thickship to punch through the swirls thickest gas belts clock those dorsal hatches evac pods still in place she was right the pods could have flung them clear before the crash but evidently they hadnt had time to bail out the ensuing impacteven cushioned by the ships manifold of thickprobably hadnt been survivable but there was no point taking chances quackheads would have finished the job but wed used up our stock mouser carried a particle beam battery but wed have to move uncomfortably close to the splinter before using it what remained were the molemines and they should have been perfectly adequate we dropped fifteen of them embedded in a cloud of two hundred identical decoys three of the fifteen were designated to dust the wreck while the remaining twelve would bury deeper into the splinter and attempt to shatter it completely that at least was the idea it all happened very quickly not in the dreamy slowmotion of a neurodisney one instant the molemines were descending toward the splinter and then the next instant they werent there spacing the two instants had been an almost subliminally brief flash starting to get sick of this yarrow said mouser digested what had happened nothing had emanated from the wreck instead thered been a single pulse of energy seemingly from the entire volume of space around the splinter particle weapons mouser diagnosed probably singleuse drones each tinier than a pebble but numbering hundreds or even thousands the defector must have sown them on her approach but she hadnt touched us it was a warning i said telling us to back off i dont think so what i think the warnings on its way i stared at her blankly for a moment before registering what she had already seen arcing from the splinter was something too fast to stop something against which our minimally armored thickship had no defense not even the option of flight yarrow started to mouth some exotic profanity shed reserved for precisely this moment there was an eardrumpunishing bang and mouser shudderedbut we werent suddenly chewing vacuum and that was very bad news indeed antiship missiles come in two main flavors quackheads and sporeheads you know which immediately after the weapon has hit if youre still thinkingif you still existchances are its a sporehead and at that point your problems are just beginning invasive demon attack mouser shrieked breather manifold compromised which meant something uninvited was in the thick that was the point of a sporehead to deliver hostile demons into an enemy ship mm yarrow said i think it might be time to suit up except our suits were a good minutes swim away into the bowels of mouser through twisty ducts that might skirt the infection site having no choice we swam anyway yarrow insisting i take the lead even though she was a quicker swimmer and somewhereits impossible to know exactly wheredemons reached us seeping invisibly into our bodies via the thick i couldnt pinpoint the moment it wasnt as if there was a jagged transition between lucidity and demonmanipulated irrationality yarrow and i were terrified enough as it was all i know is it began with a mild agoraphilia an urge to escape mousers flooded confines gradually it phased into claustrophobia and then became fully fledged panic making mouser seem as malevolent as a haunted house yarrow ignored her suit clawing the hull until her fingers spooled blood fight it i said its just demons triggering our fear centers trying to drive us out of course knowing so didnt help somehow i stayed still long enough for my suit to slither on once sealed i purged the tainted thick with the suits own supplybut i knew it wasnt going to help much the phobia already showed that hostile demons had reached my brain and now it was even draping itself in a flimsy logic beyond the ship wed be able to think rationally it would only take a few minutes for the thicks own demons to neutralize the invaderand then wed be able to reboard complete delusion of course but that was the point when something like coherent thought returned i was outside nothing but me and the splinter the urge to escape was only a background anxiety a flock of stomach butterflies urging me against returning was that demonmanipulated fear or pure common sense i couldnt tellbut what i knew was that the splinter seemed to be beckoning me forward and i didnt feel like resisting sensible surely wed exhausted all conventional channels of attack against the defector and now all that remained was to confront her on the territory shed staked as her own but where was yarrow suits alarm chimed maybe demons were still subjugating my emotions because i didnt react with my normal speed i just blinked licked my lips and stifled a yawn yeah what suit informed me something massing slightly less than me two klicks closer to the splinter on a slightly different orbit i knew it was yarrow also that something was wrong she was drifting in my blackout id undoubtedly programmed suit to take me down but yarrow appeared not to have done anything except bail out i jetted closer and then saw why she hadnt programmed her suit would have been tricky she wasnt wearing one i hit ice an hour later cradling yarrowshe wasnt much of a burden in the splinters weak gravityi took stock i wasnt ready to mourn her not just yet if i could quickly get her to the medical suite aboard the defectors ship there was a good chance of revival but where the hell was the wreck squandering its last reserves of fuel suit had deposited us in a clearing among the graveyard of ruined wasps halfsubmerged in ice they looked like scorched scrapiron sculptures phantoms from an entomologists worst nightmare so thered been a battle here back when the splinter was just another drifting lump of ice even if the thing was seamed with silicates or organics it would not have had any commercial potential to either side but it might still have had strategic value and that was why the wasps had gone to war on its surface trouble wasas wed known before the attackthe corpses covered the entire surface so there was no guessing where wed come down the wrecked ship might be just over the nearest hillockor another ten kilometers in any direction i felt the ground rumble under me hunting for the source of the vibration i saw a quill of vapor reach into the sky no more than a klick away it was a geyser of superheated ice i dropped yarrow and hit dirt suit limiting motion so that i didnt bounce looking back i expected to see a dimple in the permafrost where some rogue had impacted instead the geyser was still present worse it was coming steadily closer etching a neat trench a beam weapon was making that plume i realizedlike one of the party batteries aboard ship then i wised up that was mouser the demons had worked their way into its command infrastructure reprogramming it to turn against us now mouser worked for the defector i slung yarrow over one shoulder and loped away from the boiling impact point fast as the geyser moved its path was predictable if i made enough lateral distance the deathline would sear past except the damn thing turned to follow me now a second flanked it shepherding me through the thickest zone of wasp corpses did they have some significance for the defector maybe so but i couldnt see it the corpses were a rough mix of machines from both sides royalist wasps marked with yellow shell symbols ours with grinning tigerheads generation thirtyfive units if i remembered milhist when both sides toyed with pulsehardened optical thinkware in the seventyodd subsequent generations thered been numerous further jumps urquantum logics fullspectrum reflective wasp armor chameleoflage quackdrive powerplants and every weapon system the human mind could devise wed tried to encourage the wasps to make these innovations for themselves but they never managed to evolve beyond strictly linear extrapolation which was good or else we human observers would have been out of a job not that it really mattered now a third geyser had erupted behind me and a fourth ahead boxing me in slowly the four points of fire began to converge i stopped but kept holding yarrow i listened to my own breathing harsh above the basso tremor of the drumming ground then steel gripped my shoulder she said wed be safer underground also that she had friends below who might be able to do something for yarrow if you werent defecting i began as we entered a roughly hewn tunnel into the splinters crust what the hell was it trying to get home least that was the idea until we realized tigers eye didnt want us back wendigo knuckled the ice with one of her steel fists her suit cut away to expose her prosthetics which is when we decided to head here you almost made it i said then added where were you trying to get home from isnt it obvious then you did defect we were trying to make contact with the royalists trying to make peace in the increasingly dim light i saw her shrug it was a long shot conducted in secrecy when the mission went wrong it was easy for tigers eye to say wed been defecting bullshit i wish but you sent us not in person but your delegate is just software it could be made to say anything my enemies chose even to order my own execution as a traitor we paused to switch on our suit lamps maybe youd better tell me everything gladly wendigo said but if this hasnt been a good day so far im afraid its about to go downhill there had been a clique of highranking officers who believed that the swirl war was intrinsically unwinnable privy to information not released to the populace and able to see through tigers eyes own carefully filtered internal propaganda they realized that negotiationcontactwas the only way out of course not everyone agreed some of my adversaries wanted us dead before we even reached the enemy wendigo sighed too much in love with the wars stabilityand who can blame them life for the average citizen in tigers eye isnt that bad were given a clear goal to fight for and the likelihood of any one of us dying in a royalist attack is small enough to ignore the idea that all of that might be about to end after four hundred years that we all might have to rethink our roles well it didnt go down too well about as welcome as a fart in a vacsuit right wendigo nodded i think you understand go on her expeditionwendigo and two pilotshad crossed the swirl unchallenged approaching the royalist cometary base they had expected to be questionedperhaps even fired uponbut nothing had happened when they entered the stronghold they understood why deserted wendigo said or we thought so until we found the royalists she expectorated the word feral practically naked grubby subhumans their wasps feed them and treat their illnesses but thats as far as it goes they grunt and theyve been toilettrained but theyre not quite the military geniuses weve been led to believe then the war is nothing we thought wendigo laughed but the confines of her helmet rendered it more like the squawking of a jackinthebox and now you wonder why home didnt want us coming back before wendigo could explain further we reached a wider bisecting tunnel glowing with its own insipid chlorinecolored light rather than the meandering bore of the tunnel in which we walked it was as cleanly cut as a rifle barrel in one direction the tunnel was blocked by a bulletnosed cylinder closely modeled on the trains in tigers eye seemingly of its own volition the train lit up and edged forward a door puckering open get in wendigo said and lose the helmet you wont need it where were going inside i coughed phlegmy ropes of thick from my lungs transitioning between breathing modes isnt pleasantmore so since id breathed nothing but thick for six weeks but after a few lungfuls of the trains antiseptic air the dark blotches around my vision began to recede wendigo did likewise only with more dignity yarrow lay on one of the couches stiff as a statue carved in soap her skin was cyanotic a single allenveloping bruise pilot skin is a better vacuum barrier than the usual stuff and vacuum itself is a far better insulator against heat loss than air but where id lifted her my gloves had embossed fingerprints into her flesh worse was the broad stripe of ruined skin down her back and the left side of her tail where she had lain against the splinters surface but her head looked better when she hit vac biomodified seals would have shut within her skull barricading every possible avenue for pressure moisture or blood loss even her eyelids would have fused tight implanted glands in her carotid artery would have released droves of friendly demons quickly replicating via nonessential tissue in order to weave a protective scaffold through her brain good for an hour or somaybe longer but only if the hostile demons hadnt screwed with yarrows native ones you were about to tell me about the wasps i said as curious to hear the rest of wendigos story as i was to blank my doubts about yarrow well its rather simple they got smart the wasps she clicked the steel fingers of her hand overnight just over a hundred years ago i tried not to look too overwhelmed intriguing as all this was i wasnt treating it as anything other than an outlandish attempt to distract me from the main reason for my being here which remained killing the defector wendigos story explained some of the anomalies wed so far encounteredbut that didnt rule out a dozen more plausible explanations meanwhile it was amusing to try and catch her out so they got smart i said you mean our wasps or theirs doesnt mean a damn anymore maybe it just happened to one machine in the swirl and then spread like wildfire to all the trillions of other wasps or maybe it happened simultaneously in response to some stimulus we cant even guess at want to hazard a guess i dont think its important spirey she sounded as though she wanted to put a lot of distance between herself and this topic point is it happened afterward distinctions between us and the enemyat least from the point of view of the waspscompletely vanished workers of the swirl unite something like that and you understand why they kept it to themselves dont you i nodded more to keep her talking they needed us of course they still lacked something creativity i guess youd call it they could evolve themselves incrementally but they couldnt make the kind of sweeping evolutionary jumps wed been feeding them so we had to keep thinking there was a war on wendigo looked pleased right wed keep supplying them with innovations and theyd keep pretending to do each other in she halted scratching at the unwrinkled skin around one eye with the alloy finger of one hand clever little bastards wed arrived somewhere it was a chamber large as any enclosed space id ever seen i felt gravity too much of the stuff the whole chamber must have been gimbaled and spun within the splinter like one of the geeload simulators back in tigers eye the vaulted ceiling hundreds of meters above now seemed vertiginously higher apart from its apex it was covered in intricate frescosdozens of pictorial facets each a cycling hologram they told the history of the swirl beginning with its condensation from interstellar gas the ignition of its star the onset of planetary formation then the action cut to the arrival of the first standardist wasp programmed to dive into the swirl and breed like a rabbit so that one day thered be a sufficiently huge population to begin mining the thing winnowing out metals silicates and precious organics for the folks back home of course it never happened like that the royalists wanted in on the action so they sent their own wasps programmed to attack ours the rest is history the frescos showed the wars beginning and then a little while later the arrival of the first human observers beamed across space as pure genetic data destined to be born in artificial wombs in hollowed out cometcores raised and educated by wasps imprinted with the best tactical and strategic knowledge available thereafter they taught the wasps from then on things heated up because the observers werent limited by years of timelag they were able to intervene in wasp evolution in realtime that ought to have been it because by then we were pretty uptodate give or take four hundred years of the same but the frescos carried on there was one representing some future state of the swirl neatly ordered into a ticking orrery of variously sized and patterned worlds some with beautiful rings or moon systems and finallylike medieval conceptions of edenthere was a triptych of lush planetary landscapes with weird animals in the foreground mountains and soaring cloudbanks behind seen enough to convince you wendigo asked no i said not entirely sure whether i believed myself craning my neck i looked up toward the apex something hung from it it was a pair of wasps fused together one was complete the other was only fully formed seemingly in the process of splitting from the complete wasp the fused pair looked to have been smothered in molten bronze left to dry in waxy nodules you know what this is wendigo asked im waiting wasp art i looked at her this wasp was destroyed midreplication wendigo continued while it was giving birth evidently the image has some poignancy for them how id put it in human terms i dont know dont even think about it i followed her across the marbled terrazzo that floored the chamber arched porticos surrounded it each of which held a single dead wasp their body designs covering a hundred generations of evolution if wendigo was right i supposed these dead wasps were the equivalent of venerated old ancestors peering from oil paintings but i wasnt convinced just yet you knew this place existed she nodded or else wed be dead the wasps back in the royalist stronghold told us we could seek sanctuary here if home turned against us and the waspswhat own this place and hundreds like it although the others are already far beyond the swirl on their way out to the halo since the wasps came to consciousness most of the splinters flung out of the swirl have been infiltrated shrewd of themall along weve never suspected that the splinters are anything other than cosmic trash nice décor anyway florentine wendigo said nodding the frescos are in the style of a painter called masaccio one of brunelleschis disciples remember the wasps had access to all the cultural data we brought with us from geevery byte of it thats how they work i thinkby constructing things according to arbitrary existing templates and theres a point to all this ive been here precisely one day longer than you spirey but you said you had friends here people who could help yarrow theyre here all right wendigo said shaking her head just hope youre ready for them on some unspoken cue they emerged spilling from a door which until then id mistaken for one of the surrounding porticos i flinched acting on years of training although wasps have never intentionally harmed a human beingeven the enemys waspstheyre nonetheless powerful dangerous machines there were twelve of them divided equally between standardist and royalist units sixlegged their twometerlong segmented alloy bodies sprouted weapons sensors and specialized manipulators so far so familiar except that the way the wasps moved was subtly wrong it was as if the machines choreographed themselves their bodies defining the extremities of a much larger form which i sensed more than saw the twelve whisked across the floor they areor rather it isa queen wendigo said from what ive gathered theres one queen for every splinter splinterqueens i call them the swarm partially surrounded us nowbut retained the brooding sense of oneness she told you all this her demons did yes wendigo tapped the side of her head i got a dose after our ship crashed you got one after we hit your ship it was a standard sporehead from our arsenal but the splinterqueen loaded it with her own demons for the moment thats how she speaks to usvia symbols woven by demons take your word for it wendigo shrugged no need to and suddenly i knew it was like eavesdropping a topologists fever dreamonly much stranger the burst of queens speech couldnt have lasted more than a tenth of a second but its afterimages seemed to persist much longer and i had the start of a migraine before it had ended but like wendigo had implied before i sensed planningthat every thought was merely a step toward some distant goal the way each statement in a mathematical proof implies some final qed something big indeed you deal with that shit my chimeric parts must filter a lot and she understands you we get by good i said then ask her about yarrow wendigo nodded and closed both eyes entering intense rapport with the queen what followed happened quickly six of her components detached from the extended form and swarmed into the train we had just exited a moment later they emerged with yarrow elevated on a loom formed from dozens of wasp manipulators what happens now theyll establish a physical connection to her neural demons wendigo said so that they can map the damage one of the six reared up and gently positioned its blunt anvilshaped head directly above yarrows frostmottled scalp then the wasp made eight nodding movements so quickly that the motion was only a series of punctuated blurs looking down i saw eight bloodless puncture marks on yarrows head another wasp replaced the driller and repeated the procedure executing its own blurlike nods this time glistening fibers trailed from yarrows eight puncture points into the wasp which looked as if it was sucking spaghetti from my compatriots skull long minutes of silence followed while i waited for some kind of report it isnt good wendigo said eventually show me and i got a jolt of queens speech feeling myself inside yarrows hermetically sealed head feeling the chill that had embraced her brain core despite her pilot augs i sensed the two intermingled looms of native and foreign demons webbing the shattered matrix of her consciousness i also sensedwhat doubt shes pretty far gone spirey tell the queen to do what she can oh she will now that shes glimpsed yarrows mind shell do all she can not to lose it minds mean a lot to herparticularly in view of what the splinterqueens have in mind for the future but dont expect miracles why not we seem to be standing in one then youre prepared to believe some of what ive said what it means i started to say but i didnt finish the sentence as i was speaking the whole chamber shook violently almost dashing us off our feet what was that wendigos eyes glazed again briefly your ship she said it just selfdestructed what a picture of what remained of mouser formed in my head a dulling nebula embedding the splinter the order to selfdestruct came from tigers eye wendigo said it cut straight to the ships quackdrive subsystems at a level the demons couldnt rescind i imagine they were rather hoping youd have landed by the time the order arrived the blast would have destroyed the splinter youre saying home just tried to kill us put it like this wendigo said now might not be a bad time to rethink your loyalties tigers eye had failed this timebut they wouldnt stop there in three hours theyd learn of their mistake and three or more hours after that we would learn of their countermove whatever it happened to be shell do something wont she i mean the wasps wouldnt go to the trouble of building this place only to have tigers eye wipe it out not much she can do wendigo said after communing with the queen if home chooses to use kinetics against usand theyre the only weapon which could hit us from so farthen there really is no possible defense and remember there are a hundred other worlds like this in or on their way to the halo losing one would make very little difference something in me snapped do you have to sound so damned indifferent to it all here we are talking about how were likely to be dead in a few hours and youre acting like its only a minor inconvenience i fought to keep the edge of hysteria out of my voice how do you know so much anyway youre mighty well informed for someone whos only been here a day wendigo she regarded me for a moment almost blanching under the slap of insubordination then wendigo nodded without anger yes youre right to ask how i know so much you cant have failed to notice how hard we crashed my pilots took the worst they died hesitation one at leastsorrel but the other quillin wasnt in the ship when the wasps pulled me out of the wreckage at the time i assumed theyd already retrieved her doesnt look that way no it doesnt and she paused then shook her head quillin was why we crashed she tried to gain control to stop us landing again wendigo trailed off as if unsure how far to commit herself i think quillin was a plant put aboard by those who disagreed with the peace initiative shed been primedaltered psychologically to reject any royalist peace overtures she was born like thatwith a stick up her ass shes dead im sure of it wendigo almost sounded glad still you made it just spirey im the humpty who fell off the wall twice this time they couldnt find all the pieces the splinterqueen pumped me full of demonsgallons of them theyre all thats holding me together but i dont think they can keep it up forever when i speak to you at least some of what you hear is the splinterqueen herself im not really sure where you draw the line i let that sink in then said about your ship repair systems would have booted when you hit any idea when shell fly again another day day and a half too damn long just being realistic if theres a way to get off the splinter within the next six hours ship isnt it i wasnt giving up so easily what if wasps help they could supply materials should speed things again that glazed look all right she said its done but im afraid wasp assistance wont make enough difference were still looking at twelve hours so i wont start any long disneys i shrugged and maybe we can hold out until then she looked unconvinced so i said tell me the rest everything you know about this place why for starters why wendigo i dont have the faintest damn idea what any of us are doing here all i do know is that in six hours i could be suffering from acute existence failure when that happens id be happier knowing what was so important i had to die for it wendigo looked toward yarrow still nursed by the detached elements of the queen i dont think our being here will help her she said in which case maybe i should show you something a neargrin appeared on wendigos face after all it isnt as if we dont have time to kill so we rode the train again this time burrowing deeper into the splinter this place wendigo said and the hundred others already beyond the swirland the hundreds thousands more that will followare arks theyre carrying life into the halo the cloud of leftover material around the swirl colonization right not quite when the times right the splinters will return to the swirl only there wont be one anymore therell be a solar system fully formed when the colonization does begin it will be of new worlds around fomalhaut seeded from the lifetemplates held in the splinters i raised a hand i was following you there until you mentioned lifetemplates patience spirey wendigos timing couldnt have been better because at that moment light flooded the trains brushedsteel interior the tunnel had become a glass tube anchored to one wall of a vast cavern suffused in emerald light the far wall was tiered draping rafts of foliage our wall was steep and forested oddly curved waterfalls draining into stepped pools the waterfalls were bent away from true vertical by coriolis force evidence thatjust like the first chamberthis entire space was independently spinning within the splinter the stepped pools were surrounded by patches of grass peppered with moving forms that might have been naked people there were wasps as welltending the people as the people grew clearer i had that flinch you get when your gaze strays onto someone with a shocking disfigurement roughly half of them were males imported royalists wendigo said remember i said theyd turned feral seems there was an accident not long after the wasps made the jump to sentience a rogue demon or something decimated them they have both sexes youll get used to it spireyconceptually anyway tigers eye wasnt always exclusively female you know that it was just something we evolved into began with you pilots matter of fact fem physiology made sense for pilotswomen were smaller had better geeload tolerance better stress psychodynamics and required fewer consumables than males we were products of bioengineering from the outset so it wasnt hard to make the jump to an allfem culture makes me want to i dont know i forced my gaze away from the royalists puke or something its like going back to having hair all over your body thats because you grew up with something different did they always have two sexes probably not what i do know is that the wasps bred from the survivors but something wasnt right apart from the reversion to dimorphism the children didnt grow up normally some part of their brains hadnt developed right meaning what theyre morons the wasps keep trying to fix things of course thats why the splinterqueen will do everything to help yarrowand us of course if she can study or even capture our thought patternsand the demons make that possiblemaybe she can use them to imprint consciousness back onto the royalists like the florentine architecture i said they copied right that was one template and yarrows mind will be another thats supposed to cheer me up look on the bright side a while from now there might be a whole generation of people who think along lines laid down by yarrow scary thought then wondered why i was able to crack a joke with destruction looming so close in the future listen i still dont get it what makes them want to bring life to the swirl it seems to boil down to two imperatives i suppose youd call them the firsts simple enough when wasps were first opening up greater earths solar system back in the midtwentyfirst century we sought the best way for them to function in large numbers without supervision we studied insect colonies and imprinted the most useful rules straight into the wasps programming more than six hundred years later those rules have percolated to the top now the wasps arent content merely to organize themselves along patterns derived from living prototypes now they want to becomeor at least give rise toliving forms of their own life envy or something very like it i thought about what wendigo had told me then said what about the second imperative trickier much trickier she looked at me hard as if debating whether to broach whatever subject was on her mind spirey what do you know about solar war three the wasps had given up on yarrow while we traveled they had left her on a corniced plinth in the middle of the terrazzo poised on her back arms folded across her chest tail and fluke draping asymmetrically over one side she didnt necessarily fail spirey wendigo said taking my arm in her own unyielding grip thats only yarrows body after all the queen managed to read her mind there was no opportunity to answer the chamber shook more harshly than when mouser had exploded the vibration keeled us to the floor wendigos metal arms cracking against the tessellated marble as if turning in her sleep yarrow slipped from the plinth home wendigo said raising herself from the floor impossible cant have been more than two hours since mouser was hit there shouldnt be any response for another four they probably decided to attack us regardless of the outcome of their last attempt kinetics you sure theres no defense only good luck the ground lashed at us again but wendigo stayed standing the roar that followed the first impact was subsiding fading into a constant but bearable complaint of tortured ice the first probably only chipped usmaybe gouged a big crater but i doubt that it ruptured any of the pressurized areas next time could be worse and there would be a next time no doubt about it kinetics were the only weapon capable of hitting us at such long range and they did so by sheer force of numbers each kinetic was a speck of iron accelerated to a hairs breadth below the speed of light relativity bequeathed the speck a disproportionate amount of kinetic energyenough that only a few impacts would rip the splinter to shreds of course only one in a thousand of the kinetics they fired at us would hitbut that didnt matter theyd just fire ten thousand wendigo i said can we get to your ship no she said after a moments hesitation we can reach it but it isnt fixed yet doesnt matter well lift on auxiliaries once were clear of the splinter well be safe no good either hulls breacheditll be at least an hour before even part of it can be pressurized and itll take us an hour or so just to get there wont it so why are we waiting sorry spirey but her words were drowned by the arrival of the second kinetic this one seemed to hit harder the impact trailing away into aftergroans the holographic frescos were all dark now thenever so slowlythe ceiling ruptured a huge mandible of ice probing into the chamber wed lost the false gravity now all that remained was the splinters feeble pull dragging us obliquely toward one wall but what i shouted in wendigos direction for a moment she had that absent look which said she was more queen than wendigo then she nodded in reluctant acceptance all right spirey we play it your way not because i think our chances are great just that id rather be doing something amen to that it was uncomfortably dim now much of the illumination having come from the endlessly cycling frescos but it wasnt silent though the groan of the chambers offkilter spin was gone now what remained was almost as bad the agonized shearing of the ice that lay beyond us helped by wasps we made it to the train i carried yarrows corpse but at the door wendigo said leave her no way shes dead spirey everything of her that mattered the splinterqueen already saved you have to accept that it was enough that you brought her here dont you understand carrying her now would only lessen your chancesand that would really have pissed her off some alien part of me allowed the wasps to take the corpse then we were inside helmeted up and breathing thick as the train picked up speed i glanced out the window intent on seeing the queen one last time it should have been too dark but the chamber looked bright for a moment i presumed the frescos had come to life again but then something about the scenes unreal intensity told me the queen was weaving this image in my head she hovered above the debrisstrewn terrazzoexcept that this was more than the queen i had seen before this waswhat how she saw herself ten of her twelve wasp composites were now back together arranged in constantly shifting formation they now seemed more living than machine with diaphanous sunwings chitinblack bodies fursheened limbs and sensors and eyes that were faceted crystalline globes sparkling in the chambers false light that wasnt all before id sensed the queen as something implied by her composites now i didnt need to imagine her like a ghost in which the composites hung she loomed vast in the chamber multiwinged and brooding and then we were gone we sped toward the surface for the next few minutes waiting for the impact of the next kinetic when it hit the trains cushioned ride smothered the concussion for a moment i thought wed made it then the machine began to decelerate slowly to a dead halt wendigo convened with the queen and told me the line was blocked we disembarked into vacuum ahead the tunnel ended in a wall of jumbled ice after a few minutes we found a way through the obstruction wendigo wrenching aside boulders larger than either of us were only half a klick from the surface she said as we emerged into the unblocked tunnel beyond she pointed ahead to what might have been a scotoma of absolute blackness against the milky darkness of the tunnel after that a klick overland to the wreck she paused realize we cant go home spirey now more than ever not exactly spoiled for choice are we no it has to be the halo of course its where the splinters headed anyway just means well get there ahead of schedule there are other splinterqueens out there and at the very least theyll want to keep us alive possibly other humans as wellothers who made the same discovery as us and knew there was no going home not to mention royalists that troubles you doesnt it ill deal with it i said pushing forward the tunnel was nearly horizontal and with the splinters weak gravity it was easy to make the distance to the surface emerging fomalhaut glared down at us a whitecored bloodshot eye surrounded by the wrinklelike dust lanes of the inner swirl limned in red wasp corpses marred the landscape i dont see the ship wendigo pointed to a piece of blank caramelcolored horizon curvatures too great we wont see it until were almost on top of it hope youre right trust me i know this place like well wendigo regarded one of her limbs like the back of my hand encourage me why dont you three or four hundred meters later we crested a scallopshaped rise of ice and halted we could see the ship now it didnt look in much better shape than when yarrow and i had scoped it from mouser i dont see any wasps too dangerous for them to stay on the surface wendigo said thats cheering i hope the remaining damage is cosmetic i said because if it isnt suddenly i wasnt talking to anyone wendigo was gone after a moment i saw her lying in a crumpled heap at the foot of the hillock her guts stretched away like a rusty comettail halfway to the next promontory quillin was fifty meters ahead having risen from the concealment of a chondrite boulder when wendigo had mentioned her id put her out of my mind as any kind of threat how could she pose any danger beyond the inside of a thickship when shed traded her legs for a tail and fluke just like yarrow on dry land shed be no more mobile than a seal pup well that was how id figured things but id reckoned without quillins suit unlike yarrowsunlike any siren suit id ever seenit sprouted legs mechanized they emerged from the hip making no concessions to human anatomy the legs were long enough to lift quillins tail completely free of the ice my gaze tracked up her body registering the crossbow which she held in a doublehanded grip im sorry quillins deep voice boomed in my skull checkins closed wendigo said you might be a problem wise up it was staged from the moment we reached the royalist stronghold still keeping the bow on me she began to lurch across the ice the ferals were actors playing dumb the wasps were programmed to feed us bullshit it isnt a royalist trick quillin shit see im gonna have to kill you as well the ground jarred more violently than before a nimbus of white light puffed above the horizon evidence of an impact on the splinters far side quillin stumbled but her legs corrected the misstep before it tripped her forward i dont know if youre keeping up with current events i said but thats our own side maybe you didnt think hard enough why did wasps in the swirl get smart before the trillions of wasps back in sol system should have been the other way round yeah of course spirey ges wasps had a massive head start she shrugged but the bow stayed rigidly pointed okay war sped up wasp evolution here but that shouldnt have made so much difference thats where the story breaks down not quite what something wendigo told me about what she called the second imperative i guess it wasnt something she found out until she went underground yeah astonish me well something astonished quillin at that pointbut i was only marginally less surprised by it myself an explosion of ice and a mass of swiftly moving metal erupting from the ground around her the wasp corpses were partially dismembered blasted and halfmeltedbut they still managed to drag quillin to the ground for a moment she thrashed kicking up plumes of frost then the whole mass lay deathly still and it was just me the ice and a lot of metal and blood the queen must have coaxed activity out of a few of the wasp corpses ordering them to use their last reserves of power to take out quillin thanks queen but no cigar quillin hadnt necessarily meant to shoot me at that point butbless hershe had anyway the bolt had transected me with the precision of one of the queens theorems somewhere below my sternum gutshot the blood on the ice was my own i tried moving a couple of lightyears away i saw my body undergo a frail little shiver it didnt hurt but there was nothing in the way of proprioceptive feedback to indicate id actually managed to twitch any part of my body quillin was moving too wriggling that is since her suits legs had been cleanly ripped away by the wasps other than that she didnt look seriously injured ten or so meters from me she flopped around like a maggot and groped for her bow what remained of it anyway chalk one to the good guys by which time i was moving executing a marginally quicker version of quillins slug crawl i couldnt stand upthere are limits to what pilot physiology can cope withbut my legs gave me leverage she lacked give up spirey you have a head start on me and right now youre a little fasterbut that ships still a long way off quillin took a moment to catch her breath think you can sustain that pace gonna need to if you dont want me catching up plan on rolling over me until i suffocate thats an option if this doesnt kill you first enough of her remained in my fieldofview to see what she meant something sharp and bladelike had sprung from her wrist a bayonet projecting half a meter ahead of her hand it looked like a nasty little toybut i did my best to push it out of mind and get on with the job of crawling toward the ship it was no more than two hundred meters away nowwhat little of it protruded above the ice the external airlock was already open ready to clamp shut as soon as i wriggled inside you never finished telling me spirey telling you what about thiswhat did you call it the second imperative oh that i halted and snatched breath before i go on i want you to know im only telling you this to piss you off whatever bakes your cake all right i said then ill begin by saying you were right greater earths wasps should have made the jump to sentience long before those in the swirl simply because theyd had longer to evolve and thats what happened quillin coughed like gravel in a bucket pardon they beat us to it about a century and a half ago across sol system within just a few hours every single wasp woke up and announced its intelligence to the nearest human being it could find like babies reaching for the first thing they see i stopped sucking in deep lungfuls the wreck had to be closer nowbut it hardly looked it quillin by contrast looked awfully close nowand that blade awfully sharp so the wasps woke i said damned if she wasnt going to hear the whole story and that got some people scared so much some of them got to attacking the wasps some of their shots went wide because within a day the whole system was one big shooting match not just humans against waspsbut humans against humans less than fifty meters now across much smoother ground than wed so far traversed things just escalated ten days after solar war three began only a few ships and habitats were still transmitting they didnt last long crap quillin saidbut she sounded less cocksure than she had a few moments before there was a war back then but it never escalated into a fullblown solar war no it went the whole hog from then on every signal we ever got from ge was concocted by wasps they dared not break the news to usat least not immediately weve only been allowed to find out because were never going home guilt wendigo called it they couldnt let it happen again what about our wasps isnt it obvious a while later the wasps here made the same jump to sentiencepresumably because theyd been shown the right moves by the others difference was ours kept it quiet cant exactly blame them can you there was nothing from quillin for a while both of us concentrating on the last patch of ice before wendigos ship i suppose you have an explanation for this too she said eventually swiping her tail against the ground cmon blow my mind so i told her what i knew theyre bringing life to the swirl sooner than you think too once this charade of a war is done the wasps breed in earnest trillions out there now but in a few decades itll be billions of trillions theyll outweigh a goodsized planet in a way the swirl will have become sentient itll be directing its own evolution i spared quillin the detailshow the wasps would arrest the existing processes of planetary formation so that they could begin anew only this time according to a plan left to its own devices the swirl would contract down to a solar system comprised solely of small rocky planetsbut such a system could never support life over billions of years instead the wasps would exploit the systems innate chaos to tip it toward a state where it would give rise to at least two much larger worldsplanets as massive as jupiter or saturn capable of shepherding leftover rubble into tidy worldavoiding orbits mass extinctions had no place in the splinterqueens vision of future life but i guessed quillin probably didnt care why are you hurrying spirey she asked between harsh grunts as she propelled herself forward the ship isnt going anywhere the edge of the open airlock was a meter above the ice my fingers probed over the rim followed by the crest of my battered helmet just lifting myself into the locks lit interior seemed to require all the energy id already expended in the crawl somehow i managed to get half my body length into the lock which is when quillin reached me there wasnt much pain when she dug the bayonet into my ankle just a form of cold i hadnt imagined before even lying on the ice quillin jerked the embedded blade to and fro and the knot of cold seemed to reach out little feelers into my foot and lower leg i sensed she wanted to retract the blade for another stab but my suit armor was gripping it tight the bayonet taking her weight quillin pulled herself up to the rim of the lock i tried kicking her away but the skewered leg no longer felt a part of me youre dead she whispered news to me her eyes rolled wide then locked on me with renewed venom she gave the bayonet a violent twist so tell me one thing that storybullshit or what ill tell you i said but first consider this before she could react i reached out and palmed a glowing panel set in the lock wall the panel whisked aside revealing a mushroomshaped red button you know that story they told about wendigo how she lost her arms you werent meant to swallow that hero guff spirey no well get a load of this quillin my hands on the emergency pressurization control when i hit it the outer doors going to slide down quicker than you can blink she looked at my hand then down at her wrist still attached to my ankle via the jammed bayonet slowly the situation sank in close the door spirey and youll be a leg short and you an arm quillin stalemate then not quite see which of us is more likely to survive me inside with all the medical systems aboard this ship or you all on your lonesome outside frankly i dont think its any contest her eyes opened wider quillin gave a shriek of anger and entered one final furious wrestling match with the bayonet i managed to laugh as for your question its true every word of it then with all the calm i could muster i thumbed the control pisser isnt it i made it of course several minutes after the closing of the door demons had lathered a protective cocoon around the stump and stomach wound they allowed me no painonly a fuzzy sense of detachment enough of my mind remained sharp to think about my escapeproblematic given that the ship still wasnt fixed eventually i remembered the evac pods they were made to kick away from the ship fast if some quackdrive system went on the fritz they had thrusters for thatnothing fancy but here theyd serve another purpose theyd boost me from the splinter punch me out of its grav well so i did it snuggled into a pod and blew out of the wreck feeling the geeload even within the thick it didnt last long on the evac pods cam i watched the splinter drop away until it was pebblesized the main body of the kinetic attack was hitting it by then impacts every ten or so seconds after a minute of that the splinter just came apart afterward there was only a sooty veil where it had been and then only the swirl i hoped the queen had made it i guess it was within her power to transmit what counted of herself out to sisters in the halo if so there was a chance for yarrow as well id find out eventually then i used the pods remaining fuel to inject me into a slow elliptical orbit one that would graze the halo in a mere fifty or sixty years that didnt bother me i wanted to close my eyes and let the thick nurse me whole againand sleep an awfully long time pardon our conquest alan dean foster alan dean foster is the bestselling author of several dozen novels and is perhaps most famous for his commonwealth series which began in with the novel midworld the most recent in that series quofum was published in and a new commonwealth book featuring the popular characters pip and flinx flinx transcendent should be out around the same time as this anthology also forthcoming is the human blend the first book of a new sf trilogy for del rey fosters short fiction has appeared in numerous anthologies and in magazines such as the magazine of fantasy science fiction analog and jim baens universe a new collection exceptions to reality came out in like the forthcoming flinx transcendent this story takes place in fosters commonwealth milieu foster said it was inspired by the idea that there are various ways to conquer sometimes simply persuading an opponent that your way is better can achieve the desired end he said i always thought killing an opponent was a poor way of convincing him of the rightness of your argument admiral gorelkii shifted his seat on the meterthick jewelencrusted ceremonial golden cushion that rose behind the sweeping transparent arc of the solid crystal crescent moon and fumed his substantial pale gray bulk was draped in a bloom of multihued embroidered standards each one representing one of the ancient great hordes that together comprised the empire of the three suns they weighed on him physically as well as historically the wearing of the standards was a great honor accorded to a select few only on the most extraordinary occasions unfortunately for him todays extraordinary occasion was one of surrender his courage and willingness in accepting the responsibility for heading the disagreeable negotiations was recognized on all five inhabited worlds of the three systems that comprised the empire that did not mean he looked forward to the impending ceremony what the exact details would consist of he did not know what specific protocol was to be followed he did not know no doubt the conquerors of the empire would be enlightening him in due course the falan had never been a species to hesitate imbued with the heady wine of discovery and an assurance of their own superiority they had looked forward to the steady expansion of their empire in the direction of the arm of the galaxy that held a greater density of star systems than their own immediate vicinity following initial exploration they had discovered explored charted and engaged in the successful colonization of two new habitable systems then they had found drax iv so it was called by the short multilegged hardcarapaced creatures who inhabited the cities and towns they had excavated beneath its jungles and forests mild in temperament absurd in appearance they claimed to be part of a vast interstellar dominion called the commonwealth vast small or imaginary their polite insistence did nothing to deter the aggressive falan it was announced that the system of drax would be incorporated into the empire forthwith and any foolish resistance met with fire and destruction on a planetary scale declaring war the falan proceeded to open hostilities by unleashing a small example of their firepower on a littlepopulated corner of the planet subsequent to this ferocious demonstration the inhabitants requested some time to contemplate their limited alternatives while any military prowess on their part remained undetermined they proved expert in the arts of obfuscation and delay eventually the patience of the falan never extensive to begin with ran out this happened to coincide with the arrival of a fleet of fifty warships which was considerably more than the two dozen or so the empire could muster when informed that this was a scouting force sent to determine the precise nature of the threat that had been levied against drax and that the main armada of the socalled commonwealth had not even been assembled consternation and despair among the falan was followed by reluctant but unavoidable capitulation gorelkii and his frustrated fellow career officers would have preferred to test the strength of the enemy warships in battle as for the claim that they represented only a scouting force such alien assertions could not be verified they might be composed of nothing more than bluster on the part of the inhabitants of drax but gorelkii and his comrades had been overridden by the polity of the three suns whose fear of utter annihilation if hostilities commenced was a realistic extrapolation based on their own fractious racial history the falan must be preserved he had been informed solemnly we will build our strength in secret improve our weapons advance our science in time we will throw off the yoke of the enemy and carry the battle to its homeworlds fifty warships he thought as he sat behind the glittering crescent moon scouting force it was scarce to be believed when queried the inhabitants of drax iv had declined to elaborate on the actual size and extent of their mysterious commonwealth though not looking forward to negotiating the formal terms of surrender gorelkii knew that it would buy the falan time to learn exactly what they were up against learning that they would be able to prepare their inevitable unstoppable response adjutant bardanat entered through the wide arched entrance of rippling metal the muscles of his heavy bipedal form bulged beneath his gleaming uniform and his small black eyes glittered beneath a single thrust of projecting bone one trifingered hand snapped ceilingward in salute his tone was its usual clipped wholly professional self save for what gorelkii took to be a touch of bemusement the diplomatic representatives of the commonwealth are here grand admiral bardanat hesitated and his voice lost some of its formal stress they are they are well pour it out adjutant what are they bardanats fleshy eyefolds contracted in his species equivalent of a blink not what i expected admiral gorelkii snorted through the single large respiratory opening set high in the center of his chest and below his thick neck the nostril was framed by ribbons of valor that had been permanently encased in gleaming protective transparencies the color tint of each transparency indicated the level of accomplishment that accented each ribbon it doesnt matter what you expected or i we must deal with them he gestured with a powerful doublejointed arm admit them he readied himself though his people had been defeated without a shot having been fired a missile being unleashed or an energy beam deployed he would attempt to bargain as an equal the admiral could rant and rave with the most voluble politician he could be outargued but he could not be intimidated it was one of the reasons he had been chosen to head the negotiations it was universally conceded among the polity that no one in the empire was likely to obtain better terms than grand admiral gorelkii steeping to the left adjutant bardanat assumed a position of ready respect legs contracted upper body straight and stiff eyes forward he would hold that position until his muscles screamed for relief or gorelkii directed him to stand down two shapes were approaching from the far end of the formal antechamber walking toward him from the towering main entry arch gorelkii could not keep from tensing what would they demand how would they treat him personally what kind of confrontational species had the resources to send forth a force of fifty warships merely to scout a confrontation when at last the pair finally halted before the curve of the crescent moon he was shocked by their size the spindly bigeyed one he knew from images sent back from drax presently standing on four limbs with another four upraised it inclined feathery antennae in his direction a bright bluegreen in color it looked fragile and harmless though bipedal like the falan the creature standing beside the thranx appeared even less threatening so soft was it that one could actually see bits of its exposed flesh moving after it had come to a stop a strange white growth emerged from the top of its skull and also covered much of the lower half of its face it would take little effort gorelkii thought to crush them both splintering the thranxthing and smashing its taller companion to a pulp should he give in to the natural impulse however he knew it would put something of a damper on the forthcoming negotiations he forced down his instinctive feelings and kept his massive threefingered hands locked together in front of him lumbering forward bardanat checked to make sure the translator positioned in front of his cutting teeth was operational before he began to declaim forcefully without looking to left or right i present to you grand admiral gorelkiivant destroyer of worlds sovereign of the nationclan hasekar supreme commander of the first fleet majestic defender of empire scion of the second sun his soft mouth parting to reveal tiny white teeth behind his own hairthin translation device the whitehaired biped stepped forward and thrust a limb across the crystal arc in gorelkiis direction hi im bill william chenkhamsa but my friends all call me bill gesturing at his hardshelled companion he added thats the eint colvinyarev hes from hivehom and im from earth scuttling sideways adjutant bardanat leaned slightly toward his commander and whispered the extended limb of the human creature grand admiral i believe you are supposed to make contact with the end baffled but adaptive gorelkii reached out with a massive hand unable with his more numerous but much smaller fingers to envelop it all the human creature took two of the three thick proffered fingers and shook them up and down several times releasing its lightweight but assured grasp it then stepped back pleased to meet you admiral gesturing with its head the being indicated gorelkiis expansive torso are those awards on your chest i dont know their individual significance of course but even a visitor like myself can see that theyre very impressive flattery as an opening ploy gorelkii told himself somewhat unexpected given that he was the supine party he would not succumb to it of course still there was no harm in utilizing his personal history to make an impact on this unimposing pair he proceeded to do so when he had finished the thranx dipped its head and antennae low in his direction most impressive i can see that the polity of the three suns chose from among the best of your kind to represent them the polity makes no mistakes gorelkiis voice reverberated through the vaulted effusively decorated audience chamber though we have surrendered to your forces we have not been defeated as no actual combat has taken place we agree absolutely though massing far less than the average falan the humans eyes were the same size the bills were blue a color that fascinated gorelkii all falan eyes were black or shades of very dark gray we consider ourselves fortunate to have escaped your wrath intriguing though the diversion was gorelkii ceased musing on the startlingly bright color of alien eyes excuse me clearly after learning more about you and your kind any conflict between our three species would have resulted in terrible losses on our side we would have been devastated we are so very grateful that you have deigned to refrain from destroying us yes ccrlk folding its forelegs beneath its abdomen the thranx executed a deep bow gratitude compels us to abase ourselves before you what was going on here gorelkii thought confusedly what kind of game were these representatives playing at he bemoaned his ignorance of the culture of the triumphant species he did not know enough to recognize if he was being mocked in the absence of such data he could only improvise his responses yeswell the casualties the combined fleets would have wreaked on your forces would have been terrible truly we are aware the thranx rose out of its forwardinclining stance to regard the admiral with golden compound eyes it is out of this awe and respect that we most cordially invite you to bring the empire of the three suns into the commonwealth ah there it was at last gorelkii told himself with satisfaction couched in respectful almost deferential terms but unmistakable none the less on familiar rhetorical ground once again he immediately challenged you propose to absorb us into your own federation well i can tell you both as an admiral of the falan and as no no youve got it all wrong so absurd a picture did the human present with its waving little arms and wide eyes that gorelkii did not take exception to the clumsy interruption colvinyarev speaks honestly when he says its an invitation if it so wishes the empire can go on its happy way with as little or as much contact with the commonwealth as it desires there is no compulsion to participate of any kind the thranx gestured firstdegree concurrence though the elaborate gesticulations of foothands and truhands meant nothing to the admiral many intelligent species besides our own are members of the commonwealth some in full some only in part the only thing we have in absolute common is sentience several participate actively in decisions of commonwealth policy others tend to their own world or worlds and leave policy making to the rest a small truhand gestured the falan would surely rank among the most impressive species ever to join despite the resolve with which he had determined to enter into the negotiations gorelkii found himself slightly dazed nothing was proceeding as expected he resolved to force matters back onto a familiar keel it is for the polity and not me to consider such topics i sit before you only to settle formal matters of surrender he leaned forward his massive bulk greater than that of human and thranx combined his jet black eyes glittering challengingly first we will dispose of the matter of reparations human and thranx looked at one another what reparations the human turned back to face the admiral a couple of your ships inflicted some minor damage on drax iv nothing that cant be fixed forget about it whats a little petty devastation between friends once again gorelkiis eyepads performed the falan blink no reparations the human showed its teeth again no reparations very well then the admiral drew himself up we will proceed to the highly sensitive matter of disarmament which i assure you the polity will regard with the most this time it was the thranx who broke in you can keep and maintain all of your ships all of them the adjutant blurted all three fleets it was an outrageous breach of protocol but gorelkii could hardly chastise bardanat for speaking out the admiral was equally shocked well of course the human replied cheerfully theyre your ships after all restriction of movement then recovering gorelkii cast a warning look in bardanats direction to remind the adjutant who and where he was no restrictions instead of meeting the admirals eyes the human was leaning forward to examine the arc of the crescent moon this is really beautiful workmanship i cant find a single flaw or inclusion i know that the crafts folk who fashioned it would find ready acceptance on many worlds of the commonwealth as i said theyre your ships gorelkiis thoughts were awhirl commonwealth military garrisons on the five worlds how extensive the human looked again at his thranx companion why would we want to establish a military presence on any of your worlds youre not part of the commonwealth yet anyway but the thranx added we would be flattered if you would situate some of your forcescompletely independent of courseon several of our worlds given the impression the falan have made on the peoples of the commonwealth im certain their presence would be both welcome and admired wait gorelkii struggled to gather himself you want us to establish a military presence on some of your worlds the humans head bobbed lightly up and down would you do us that honor honor no reparations no disarmament everything the two representatives had said so far was suggestive of craven cowardice or gorelkii was a soldier he knew how to fight he even knew how to surrender his long and distinguished career had prepared him for both eventualities but nothing he had experienced or studied had prepared him for negotiations like this i am sure he said quickly that the polity would be most pleased to place representatives of the empires military on as many of your worlds as would be allowed excellent as far as gorelkii could ascertain the humans expression of delight was sincere we would be pleased to engage in cultural and commercial exchanges as well according to whatever procedures and restrictions your government decides to impose yes well as i have already mentioned i am not empowered to negotiate such matters the humans head moved again the white growth covering part of his face bobbing with the movement im positive others can work out the details he looked to his colleague i think thats about it col yes the thranx agreed he eyed the admiral is there anything else you would like to discuss your excellency if you have the time we would be flattered to invite you to a reception to be given aboard our ship currently in stationary orbit above this city you may of course bring with you any relations or friends that you would like as our food synthesizers are programmed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of many species i am sure they can create victuals that you would find of culinary interest srralk gorelkii hesitated the negotiations had gone well no amazingly well far far better than even the most pessimistic member of the polity could have imagined he considered the thranxs offer refusing an invitation might be construed as an affront it would be foolish to risk all that had been attained over such a slight request besides which he could not deny holding a personal interest in learning as much as he could about these obscenely deferential creatures i accept your invitation he indicated the stifflegged bardanat my adjutant will handle the details but i warn you he added the details of these proceedings have been exhaustively recorded by multiple concealed sources any attempt at a future date to alter the terms of surrender will be met with the visitors penchant for interruption struck yet again oh lets not call it that the human insisted surrender is such an unsociable term i believe the official documents to be agreed upon are titled instruments of eternal and lasting friendship between the commonwealth of the humanx and the grand and indivisible empire of the three suns they are already being communicated to your polity for formal final review and execution gorelkii tapped his translator in the course of negotiations he had fully expected to hear the term execution employed but before now and not in relation to bureaucratic formalities we do have one last request the human was eyeing him thoughtfully here it comes gorelkii thought he steeled himself for whatever lastminute ultimate demand might be forthcoming which is raising a spindly arm the whitehaired human pointed at the admiral would you wear that magnificent uniform or whatever you call your current attire when you attend our reception i know that all of our military as well as diplomatic people will be as impressed by it as col and i have been gorelkii found himself gesturing automatically yes yes that can be arranged splendid stepping forward the human extended his arm once more this time gorelkii knew how to respond they shook hands gray enveloping beige as the alien biped retreated his thranx colleague advanced dipped his head and brushed the admirals still extended trio of fingers with his antennae the contact was negligible we are most grateful for your hospitality the hardshell murmured i personally look forward to greeting and entertaining you and your companions on board our vessel gorelkii sat in silence for a long time after the two commonwealth diplomats had departed only an involuntary and irrepressible grunt of pain from bardanat reminded the admiral that his adjutant was still locked in the ritual pose of formal reception straighten he told bardanat gratitude admiral the adjutant was relieved i he hesitated then asked the question that he could not suppress it is not for me to determine but from what i was witness to i am presuming that according to the hopes and expectations of the polity and of your personal self the negotiations went well enough you may presume correctly adjutant gorelkii was gazing down the arched corridor of mortality through which the diplomats had taken their leave theres just one thing of which i remain uncertain bardanat stared back at the grand admiral destroyer of worlds etc what is that excellency gorelkii looked over at him remind me again this war we lostdidnt we symbiont robert silverberg robert silverbergfourtime hugo awardwinner fivetime winner of the nebula award sfwa grand master sf hall of fame honoreeis the author of nearly five hundred short stories nearly hundredandfifty novels and is the editor of in the neighborhood of one hundred anthologies among his most famous works are lord valentines castle and the other books and stories in the majipoor series but all of his classic works are far too numerous to name the idea for symbiontwhich silverberg described in the collected stories of robert silverberg as a somber tale of jungle adventure and diabolical revengecame from a young woman named karen haber that silverberg met while on a book tour she gave him the idea and he worked his magic shortly after the story was finished and appeared in playboy and shortly after that silverberg married ms haber but you shouldnt let that sweet story fool you he wasnt joking when he said this one is diabolical ten years later when i was long out of the service and working the turnaround wheel at betelgeuse station fazio still haunted me not that he was dead other people get haunted by dead men i was haunted by a live one it would have been a lot better for both of us if he had been dead but as far as i knew fazio was still alive hed been haunting me a long while three or four times a year his little dry thin voice would come out of nowhere and id hear him telling me again before we go into that jungle we got to come to an understanding if a synsym nails me chollie you kill me right away hear none of this shit of calling in the paramedics to clean me out you just kill me right away and ill do the same for you is that a deal this was on a planet called weinstein in the servadac system late in the second ovoid war we were twenty years old and we were volunteers two dumb kids playing hero you bet your ass is what i told him not hesitating a second deal absolutely then i gave him a big grin and a handclasp and we headed off together on sporespreading duty at the time i really thought i meant it sometimes i still believe that i did ten years i could still see the two of us back there on weinstein going out to distribute latchenango spores in the enemyheld zone the planet had been grabbed by the ovoids early in the war but we were starting to drive them back from that whole system fazio and i were the entire patrol you get spread pretty thin in galactic warfare but there was plenty of support force behind us in the hills weinstein was strategically important god only knows why two small continentsboth tropical mostly thick jungle air like green soupsurrounded by an enormous turbulent ocean never colonized by earth and of no use that anyone had ever successfully explained to me but the place had once been ours and they had taken it away and we wanted it back the way you got a planet back was to catch a dozen or so ovoids fill them full of latchenango spores and let them return to their base there is no lifeform a latchenango likes better as its host than an ovoid the ovoids being ovoids would usually conceal what had happened to them from their pals who would kill them instantly if they knew they were carrying deadly parasites of course the carriers were going to die anywaylatchenango infestation is invariably fatal to ovoidsbut by the time they did in about six standard weeks the latchenangos had gone through three or four reproductive cycles and the whole army would be infested all we needed to do was wait until all the ovoids were dead and then come in clean the place up and raise the flag again the latchenangos were generally dead too by then since they rarely could find other suitable hosts but even if they werent we didnt worry about it latchenangos dont cause any serious problems for humans about the worst of it is that you usually inhale some spores while youre handling them and it irritates your lungs for a couple of weeks so you do some pretty ugly coughing until youre desporified in return for our latchenangos the ovoids gave us synsyms synsyms were the first things you heard about when you arrived in the war zone and what you heard was horrendous you didnt know how much of it was myth and how much was mere bullshit and how much was truth but even if you discounted seventyfive percent of it the rest was scary enough if you get hit by one the old hands advised us kill yourself fast while you have the chance roving synsym vectors cruised the perimeter of every ovoid camp sniffing for humans they were not parasites but synthetic symbionts when they got into you they stayed there sharing your body with you indefinitely in school they teach you that symbiosis is a mutually beneficial state maybe so but the word that passed through the ranks in the war zone was that it definitely did not improve the quality of your life to take a synsym into your body and though the service medics would spare no effort to see that you survived a synsym attackthey arent allowed to perform mercy killings and wouldnt anywayeverything we heard indicated that you didnt really want to survive one the day fazio and i entered the jungle was like all the others on weinstein dank humid rainy we strapped on our spore tanks and started out using handheld heat piles to burn our way through the curtains of tangled vines the wet spongy soil had a purplish tinge and the lakes were iridescent green from lightning algae heres where well put the hotel landing strip fazio said lightly over here the pool and cabanas the gravitytennis courts here and on the far side of that watch it i said and skewered a lowflying wingfinger with a beam of hot purple light it fell in ashes at our feet another one came by the mate traveling at eye level with its razorsharp beak aimed at my throat but fazio took it out just as neatly we thanked each other wingfingers are elegant things all trajectory and hardly any body mass with scaly silvery skins that shine like the finest grade of moonlight and it is their habit to go straight for the jugular in the most literal sense we killed twelve that day and i hope it is my quota for this lifetime as we advanced into the heart of the jungle we dealt just as efficiently with assorted hostile coilworms eyeflies dingleberries leper bats and other disagreeable local specialties we were a great team quick smart good at protecting each other we were admiring a giant carnivorous fungus a klick and a half deep in the woods when we came upon our first ovoid the fungus was a fleshy phallic red tower three meters high with orange gills equipped with a dozen dangling whiplike arms that had green adhesive knobs at the tips at the ends of most of the arms hung small forest creatures in various stages of digestion as we watched an unoccupied arm rose and shot forth extended itself to three times its resting length and by some neat homing tropism slapped its adhesive knob against a passing manylegger about the size of a cat the beast had no chance to struggle a network of wiry structures sprouted at once from the killer arm and slipped into the victims flesh and that was that we almost applauded lets plant three of them in the hotel garden i said and post a schedule of feeding times itll be a great show for the guests shh fazio said he pointed maybe fifty meters away a solitary ovoid was gliding serenely along a forest path obviously unaware of us i caught my breath everyone knows what ovoids look like but this was the first time i had seen a live one i was surprised at how beautiful it was a tapering cone of firm jelly pale blue streaked with red and gold triple rows of shortstalked eyes along its sides like brass buttons clusters of delicate tendrils sprouting like epaulets around the eating orifice at the top of its head turquoise ribbons of neural conduit winding round and round its equator surrounding the dark heartshaped brain faintly visible within the cloudy depths the enemy i was conditioned to hate it and i did yet i couldnt deny its strange beauty fazio smiled and took aim and put a numbneedle through the ovoids middle it froze instantly in midglide its color deepened to a dusky flush the tiny mouth tendrils fluttered wildly but there was no other motion we jogged up to it and i slipped the tip of my spore distributor about five centimeters into its meaty middle let him have it fazio yelled i pumped a couple of ccs of latchenango spores into the paralyzed alien its soft quivering flesh turned blueblack with fear and rage and god knows what other emotions that were strictly ovoid we nodded to each other and moved along already the latchenangos were spawning within their host in half an hour the ovoid able once more to move would limp off toward its camp to start infecting its comrades it is a funny way to wage war the second ovoid an hour later was trickier it knew we had spotted it and took evasive action zigzagging through a zone of streams and slender trees in a weird dignified way like someone trying to move very fast without having his hat blow off ovoids are not designed for quick movements but this one was agile and determined ducking behind this rock and that more than once we lost sight of it altogether and were afraid it might double back and come down on us while we stood gaping and blinking eventually we bottled it up between two swift little streams and closed in on it from both sides i raised my needler and fazio got ready with his spore distributor and just then something gray and slippershaped and about fifteen centimeters long came leaping up out of the lefthand stream and plastered itself over fazios mouth and throat down he went snuffling and gurgling trying desperately to peel it away i thought it was some kind of killer fish pausing only long enough to shoot a needle through the ovoid i dropped my gear and jumped down beside him fazio was rolling around eyes wild kicking at the ground in terror and agony i put my elbow on his chest to hold him still and pried with both hands at the thing on his face getting it loose was like pulling a second skin off him but somehow i managed to lift it away from his lips far enough for him to gasp synsymi think its synsym no man its just some nasty fish i told him hang in there and ill rip the rest of it loose in half a minute fazio shook his head in anguish then i saw the two thin strands of transparent stuff snaking up out of it and disappearing into his nostrils and i knew he was right i didnt hear anything from him or about him after the end of the war and didnt want to but i assumed all along that fazio was still alive i dont know why my faith in the general perversity of the universe i guess the last i had seen of him was our final day on weinstein we both were being invalided out they were shipping me to the big hospital on daemmerung for routine desporification treatment but he was going to the quarantine station on quixote and as we lay side by side in the depot me on an ordinary stretcher and fazio inside an isolation bubble he raised his head with what must have been a terrible effort and glared at me out of eyes that already were ringed with the red concentric synsym circles and he whispered something to me i wasnt able to understand the words through the wall of his bubble but i could feel them the way you feel the light of a bluewhite sun from half a parsec out his skin was glowing the dreadful vitality of the symbiont within him was already apparent i had a good notion of what he was trying to tell me you bastard he was most likely trying to say now im stuck with this thing for a thousand years and im going to hate you every minute of the time chollie then they took him away they sent him floating up the ramp into that quixotebound ship when he was out of view i felt released as though i was coming out from under a pull of six or seven gravs it occurred to me that i wasnt ever going to have to see fazio again i wouldnt have to face those reddened eyes that taut shining skin that glare of infinite reproach or so i believed for the next ten years until he turned up on betelgeuse station a bolt out of the blue there he was suddenly standing next to me in the recreation room on north spoke it was just after my shift and i was balancing on the rim of the swimmer web getting ready to dive chollie he said calmly the voice was fazios voice that was clear when i stopped to think about it a little later but i never for a moment considered that this weird gnomish man might be fazio i stared at him and didnt even come close to recognizing him he seemed about seven million years old shrunken fleshless weightless with thick coarse hair like white straw and strange soft gleaming translucent skin that looked like parchment worn thin by time in the bright light of the rec room he kept his eyes hooded nearly shut but then he turned away from the glowglobes and opened them wide enough to show me the fine red rings around his pupils the hair began to rise along the back of my neck come on he said you know me yeah yeah the voice the cheekbones the lips the eyesthe eyes the eyes the eyes yes i knew him but it wasnt possible fazio here how so long a time so many lightyears away and yetyet he nodded you got it chollie come on who am i my first attempt at saying something was a sputtering failure but i managed to get his name out on the second try yeah he said fazio what a surprise he didnt look even slightly surprised i think he must have been watching me for a few days before he approached mecasing me checking me out making certain it was really me getting used to the idea that he had actually found me otherwise the amazement would surely have been showing on him now finding mefinding anybody along the starwayswasnt remotely probable this was a coincidence almost too big to swallow i knew he couldnt have deliberately come after me because the galaxy is so damned big a place that the idea of setting out to search for someone in it is too silly even to think about but somehow he had caught up with me anyway if the universe is truly infinite i suppose then even the most wildly improbable things must occur in it a billion times a day i said shakily i cant believe you cant hey you better what a surprise kid hey hey he clapped his hand against my arm and youre looking good kid nice and healthy you keep in shape huh how old are you now thirtytwo thirty i was numb with shock and fear thirty mmm so am i nice age aint it prime of life fazio his control was terrifying come on chollie you look like youre about to crap in your pants arent you glad to see your old buddy we had some good times together didnt we didnt we what was the name of that fuckin planet weinberg weinfeld hey hey dont stare at me like that i had to work hard to make any sound at all finally i said what the hell do you want me to do fazio i feel like im looking at a ghost he leaned close and his eyes opened wider i could practically count the concentric red rings ten or fifteen of them very fine lines i wish to christ you were he said quietly such unfathomable depths of pain such searing intensity of hatred i wanted to squirm away from him but there was no way he gave me a long slow crucifying inspection then he eased back and some of the menacing intensity seemed to go out of him almost jauntily he said we got a lot to talk about chollie you know some quiet place around here we can go theres the gravity lounge sure the gravity lounge we floated facetoface at halfpull you promised youd kill me if i got nailed fazio murmured that was our deal why didnt you do it chollie why the fuck didnt you do it i could hardly bear to look into his redringed eyes things happened too fast man how was i to know paramedics would be on the scene in five minutes five minutes is plenty of time to put a heat bolt through a guys chest less than five minutes three two the paramedic floater was right overhead man it was covering us the whole while they came down on us like a bunch of fucking angels fazio you had time i thought they were going to be able to save you i said lamely they got there so quickly fazio laughed harshly they did try to save me he said ill give them credit for trying five minutes and i was on that floater and they were sending tracers all over me to clean the synsym goop out of my lungs and my heart and my liver sure that was just what i figured theyd do you promised to finish me off chollie if i got nailed but the paramedics were right there they worked on me like sonsabitches he said they did everything they can clean up the vital tissues they can yank out your organs synsym and all and stick in transplants but they cant get the stuff out of your brain did you know that the synsym goes straight up your nose into your brain and it slips its tendrils into your meninges and your neural glia and right into your fucking corpus callosum and from there it goes everywhere the cerebellum the medulla you name it they cant send tracers into the brain that will clean out synsym and not damage brain tissue and they cant pull out your brain and give you a new one either thirty seconds after the synsym gets into your nose it reaches your brain and its all over for you no matter what kind of treatment you get didnt you hear them tell you that when we first got to the war zone didnt you hear all the horror stories i thought they were just horror stories i said faintly he rocked back and forth gently in his gravity cradle he didnt say anything do you want to tell me what its like i asked after a while fazio shrugged as though from a great distance he said what its like ah its not all that goddamned bad chollie its like having a roommate living with you in your head forever and you cant break the lease thats all or like having an itch you cant scratch having it there is like finding yourself trapped in a space thats exactly one centimeter bigger than you are all around and knowing that youre going to stay walled up in it for a million years he looked off toward the great clear wall of the lounge toward giant red betelgeuse blazing outside far away your synsym talks to you sometimes so youre never lonely you know doesnt speak any language you understand just sits there and spouts gibberish but at least its company sometimes it makes you spout gibberish especially when you badly need to make sense it grabs control of the upper brain centers now and then you know and as for the autonomous centers it does any damned thing it likes with them keys into the pain zones and runs little simulations for youan amputation without anesthetic say just for fun its fun or youre in bed with a woman and it disconnects your erection mechanism or it gives you an erection that wont go down for six weeks for fun it can get playful with your toilet training too i wear a diaper chollie isnt that sweet i have to i get drunk sometimes without drinking or i drink myself sick without feeling a thing and all the time i feel it there tickling me like an ant crawling around within my skull like a worm up my nose its just like the other guys told us when we came out to the war zone remember kill yourself fast while you have the chance i never had the chance i had you chollie and we had a deal but you didnt take our deal seriously why not chollie i felt his eyes burning me i looked away halfway across the lounge and caught sight of elisandras long golden hair drifting in freefloat she saw me at the same moment and waved we usually got together in here this time of night i shook my head trying to warn her off but it was too late she was already heading our way whos that fazio asked your girlfriend a friend nice he said he was staring at her as though he had never seen a woman before i noticed her last night too you live together we work the same shift on the wheel yeah i saw you leave with her last night and the night before how long have you been at the station fazio week ten days maybe came here looking for me just wandering around he said fat disability pension plenty of time i go to a lot of places thats a really nice woman chollie youre a lucky guy a tic was popping on his cheek and another was getting started on his lower lip he said why the fuck didnt you kill me when that thing first jumped me i told you i couldnt the paramedics were on the scene too fast right you needed to say some hail marys first and they just didnt give you enough time he was implacable i had to strike back at him somehow or the guilt and shame would drive me crazy angrily i said what the hell do you want me to tell you fazio that im sorry i didnt kill you ten years ago okay im sorry does that do any good listen if the synsyms as bad as you say how come you havent killed yourself why go on dragging yourself around with that thing inside your head he shook his head and made a little muffled grunting sound his face abruptly became gray his lips were sagging his eyeballs seemed to be spinning slowly in opposite directions just an illusion i knew but a scary one fazio he said chollallula lillalolla loolicholla billillolla i stared he looked frightening he looked hideous jesus fazio spittle dribbled down his chin muscles jumped and writhed crazily all over his face you see you see he managed to blurt there was warfare inside him i watched him trying to regain command it was like a man wrestling himself to a fall i thought he was going to have a stroke but then suddenly he seemed to grow calm his breath was ragged his skin was mottled with fiery blotches he collapsed down into himself head drooping arms dangling he looked altogether spent another minute or two passed before he could speak i didnt know what to do for him i floated there watching finally a little life seemed to return to him did you see thats what happens he gasped it takes control how could i ever kill myself it wouldnt let me do it wouldnt let you he looked up at me and sighed wearily think chollie think its in symbiosis with me we arent independent organisms then the tremors began again worse than before fazio made a desperate furious attempt to fight them offarms and legs flung rigidly out jaws workingbut it was useless illallomba he yelled nullagribba he tossed his head from side to side as if trying to shake off something sticky that was clinging to it if ithen itgillagilla holligoolla i canti cantohjesuschrist his voice died away into harsh sputters and clankings he moaned and covered his face with his hands but now i understood for fazio there could never be any escape that was the most monstrous part of the whole thing the ultimate horrifying twist the symbiont knew that its destiny was linked to fazios if he died the symbiont would also and so it could not allow its host to damage himself from its seat in fazios brain it had ultimate control over his body whatever he triedjump off a bridge reach for a flask of poison pick up a gunthe watchful thing in his mind would be a step ahead of him always protecting him against harm a flood of compassion welled up in me and i started to put my hand comfortingly on fazios shoulder but then i yanked it back as though i were afraid the symbiont could jump from his mind into mine at the slightest touch and then i scowled and forced myself to touch him after all he pulled away he looked burned out chollie elisandra said coining up beside us she floated alongside longlimbed beautiful frowning is this private or can i join you i hesitated fumbling i desperately wanted to keep fazio and elisandra in separate compartments of my life but i saw that i had no way of doing that we werewelljust that come on chollie fazio said in a bleak hollow voice introduce your old war buddy to the nice woman elisandra gave him an inquiring glance she could not have failed to detect the strangeness in his tone i took a deep breath this is fazio i said we were in the servadac campaign together during the second ovoid war fazioelisandra elisandras a trafficpolarity engineer on the turnaround wheelyou ought to see her at work the coolest cookie you can imagine an honor to meet you said fazio grandly a woman who combines such beauty and such technical skillsi have to sayii suddenly he was faltering his face turned blotchy fury blazed in his eyes no damn it no no more he clutched handfuls of air in some wild attempt at steadying himself mullagalloola he cried helpless jillabongbong sampazozozo and he burst into wild choking sobs while elisandra stared at him in amazement and sorrow well are you going to kill him she asked it was two hours later we had put fazio to bed in his little cubicle over at transient house and she and i were in her room i had told her everything i looked at her as though she had begun to babble the way fazio had elisandra and i had been together almost a year but there were times i felt i didnt know her at all well she said are you serious you owe it to him you owe him a death chollie he cant come right out and say it because the symbiont wont allow him to but thats what he wants from you i couldnt deny any of that id been thinking the same thing for at least the past hour the reality of it was inescapable i had muffed things on weinstein and sent fazio to hell for ten years now i had to set him free if there was only some way to get the symbiont out of his brain but there isnt no i said there isnt youll do it for him wont you quit it i said i hate the way hes suffering chollie you think i dont and what about you suppose you fail him a second time how will you live with that tell me how i was never much for killing ellie not even ovoids we know that she said but you dont have any choice this time i went to the little fireglobe she had mounted above the sleeping platform and hit the button and sent sparks through the thick coiling mists a rustle of angry colors swept the mist a wild aurora green purple yellow after a moment i said quietly youre absolutely right good i was afraid for a moment you were going to crap out on him again there was no malice in it the way she said it all the same it hit me like a fist i stood there nodding letting the impact go rippling through me and away at last the reverberations seemed to die down within me but then a great new uneasiness took hold of me and i said you know its totally idiotic of us to be discussing this im involving you in something thats none of your business what were doing is making you an accomplice before the fact elisandra ignored me something was in motion in her mind and there was no swerving her now how would you go about it she asked you cant just cut someones throat and dump him down a disposer chute look i said do you understand that the penalty could be anything up to she went on any sort of direct physical assault is out thered be some sort of struggle for surethe symbionts bound to defend the host body against attackyoud come away with scratches bruises worse somebody would notice suppose you got so badly hurt you had to go to the medics what would you tell them a barroom brawl and then nobody can find your old friend fazio who you were seen with a few days before no much too risky her tone was strangely businesslike matteroffact and then getting rid of the bodythats even tougher chollie getting fifty kilos of body mass off the station without some kind of papers no destination visa no transshipment entry even a sack of potatoes would have an outinvoice but if someone just vanishes and theres a fiftykilo short balance in the mass totals that day quit it i said okay you owe him a death you agreed about that maybe i do but whatever i decide i dont want to drag you into it it isnt your mess ellie you dont think so she shot right back at me anger and love were all jumbled together in elisandras tone i didnt feel like dealing with that just now my head was pounding i activated the pharmo arm by the sink and hastily ran a load of relaxants into myself with a subcute shot then i took her by the hand gently trying hard to disengage i said can we just go to bed now id rather not talk about this any more elisandra smiled and nodded sure she replied and her voice was much softer she started to pull off her clothes but after a moment she turned to me troubled i cant drop it just like that chollie its still buzzing inside me that poor bastard she shuddered never to be alone in his own head never to be sure he has control over his own body waking up in a puddle of piss he said speaking in tongues all that other crazy stuff what did he say like feeling an ant wandering around inside his skull an itch you cant possibly scratch i didnt know it would be that bad i said i think i would have killed him back then if i had known why didnt you anyway he was fazio a human being my friend my buddy i didnt much want to kill ovoids even how the hell was i going to kill him but you promised to chollie let me be i said i didnt do it thats all now i have to live with that so does he said elisandra i climbed into her sleeptube and lay there without moving waiting for her so do i she added after a little while she wandered around the room for a time before joining me finally she lay down beside me but at a slight distance i didnt move toward her but eventually the distance lessened and i put my hand lightly on her shoulder and she turned to me an hour or so before dawn she said i think i see a way we can do it we spent a week and a half working out the details i was completely committed to it now no hesitations no reservations as elisandra said i had no choice this was what i owed fazio this was the only way i could settle accounts between us she was completely committed to it too even more so than i was it sometimes seemed i warned her that she was needlessly letting herself in for major trouble in case the station authorities ever managed to reconstruct what had happened it didnt seem needless to her she said i didnt have a lot of contact with him while we were arranging things it was important i figured not to give the symbiont any hints i saw fazio practically every day of coursebetelgeuse station isnt all that bigoff at a distance staring glaring sometimes having one of his weird fits climbing a wall or shouting incoherently or arguing with himself out loud but generally i pretended not to see him at times i couldnt avoid him and then we met for dinner or drinks or a workout in the rec room but there wasnt much of that okay elisandra said finally ive done my part now you do yours chollie among the little services we run here is a sightseeing operation for tourists who feel like taking a close look at a red giant star after the big stellarenvelope research project shut down a few years ago we inherited a dozen or so solar sleds that had been used for skimming through the fringes of betelgeuses mantle and we began renting them out for threeday excursions the sleds are twopassenger jobs without much in the way of luxury and nothing at all in the way of propulsion systems the trip is strictly ballistic we calculate your orbit and shoot you out of here on the big repellers sending you on a dazzling swing across betelgeuses outer fringes that gives you the complete light show and maybe a view of ten or twelve of the big stars family of planets when the sled reaches the end of its string we catch you on the turnaround wheel and reel you in it sounds spectacular and it is it sounds dangerous and it isnt not usually anyhow i tracked fazio down in the gravity lounge and said weve arranged a treat for you man the sled i had rented for him was called the corona queen elisandra routinely handled the dispatching job for these tours and now and then i worked as wheelman for them although ordinarily i wheeled the big interstellar liners that used betelgeuse station as their jumpingoff point for deeper space we were both going to work fazios sled unfortunately this time there was going to be a disaster because a regrettable little error had been made in calculating orbital polarity and then there would be a oneinamillion failure of the redundancy circuits fazios sled wasnt going to go on a tour of betelgeuses farflung corona at all it was going to plunge right into the heart of the giant red star i would have liked to tell him that as we headed down the winding corridors to the dropdock but i couldnt because telling fazio meant telling fazios symbiont also and what was good news for fazio was bad news for the symbiont to catch the filthy thing by surprise that was essential how much did fazio suspect god knows in his place i think i might have had an inkling but maybe he was striving with all his strength to turn his mind away from any kind of speculation about the voyage he was about to take you cant possibly imagine what its like i said its unique theres just no way to simulate it and the view of betelgeuse that you get from the station isnt even remotely comparable the sled glides through the corona on a film of vaporized carbon said elisandra the heat just rolls right off its surface we were chattering compulsively trying to fill every moment with talk youre completely shielded so that you can actually pass through the atmosphere of the star of course i said betelgeuse is so big and so violent that youre more or less inside its atmosphere no matter where you are in its system and then there are the planets elisandra said the way things are lined up this week you may be able to see as many as a dozen of them otello falstaff siegfried maybe wotan youll find a map on the ceiling of your cabin five gas giants twice the mass of jupiterkeep your eye out for wotan thats the one with rings and isolde you cant miss isolde shes even redder than betelgeuse the damndest bloodshot planet imaginable with eleven red moons too but you wont be able to see them without filters otello and falstaff for sure and i think this weeks chart shows aida out of occultation now too and then theres the band of comets the asteroids thats where we think a couple of the planets collided after gravitational perturbation of and the einsteinian curvature its unmistakable the big solar flares here we are elisandra said we had reached the dropdock before us rose a gleaming metal wall elisandra activated the hatch and it swung back to reveal the little sled a sleek tapering frognosed thing with a low hump in the middle it sat on tracks above it arched the coils of the repellerlauncher radiating at the moment the bluegreen glow that indicated a neutral charge everything was automatic we had only to put fazio on board and give the station the signal for launch the rest would be taken care of by the orbitalpolarity program elisandra had previously keyed in its going to be the trip of your life man i said fazio nodded his eyes looked a little glazed and his nostrils were flaring elisandra hit the prelaunch control the sleds roof opened and a recorded voice out of a speaker in the dropdock ceiling began to explain to fazio how to get inside and make himself secure for launching my hands were cold my throat was dry yet i was very calm all things considered this was murder wasnt it maybe so technically speaking but i was finding other names for it a mercy killing a balancing of the karmic accounts a way of atoning for an ancient sin of omission for him release from hell after ten years for me release from a lesser but still acute kind of pain fazio approached the sleds narrow entry slot wait a second i said i caught him by the arm the account wasnt quite in balance yet chollie elisandra said i shook her off to fazio i said theres one thing i need to tell you before you go he gave me a peculiar look but didnt say anything i went on ive been claiming all along that i didnt shoot you when the synsym got you because there wasnt time the medics landed too fast thats sort of true but mainly its bullshit i had time what i didnt have was the guts chollie elisandra said again there was an edge on her voice just one more second i told her i turned to fazio again i looked at you i looked at the heat gun i thought about the synsym but i just couldnt do it i stood there with the gun in my hand and i didnt do a thing and then the medics landed and it was too latei felt like such a shit fazio such a cowardly shit fazios face was turning blotchy the red synsym lines blazed weirdly in his eyes get him into the sled elisandra yelled its taking control of him chollie oligabongaboo fazio said ungabanoo flizz thrapp and he came at me like a wild man i had him by thirty kilos at least but he damned near knocked me over somehow i managed to stay upright he bounced off me and went reeling around and elisandra grabbed his arm he kicked her hard and sent her flying but then i wrapped my forearm around the throat from behind and elisandra crawling across the floor got him around his legs so we could lift him and stuff him into the sled even then we had trouble holding him two of us against one skinny burnedout ruined man and he writhed and twisted and wriggled about like something diabolical he scratched he kicked he elbowed he spat his eyes were fiery every time we forced him close to the entryway of the sled he dragged us back away from it elisandra and i were grunting and winded and i didnt think we could hang on much longer this wasnt fazio we were doing battle with it was a synthetic symbiont out of the ovoid labs furiously trying to save itself from a fiery death god knows what alien hormones it was pumping into fazios bloodstream god knows how it had rebuilt his bones and heart and lungs for greater efficiency if he ever managed to break free of my grip i wondered which of us would get out of the dropdock alive but all the same fazio still needed to breathe i tightened my hold on his throat and felt cartilage yielding i didnt care i just wanted to get him on that sled dead or alive give him some peace at all him and me both tightertighter fazio made rough sputtering noises and then a thick nasty gargling sound youve got him elisandra said yeah yeah i clamped down one notch tighter yet and fazio began to go limp though his muscles still spasmed and jerked frantically the creature within him was still full of fight but there wasnt much air getting into fazios lungs now and his brain was starving for oxygen slowly elisandra and i shoved him the last five meters toward the sledlifted him pushed him up to the edge of the slot started to jam him into it a convulsion wilder than anything that had gone before ripped through fazios body he twisted half around in my grasp until he was facetoface with elisandra and a bubble of something gray and shiny appeared on his lips for an instant everything seemed frozen it was like a slice across time for just that instant then things began to move again the bubble burst some fragment of tissue leaped the short gap from fazios lips to elisandras the symbiont facing death had cast forth a piece of its own lifestuff to find another host chollie elisandra wailed and let go of fazio and went reeling away as if someone had thrown acid in her eyes she was clawing at her face at the little flat gray slippery thing that had plastered itself over her mouth and was rapidly poking a couple of glistening pseudopods up into her nostrils i hadnt known it was possible for a symbiont to send out offshoots like that i guess no one did or people like fazio wouldnt be allowed to walk around loose i wanted to yell and scream and break things i wanted to cry but i didnt do any of those things when i was four years old growing up on backgammon my father bought me a shiny little vortex boat from a peddler on maelstrom bridge it was just a toy a bathtub boat though it had all the stabilizer struts and outriggers in miniature we were standing on the bridge and i wanted to see how well the boat worked so i flipped it over the rail into the vortex of course it was swept out of sight at once bewildered and upset because it didnt come back to me i looked toward my father for help but he thought i had flung his gift into the whirlpool for the sheer hell of it and he gave me a shriveling look of black anger and downright hatred that i will never forget i cried half a day but that didnt bring back my vortex boat i wanted to cry now sure something grotesquely unfair had happened and i felt four years old all over again and there was nobody to turn to for help i was on my own i went to elisandra and held her for a moment she was sobbing and trying to speak but the thing covered her lips her face was white with terror and her whole body was trembling and jerking crazily dont worry i whispered this time i know what to do how fast we act when finally we move i got fazio out of the way first tossing him or the husk of him into the entry slot of the coronaqueen as easily as though he had been an armload of straw then i picked up elisandra and carried her to the sled she didnt really struggle just twisted about a little the symbiont didnt have that much control yet at the last moment i looked into her eyes hoping i wasnt going to see the red circles in them no not yet not so soon her eyes were the eyes i remembered the eyes i loved they were steady cold clear she knew what was happening she couldnt speak but she was telling me with her eyes yes yesgo ahead for christs sake go ahead chollie unfair unfair but nothing is ever fair i thought or else if there is justice in the universe it exists only on levels we cant perceive in some chilly macrocosmic place where everything is evened out in the long run but the sin is not necessarily atoned by the sinner i pushed her into the slot down next to fazio and slammed the sled shut and went to the dropdocks wall console and keyed in the departure signal and watched as the sled went sliding down the track toward the exit hatch on its oneway journey to betelgeuse the red light of the activated repellers glared for a moment and then the bluegreen returned i turned away wondering if the symbiont had managed to get a piece of itself into me too at the last moment i waited to feel that tickle in the mind but i didnt i guess there hadnt been time for it to get us both and then finally i dropped down on the launching track and let myself cry and went out of there after a while silent numb purged clean thinking of nothing at all at the inquest six weeks later i told them i didnt have the slightest notion why elisandra had chosen to get aboard that ship with fazio was it a suicide pact the inquest panel asked me i shrugged i dont know i said i dont have any goddamned idea what was going on in their minds that day i said silent numb purged clean thinking of nothing at all so fazio rests at last in the blazing heart of betelgeuse my elisandra is in there also and i go on day after day still working the turnaround wheel here at the station reeling in the stargoing ships that come cruising past the fringes of the giant red sun i still feel haunted too but it isnt fazios ghost that visits me now or even elisandrasnot now not after all this time i think the ghost that haunts me is my own the ship who returned anne mccaffrey anne mccaffrey is a winner of both the hugo and nebula award a sfwa grand master and an inductee into the sf hall of fame her work is beloved by generations of readers she is best known for authoring the dragonriders of pern series but she has also written dozens of other novels she was born in cambridge mass in and currently makes her home in ireland in a home named dragonholdunderhill the ship who returned which first appeared in the anthology far horizons is a sequel to the ship who sang part of mccaffreys brain and brawn ship series this story follows helva a sentient spaceship with the mind of a human girl as she deals with the death of her human partner and an emergency return to the planet she had saved years before helva had been prowling through her extensive music files trying to find something really special to listen to when her exterior sensors attracted her attention she focused on the alert dead ahead of her were the ion trails of a large group of small medium and heavy vessels they had passed several days ago but she could still smell the stink of the dirty emissions she could certainly analyze their signatures instantly setting her range to maximum she caught only the merest blips to the port side almost beyond sensor range bit off regular shipping routes she murmured so they are replied niall she smiled fondly the holograph program had really improved since that last tweaking shed done there was niall parollan in the pilots chair one compact hand spread beside the pressure plate the left dangling from his wrist on the armrest he was dressed in the black shipsuit he preferred to wear vain man that hed been because blacks better now that my hairs turned he would brush back the thick shock of silvery hair and preen slightly in her direction where exactly are we niall i havent been paying much attention ha off in cloudcuckoo land again wherever that is she replied amiably it was such a comfort to hear his voice i do believe and there was a pause as the program accessed her present coordinates we are in the cepheus three region why so we are why would a large flotilla be out here this is a fairly empty volume of space ill bring up the atlas niall replied responding as programmed it was bizarre of her to have a hologram of a man dead two months but it was a lot betterpsychologicallyfor her to have the comfort of such a reanimation the company would dam up her grief until she could return her dead brawn to regulus base and discover if there were any new brawns she could tolerate as a mobile partner seventyeight years five months and twenty days with niall parollans vivid personality was a lot of time to suddenly delete since she had the technology to keep him alivein a fashion she had done so she certainly had enough memory of their usual interchanges with which to program this charade she would soon have to let him go but shed only do that when she no longer needed his presence to keep mourning at bay not that she hadnt had enough exposure to that emotion in her lifewhat with losing her first brawn partner jennan only a few years into what should have been a lifelong association in that era niall parollan had been her contact with central worlds brain and brawn ship administration at regulus base after a series of relatively short and only minimally successful longerterm partnerships with other brawns she had gladly taken niall as her mobile half together they had been roaming the galaxy since niall had ingeniously managed to pay off her early childhood and educational indebtedness to central worlds they had been free agents able to take jobs that interested them not compulsory assignments they had not gone to the horsehead nebula as she had once whimsically suggested to jennan the nh had had quite enough adventures and work in this one not to have to go outside it for excitement lets see if we can get a closer fix on them shall we niall wouldnt be a bad idea on an otherwise dull day would it though his fingers flashed across the pressure plates of the pilots console it was she who did the actual mechanics of altering their direction but then she would have done that anyway niall didnt really need to but it pleased her to give him tasks to do hed often railed at her for finding him the sort of work he didnt want to do and shed snap back that a little hard work never hurt anyone of course as he began to fail physically this became lip service to that old argument niall had been in his midforties when he became her brawn and she the nh so he had had a good long life for a softshell person good healthy stock i am the hologram said surprising her was she thinking out loud she must have been for the program to respond with careful treatment youll last centuries she replied as she often had she executed the ninetydegree course change that the control panel had plotted dont dawdle girl niall said swiveling in the chair to face the panel behind which her titanium shell resided she thought about going into his routine but decided shed better find out a little more about the invasion why do you call it an invasion niall asked that many ships all heading in one direction what else could it be freighters dont run in convoys not out here at any rate and nomads have definite routes they stick to in the more settled sectors and if ive read their kps rightly which inevitably you do my fine lady friend those ships have been juiced up beyond freighter specifications and theyre spreading dirty stuff all over space shouldnt be allowed cant have space mucked up can we the holos right eyebrow cocked imitating an habitual trait of nialls and juicedup engines as well should we warn anyone helva had found the atlas entries for this sector of space only the one habitable planet in the system they seem to be heading straight for ravel sudden surprise caught at her heart at that name of all places ravel a pretty good program to search and find that longago reference so quickly she inwardly winced at the holos predictable response ravel was the name of the star that went nova and killed your jennan brawn wasnt it niall said knowing the fact perfectly well i didnt need the reminder she said sourly biggest rival i have niall said brightly as he always did and pushed the command chair around in a circle grinning at her unrepentantly as he let the chair swing degrees and back to the console nonsense hes been dead nearly a century dead but not forgotten helva paused knowing niall was right as he always was in spite of being dead too maybe this wasnt a good idea having him able to talk back to her but it was only what he would have said in life anyhow and had done often enough or it wouldnt be in the program she wished that the diagnostics had shown her one specific cause for his general debilitation so she could have forestalled his death some way somehow im wearing out lover hed told her fatalistically in one of their conversations when he could no longer deny increasing weakness what can you expect from a lifeform that degenerates im lucky to have lived as long as i have thanks to you fussing at me for the last seventy years seventyeight she corrected him then ill be sorry to leave you alone dear heart hed said coming and laying his cheek on the panel behind which she was immured of all the women in my life youve been the best only because i was the one you couldnt have she replied not that i didnt try the hologram responded with a characteristic snort helva echoed it reminiscing and talking out loud were not a good idea soon she wouldnt know what was memory and what was programming why hadnt she used the prosthetic body that niall had purchased for herreducing their credit balance perilously close to zero and coming close to causing an irreparable breach between them he had desperately wanted the physical contact ersatz as she had argued it would be the prosthesis would have been her in nialls eyes and arms since she would have motivated it and hed tried so hard to have her he had supplied sorg prosthetics with the hologram statue hed had made long before he became her brawn using genetic information from her medical history and holos of her parents and siblings until hed told her she hadnt known that there had been other physically normal children of her parents issue but then shellpeople were not encouraged to be curious about their families they were shellpeople and ineffably different he swore blind that he hadnt maximized her potential appearancethe hologram was of a strikingly goodlooking womanwhen hed had a hologram made of her from that genetic information hed even produced his research materials for her inspection you may not like it kid hed said in his usual irreverent tone but you are a blond blueeyed female and would have grown tall and lissome just like i like em your dad was goodlookin and i made you take after him since daughters so often tend to resemble good ol dad not that your ma wasnt a goodlooking broad your siblings all are so i didnt engineer anything but a valid extrapolation you just prefer blondes dont tell me otherwise i never do do i responded the hologram and helva brought herself sharply to the presentand the fact she tried to avoidthat the niall parollan she had loved was dead really truly dead the husk of what he called his mortal coil was in stasis in his quarters he had died peacefullynot as he had lived with fuss and fury and fine histrionics one moment her sensors read his slowly fading life signsthe next second the thin line of nothing as the essence of the personality that had been niall parollan departedto wherever souls or a spiritual essence went she who could not weep was shattered later she realized that she had hung in space for days coming to grips with his passing she had said over and over that they had had a good long time together that these circumstances differed from her loss of jennan after just a few very short years jennan had never had a chance to live a full long productive life niall had surely she shouldnt be greedy for just a little more especially when for the last decade he had been unable to enjoy the lifestyle that he had followed so vibrantly so fully in such a raucous nonconformist spirit surely she had learned to cope with grief in her last hundred years that was when she realized that she couldnt face the long silent trip back to regulus base hed insisted that he had a right to be buried with other heroes of the service since hed had to put up so much with them and especially her all these decades they had been a lot closer to regulus at the time that subject had come up but she was determined to grant that request there were no other brain ships anywhere in her spatial vicinity to contact and act as escort she and niall had been on a primary scouting sweep of unexplored star systems she might have resented that first escort back from ravel with jennans body not that there was much chance of her suiciding this time shed passed that test on the first funereal return to regulus base which is when the notion to program a facsimile had occurred to her so it was a way to delay acceptance surely she could be allowed this aberrationif aberration it was she didnt have to mention the matter to regulus theyd be glad enough to have her ready to take another partner experienced bb ships were always in demand for delicate assignments she was one of their best her shipself redesigned and crammed with all the new technology that had been developed for brain ships and stations like that damned spare body niall had bought and which she had never used she couldnt she simply couldnt inhabit the sorg prosthesis oh she knew that tia did and the girl was glad of the ability to leave the shell and ambulate lovely word ambulate she and niall had had some roaring arguments over the whole notion of prosthesis youd fit me out with a false arm or leg if i lost one wouldnt you had been one of nialls rebuttals so you could walk or use the hand yes but this is different because you know what id be using on you dont you he was so close to her panel that his face had been an angry blur hed been spitting at her intransigence and you dont want any part of my short arm do you at least they cant replace that in prosthesis shed snarled wanna bet hed whirled away back to his command chair sprawling into it glaring at her panel trouble is with you girl youre aged in the keg set in plascrete you dont know what youre missing and he was snarling with bitterness since she considered herself tolerant and forward thinking that accusation had burned it still did maybe after all she was too old in her head to contemplate physical freedom but she could not make use of that empty bodyshell as something she helva could manipulate not all the brain ships she had spoken to about the sorg prosthesis had found it a substitute for immolation in a shell and some of them had been just commissioned too of course tiaalexhypatia ahhad once been a walking unshelled person as a child maybe as niall had vociferously bellowed at the top of his lungs at her helva needed to have her conditioning altered a moral update for a brain ship she wasnt that old after all why couldnt she have accepted the prosthesis when he wanted so desperately for her to use it she and niall had been partnered a long time so how could it have altered their special relationship to have added to it that final surrender of self she really hadnt thought of herself as a technological vestal virgin one of the epithets niall had flung at her she wasnt prudish shed just been conditioned to accept herself as she was so thoroughly that to be unshelled was the worst imaginable fate using the prosthetic body was not at all the same thing as being unshelled he had shouted back at her while she had been sensorily deprived once she hadnt also been out of her shell nearly out of her mind yes but not out of the shell but she couldnt simply could not oblige oblige no she couldnt oblige niall in that way a weak word to define a response to his unreasonable but ohsomuch masculine request well she had refused now she wished she hadnt but if niall were still living would she have relented not likely since it was his death that had now prompted remorse for that omission preferably before i became impotent my girl and this was the holo speaking if you knew how sorry i am niall she murmured information started to chatter in from her sensors she didnt quite recall having asked for a spectrographic analysis of the ion trail such an action was so much a part of her standard operating procedure that she supposed in between selfcastigation and listening to her niall program that she had automatically instigated it well well armed and loaded for bear huh yeah niall in holo replied but what sort of bear those religious fanatics on chloe had used fur rugs to keep warm so the analogy is accurate enough she replied amused to have been so accurate i remember they went merrily off to merrily nialls voice cracked in dismay that lot never heard the word so whats hunting bear in this volume of space he asked well now hear this dear friend theyre on that habitable planet which being the gluttons for punishment they seemed to be when i first met them they have named ravel no doubt a penitential derived gimmick to remind them of their sins niall said in a dour tone helva analyzed the report got an id on the visitors pirates she said for her data files had been able to match the emissions with those of kolnari raiders smallyachts more likelyand some mediumsized spaceships probably freighters gutted and refitted for piratical practices and two heavier but older cruisersized vessels the niall holo whipped the chair round staring at her mind you the program was very good to get this sort of reaction so quickly kolnari the bastards that attacked your spacestation friend simeon the very same not all of those fanatics got captured when central worlds navy tried to round all of them up wily fiends those kolnari and the holos expression was dead serious last info from regulus suggested that two groups possibly four had escaped completely even one groups more than enough bearhunters to ravage ravel with their modus operandi the holo slammed both hands on the armrests in frustration i wonder that there are any still alive after all the virus that dr chaundra let loose on them was one of the most virulent ever discovered she gave a sigh the kolnari were dying in droves the kolnaria dissident splinter group that had so adapted to the conditions of their harsh home planet that they were considered a human subspecieswere known to have an incredible ability to adapt to and survive otherwise fatal diseases viruses and punishing planetary conditions they had a short life span maturing when other male human types were only hitting puberty but the short generations were dangerous despite the limitation they raided wherever they could planets space platforms or freighter convoys using the human populations or crews as slaves and refitting the captured vessels to their usespiracy after their nearly successful raid on space station central worlds navy was reasonably certain they had destroyed the main body of peripatetic kolnari units they were on alert to locate and destroy on sight any other units huh niall snorted adapting to that particular virus would be just the sort of thing the kolnari would be able to do given their perverse nature and crazy metabolism im afraid you could be right who else would be insane enough to run ships in that condition even nomads dont get that sloppy about emissions helva said not if they wish to continue their nomadic existence if theyre leaving a system on the sly are you being wise to go after kolnari niall asked a trace of anxiety in his tone youd constitute a real prize helva did a mental shudder all too vividly reminded of what the kolnari leader belazir tmarid had nearly done to the spacestation brain simeon odd that niall would remind her of that she knew shed done a good program but could she rationally believe in the transmigration of souls or that the holo was the ghost of the real niall i can no more leave those ravel idiots to the kolnari than i could to the damned nova and it is sort of poetic justice she said with a sigh lets see its nearly a hundred years since i had to transport them off their planet before their sun fried it it took time for central worlds to find such a suitably remote star system where they would be safe from both nova stars and any profanity from the evils that beset mere men lets hope that they have some sort of modern equipment protecting them if not against novas at least against predators ah the atlas says the suns stable and there is or was a space facility for incoming converts ha the holo gave a bark of disgust any satellite systems none mentioned no contact in the past forty years in fact well im about to break into their meditations or whatever it is they do down there theres nothing but females on that planet i cant let kolnari get their hands on all those innocent pious virgins now can i itd be fun to watch though said a totally unrepentant niall shut up you prurient sadist she said as firmly as possible maybe she should also shut the program down no she needed him one way or the other because embedded in that program was the distillation of seventyeight years of experience his and hers i was never a sadist my dear helva he said haughtily and then grinned wickedly ill admit to hedonism but none of my women ever minded my attention bar you have you considered a pulse to any listening central worlds units of the imminent unraveling disaster i am andshe paused as she put the final urgent all eyes tag on the beamand its away for the first time she experienced a touch of relief that she could approach the group without defiling it by the presence of a male shed pause the programsince niall seemed to talk without any cues from her quite likely she wouldnt have as much trouble this time persuading them to seek whatever hidden shelters the planet might provide possibly the fact that she had saved them once before would weigh in their obedience to her urgings to make themselves as scarce as possible when the kolnari arrived whatever she wouldnt let them be victims to kolnari rape and brutality and ravel was only a minor detour from the way to regulus she not only felt better to have something useful to do after going into a fugue over nialls death but also was revived by the need as she had been needed at ravel as jennans father had been at parsaea true tragedy occurred when those who could have helped were not there when needed she was here she was needed vigor flowed through the tubes that supplied her nutrient fluids feeling on form are you the holo asked brightly thatta girl we gotta do what we gotta do data suggests that therell be a lot of small settlements cloisters they call em theyve increased their population from the chloe figures he sighed there isnt enough of the geoecological survey to show possible refuges planets high on vegetation though lots of forests and lots of mountains and valleys plenty of cover if they separate make it that much harder for the kolnari to tag em even from the air that is if they keep their wits about them helva said charged with hope they need only lie doggo until the fleet arrives that isand the holos tone was cynicalif the fleet has any squadrons near enough to send in timely fashion or decides such a splinter group is worth saving ive never heard of their type of faith the inner marian circle whos this marian they worship in this case marian is an adjective and refers to mary mother of jesus oh and whats an inner circle then i dont know and it scarcely matters does it we have to warn them maybe there isnt anyone left to warn niall suggested hey did you just say theyve increased their population from the chloe figures how does a celibate religious order perpetuate its membership converts she suggested she often had wondered how such minorities did manage to continue to practice a faith that rejected procreation as a sin there was a new shipment forty years ago ach and niall dismissed that even if they converted preteens how could the present inhabitants run fast enough at fiftyodd years to escape galloping kolnari parthenogenesis she suggested that is at least virgin birth and he snickered that would go with the theories about mary niall snorted that was just the first recorded case of exogenesis possibly but it doesnt detract from the messiahs effect on man and woman kind ill allow that big of you to the realities woman he said stirring forward in his chair first we have to find out if theres anyone to rescue and if theres any safe place to send them so the kolnari dont get em until the fleet heaves into sight i wouldnt wish that bunch on my worst enemy even my secondworst enemy helva had been scanning the file on the kolnari they might be looking for a new home base central worlds sterilized their planet of origin then lets not let them have this ravel which seems to be a nice planet wouldnt want the neighborhood to go to such dogs they have an indigenous sort of canine on ravel have you been speedreading ahead of me again she asked surprised because the list of local fauna was just coming up for her to peruse most of the mtype planets weve been on have some sort of critter in the canine slot cats dont always make it and he shot a snide glance at her he was a dog person but she had long ago decided she liked the independence of felines they could argue the merits of the two species quite happily on their journeys between star systems planet does have predators furthermore our inner circle does not have any weaponry and does not hunt theyre vegetarians he grinned around at her again so its all organic material helva asked at her most innocent playing on the theme just the kind of organic virgin material the kolnari adore the holo rubbed its hands together and leered she ignored that temperate climate too makes a change from chloe which was frozen most of the time what no harsh temperatures to mortify the body and soul no and a good basic ecology which they dont interfere with havent even domesticated any of the indigenous beasts for use but then this entry is forty years old dating from the last landfall they live in harmony with their environment it says here and do not plunder it which sure does leave them wideopen to being plundered themselves which is about to happen though when alls said and done i wouldnt like to see them plundered or deflowered among their vegetable patches by the kolnari nor will we permit it helva said fiercely although she devoutly hoped that she wouldnt meet with the incredulity and pious fatalism that shed encountered the first time and which obliquely had caused jennans death frankly my dear i dont know what i could do to help you you know my reputation with women the holo began ill do the talking she said firmly interrupting him he leaned back in his chair idly swinging it on the gimbals i wonder if they added you to their inner circle as a savior nonsense none of the original group would be still alive they didnt believe in artificially prolonging life all cures provided by prayer avoiding all impure substances like kolnari niall cocked his head at her maybe theyll welcome the kolnari as a trial sent by whatever universal deity they revere he paused scowling mary was never a god was she goddess i mean any rate would they consider the kolnari have been sent to test their faith im hoping not what do we have left of the tapes simeon recorded i opine that you would be referring to the rape scene my favorite of them all niall said and his fingers tapped a sequence you wouldnt actually dare to play that back at those innocents a picture is worth a thousand words she quoted at him if we have to tour as much of the planet as jennan and i had to on chloe im going to need to use a sharp fast lesson i can rig a hologram for them to see she added since she was pleased with the way she handled holographic programming if you do half as well with that program as you have with mine itll work honey that remark startled helva and she activated a magnification of his holographic image but it was the hologram one could see just the faintest hint of the light source how could niall know that he was a holo then she remembered the one they had done together at astrada iii when he had had to replay an historical event to prove a point to a skeptical audience surely that was his reference i cant find any indication of how large the population is she added having replayed the entry on ravel several times might be they dont keep an accurate census do they even have a space facility no but they do have a satellite with a proximity alarm she cried in triumph and how far away is the nearest inhabited system thatd hear it much less act niall wanted to know probably contains no more than the usual silly warning and he chanted in the lifeless tones of an automated messager this is an interdicted planet you will not proceed further he abandoned that tone and in a pious falsetto added or youll get a spanking when the fleet comes helva gave him the brief chuckle he would have expected our message will prompt action no one ignores a bb ship message and rightly so niall said loyally fierce pounding one fist for emphasis on the desk there was no sound attached to that action shed have to work on that facet when shed managed to preserve the chloists or chloeites or inner marian circle ravellians from the imminent arrival of the kolnari shed have to be sure they knew just how dangerous and bloodyminded the kolnari were so theyd make themselves as scarce as possible helva was now speeding along the ion trail its dirty elements all the more pronounced as she reduced the distance separating them shed overtake the flotilla within twenty hours and arrive at ravel four or five days ahead of them shed have to start decelerating once she passed the heliopause but so would the kolnari dont forget to cloak niall said rising from his chair he stretched until she was sure she could hear the sinews popping which she reminded herself is why she hadnt added more than vocal sound to the holo stretching he was allowed but not the awful noise hed make popping his knucklebones id better get some shuteye before the party begins good idea ill work on the hologram while youre resting and call you for a critique niall the holo walked across the main compartment and to the aisle and down to nialls quarters did it never realize that it melded with nialls stasisheld body on the bunk shed almost forgotten the cloaking mechanism that bent light and sensory equipment around the ship itself shed only used that device once and had held that up to niall as a really unnecessary piece of technology for a bb ship to waste credit on so it was coming in handy again bb ships had no weaponry with which to defend themselves and vanishing provided a much more effective evasion than the tightest most impervious shielding as she judiciously edited the tapes from the kolnari occupation of space station she mulled over the first encounter with the chloeites at least this time her brawn couldnt be killed however unintentional jennans death had been she also had more tricks in her arsenal than she had had as that raw young brain ship she sped along and well before any sensors the kolnari might have could track her approach she went into cloak of course they became spots on her sensors rather than threedimensional ships still by the size of the signals as she passed them she learned a good deal about them to begin with there were more than she had anticipated even taking into consideration all the dirty emissions none of this lot matched the signatures of any of those that had attacked her friend simeon not that that provided her with any consolation the kolnari fleet was an incredible mixture of yachts large and small prizes of other kolnari attacksa round dozen of them stuffed far above the optimum capacity with bodies some evidently stashed in escape pods as lastresort accommodation the conditions on board those ships would have been desperate even if the lifesupport systems managed to cope with such overloading three mediumsized freighters equally jampacked with little and large kolnaris two destroyer types quite elderly but these were loaded with missiles and other armaments two of the freighters were hauling drones five apiece which cut down on the speed at which the entire convoy could travel four drones contained nothing but ammunition missiles and spare parts the fifth probably food as she got no metallic signals from it nineteen ships a veritable armada and certainly able to overwhelm the inhabitants of ravel which was undoubtedly why that luckless planet had been picked she pulsed an update of her earlier message with these details to the nearest fleet facilitya good ten days away even by the speed of a pulse the admiralty had sworn blind that they intended to wipe kolnari pirates out of space forever so here was a chance for an ambitious picket commander to make that clean sweep and get a promotion a small modern force could easily overwhelm this shagbagragbag of barely spaceworthy vehicles on the other hand the kolnari would fight to the last male child able to wield a weapon or fire a missile and they had rather a few of those even kolnari females were vicious fighters reviewing what was known of their lifestyle it was likely a great many of the women were slaves captured and forced to breed up more kolnari offspring she sped on wishing she had more information on the chloes living close to nature on another planet was fine in theory but practice was another thing altogether as the original religious group had found out the hard way on daphnis and chloe a hundred years ago she had completed a holographic account of the less palatable habits of the kolnari including the modus operandi of their invasion of the peaceful planet bethel the trid coverage had been found in the space wreckage and used in the trial against those that had been captured at ss she was delighted to have found the one that showed vividly how the kolnari dealt with anyone who defied them that was the short sharp lesson she needed to project she edited it added some voiceover and then programmed the exterior vid systems to play it that ought to cut down the waste of time spent arguing she wanted every single female resident of ravel safely hidden away when the kolnari arrived she didnt rouse niallwhy bother him when he was sleeping like the deador rather the holo of him he had always been hard to wake though once roused he altered from sleepy to alert in seconds she had the time so she did a leisurely spinin quartering the globe from darkside to daylight and identifying congregates of life signs all too many shed never make it to every settlement how could these piously celibate folk have increased almost fourfold from the numbers of the registered settlers multiply and be fruitful might be a biblical injunction but if the last bunch had come four decades before there were a great many more than there ought to be rabbits might multiply so but virgin rabbits well shed get to as many what had they called themselvesah cloistersas she could maybe they had some form of communication between the settlements widespread as they were on the sprawling main continent shed simply have to ignore the island groups and concentrate on the larger juicier targets that the kolnari would be likely to attack first smackdab in the middle of the main continent she easily identified what had been the landing fieldwell a few square acres of burntout ground a flimsy concretecovered grid where ships or shuttles had landed to offload people and supplies rows of temporary barracks weathered and in need of maintenance bordered two sides of the field to show that humans had once been accommodated there for however brief a time there was a lowpower source discernible and vegetation had not grown back over the landing area though in fortysome years there should have been some weeds regaining a root hold a blocky tower now tilting sideways held the corner position of the two barrack rows from her aerial advantage she could also see four roads each going away from the deserted landing place north south east and west she could see where auxiliary lanes had split off from the main ones smaller arteries leading to probably smaller settlements though none appeared to be more than dirt tracks the vigorous growths had not reclaimed the track leaving a clear margin on both sides some sort of chemical must have been used to discourage succession i wonder how they decided who went in which direction she murmured forgetting that oddity in the press of more important concerns probably by divine intervention niall said and there he was seated at the pilots console she hadnt put a voiceoperated command in the program but there he was and she was rather pleased to hear another voice after the silent days of inward travel makes it easier to have just four main directions to search in those tracks were made over a period of years or they wouldnt be quite so visible since the last time they were used forty years ago true so eeny meeny miny moe which track will we follow now east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet he said in one of his whimsical moods nothing for north and south well we could go this way and he crossed his arms pointing in two separate directions neither of which was a cardinal compass point north i think and then swing round helva decided in everincreasing circles his tone was so caustically bright mountains too thats good purple mountains majesty above the fruited plain he quoted that doesnt sound right ive forgot how it goes he said frowning they do say that memory is the first thing that aging affects thanks ill remember that cloaked and at low altitude she followed the northern track noting the offshoots and realizing she had bit off quite a lot to chew if she was going to warn even half the inhabitants she refused to allow the fact to discourage her from her chosen task and night was falling on the continent ahha niall pointed urgently at the view port fires port three degrees and far too much forest for me to land in i dont mind backtracking when you can find a landing spot oh no i cant can i no you cant but i appreciate your willingness to offer especially since i need to show my little vid to stir them to action you could use the prosthesis he said in a wheedling tone grinning at her she said nothingpointedlyand he chuckled she might have to at that if daylight didnt show her settlements she could reach she could hover but shed need something to project the vid on to for maximum effectiveness ill just use the darkness for reconnaissance and find out how many places im going to have to visit good thinking ill make a list of the coordinates you might need them if the fleet does come to our aid and comfort by morning his list of settlements in all directions had reached the three hundred mark some were small in the forested areas but the plains or rolling hill country had many with several hundred inhabitants all were ringed with walls and these seemed to exude the power that showed up at every settlement as well as a landdike that niall called a margin of nowomansland the largest congregation was sited at the confluence of two rivers if they have such a thing as an administrative center that is likely it she said well go there first thing in the morning when ive had a quick look at that island complex whatever you say love niall remarked with unusual compliance so shetheyarrived bright and early as the sun rose over the cup of the mountains that surrounded the largest congregation of ravels chloeites rather impressive wouldnt you say niall remarked orderly neat everyone must have a private domicile thought you said they were a cloistered order the arrangement of the town small city did surprise helva streets laid out in the center while garden plots and some large fields were positioned all around but within the customary low surrounding wall there were main gates at each of the cardinal points of the compass but they werent substantial a kolnari war axe would have reduced them to splinters with the first blow a power source was visible on her sensors but it seemed to power the wall what could they be keeping out that wasnt very tall or large or strong odd larger buildings set in the midst of fenced fields suggested either storage or barn shelters she saw nothing grazing though the season looked to be spring to judge by the delicate green of cultivated fields all within the walled boundary all four of the major avenues leading from the gates for they were broad enough to be dignified with that title treelined as well led toward a large building which dominated the center part of it looked like a church with an ample plaza in front of it for assemblies behind the church were low lines of buildings possibly administration this was a farbetterorganized place than the original chloe had been maybe they had learned something in the last century she could hope hey get that helva niall said suddenly pointing to a slim structure atop the front of the building not a steeple after allno bells in itbut its got something atop it their approach had now been sighted for the avenues as well as the smaller lanes between the individual housing units were filling with figures faces upturned most were racing towards the square in front of the church or whatever the big building was early risers helva remarked early to bedthat power source is limited to the wall not any electricityand early to rise you know niall said in a revoltingly jocular tone of voice then he altered to a practical tone and theres just about enough space for you to land in front of that church so there is but its also full she said for they had arrived at the back end of the building and now that she had swung round she could see that the plaza was filled with kneeling bodies no one was working the fields the more you squash the fewer well have to save from the kolnari niall said oh be quiet its over and out to you helva love sock it to them the devout knelt with upturned faces she could see their mouths open with dark os of surprise but not fear at some unseen signal the kneelers rose and quickly but without panic moved back out of the plaza be not afraid helva said gently using her exterior sound system and ignoring the rich chuckle of amusement from niall theyre not maybe you better alter your program dear heart i need to speak with you why dont you just hover she made sure she was on interior sound only before she said sharply will you shut up and let me handle this niall remind them that you saved them from the hellfire of chloe dear suggested niall thats my next line she said in a caustic aside i am called helva hey helva thats you theyve got mounted on that building in her careful vertical descent she was now level with the spire which wasnt a spire but a replica of her earlier shipself vanes and all well hows that for being canonized niall said but she could hear a note of pride in his voice you may be able to pull this off after all love rather more shaken by the artifact than shed ever let him know she completed her landing one of the improvements on her ship body was the vertical cabin and a ramp directly to it rather than the old and inconvenient lift from the stern you even have a reception party of one niall remarked as a tall figure became visible on the starboard viewers all around the square the others turned towards that figure heads bowing in a brief obeisance how else are you called ship helva said the tall woman the hood falling back and revealing the serene face of an older woman not bad at all niall murmured shed look even better in something feminine indeed helva agreed with him since the woman had the most amazingly attractive face a pity she had taken up religion instead of a man and a family the long cassock robe she wore was one of those amorphous affairs probably woven or pounded out of indigenous fibers and strictly utilitarian i am ship nh who was once also the jh the woman nodded and inclined forward from her waist in a deep bow bingo said niall we have sent eternal prayers for the repose of the soul of jennan the woman said in a richly melodious voice and from the onlookers rose a murmur of praise ever to his name his memory is honored helva replied sincerely may i ask your name i am the helvana the woman replied again with a reverent bow of her head oh my god helva you made it to sainthood niall said with complete irreverence and rolled with laughter in the pilots chair with your own priestess caste system wow somehow his reaction annoyed her so much she almost erased his program but common sense reasserted itself if she was indeed some sort of saint to these people she needed his irreverence more than everto keep her balance you lead your people i am she who has been chosen the woman said for many decades we have hoped that you would honor us with your appearance once more i come to you with bad tidings helva said quickly before she could be inundated with sanctimonious sentiments or perorations that you have come is enough what is your bidding ship who sings they have you pegged my dear niall murmured grinning like an idiot an enemy approaches this planet ah helvana helva had a bit of trouble getting that nametitle out i have sent for assistance but it will not arrive in time to prevent the landing nor the brutality with which these peoplethey are called the kolnarioverwhelm an unprotected population a chuckle rich and throaty surprised helva she also caught smiles from those around the square its no laughing matter helvana i have documentation of how they overwhelm resistance how they abuse the population she couldnt quite say rape in the presence of girls who looked to be in their teens i must ask that you retreat to whatever safety the forests and mountains can provide until the fleet arrives having warned you here in this fine city i must spread the alarm to all that i can to protect as many as i can the woman named helvana raised one hand a polite interruption birdkeepers send the flocks to warn our sisters ship who sings would you know how soon they will land im no more than four days ahead of them helva said wondering at her calmness with relief she did see quite a few women disappearing from the perimeter and doing whatever duties the birdkeepers might have you must gather what belongings you cherish and make for forest and mountain four days is plenty of time to set all in motion ship who sings this helvana sounded not the least bit alarmed as she bloody well should have been you dont understand hel helvana these men are pirates vicious they have no mercy on their victims show them the tape niall said this is what they did on the planet bethel she said and activated the exterior display using the whitewashed facade of the imposing main building as a screen that will not be necessary helvana said turn it off now please and since some of the captive audience looked decidedly unnerved by the first scene of battlearmored kolnari making mighty jumps towards screaming and panicking bethelites helva found herself obeying there is absolutely no need to terrify no need at all but there is helvana those men may i speak to you in private ship who sings i wouldnt like to go against that one niall said shes tough yes of course helva said to the helvana and then to niall get lost immediately niall said rising and skittering off to his quarters the helvana was tall enough to have to duck her head to clear the lintel of the opening and stood for a moment looking calmly around her a little smile flickering at the corners of her mouth then to helvas surprise she bowed with great reverence toward the central panel behind which helvas titanium shell was situated i have dreamed of being granted such a moment ship who sings she said her voice vibrant with exultation please be seated in the lounge on your right helva said the helvana took a second look at the raised bridge area that had been nialls favorite place and turned to the lounge area with considerable grace the heavy folds of her cassock flowing around her feet and her heavy boots grating on the metal part of the deck she reached the first of the sectional couches with another bow she seated herself facing helvas panel i must tell you ship who sings that the pitiful colony of the religious you rescued from ravels nova learned from that basic mistake i am pleased to hear that helva began but you must the graceful hand raised from the deepcuffed sleeve there was much to be learned if the inner marian circle would survive the science of your civilization really helva decided that this was a time to listen the satellite will have sent its preprogrammed message even as i am certain you sent messages her voice ended on an upward querying note several with such details of the invading force as i was able to glean but really helvana theyre going the hand raised and helva subsided she did have four days in hand my grandmother well that was unexpected was one of those whom you yourself rescued a wise but older christian sisterhood succored her and the other younger members of that community until a new planet could be found for our order and they acquired much wisdom during their waiting not however how to combat bloodthir the hand went up and helva subsided again we had been children on chloe ignorant and kept in ignorance when knowledge would have saved us and the blessed jennan my grandmother studied much as did her intimate circle with prayer and research we found that this planet was available a stable primary was our first consideration of course she said with a graceful wave of her hand surveys of ravel proved it would be adequate for our needs and our preferred style of life once we overcame its nature the planet has inherent dangers indeed we were required to devise a means whereby we could safely land the first colony expedition her expression became distant with memories but she pulled herself back to the present with a little shake of her head we were averse to the use of technology but that in the end was what we required and what we still employ we have maintained the landing site out of respect for the achievement of technology over rampant nature the touch of a switch will deter any unwelcome visitors she was talking a great deal more rationally than that rabid idiot mother superior at chloe had but defending the broad open plains of this ravel would be the task of an army a muchbetterequipped one than these people could possibly mount we have cultivated not only the land but the resources of the vegetation and wildlife there are predators on ravel not anything that could overcome a battlearmed kolnari the helvana smiled how many are in this kolnari battle armor well that was the first sensible question id estimate five maybe six regiments her wellshaped eyebrows arched in surprise how many are in a regiment helva told her that many yes that many and impregnable in that battle armor too unless you happen to have armorpiercing missiles hidden in your fields nothing to pierce armor the helvana said blithely with a light emphasis on pierce but we will defend ourselves well dont even consider handtohand combat helvana helva said ohand there was a lovely rippling contralto laughwe wouldnt consider attacking anyone then how do you plan to deal with the kolnari may i surprise you if it doesnt lead immediately to your death and the slaughter of all those innocents out there it wont which reminds me helvana i saw young children out there and teenage girls as well as matrons your age and older helva had been reviewing her tapes because something had puzzled her about the composition of those calm observers ah yes the helvana said smiling graciously my grandmother also decided that our community must propagate parthenogenesis oh no that would have been against our precepts we brought with us sufficient fertilized female ova removed from our faithful to supply us with the necessary diverse genetic balance to ensure that our community will last for centuries clever helva said not the least of our cleverness ship who sings just then helvas outside sensors picked up a little cough and she became aware that a covey of girls was standing just outside the hatch i think they wish to speak to you helvana the ship said come on in girls their faces either red with embarrassment or white with exultation the young women entered bowing with varying degrees of grace as the helvana had done towards helvas panel did the whole damned planet know where she lived the birds have flown helvana and some nearby have responded helvana nodded pleased enter the responses and report back when all have answered the girls left in a flurry but not before a second obeisance to helva youve trained avians as messengers it seemed wise since there are such distances between our communities and decisions must be circulated when necessary does every community have a helvana no i am the one so honored by my peers how long will you serve if that is the correct phrase it is you i serve the helvana said with great dignity when i know myself too old to continue intelligent administration my successor will be installed chosen from among those who are diligent in learning the canon and tradition of our circle well yes but lets get to the point do you have some safe refuge where you cant be found until the fleet arrives ravel supplies our defense helvana said again with the confident smile enlighten me then because i have every reason to fear for your safety you must look more closely at ravel dont tell me youve trained the predators to defend you no the planet itself will well if your defense is classified i assure you i wont disclose your methods but the kolnari are the most effective and ruthless fighting force of all humanoids they against other humans quite likely they have weaponryand helva was getting a bit tired of this womans selfconfident denial of any threatthat could turn this settlement into a cinder from the air and there was just a touch of fear in this helvanas voice youre lucky helva said dryly the kolnari strategy is based more on overwhelming their target with ground forces of course your satellite warning systemll be blasted out of space as soon as they spot it but the bunch thats headed here dont have any assault ships unless theyve modified some of the bigger yachts and all of them seem so full of bodies that i doubt they are armed with spacetosurface missiles too though helva added thoughtfully they could be however they think they have total surprise as an advantage to a quick rout the helvana crossed her arms and said not quite smugly then we shall not be harmed look their ships are crammed with bodies bodies which intend to take over this planet for their purposes which i assure you you wont like you have no armament we need none so you say but youve never seen the kolnari take over a planet let me just show you how they conquered helvana held up her hand god forfend hes not in a position to forfend anything look youve got to take precautions they are already in place what the planet itself and round and round we go helva said irked this is chloe all over again with a slightly different scenario she said allowing her irritation to show in her voice you wont be fried by the sun this time but by no and helvana held up a hand with such authority that helva broke off you will have noticed that our settlements large and small are walled not much good against kolnari battlearmored troops who will not get close enough to our walls nor do we go beyond them very often for it is the vegetation of ravel that is dangerous to all even the predators venture out only on cold nights when the planet sleeps come again helvanas smile just missed being a smirk and she cocked her head slightly at helva how much would these kolnari know about our planet only what is in the galactic atlas may i see that entry helva brought it up on the mainlounge screen and the helvana read it swiftly smiling her smile as she finished there have been no additions as promised i do wish i could be as confident as you are helva said the helvana rose the last time it was the primary which would destroy us this time the planet will work for us one question since the entry indicates a spaceport will the kolnari land there first to organize their invasion helva thought of that battered collection of ships they use whatevers available theyve enough ships to use all the space the landing field offers though in my judgment she added grimly some of them may not make a controlled landing she paused wondering if in those dilapidated buildings there were any emergency vehicles or equipment then she ruthlessly decided that a few kolnari would not be missed some are barely spaceworthy and one was leaking oxygen you must realize that this is the kolnaris lastgasp attempt to resettle theyll fight whatever you have in mind to put against them they must know this planet is a walkover not helvana paused with an inscrutable twist to her lips an easy walkover not by any means they do have arsenals of some pretty sophisticated weapons helva reminded her guest dont discount the possibility of an airtosurface barrage to soften you up helvana actually chuckled what bomb our fields and settlements if their object is to settle here they wouldnt destroy available housing or crops you dont know the kolnari as i do helvana dont treat this lightly i assure you i do not the woman said and her face assumed a concerned and serious expression our fields our homes would be targeted very likely although it is equally likely that fearing no resistance they may just land and march oh i do hope so said the helvana one moment her face brightening with something akin to triumph instantly fading to selfrecrimination we do not take pleasure in destruction of any kind on ravel even to save your lives your presence and your warning is sufficient the helvana rose i have no weapons no way to defend you helva said unable to keep the frustration and anger out of her voice the woman turned inclining her head that is known so you must seek safety yourself i know little of what transpires in other sections of the universe and your pictures showed us it is not a safe place in which to reside so you are at risk you have warned us we are advised we shall be safe go you to be safe too ship who sings i cant just leave you helvas voice rose and she could hear it resounding outside causing some of the women still gathered in groups in the plaza to turn around as you cannot defend yourself helvana said in a tone that implied helva was indeed more at risk than her adherents were you must depart i have much to organize well im glad to hear that helva said in a caustic tone the woman turned at the airlock made a deep and respectful obeisance and strode down the ramp immediately she began issuing commands that had all the onlookers scurrying to obey in moments the plaza was empty and the helvana had reentered the church or administration building or whatever it was well well and niall peered around the edge of the corridor that led to his quarters that one has style shes no smarter than that rabid ranting ascetic on chloe helvas voice crackled with anger as if im the one whos vulnerable what was that about the vegetation niall asked and close the hatch love i dont want someone peering in and catching sight of a maaaale he jiggled his hands in clownish antic and dragged out the last word what about the vegetation helva demanded irritably as she retracted the ramp and shut off access id say its dangerous and the power to the walls is to keep it at bay remember the roads here all with neat margins and havent been used and they employ birds to carry messages doesnt that suggest to you they dont wander much from the walls of their cloisters helva thought about that possibility as a weapon against the kolnari she demanded with trenchant incredulity we can cloak and watch niall said cocking his head slightly at something he had perceived that eluded her that lady seemed far too certain of their indigenous protections and we havent seen everything on this world yet now have we helva had been scanning with her exterior sensors and except for birds coming in to land on what she had initially thought to be multiple chimneys but were rooftop aviaries she reconsidered the situation im going to try another of their settlements she said and making sure there were no bodies anywhere near her lifted slowly the plaza was so hardpacked from much usage that only little swirls of dust marked her ascent she tried nine settlements medium small and another large one but each time the head woman of the group while respectful in all other ways replied that there was no need this time for the ship who sings to worry about ravellians but it was good of her to appear to warn them that a time of trial was coming helva tried to show the hologram and after the first horrified glances everyone turned their backs squeezing their eyes closed against the proof she tried to exhibit i dont think its a case of your losing your touch niall said kindly drumming silent fingers on the armrest they honestly believe theyre safe not that the mere odor of sanctity ever saved a saint and certainly wont save these sisters from the kolnari but in case youve been fretting too much to notice every single one of the walls around these cloisters is on full power wherere the sources thats something the kolnari will spot if they make even the most routine scan or aerial reconnaissance and helva was more afraid than ever on the previous occasion the expanding sun itself had provided proof positive of danger to the doubting religious what would it take to prove it this time and why was she stuck with this gullible lot again she kept trying and kept getting the same responses from all ninetyseven cloisters she visited on the way to the ninetyeighth they saw the spark of bright light in the sky that indicated the kolnari had just demolished the satellite nice of them to give us fair warning nows the time to cloak helva niall remarked his fingers in their restless dance on the armrests i have been while i was flying between these damnable stubborn towns she replied curtly and headed towards the pathetic landing field since it was there and nothing else on this vegetating world offered any other large cleared space as a comeon to the kolnari she figured that would be where the invaders would land at dawn she and niall arrived close enough to the landing site hovering just behind the nearest of the hills that surrounded the facility ahha niall said in a thoughtful drawl as he leaned across the control board to peer at the forward view screen he flipped on each of the exterior viewers reducing them to a patchwork that made helva almost dizzy until she spotted what had alerted him the landing field once unpatterned level soil had sprouted the most obscenelooking ground cover greasy slimy a sort of pus yellow and mold green no more than a few centimeters high undoubtedly it gave a smooth even appearance to anyone above those are not my favorite colors for a solid footing helva niall said in a low ominous tone lets just hover and shelter in our cloak excellent notion she said noticing on the port sensor near the prow of her ship that tendrils thrust up towards her lashing in their attempt to snare the ship she put more distance between herself and the ground very interesting indeed malevolent vegetation niall began rubbing his hands an unholy expression on his face serves the bastards right though lets hope their disintegrating metabolism doesnt affect the stuff theyre mean enough to poison anything that doesnt poison them first they may have met their match she replied willing to be convinced the first two kolnari ships to land were two of the heavier armed cruisers they landed smackdab in the middle of the greasy sward and instantly deployed their armored infantry units while gunners started setting up their portable projectile units they didnt as helva half expected them to take out the rickety old buildings which were now covered with viler chartreusey green vines not that the kolnari were apt to be colorconscious much less suspicious their home world was noted for its offputting appearance the troops marched off the landing field kicking their metallic booted feet at now calfhigh shrubs and bushes that impeded their progress ignorant of the fact that the growths were brandnew additions on the field they had split into four sections and each started off up one of the main tracks three more of the larger ships landed at one edge of the field crowded with additional troops who set off after the vanguard smaller units turning off at each arterial lane in quick succession the yachtsized spacecraft zoomed in one or two making such rough landings that they plowed their noses into the ground they were instantly covered with tendrils and twigs that shortly turned into thick branches wrapping about the ships tethering them to the field had these not been kolnari whose prime intent was capture and enslavement of the ravellians helva might have been tempted to warn those unarmed unsuited people who swarmed out of the ships coughing falling to the ground raising arms upward as if they had just been saved from dying of asphyxia they had but ravels indigenous vegetation vigorously began to engulf them consuming their stillliving forms to judge by the frantic greencovered contortions and the screams shrieks and tortured calls the seeking vines penetrated the open hatches cutting off the escape of any who saw what was happening and thought of seeking safety inside there was undoubtedly not even time for one of the more intelligent captains to warn off the rest of the armada which continued to touch down wherever they could remaining aloft did not seem to have been an option every passenger was in too much of a hurry to disembark to notice what had been happening to the earlier arrivals truly a just retribution has been meted out to them niall muttered a planet fighting back the verdure kept moving probing twining inserting itself everywhere bursting the seams of some of the oldest and most fragile vessels after all the violence they have dealt out to unsuspecting and innocent populations his voice trailed off and he snapped off the screen displays of the chartreuse catastrophe without a word helva lifted and started up the nearest track actually the one that headed towards the main settlement to see what the flora of ravel was doing to the armored infantry units the demise of the ground troopsnone of which reached even the nearest and smallest of the cloistersonly took a little longer though they didnt penetrate even within howling distance of any of the cloisters the weeds must exude some really corrosive kind of acid look at the pockmarksholes evenin some of that armor where the vine tips have lashed it niall said shaking his head in amazement how do the girls manage that stuff if it can do that to spaceworthy body armor i do not care so long as it is as effective as it seems to be belatedly realizing the danger they were in the bold kolnari were of course turning their weapons on the demon flora that was smothering them perhaps someone on the space field had lasted long enough to send out a message but on this field of battle the kolnari weapons increased rather than decreased the foe blasting or flaming the vegetable matter only caused it to fragment each part then expanding and multiplying into more attackers kolnari warriors in their heavy boots were being tripped up and once down became greeny yellow mounds of writhing shrubbery their power packs would have been infiltrated by vine tips their equipment shorted out safe now from kolnari weapons helva uncloaked and recorded the kolnari defeat focusing occasionally on what happened when flora was fragmented she stayed high enough above the carnage or did she mean vernage to avoid any contact she thoughtonly brieflyof trying to acquire a leaf or twig to preserveat maximum botanical securityfor later analysis in the high risk laboratories at central worlds ive never seen anything like it niall said shaking his head we do know that there are inimical planetary surfaces but one which can be contained tamed and used in emergencies one more for the files then he leaned back in the chair locking his fingers and rubbing his palms together with the great satisfaction he enjoyed at this totally unexpected kolnari defeat those lassies learned a thing or two didnt they about passive resistance passive wasnt what we just witnessed helva said drolly they simply let the nature of the planet take its course mind you somewhere in the ethics of their marian religiosity there must be a shibboleth about taking human lives ha i never considered the kolnari as humans was nialls response besides which the religious have as much right to protect themselves as any other lifeform they arent doing anything the planet is thats the beauty part ah yes and nialls tone turned sanctimonious suffer the meek for they shall inherit the earth of ravel in this case welldone ladies welldone he brought his hands together in a silent applause we should extend our felicities or you should i think the outcome was not only taken for granted but has been observed helva said and activated a longrange screen that showed little flocks of avians circling here and there before darting off so quickly not even helva could have plotted so many different course directions when helva touched down again in the plaza the helvana and a group of about fourteen awaited her they wore long black scarves and tightfitting black caps we come to mourn caesar not to praise him niall quoted get thee hence marc antony she replied warningly im going im going ill not attend this wake in mournful array youre already arrayed appropriately she called after his disappearing figure then opened her airlock and extended the ramp the deputation entered making obeisance to her until all had filed into the lounge their expression somber if respectful though some were redeyed with weeping there would be some tender hearts among such a group why theyd spend their tears on the kolnari when they knew what would have been their fate defeated helvas understanding but then she was not religious she spoke first not wishing to be embroiled in specious gratitude for this second inadvertent deliverance in which she had been only a passive spectator not the rescue vehicle i apologize helvana for doubting your efficiency and ingenuity the meek have indeed inherited this earth helva devoutly hoped that no one else heard the scoffing snort from the passageway we all deeply regret that we had to prove our invulnerability on ravel the helvana said in a slow sad tone we shall pray for their departed souls i sincerely doubt they had any helva said an acid remark that occasioned gasps of surprise from some of the younger women uncharitable of me i know but i have seen their form of conquest at firsthand i do not regret their destruction nor should any here shed any more remorseful tears or rue the incident the universe is now considerably safer after all none of you she paused briefly did anything your planet is well able to take care of unwanted visitors and has done so there was a brief awkward pause while the faithful dealt with the unexpected candor of their savior to fill in the silence helva went on how long will it take you to repair the damage to the space field and the tracks we may not the helvana said after glancing at her companions we keep in touch with the other cloisters and there is really no need for all to assemble at the same time each community is selfsufficient and there is no longer any need for the space field but youll keep the walls functioning a little smile tugged at the helvanas lips yes she inclined her head they are required to keep the flora of ravel in its place but surely those plant forms that have had such helva hesitated not wishing to upset the tenderhearted with the word fertilizing unexpected freedom will wish to retain it what needs to be restored will be it is a long and painstaking process and we have much to occupy ourselves in the normal course of our daily routine the helvana said one of her escort pulled at her sleeve yes of course and our eternal gratitude to you should have been spoken of first helvana said kindly to the woman we are once again in your debt ship who sings and once again have no way to repay your watchful guardianship if i said i only happened to be in the neighborhood would you believe me helva asked gently there was just a hint of a sparkle in the helvanas eyes as she caught the irony let us then hope that we have not caused you an unnecessary delay the helvana said no you have not helva replied more graciously perversely she really didnt want to destroy her reputation among the cloisters i will not be late arriving at my destination since she wasnt expected at regulus that was no lie more worldly remarks must be made however i shall apprise the fleet that they may stand down from the alert i sent out i shall report the demise that rattled them all but the helvana raised her hand and the startled expressions of dismay were silenced let not death be part of the message merely that the emergency has been dealt with the helvana said with great dignity so it shall be said helva replied solemnly though she was in honor bound to inform the fleet that the kolnari were well and truly annihilated if i may suggest it i would feel better if you let me have the satellite beacon replaced the one that the recent visitors blasted from your skies so you will not be further interrupted once the fate dealt the kolnari invaders was known no one would dare land on ravel may i attend to that detail for you there is a small group of our marian circle on vega iii the helvana said if you would be good enough to inform them that a replacement satellite is required they will attend to the expense and installation you need not be troubled with such a detail it would not trouble me helva said but i will inform your sisters in religion of the need and your continued safety no debt exists between us wise and good helvana i was here when i was needed as i was at chloe that is enough so be it the helvana said bowing her head in acceptance while the others murmured the same response then with firm gestures she led the delegation to the airlock standing to one side as each made proper obeisance to helvas column this took long enough so that helva was getting fidgety she adjusted her nutrient flow to account for the recent stress the helvana hesitated after she made her deep bow we shall pray for your lost partner she said and inclined her head in the direction of nialls cabin may you be comforted in his loss by another as worthy to hold his position as niall parollan she was gone leaving helva so stunned that she couldnt speak pray for me indeed snapped nialls crisp voice as he strode into the main cabin helva closed the airlock with a clang how did she know that piece of gossip niall went on and lets get off this planet gives me the creeps all those women weeping over kolnari much less me somehow helva went through the necessary routines to lift her shipself as adroitly as possible the plaza was clear of all save the helvana and her delegation backed up against the main building forming an orderly triangle on the steps with the helvana at the apex from her stern sensors helva saw the upturned faces as the faithful watched the sight of their ship ascending once again into the heavens from which she had come to succor them they never will believe you were just in the neighborhood you know niall said but there was an odd quirk to his lips at least that wise one wont we were helva replied more involved with figuring out how the helvana had known of nialls death when the woman had been no farther inside the ship than the airlock and the lounge what astonished her even more was that the helvanas blessing did comfort her once clear of the system helva sent out an allpoints saying that the emergency was over and that she could report the extermination of the remnants of the kolnari fleet full details would be presented at regulus on her arrival there she did not give an estimated time though she encountered several picket forces making all possible speed in obedience to her summons she knew they were disappointed about losing a chance to gain fame and promotion fighting the last remnants of the kolnari but she advised them that the ravellians were not people interested in having quests ever she could and did patch across the tapes she had taken of the disastrous kolnari defeat obliquely she kept her word to the helvana while still satisfying fleet intelligence what she didnt realize was that her reticence only added to the glamour surrounding her living legend she met up with the escort five days out of the regulus system two squadrons no less and with a commodore on board the nova class flagship commodore halliman reporting maam as escort for yourself and niall parollan was the initial message and there was the happily grinning commodore in fulldress uniform on the bridge of the battle cruiser he glanced around expecting to see helvas brawn i bring back the body of my scout niall parollan commodore she said more calmly than she expected she could the helvanas prayers were working i hadnt known the commodore was patently shocked and she could hear a murmur run around the bridge at such news my condolences and apologies you have sustained a great loss was he a casualty of the kolnari action niall parollan died quietly in his sleep the diagnosis was total systems failure caused by extreme age she said she went on before shed be asked the time and place of death stasis provided no clues he requested the ceremonies due his rank and service commodore she went on smiling inwardly at nialls idea of a reward for putting up with her for so many years only his just due maam we shall proceed with the arrangements immediately if that is your wish it is she said with a gentle sigh actually that program hadnt been such a bad idea at all it had given her time to become accustomed to the fact of nialls death death death where is thy sting grave thy victory our deepest sympathies said the commodore and saluted with solemn precision behind him she saw others come smartly to attention and salute the nh made inestimable contributions to the service niall was a paragon of partners she replied youll forgive me if i resume my silence she really didnt mean to misrepresent any facet of her recent history but there were certain details she intended to keep hidden in her head dont think thats going to get you off the hook of explaining the kolnari defeat my pet niall said he had been propping up a wall just beyond the view of the one screen she had activated to receive the commodores call and will i have performed my part there in true heroic form what else ill not have you go to your grave without every bit of honor due you and you did perform your designated role on ravel you stayed out of sight not entirely evidently niall said with a wicked grin waggling a finger at her if you mean that helvana womans little surprise remark forget that a lucky guess since she would have known id have to have had a brawn with me somewhere she knew me by name maybe she can talk to the dead and you are dead you know cant you stay down why should i miss my own obsequies how can you ask that of me he pressed one hand against his chest in dismay she laughed i should have known youd pull a tom sawyer he laughed too why not since you have provided me the ability to watch ive always wanted to hear what people thought of me you wont hear any candor at your funeral its not good manners to speak ill of the dead you know besides which i do not want psych checking my synapses for fear ive blown a few by concocting your holo program no one will see me my love i assure you he said she had intended to delete the program totally even the petabytes that had once stored it when she reached regulus base now she changed her mind he had the right to see the ceremony all of it from the slow march with his bier the atmosphere planes doing their wingtipping salute the volley of rifles the whole nine yards of changeless requiem for the honored dead this time she was not mourning the sudden unnecessary death of a beloved partner she was celebrating the long and fruitful life of a dear friend whom she would also never forget when the burial detail came to collect the mortal husk the stasis in the coffin replaced that in which she had held his body intact during her long journey home regulus officialdom turned out in force from the central worlds current administrative chief with every one of his aides in formaldress parade uniforms to the planetary governor in her very elegant black dress and fashionable hat to the parade of mixed armed services as well as whatever brawns were on the base and all the brawn trainees the service was just long enough a little longer and shed have believed the fulsome eulogies about the man they mourned who was sitting in the pilots chair and watching the entire show with the greatest of satisfaction shed remember that as the best part of the whole show i wouldnt have missed this for the damned horsehead nebula we never did get to he exclaimed several times as helva was parked where her cabin could not be seen from those either on the ground or on the raised platform for the dignitaries he could peer about wisecracking and reminiscing as he chose she did as she had done before and as it was expected of helva the ship who sings let the heavens resound with the poignant strains of the service song of evening and requiem but this time her tone was triumphant and as her last note died away across the cemetery and all the bowed heads she deleted nialls holographic program they left her alone until she had decided shed had enough solitude she ought to have held off deleting niall a few days longer but there was a time to end things and his funeral had been it then she contacted headquarters this is the xh requesting a new brawn she said and youd better arrange a time for the fleet to query me on that ravel incident i want it down on the records straight i want a top priority message to the marian circle cloister on vega iii that ravel needs to have its warning satellite replaced the kolnari blew the old one out of space new brawn repeated the woman who had responded to her call her brain had gone into neutral at being unexpectedly contacted by the xh yes a new brawn helva then repeated her other requests got them good please expedite and as soon as youve informed the brawn barracks of my availability patch me over whatever missions are currently available for a brain ship with my experience yes indeed xh yes indeed there was a pause through which helva heard only sharp excited words clipped off before she quite caught any of the agitated sentences surprise always gives you an advantage she laughed with pure vindictive satisfaction as the brawn barracks erupted with people hastily flinging on tunics or fixing their hair or adjusting buttons the scene brought back fond memories as the young men and women all determined to win this prize of prizes raced to be first aboard her they had not quite reached the ramp when she suddenly became aware of a hazy object the outlines were misty but it was niall parollan striding to her column laying his cheek once more against the panel that covered her dont give the next one any more grief than you gave me will you love he started to turn away his outline noticeably fading and if you ever use that sorg prosthesis with anyone else but me ill kill him got that she thought she muttered something as she watched his image drift to the hull by the forward screen not towards the airlock just as she heard the stampede of the brawns outside he disappeared altogether with one last wave of a hand that seemed to flow into the metal of her shipself permission to come aboard maam a breathless voice asked my she mary rosenblum mary rosenblum is the author of four science fiction novels including her latest horizons and the drylands which won the

rosenblum is also the author of four mystery novels lately she has returned her short fiction roots but is currently working on a young adult fantasy novel and an alternate history project communication is power and this tale is a story of communication on a couple of levels but it also tackles one of rosenblums favorite themes where does the boundary lie between human and nonhuman i wait outside the speaking chamber where the young speakers learn to hear and speak the walls and carpeted floor are purest white the color of this god place and the speakers who live here walk by all dressed in white like the walls and the floor their palms on the shoulders of their guides they all look the same with their pale hair and pale eyes only their smell tells me who they are i am a guide for my speaker until she puts on the robe and is sent to another place to speak between the worlds for the citizens then i will have a new pup to raise i will miss this puppy her scent comes to me from beneath the door of the learning room smelling of trying hard and not sure she is never sure my she not since i first came to her when she was just small i sometimes smell her silent tears at night and slip into her room from my cubicle to lie beside her she strokes the fur on my head and shoulders and it comforts her it is our secretkept secret i think because she does not know if it is permitted for me to sleep on her bed at night i myself do not know even after all these years here never before have i slept beside a pup in my chargeperhaps there is nothing wrong perhaps there is but it is our secret and it binds us when i sleep in her bed i hear my litterbrother in my dreams and i like that i miss him always i will miss her when she leaves unless they finally send me with her the way they sent my litterbrother with his speaker but they say i am good at raising puppies and they have not sent me with a newlyrobed speaker yet while i wait for her i pull out my brothers last mail to me the tiny disk feels cool and hard in my palm diskmail is not expensive but it is slow this disk traveled in four ships before it found its way here from the colony world where my brother now lives but we guides are servants and servants are not entitled to use the speakers they are for citizens only perhaps they think that because we mostly smell to each other that we do not need to speak with words but we cannot smell between the stars i would like to speak to my litterbrother and hear his answer i will never see him again except on my shes bed there he speaks to me tells me how he misses me we used to wrestle in the meadow around the school where we were raised chasing each other into the creek splashing and laughing sometimes it snowed and i still dream of snow cold and white stinging my palms and the soles of my feet tingly as it melted in my fur there is no snow in the convent only spring forever the door opens and i have been dreaming of snow and my brother i am not ready i leap to my feet ears going flat siri where are you her hand goes out and i step beneath it so that my shoulder fur comes up against her palm i feel the tickle of her mind finding my eyes and the whitewalled corridor blurs just a bit as our minds share my eyes i wonder if that is how i speak to my brother when i sleep in her bed i had a mail from my litterbrother i tell her she understands litters the speaker puppies are born in litters of ten we walk down the hall and i see that she is heading for the garden in the center of the convent sadness darkens her scent and i reach up to touch her hand lightly wanting to make the smell go away you dont understand she shrugs me off but she does not smell angry what if i fail fail the word chills me my puppies to do not fail have never failed we step out into sunlight soft and gentle through the dome water trickles and the rich tapestry of dirt smells the small beings that inhabit this space the breath of the water itself make me dizzy most of the convent is clean of such smells she sits on a bench covered with bright chips of color and i squat beside her leaning lightly against her thigh because that comforts her her fingers slide into the long fur on the back of my neck and that makes me shiver who said you would fail my speakermistress her words are low and she smells sharp unhappy the one who trains me i hear more than the voice im tuning to i cant shut the others out but i dont listen to them she smells distress and a tinge of anger i am good i would not listen to any other voice i would not speak the god words to another not ever i wincei cannot stop myselfbecause her fingers digging in hurt me she lets go and covers her face with her hands i am not trying to hear them i listen only for the voice that speaks to me too sensitive she said the speakermistress her voice is hard to hear but she smells frightened she said it could not be that my genes will not permit it i shiver as if i am a puppy again and have played too long in the snow will they make me leave she does not understand maybe none of them do speaking only the god words hearing the god words is all there is for them only speakers live here in the convent and we servants no one leaves except on a ship to hear and speak in another place so that the citizens can talk between the stars the way my brother left with the new speaker assigned to him i try to distract her i can smell the vanilla orchids opening and she loves them even she can smell them with her poor dead nose and she loves the touch of their thick petals so i take her to them and she puts on a face that means she is happy but she smells sad and i smell afraid she is my puppy she was given to me to raise and none of my puppies have ever failed if she fails i will no longer speak to my litterbrother in my dreams i wake in darkness and smell her tears i leave my cushion and pad across the carpet in the soft warm darkness slipping on to the soft mattress beside her she puts her arm around me and buries her face in the fur that covers my shoulders i can feel the wetness of her tears as they soak my fur like the melting snow so long ago but warm she reeks of sorrow but no fear how can she truly know fear i envy her that tell me about snow she says it is frozen water it falls from the skies tell me more tell me about when you were a child she is using her command voice and its hard very hard to say no to her even though we do not speak of things outside not in here the god of speakers will be angry the god of speakers is only angry at you one time but if she has failed so i shrug what can it hurt now i was never a child the tail stub that doesnt show under my coveralls wriggles in amusement but my litter was born in a place where winterthe cold time when snow fallslasts a very long time so we were old enough to play in it before we were old enough to be sent to our homes you were young so you were a child we are not called children when we are young i flatten my ears uneasy never has one of my young speakers talked to me like this i suddenly want to tell her our people have forever served yours even as i serve you now i do not understand but she has stopped thinking about it and she smells wistful i keep wondering what type of world they will send me to i dreamed of snow you know snow white fluffy flakes falling from a gray sky and two furry creatures chasing each other through humps of white was that you she smells happy did i dream of you i flatten my ears and nod i hoped they would send me to a world with snow she buries her face in my fur again but will they send me anywhere now my ears are tight to my head and my nose quivers i want to point to the moon that i remember but cannot see here and want to howl i have not howled since i was a puppy far younger than my she instead i kiss her cheek and let her soak my fur with her warmsnowmelt tears and my howl fills my belly when she is gone my litterbrother will be gone too i dream of my brother we are playing chase in the snow and it glitters like stardust from a thousand frozen galaxies as he catches me and we tumble over and over in the cold dry whiteness then we are curled together in our sleeping place warm dreaming that was a long long time ago before we learned to be servants before we left to guard the speaker pups i will never forget the smell of him how can i forget you he blinks green eyes in the darkness and his tongue curls over his white white teeth we dream together every night once in his mail he sent me a map of the place where he is a sweep of glittering stars with their silent planets he had flagged the world he was on a mote of darkness in that sea of light you are younger than i now could be my puppy i tell him and nuzzle his ears that is what happens when you sleep on the slow ships that carry living things you look like you always look he says and then we romp off to play in the snow my she stirs and wakes and stares up into the darkness my dream is gone my litterbrothers voice is gone and even when she finally falls asleep again it does not return she is quiet this morning i take her to the dining room her hand on my shoulder she is not using my eyes is looking inward walking in darkness trusting me to guide her feet i bring her breakfast and take my own plate to squat along the wall with the others like me their ears flick and flatten as i pass and they smell sympathy for me ah well we know before anyone else always i have no appetite for my roll this morning but i eat it i am a good servant each litter of young speakers sits at its own table ten together the oldest and tallest near the front the young ones with their servants close in the rear near the big doors the room is light and warm i have made many trips across it over the years moving from door to the front of the room then back to the door as my puppy assumes the speakers gown and departs and i am assigned to a new puppy now my she sits at the front table with her litter all identical with the same whitegold hair braided down their backs the same white coveralls that mark them as speakersintraining the same faces and pale lavender unseeing eyes only the smell identifies them my she smells sad and this morning afraid perhaps even among the speakers the news is spreading perhaps even they with their nearlydead noses can smell failure the litters rise together at their tables the youngest first to return to their meditation where they can learn to hear the words of god across the space between the stars one after another we rise as we smell our puppy and we follow and it occurs to me as they passidentical hair identical pale sightless eyes identically curved spines and graceful fingersthat they are as created as we are that is a blasphemous thought because we are taught that citizens are not created servants are i rise to join my she and i feel her arm brush against my shoulder secretly i smell sympathy from the other servants and think that she is like us i should not think it but i do after breakfast we go to the room where she learns to hear the god words but when she gets there an old one like she waits for her wearing the full robe of a speaker her servant flicks his ears at me then flattens them slightly and my own flatten in return i want to squeeze against my she and comfort her she lowers herself before the speaker like any pup respectfully but her fear stings my nose and my ears flick back and forth your presence is requested at council the speaker offers a hand the dna analysis came back my she doesnt move i take her hand place it in the speakers hand it feels dead heavy without life yes the speaker closes her hand around my shes and then releases it walking away with her hand on her servants shoulder the council room is white but the table and the chairs are brown made of dead trees from the home world i was not born on the home world i know that world is at the far end of the stars too far to visit farther even than my litterbrother but the speakers can speak there they can hear a whisper on the far far away world i am proud to be a servant to speaker pups but the scent of the room keeps my ears flat and the others along the wall smell sympathy for me as we come in three speakers wait at the table their robes all around their feet their faces creased and wrinkled like a pile of clothes that has been slept on they smell very old and of power the fur on my neck stirs and rises even though that is not permitted here i flatten my ears but i cannot make my fur lie down i sit along the wall with the others the power to speak is all they murmur all together the power to hear is all they bow their heads except my she she has seated herself but her eyes are on the far wall the speaker is a pure being the speaker who smells oldest the one who made my fur stand up speaks in a thousand years the purity has been maintained only those of that purity can speak between the worlds with the words of god what is the holy trinity she speaks command and my throat wants to answer her a pure life a pure mind and a pure body my shes voice is so soft even i can barely hear it you have never compromised the purity of your life nor of your mind the powerful speaker whispers on but even in the sanctity of the convents purity must be defended always how can i be impure my she rises smelling of anger now i came into being here i have nine siblings they are pure you cannot have found anything wrong it is a tiny mutation another of the powerful old ones speaks a small thing it occurred late in gestation after our final test predecantation we will expand our testing after this and we have alerted the other convents i can block out the other voices i can concentrate on the one im supposed to hear communication is the neurosystem that holds our civilization together flesh and blood impure as we are we must emulate the purity of electronics interpretation alteration destroys purity but i dont the quantum effect is doubled by the mutation that is why you hear more than the voice you tune to but i can communication must be pure perfect private there is no room for impurity the oldsmelling powersmelling one stands even her standing is a command the others stand with her and their servants leap into position my she does not react as i reach her side refusing my sight keeping her face turned to the wall as the others file out the last one out the door the one who came to summon her smells sad only she we stand there for a long time after the others have left my fur no longer stands up but my ears are still flat to my head and the howl that has troubled me has returned to knot in my gut finally she stirs and the room shimmers as she takes my sight she strides out of the room and i have to almost trot to stay with her it is dinner time and my stomach growls as we pass the corridor that leads to the dining room and the scent of fish stew wafts out but my she marches on past servants like myself moving floaters piled with laundry or stacked with goods that came in as tithe from the citizen communities around the convent we pass into the old hallways in the center of the convent the ones that were built long ago perhaps before my geneline even existed when my ancestors still ran on four feet and ate from the floor i know where she is going we come here sometimes and she always smells thoughtful it is after these visits that she often wants me to creep onto the bed with her at last we reach it the center of the old convent the room with eight sides and the old dark screens that once my she told me offered information the way a holographic window does now and in the very center of that center room stands the statue she stops in front of it it is of two women standing palm to palm i dont know what it is made fromnone of the materials in the convent smell like it and i never smelled anything like it when i was a pup even the taste when i once licked it is strange but it is smooth and milky and the eyes of the two women seemed to gleam with faint light the same pale lavender as the speakers eyes as my shes eyes once upon a time more than a millennium ago a pair of identical twins were born they were born disabled because at that time people couldnt read dna well enough to fix it her words stumble here and her smell of sadness makes me want to kiss her cheek but when i lean gently against her she steps away no one else could do what they did so they preserved the geneline and thus was the origin of the convents purity of thought word and deed you must not know the words you hear you must only repeat them perfectly and only to the one you are tuned to her face is dry but she smells like crying i want to press against her but i stay still i am impure her voice grows softer deeper perhaps my dna has betrayed me but my mind betrayed me first making me wonder why why can we not know history why can we not know the world outside the dome why can we not simply speak when we choose to whom we choose why only here only the words that are given us without understanding what those words mean she smells angry again now and i flick my ears forward and back fighting an urge to crouch low the convents exist on every inhabited planet her face looks strange and tight and there are no speakers other than at the convents communication is valuable i dont understand but her angry smell makes my neck fur rise wanting to protect her how can i think such thoughts she clenches both her pale hands now no wonder my dna betrayed me my impure thoughts must have warped it where will i go now what can i do if i cannot speak to the stars who will i speak to the howl knotted in my gut nearly escapes but i flatten my ears and crouch in spite of myself forcing it down even when she uses my eyes she cannot see me without a mirror and for that i am now grateful there are no mirrors here and if she looked in my eyes she would see the truth perhaps ill end up a servant like you her shoulders droop cleaning the gardens or cooking in the kitchen ive never seen one of our type as a servant before not many fail i suppose not many fail i shiver glad that she is not touching me to feel my crouch my shiver glad that she can not smell i am old but the speakers that smell old tell me that i am a good puppy raiser will they give me a new small one tomorrow next week then i will sit at the table nearest the door with my small puppy while she learns how to eat and walk and speak will i ever need to slip onto her bed at night will she ever wet my neck fur with warm snowmelt tears will i ever speak with my litterbrother again nested in our dreams perhaps she is right and she is impure we are all impure us servants here we cannot speak and we know far too much for purity perhaps my dreams have made her impure weve missed dinner she gropes for me finally and i place myself beneath her palm take me to the garden and then you can go to the kitchen and get food im not hungry but i want you to eat they are waiting for her in her room or in the garden i smell the traces of tension in the air circulating through the room the smell of distress like bitter smoke in my nose we always know she starts forward knowing the way to the garden without my eyes i step in front of her and she bumps into me smelling surprised stumbling back a step siri what happened whats wrong not to the garden i tell her why not they will be gentle they will be kind the way they are when we grow too old for our duties that gentleness will come to me sooner rather than later i am gray now i have traveled the room many times from back to front no speaker leaves the convent except to a new world i say and the howl in my gut thickens the words what do you mean that ill be servant here i do not answer and i do not need to she knows that none of her kind serve here i smell her sharpening fear theres no way out her eyes are round now reflecting the dim light in the room where would i go if i could escape what would i do i take her hand firmly the corridor on the far side of the statue smells like old air and longdead small things we know everything we who serve she shuffles after me clinging to my hand and i hurry because if i go slowly the fear will fill her and she will stop at the end of the corridor is a narrow space one that brought air perhaps or heat or some kind of small cargo we have to crawl and she can only touch me briefly so she loses her sight but she hurries perhaps afraid that i might leave her if she could smell she would know that i would never leave her but she cannot smell so i harden my heart against her fear and hurry fear of being left behind will keep her moving at the far end of the small corridor an old corroded screen gives way reluctantly tangled in green vines that fill the air with the sweetsharp scent of their injuries a shout that fills the night air but the speakers have no nose and none of us will tell i emerge and stand helping her up the two moons of this worldsmall and strange one blue one reddishfloat against a blazing ceiling of stars where are we she gasps i take her hand pull her the door is small not one for cargo but for the people who must come and go no one can get in but the speakers see no need to lock it from this side you only go through a door if you have permission i do not have permission terror rises up out of my bowels like a black snake filling me as i place my palm against the door and i reek into the night air i wet myself and almost almost turn and flee releasing that knotted howl into the safe darkness of the convent but she has shared my dreams and brought me to my brother i place both palms against the door although pain sears me as if it is red hot it swings open silent and i stumble through falling to my knees i feel her hands on me and i smell her worry she is afraid for me not for herself i am all right i tell her standing up my whole body shivers with reaction but her arms around me her worry for me fills me with strength none of my pups have ever worried about me the convent sits in the middle of the city it has many needs and many of us fill those needs every day and we all share so i know the city even though i have never walked it and it frightens me how easily we left it but then none of them try to leave only this one the puppy who shares my dreams it is warm this night but her clothesthe white coverall of a speakerintrainingseem to shine like the midday sun the narrow alley that leads to this door opens into a wide street i see lights and shops and eating places and smell people happy and angry and hungry and full i smell my own kind too we servants are everywhere people have always had servants garden grows along the wall surrounding the convent like the garden within but smelling of people and city and no vanilla orchids i take her to a bench in the deeper darkness against the wall her clothes still shine like the moon i remember or the snow my litterbrother and i rolled in but she will be hard to see from the street she smells fear but more than that she smells curious i hear things i smell food what is it likelet me see but i am afraid i have to find you clothes so that people dont see you and know what you are what are we going to do siri the fear smell gets briefly stronger i dont know but i dont want to say that i will be back stay here and be quiet and you will be safe i hurry down the narrow alley to the main street but there i stroll sorting the thick woven fabric of scent for what i need people dont see me they dont really see any of our kind their eyes skate over us and past as if we live on the other side of an invisible wall as if we all live within a convent i smell my kind a strong home smell and i follow it unraveling it from the tapestry of food and peoplelust of happy smells and sad smells it leads me to an alley that opens to another like it a courtyard of clean paving surrounded by the back side of tall housebuildings and shops small apartments line the walls of this small courtyard along with shops lit dimly or not at all unlike the shops on the main street one smells open i sniff the doorway smelling food herbs dust invitation the shopkeeper pricks his ears at me and smells a question i need clothes i tell him in the common tongue although it is forbidden for me to speak it i am not supposed to know the common tongue because the speakers cannot know the words they repeat but of course we servants know everything his ears flick another question at me and he smells surprised because of course the simple coverall i wear in the convent is quite good not worn at all not for me i flatten my ears in quick apology for a friend a people friend now he smells wary a friend of us and he smells truth so he shrugs and rummages in bins behind his small counter smelling doubtful because he does not sell to people just to us but he drags a long cloak out into the light and shakes it i smell old dust insect wings and summer and sneeze i have seen a few cloaks on the street on my way here enough like this that she will pass and it will hide her conventwhiteness he wants money of course i have no money as the servant for a speakerintraining i have no time of my own to trade with others in the convent so have not amassed the coins that we use among ourselves i flatten my ears in apology and smell need for that cloak now his ears flatten and he smells thoughtful and crafty bring your people here he finally says and he reeks now of curiosity i cannot hide the smell of my relief and that makes his ears prick again we servants love a good story and clearly i am going to have one to show him never mind tell i take the cloak roll it tightly and run down the narrow alleyofus to the main street where i once again strollinvisible to those peopleeyesto the garden my ears are flat with worry by the time i reach the convent alley even though i have been gone a short time they may be looking for her someone may have wandered into the night shadows to see her whiteness but she is there her sightless eyes turned upward her hands palm up on her thighs she no longer smells afraid i touch her inviting her to use my eyes and see the cloak and the garden shadows there is no place for me out here she smells peace as she says these words but a whiff of darkness lurks behind that peace and it makes the hair on my shoulders bristle we will find you a place i tell her and i drape the cloak around her shoulders she raises a fold to her nose it smells like you where are we going to go to a place to pay for the cloak that smells of us i do not think the convent will look for you there i am sure of it the hair on my face is gray and i have lived all my life among the people in the convent they will not think that the servant led her we are eyes only a tool to use they will look for her among the people of the city i take her hand people do not walk with their hands on our shoulders the way they do in the convent out here they have their own eyes but all she needs is a touch to use my eyes i feel the effort she makes to walk easily on this strange street and she smells fear even though she does not show it i am full of pride for this puppy she is much stronger than any other pup i have raised she is different perhaps it is not my fault perhaps i have not contaminated her after all i lead her past the shops and through the crowds of people who see only a slight woman wearing a cloak walking handinhand with her servant the foodsmells make my stomach hurt because it has been a long time since i ate my breakfast roll but i have no coins and i fear to take her into a shop where someone might speak to her her head tilts and her steps begin to drag she smells shocked they are speaking words she whispers to me almost too low to hear the god words they are speaking the tongue that everyone speaks i tell her softly i want to kiss her cheek to comfort her they are only god words to you now her feet stumble and i pause smelling fear so strong that for a minute i think that even the people with their dead noses might notice what are we she breathes my blasphemous thought comes to me that she is as created as i only now i think that she is more created than i i have been created to be a servant but she has been created to be a machine i relax a bit when we reach the darkness of the alley by now the convent must guess that she has left they probably record our traffic in and out of the small door and now they will know that she left with me they will not look for her here they will not even know that here exists the shopkeepers eyes widen as we enter his shop and her hair catches the light from beneath her hood he reeks curiosity now welcome he says and flattens himself almost like a puppy in front of her she doesnt understand any more than she can smell i shrug she has run away his eyes narrow and his ears flick nervously but he smells thoughtful rather than afraid why did you bring her here she speaks to my litterbrother my ears flatten in spite of myself and i cannot keep my lips from drawing back from my teeth he is on a star a long shiptravel from here when i sleep next to her i speak with him i know my teeth are showing now and his eyes burn bright in the dim light of the shop my she was wrong when she thought that speakingacrossthestars brought the convents money it brought them power they can speak for us too the words sound deep in my throat like a growl his eyes gleam in the darkness and i think for a moment that i can see the moon of my puppyhood reflected in them only citizens can speak across the stars she can speak for us the shoulders of giants robert j sawyer robert j sawyer is the author of twenty novels including hominids which won the hugo award the terminal experiment which won the

herbert niven and all the others upon whose shoulders the sf writers of my generation are fortunate enough to stand it seemed like only yesterday when id died but of course it was almost certainly centuries ago i wish the computer would just tell me dammitall but it was doubtless waiting until its sensors said i was sufficiently stable and alert the irony was that my pulse was surely racing out of concern forestalling it speaking to me if this was an emergency it should inform me and if it wasnt it should let me relax finally the machine did speak in its crisp feminine voice hello toby welcome back to the world of the living where id thought id spoken the word but no sound had come out i tried again where are we exactly where we should be decelerating toward soror i felt myself calming down how is ling shes reviving as well the others all fortyeight cryogenics chambers are functioning properly said the computer everybody is apparently fine that was good to hear but it wasnt surprising we had four extra cryochambers if one of the occupied ones had failed ling and i would have been awoken earlier to transfer the person within it into a spare whats the date june id expected an answer like that but it still took me back a bit twelve hundred years had elapsed since the blood had been siphoned out of my body and oxygenated antifreeze had been pumped in to replace it wed spent the first of those years accelerating and presumably the last one decelerating and the rest the rest was spent coasting at our maximum velocity kms one percent of the speed of light my father had been from glasgow my mother from los angeles they had both enjoyed the quip that the difference between an american and a european was that to an american a hundred years was a long time and to a european a hundred miles is a big journey but both would agree that twelve hundred years and lightyears were equally staggering values and now here we were decelerating in toward tau ceti the closest sunlike star to earth that wasnt part of a multiplestar system of course because of that this star had been frequently examined by earths search for extraterrestrial intelligence but nothing had ever been detected nary a peep i was feeling better minute by minute my own blood stored in bottles had been returned to my body and was now coursing through my arteries my veins reanimating me we were going to make it tau ceti happened to be oriented with its north pole facing toward sol that meant that the technique developed late in the twentieth century to detect planetary systems based on subtle blueshifts and redshifts of a star tugged now closer now farther away was useless with it any wobble in tau cetis movements would be perpendicular as seen from earth producing no doppler effect but eventually earthorbiting telescopes had been developed that were sensitive enough to detect the wobble visually and it had been frontpage news around the world the first solar system seen by telescopes not inferred from stellar wobbles or spectral shifts but actually seen at least four planets could be made out orbiting tau ceti and one of them there had been formulas for decades first popularized in the rand corporations study habitable planets for man every sciencefiction writer and astrobiologist worth his or her salt had used them to determine the life zonesthe distances from target stars at which planets with earthlike surface temperatures might exist a goldilocks band neither too hot nor too cold and the second of the four planets that could be seen around tau ceti was smackdab in the middle of that stars life zone the planet was watched carefully for an entire yearone of its years that is a period of earth days two wonderful facts became apparent first the planets orbit was damn near circularmeaning it would likely have stable temperatures all the time the gravitational influence of the fourth planet a jovian giant orbiting at a distance of half a billion kilometers from tau ceti probably was responsible for that and second the planet varied in brightness substantially over the course of its twentyninehourandseventeenminute day the reason was easy to deduce most of one hemisphere was covered with land which reflected back little of tau cetis yellow light while the other hemisphere with a much higher albedo was likely covered by a vast ocean no doubt given the planets fortuitous orbital radius of liquid wateran extraterrestrial pacific of course at a distance of lightyears it was quite possible that tau ceti had other planets too small or too dark to be seen and so referring to the earthlike globe as tau ceti ii would have been problematic if an additional world or worlds were eventually found orbiting closer in the systems planetary numbering would end up as confusing as the scheme used to designate saturns rings clearly a name was called for and giancarlo dimaio the astronomer who had discovered the halfland halfwater world gave it one soror the latin word for sister and indeed soror appeared at least as far as could be told from earth to be a sister to humanitys home world soon we would know for sure just how perfect a sister it was and speaking of sisters wellokay ling woo wasnt my biological sister but wed worked together and trained together for four years before launch and id come to think of her as a sister despite the press constantly referring to us as the new adam and eve of course wed help to populate the new world but not together my wife helena was one of the fortyeight others still frozen solid ling wasnt involved yet with any of the other colonists but well she was gorgeous and brilliant and of the two dozen men in cryosleep twentyone were unattached ling and i were cocaptains of the pioneer spirit her cryocoffin was like mine and unlike all the others it was designed for repeated use she and i could be revived multiple times during the voyage to deal with emergencies the rest of the crew in coffins that had cost only a piece instead of the six million each of ours was worth could only be revived once when our ship reached its final destination youre all set said the computer you can get up now the thick glass cover over my coffin slid aside and i used the padded handles to hoist myself out of its black porcelain frame for most of the journey the ship had been coasting in zero gravity but now that it was decelerating there was a gentle push downward still it was nowhere near a full g and i was grateful for that it would be a day or two before i would be truly steady on my feet my module was shielded from the others by a partition which id covered with photos of people id left behind my parents helenas parents my real sister her two sons my clothes had waited patiently for me for twelve hundred years i rather suspected they were now hopelessly out of style but i got dressedid been naked in the cryochamber of courseand at last i stepped out from behind the partition just in time to see ling emerging from behind the wall that shielded her cryocoffin morning i said trying to sound blasé ling wearing a blue and gray jumpsuit smiled broadly good morning we moved into the center of the room and hugged friends delighted to have shared an adventure together then we immediately headed out toward the bridge halfwalking halffloating in the reduced gravity howd you sleep asked ling it wasnt a frivolous question prior to our mission the longest anyone had spent in cryofreeze was five years on a voyage to saturn the pioneer spirit was earths first starship fine i said you okay replied ling but then she stopped moving and briefly touched my forearm did youdid you dream brain activity slowed to a virtual halt in cryofreeze but several members of the crew of cronusthe saturn missionhad claimed to have had brief dreams lasting perhaps two or three subjective minutes spread over five years over the span that the pioneer spirit had been traveling there would have been time for many hours of dreaming i shook my head no what about you ling nodded yes i dreamt about the strait of gibraltar ever been there no its spains southernmost boundary of course you can see across the strait from europe to northern africa and there were neandertal settlements on the spanish side lings phd was in anthropology but they never made it across the strait they could clearly see that there was more landanother continentonly thirteen kilometers away a strong swimmer can make it and with any sort of raft or boat it was eminently doable but neandertals never journeyed to the other side as far as we can tell they never even tried and you dreamt i dreamt i was part of a neandertal community there a teenage girl i guess and i was trying to convince the others that we should go across the strait go see the new land but i couldnt they werent interested there was plenty of food and shelter where we were finally i headed out on my own trying to swim it the water was cold and the waves were high and half the time i couldnt get any air to breathe but i swam and i swam and then yes she shrugged a little and then i woke up i smiled at her well this time were going to make it were going to make it for sure we came to the bridge door which opened automatically to admit us although it squeaked something fierce while doing so its lubricants must have dried up over the last twelve centuries the room was rectangular with a double row of angled consoles facing a large screen which currently was off distance to soror i asked into the air the computers voice replied million kilometers i nodded about three times the distance between earth and its moon screen on view ahead overrides are in place said the computer ling smiled at me youre jumping the gun partner i was embarrassed the pioneer spirit was decelerating toward soror the ships fusion exhaust was facing in the direction of travel the optical scanners would be burned out by the glare if their shutters were opened computer turn off the fusion motors powering down said the artificial voice visual as soon as youre able i said the gravity bled away as the ships engines stopped firing ling held on to one of the handles attached to the top of the console nearest her i was still a little groggy from the suspended animation and just floated freely in the room after about two minutes the screen came on tau ceti was in the exact center a baseballsized yellow disk and the four planets were clearly visible ranging from peasized to as big as grape magnify on soror i said one of the peas became a billiard ball although tau ceti grew hardly at all more said ling the planet grew to softball size it was showing as a wide crescent perhaps a third of the disk illuminated from this angle andthankfully fantasticallysoror was everything wed dreamed it would be a giant polished marble with swirls of white cloud and a vast blue ocean and part of a continent was visible emerging out of the darkness and it was green apparently covered with vegetation we hugged again squeezing each other tightly no one had been sure when wed left earth soror could have been barren the pioneer spirit was ready regardless in its cargo holds was everything we needed to survive even on an airless world but wed hoped and prayed that soror would be welljust like this a true sister another earth another home its beautiful isnt it said ling i felt my eyes tearing it was beautiful breathtaking stunning the vast ocean the cottony clouds the verdant land and oh my god i said softly oh my god what said ling dont you see i asked look ling narrowed her eyes and moved closer to the screen what on the dark side i said she looked again oh she said there were faint lights sprinkled across the darkness hard to see but definitely there could it be volcanism asked ling maybe soror wasnt so perfect after all computer i said spectral analysis of the light sources on the planets dark side predominantly incandescent lighting color temperature kelvin i exhaled and looked at ling they werent volcanoes they were cities soror the world wed spent twelve centuries traveling to the world wed intended to colonize the world that had been dead silent when examined by radio telescopes was already inhabited the pioneer spirit was a colonization ship it wasnt intended as a diplomatic vessel when it had left earth it had seemed important to get at least some humans off the mother world two smallscale nuclear warsnuke i and nuke ii as the media had dubbed themhad already been fought one in southern asia the other in south america it appeared to be only a matter of time before nuke iii and that one might be the big one seti had detected nothing from tau ceti at least not by but earth itself had only been broadcasting for a century and a half at that point tau ceti might have had a thriving civilization then that hadnt yet started using radio but now it was twelve hundred years later who knew how advanced the tau cetians might be i looked at ling then back at the screen what should we do ling tilted her head to one side im not sure on the one hand id love to meet them whoever they are but but they might not want to meet us i said they might think were invaders and and weve got fortyeight other colonists to think about said ling for all we know were the last surviving humans i frowned well thats easy enough to determine computer swing the radio telescope toward sol system see if you can pick anything up that might be artificial just a sec said the female voice a few moments later a cacophony filled the room static and snatches of voices and bits of music and sequences of tones overlapping and jumbled fading in and out i heard what sounded like englishalthough strangely inflectedand maybe arabic and mandarin and were not the last survivors i said smiling theres still life on earthor at least there was years ago when those signals started out ling exhaled im glad we didnt blow ourselves up she said now i guess we should find out what were dealing with at tau ceti computer swing the dish to face soror and again scan for artificial signals doing so there was silence for most of a minute then a blast of static and a few bars of music and clicks and bleeps and voices speaking in mandarin and english and no said ling i said face the dish the other way i want to hear whats coming from soror the computer actually sounded miffed the dish is facing toward soror it said i looked at ling realization dawning at the time wed left earth wed been so worried that humanity was about to snuff itself out we hadnt really stopped to consider what would happen if that didnt occur but with twelve hundred years faster spaceships would doubtless have been developed while the colonists aboard the pioneer spirit had slept some dreaming at an indolent pace other ships had zipped past them arriving at tau ceti decades if not centuries earlierlong enough ago that theyd already built human cities on soror damn it i said god damn it i shook my head staring at the screen the tortoise was supposed to win not the hare what do we do now asked ling i sighed i suppose we should contact them weah we might be from the wrong side i grinned well we cant both be from the wrong side besides you heard the radio mandarin and english anyway i cant imagine that anyone cares about a war more than a thousand years in the past and excuse me said the ships computer incoming audio message i looked at ling she frowned surprised put it on i said pioneer spirit welcome this is jod bokket manager of the derluntin space station in orbit around soror is there anyone awake on board it was a mans voice with an accent unlike anything id ever heard before ling looked at me to see if i was going to object then she spoke up computer send a reply the computer bleeped to signal that the channel was open this is dr ling woo cocaptain of the pioneer spirit two of us have revived there are fortyeight more still in cryofreeze well look said bokkets voice itll be days at the rate youre going before you get here how about if we send a ship to bring you two to derluntin we can have someone there to pick you up in about an hour they really like to rub it in dont they i grumbled what was that said bokket we couldnt quite make it out ling and i consulted with facial expressions then agreed sure said ling well be waiting not for long said bokket and the speaker went dead bokket himself came to collect us his spherical ship was tiny compared with ours but it seemed to have about the same amount of habitable interior space would the ignominies ever cease docking adapters had changed a lot in a thousand years and he wasnt able to get an airtight seal so we had to transfer over to his ship in space suits once aboard i was pleased to see we were still floating freely it would have been too much if theyd had artificial gravity bokket seemed a nice fellowabout my age early thirties of course maybe people looked youthful forever now who knew how old he might actually be i couldnt really identify his ethnicity either he seemed to be rather a blend of traits but he certainly was taken with linghis eyes popped out when she took off her helmet revealing her heartshaped face and long black hair hello he said smiling broadly ling smiled back hello im ling woo and this is toby macgregor my cocaptain greetings i said sticking out my hand bokket looked at it clearly not knowing precisely what to do he extended his hand in a mirroring of my gesture but didnt touch me i closed the gap and clasped his hand he seemed surprised but pleased well take you back to the station first he said forgive us but wellyou cant go down to the planets surface yet youll have to be quarantined weve eliminated a lot of diseases of course since your time and so we dont vaccinate for them anymore im willing to take the risk but i nodded thats fine he tipped his head slightly as if he were preoccupied for a moment then ive told the ship to take us back to derluntin station its in a polar orbit about kilometers above soror youll get some beautiful views of the planet anyway he was grinning from ear to ear its wonderful to meet you people he said like a page out of history if you knew about us i asked after wed settled in for the journey to the station why didnt you pick us up earlier bokket cleared his throat we didnt know about you but you called us by name pioneer spirit well it is painted in letters three meters high across your hull our asteroidwatch system detected you a lot of information from your time has been losti guess there was a lot of political upheaval then nobut we knew earth had experimented with sleeper ships in the twentyfirst century we were getting close to the space station it was a giant ring spinning to simulate gravity it might have taken us over a thousand years to do it but humanity was finally building space stations the way god had always intended them to be and floating next to the space station was a beautiful spaceship with a spindleshaped silver hull and two sets of mutually perpendicular emeraldgreen delta wings its gorgeous i said bokket nodded how does it land though taildown it doesnt land its a starship yes but we use shuttles to go between it and the ground but if it cant land asked ling why is it streamlined just for esthetics bokket laughed but it was a polite laugh its streamlined because it needs to be theres substantial lengthcontraction when flying at just below the speed of light that means that the interstellar medium seems much denser although theres only one baryon per cubic centimeter they form what seems to be an appreciable atmosphere if youre going fast enough and your ships are that fast asked ling bokket smiled yes theyre that fast ling shook her head we were crazy she said crazy to undertake our journey she looked briefly at bokket but couldnt meet his eyes she turned her gaze down toward the floor you must think were incredibly foolish bokkets eyes widened he seemed at a loss for what to say he looked at me spreading his arms as if appealing to me for support but i just exhaled letting airand disappointmentvent from my body youre wrong said bokket at last you couldnt be more wrong we honor you he paused waiting for ling to look up again she did her eyebrows lifted questioningly if we have come farther than you said bokket or have gone faster than you its because we had your work to build on humans are here now because its easy for us to be here because you and others blazed the trails he looked at me then at ling if we see farther he said its because we stand on the shoulders of giants later that day ling bokket and i were walking along the gently curving floor of derluntin station we were confined to a limited part of one section theyd let us down to the planets surface in another ten days bokket had said theres nothing for us here said ling hands in her pockets were freaks anachronisms like somebody from the tang dynasty showing up in our world soror is wealthy said bokket we can certainly support you and your passengers they are not passengers i snapped they are colonists they are explorers bokket nodded im sorry youre right of course but lookwe really are delighted that youre here ive been keeping the media away the quarantine lets me do that but they will go absolutely dingo when you come down to the planet its like having neil armstrong or tamiko hiroshige show up at your door tamiko who asked ling sorry after your time she was the first person to disembark at alpha centauri the first i repeated i guess i wasnt doing a good job of hiding my bitterness thats the honorthats the achievement being the first nobody remembers the name of the second person on the moon edwin eugene aldrin jr said bokket known as buzz fine okay i said you remember but most people dont i didnt remember it i accessed it he tapped his temple direct link to the planetary web everybody has one ling exhaled the gulf was vast regardless she said we are not pioneers were just alsorans we may have set out before you did but you got here before us well my ancestors did said bokket im sixthgeneration sororian sixth generation i said how long has the colony been here were not a colony anymore were an independent world but the ship that got here first left earth in of course my ancestors didnt immigrate until much later twentyoneohseven i repeated that was only fiftysix years after the launch of the pioneer spirit id been thirtyone when our ship had started its journey if id stayed behind i might very well have lived to see the real pioneers depart what had we been thinking leaving earth had we been running escaping getting out fleeing before the bombs fell were we pioneers or cowards no no those were crazy thoughts wed left for the same reason that homo sapiens sapiens had crossed the strait of gibraltar it was what we did as a species it was why wed triumphed and the neandertals had failed we needed to see what was on the other side what was over the next hill what was orbiting other stars it was what had given us dominion over the home planet it was what was going to make us kings of infinite space i turned to ling we cant stay here i said she seemed to mull this over for a bit then nodded she looked at bokket we dont want parades she said we dont want statues she lifted her eyebrows as if acknowledging the magnitude of what she was asking for we want a new ship a faster ship she looked at me and i bobbed my head in agreement she pointed out the window a streamlined ship what would you do with it asked bokket where would you go she glanced at me then looked back at bokket andromeda andromeda you mean the andromeda galaxy but thats a fractional pause no doubt while his web link provided the data million lightyears away exactly but but it would take over two million years to get there only from earthsexcuse me from sororspoint of view said ling we could do it in less subjective time than weve already been traveling and of course wed spend all that time in cryogenic freeze none of our ships have cryogenic chambers bokket said theres no need for them we could transfer the chambers from the pioneer spirit bokket shook his head it would be a oneway trip youd never come back thats not true i said unlike most galaxies andromeda is actually moving toward the milky way not away from it eventually the two galaxies will merge bringing us home thats billions of years in the future thinking small hasnt done us any good so far said ling bokket frowned i said before that we can afford to support you and your shipmates here on soror and thats true but starships are expensive we cant just give you one its got to be cheaper than supporting all of us no its not you said you honored us you said you stand on our shoulders if thats true then repay the favor give us an opportunity to stand on your shoulders let us have a new ship bokket sighed it was clear he felt we really didnt understand how difficult lings request would be to fulfill ill do what i can he said ling and i spent that evening talking while blueandgreen soror spun majestically beneath us it was our job to jointly make the right decision not just for ourselves but for the four dozen other members of the pioneer spirits complement that had entrusted their fate to us would they have wanted to be revived here no no of course not theyd left earth to found a colony there was no reason to think they would have changed their minds whatever they might be dreaming nobody had an emotional attachment to the idea of tau ceti it just had seemed a logical target star we could ask for passage back to earth i said you dont want that said ling and neither im sure would any of the others no youre right i said theyd want us to go on ling nodded i think so andromeda i said smiling where did that come from she shrugged first thing that popped into my head andromeda i repeated tasting the word some more i remembered how thrilled i was at sixteen out in the california desert to see that little oval smudge below cassiopeia for the first time another galaxy another island universeand half again as big as our own why not i fell silent but after a while said bokket seems to like you ling smiled i like him go for it i said what she sounded surprised go for it if you like him i may have to be alone until helena is revived at our final destination but you dont have to be even if they do give us a new ship itll surely be a few weeks before they can transfer the cryochambers ling rolled her eyes men she said but i knew the idea appealed to her bokket was right the sororian media seemed quite enamored with ling and me and not just because of our exotic appearancemy white skin and blue eyes her dark skin and epicanthic folds our two strange accents both so different from the way people of the thirtythird century spoke they also seemed to be fascinated by well by the pioneer spirit when the quarantine was over we did go down to the planet the temperature was perhaps a little cooler than id have liked and the air a bit moisterbut humans adapt of course the architecture in sorors capital city of pax was surprisingly ornate with lots of domed roofs and intricate carvings the term capital city was an anachronism though government was completely decentralized with all major decisions done by plebisciteincluding the decision about whether or not to give us another ship bokket ling and i were in the central square of pax along with kari deetal sorors president waiting for the results of the vote to be announced media representatives from all over the tau ceti system were present as well as one from earth whose stories were always read years after he filed them also on hand were perhaps a thousand spectators my friends said deetal to the crowd spreading her arms you have all voted and now let us share in the results she tipped her head slightly and a moment later people in the crowd started clapping and cheering ling and i turned to bokket who was beaming what is it said ling what decision did they make bokket looked surprised oh sorry i forgot you dont have web implants youre going to get your ship ling closed her eyes and breathed a sigh of relief my heart was pounding president deetal gestured toward us dr macgregor dr woowould you say a few words we glanced at each other then stood up thank you i said looking out at everyone ling nodded in agreement thank you very much a reporter called out a question what are you going to call your new ship ling frowned i pursed my lips and then i said what else the pioneer spirit ii the crowd erupted again finally the fateful day came our official boarding of our new starshipthe one that would be covered by all the mediawouldnt happen for another four hours but ling and i were nonetheless heading toward the airlock that joined the ship to the stations outer rim she wanted to look things over once more and i wanted to spend a little time just sitting next to helenas cryochamber communing with her and as we walked bokket came running along the curving floor toward us ling he said catching his breath toby i nodded a greeting ling looked slightly uncomfortable she and bokket had grown close during the last few weeks but theyd also had their time alone last night to say their goodbyes i dont think shed expected to see him again before we left im sorry to bother you two he said i know youre both busy but he seemed quite nervous yes i said he looked at me then at ling do you have room for another passenger ling smiled we dont have passengers were colonists sorry said bokket smiling back at her do you have room for another colonist well there are four spare cryochambers but she looked at me why not i said shrugging its going to be hard work you know said ling turning back to bokket wherever we end up its going to be rough bokket nodded i know and i want to be part of it ling knew she didnt have to be coy around me that would be wonderful she said butbut why bokket reached out tentatively and found lings hand he squeezed it gently and she squeezed back youre one reason he said got a thing for older women eh said ling i smiled at that bokket laughed i guess you said i was one reason said ling he nodded the other reason iswell its this i dont want to stand on the shoulders of giants he paused then lifted his own shoulders a little as if acknowledging that he was giving voice to the sort of thought rarely spoken aloud i want to be a giant they continued to hold hands as we walked down the space stations long corridor heading toward the sleek and graceful ship that would take us to our new home the culture archivist jeremiah tolbert jeremiah tolberts fiction has appeared in fantasy magazine black gate interzone ideomancer and shimmer as well as in the anthologies seeds of change polyphony and allstar zeppelin adventure stories hes also been featured several times on the escape pod and podcastle podcasts in addition to being a writer he is a web designer photographer and graphic artistand he shows off each of those skills in his dr roundbottom project located at wwwclockpunkcom for several years tolbert also published a wellregarded online magazine of weird fiction called the fortean bureau he lives in colorado with his wife and cats many of the stories in this book probably owe some debt to star trek but tolbert says this one definitely does i was thinking to myself whats the difference between the federation and the borg really both assimilate other cultures into themselves one just does it a little more violently he said i started thinking about what a realistically capitalistic federation would look like and the story was born the humpty moon vanished two days ago devoured by the ravenous nanobugs of an advance wave assimilation swarm but had i noticed of course noti was so absorbed in my work documenting the intricacies of the humpties pairing ritual that i was numb to anything that didnt involve flaponflap action i was so busy ensuring their cultures survival by recording them screwing that i missed the actual herald of their doom typical it wasnt until i finished filing away my recordings in my hardbrain storage and tuned back into the drone of the grand debate that i picked up on what had happened i had bugs recording the proceedings and it was mostly the usual dry legal stuff but when i finally picked apart the thread enough to realize that the subject under discussion was just where the hell their worlds primary orbiting body had gotten off to i nearly evacuated my humpty renal bowelsone of the more disgusting biological characteristics of the humpty body that id had put up with over the past several up standard months the theory gaining the most support was that a dark unobservable mass had moved through their system at near lightspeed and dragged away the moon in its wake the humpties being of the general shape and form of an egg with stumpy nearly useless legs were keen astronomers and understood physics and astronomy at a level far more advanced than one would expect from a race of their otherwise primitive level of technology which is to say they had gotten past the point of blaming the gods for everything that happened and moved on to thinlybacked pseudoscientific evidence the truththat the moons disappearance heralded the arrival of beings from other worldswas a minority opinion and losing ground fast like many sentients the humpties had a hard time imagining a universe inhabited by anyone but their rotund selves i might have had time to escape had i noticed the advance wave swarm ripping the humpty moon apart molecule by molecule converting it into an unbelievably wide variety of consumer goods that would soon be launched at the surface of the humpty world at high velocities inside protective heatshielded capsules but my ship was hidden more than one hundred klicks from the nomadic humpty community i had infiltrated on humpty legs it would take me a up standard week to make it there despite my certainty of failure i made a go of it i began shuffling away from the herd ignoring the frightened look of the humpties on the fringes from their perspective leaving the comfort and conversation of the group was madness i might as well have dug up a rock from the mossy plain and cracked my skull open with it i called in my bugs and the swarm buzzed helpfully around me providing tracking data on a variety of objects entering the atmosphere i dismissed the information with a very humptian wet snort no shit guys one of the emergent ai in my swarm snickered you in trouble deep shit screwed royally fuxored again with stating the obvious i told them to stay dead quiet if the up knew they existed it would be over for all of us nukes from orbit just to be sure the first goods capsule hit half a klick away and unfolded into a blossom of blue flames judging from the size of the impact it had to be a habitation module the big stuff usually came in first toasters didnt quite have the same awe factor as fourwheel drive vehicles and twostory starter homes but the delivery mechanisms were notoriously flaky and the goods didnt always arrive planetside intact case in point i could make out the smell of fear excretions from the humpty herd in the distance the debate had turned into nothing more than chaotic noise other rogue culture archivists might have taken the opportunity to collect data on the disruption of a native culture but i had seen plenty of that in my time both in my current life and the one before the consumer goods that had begun to rain down from the heavens reminded me of santa claus that mythological magical creature that flew through the air bringing toys and gifts to all the children of terra delivered simultaneously on a single night a colleague specializing in the old cultures long since subsumed by the up did a calculation once based on population estimates and given how absolutely fucking huge everything was back then and figured that old santas volume of goods to be tens of thousands of cubic meters this was like that only if some primitive government had fired a surfacetoair missile and blown that magical bastard to smithereens merry clausmas humpties try to get out of the way a bright light blinded me momentarily as something large and loud came crashing to the moss before me in a slightly more controlled fashion than the goods capsules the light resolved into a standardissue up welcome wagontm the shuttles hull crawled with infotizements for everything from the latest in prophylactic advancements to genesis bombs to babys first nanoswarm i instructed my own swarm to turn down all incoming offers which were already hitting hard and fast wed been out of contact for a couple of years and the little buggers were hungry for upgrades but they had to listen to me or each little microscopic piece would selfdetonate a little something you need to pick up on the black market after you go rogue and leave the up id also purchased the removal of certain protocols necessary in fostering an illegal ai powerful enough to make a survey world vanish existence in the datanet ok obviously not completely wiped or i would not be standing on stumpy little legs flaps agape staring at a pornographic video playing along the hull near the lower right landing pad it had been a few years since i had seen up standard bodies going at it deep tissue memories stirred and retasked cells twinged with an effort to engorge it would have almost been amusing if i wasnt as the swarmtot ai had said fuxored with the welcome shuttle safely on the ground the hatches blew releasing glittering dust and confetti loud music blared from newly revealed speakers a pod bay door irised open and a creature my subconscious had relegated from memory to recurring nightmares strolled gracefully down the plank and onto humpty soil captain lewyana morgana paused moistened her perfect lips and frowned her wrinkleimpervious brow she was flanked by redshirts of various thuggish models and trailed by a pair of officers one of which also featured prominently in said nightmares what the i said forgetting myself and squelching out the words in an approximation of the up lingua franca the music died down cadet kav morgana said to one of her crew i thought you said the data indicated no prior contact with the united planets it did said a genderneutral voice from within the crowd of perfect unitardwearing specimens of up standard aka homo sapiens but i also told you captain that the probes picked up signs of up technology shortly after nanoassembly completed i took note of the gender neutrality and mentally raised an eyebrow a neuter in the up corps half the fun of joining up was getting to fuck and suck the natives into conformity i tagged this bit of information as weird possibly useful whoever this kav wasne hadnt been in lewyanas crew back in my days aboard the jolly happy fun timene was also the first up citizen i had any interest in speaking with in several years relative i didnt want to think about how long it had been in real time numbers that big made my hardbrain throb looks like we have an expat on our hands said a sneering voice i recognized as adam kilkenya waste of memory storage if ever there was one he had taken up as lewyanas boytoy and secondincommand shortly before i had jumped ship which i would like the record to show had nothing to do with my defection mostly my swarm informed me that lewyanas swarm was politely querying for an id and not so politely backing up the request with a threat of nanoanhiliation if they did not comply i toyed with letting the little bastards have at it but lewyana would figure me out soon enough i gave them the goahead the crew became immediately silent adam began to laugh and lewyanas eyes widened then narrowed bertie it was a pointless question my swarm had already confirmed my identity with zero chance of error i pointedly ignored it data began to fly back and forth between the swarms of the crew but i was able to pirate a few bits the neuter wanted to know who i was but nobody was telling nim lewyana instructed the semisentient redshirts to take me captive but to go easy on me and not damage anything and adam sent the up backdoor codes necessary to shut my swarm down to only the most basic functions against which i had no defense they could have hurt me in a million ways and not wounded me as badly as that my emergent ais were wiped out of existence in a flash i had coaxed them from the chaos of the swarm they were the closest things i had to friends now i had another reason to add to my klickslong list titled why i should murder lieutenant adam kilkeny the first chance i get bertram kilroy i hereby put you under arrest as a most wanted sentient for the crimes of datatheft attempted thoughtpattern murder and nonconformity adam said voice oozing with pleasure you forgot treason i said with my swarm incapacitated i didnt bother to struggle as a couple of the meatpuppets took hold of me and dragged my humpty body into the welcome shuttle the actual sentient crew conferred on a secure signal i couldnt infiltrate with a crippled swarm yep fuxored nothing to do now but wait for my trial or possibly find a way to subvert the crews conformity escape the shuttle and kill lieutenant adam fucking kilkeny in a very messy fashion along the way even the condemned have dreams the redshirts tossed me in an empty cargo container previously used for incubating celebratory champagne and shut the lid one plopped his barely sentient welltoned ass down on the lid as if i was going anywhere on my stumpy humpty legs and so to my first order of business i struck up a conversation with my swarm they were crippled in a dozen ways but medical features remained online which gave me all the functionality i needed at the moment i scrolled through my library of body shapes and idly considered a berserker model of some sort but ultimately decided given the available mass and time that i should probably stick with up homo sap standard for now the homo sap frame had done its fair share of murder and mayhem in the million and a half or so years of its evolution i had to remind myself of a central tenet of the culture archivist code its not the size of your tool its how you use it that ascribes certain cultural and moral values to a people and social group my nerve cells began to ache so i shut off pain for the duration of my transformation swarm noted that it would take half a terran standard to complete the process given the humpty frame as a starting point and allowing for available carbon half a day of agonizing pain while my organic bits reshuffled no thank you i blissed out instead voices shook me from my daze i focused long enough to hear the neuter order the redshirts to leave and my halfhuman halfhumpty eyes blinked in the harsh white light of the shuttle bay as the lid slid aside and revealed the androgynous face of an angel ive been instructed to give you a thorough bio examination ne said my name is cadet kav wouldnt want me keeling over before the trial i said my vocal systems were slowly coming into a shape more compatible with lingua franca i think lieutenant kilkeny would prefer it actually cadet kav said absentmindedly ne had the halffocused eyes of someone sorting through a stream of data coming in from its swarm no surprise there but i doubt the captain will let that happen i said shrugging not realizing until that moment that i was starting to have shoulders again i had actually missed shrugging the humpty equivalent of a shrug was a tortuously long rhetorical device involving subtly belittling the idea in question without outright calling the sanity of the speaker into question say what you will about the fuck ups their language afforded a certain efficiency which was of course part of the whole damned problem efficiency wins out too often in the end the neuters eyes snapped into focus all done ive instructed my swarm to facilitate your carbon acquisition to speed your morphing along by the way thanks i muttered suspicious of why the cadet was being so friendly but its next question made the reason plain enough so who are you ive never see the captain surprised by anything and you must have done something interesting for adam to hate you so much ahh gossip i was your captains secondincommand once upon a time i said being honest for once youve really never heard of me i wasnt sure whether i was pleased or hurt by nis ignorance i only joined the crew of the jolly happy fun time a couple of relative months ago this is my first assimilation mission yeah about that why are you in the corps being a neuter and all no offense but there arent a lot of you sort interested in this line of work it was the neuters turn to shrug it seemed like a good idea at the time and that was all ne said fair enough and it gave me an opening at the time huh not so happy with the state of things now ne paused i am a little surprised at the lack of respect for nonassimilateds in the delivery of welcome kits by which cadet kav meant the exploding capsules of doom raining down on the humpty planet as we conversed youll get over it i muttered you didnt kav pointed out i dont know who you were but i know what you are now a deserter an expat the least of my crimes i said preening not just a little bit the neuter tried to stifle a grin and failed ive only heard stories about people like you whats it like out there where ne waved nis long thin hands out there outside of the up oh you wouldnt like it you cant buy anything on credit the food is too rich the languages are too complicated the sentients are barbaric and they practice the most obscene customs horrible truly every day is a struggle to survive youre making fun of me the neuter said hes very good at that captain lewyana said from the bay door she was wearing her hair down long and golden just the way i had liked and adam hated interesting go join the others kav there are plenty of goods left to distribute these poor sentients barely know how to use a stick if you can believe that kav paused about to speak again but departed apparently thinking better of it i wondered what the neuters last question had been and how long it would be before kav was back to ask me more i turned my attention to the captain you know their lack of tool use has allowed them to develop a sophisticated rhetoric thats quite fascinating i said you mean that theyre so bored for lack of toys that all they do is sit around and bullshit i noddedanother odd gesture after having no neck for so long that would be the up way of seeing things the only way worth seeing things she said bertie youre uglier than ever thanks for noticing youre not going to take this seriously at all are you she asked i continued my practice of not answering questions to which she already knew the answer what are you doing out here studying i said lewyana sighed i liked the way it made her breasts heave my human biology was definitely dominant once again the motion would have been repulsive to a humpty adam thought that you were playing little emperor if that was the case you would not have caught me running through the muck i would have been sitting atop a golden throne surrounded by my adoring people i looked past her into the passageway two redshirts loitered nearby blocking any possible escape attempt so she had learned something since id left besides i would have to be a much smoother talker to convince the humpties that im a god you dont give yourself nearly enough credit you almost convinced me of something equally ridiculous once she said almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades what forget it an expression i picked up from a friend of mine i dont believe it what the expression or that i have friends she laughed at that finally i felt a previously unnoticed tension in my new muscles relax both i guess she said look lets stop tiptoeing around this what happens next she put on her professional face stern commanding sexy the natives have two planetary rotations to affirm their citizenship in the up at which point well direct the celebrations seed the atmosphere with swarms and depart for our next mission dropping you off at a up central court along the way or or or we lose adams mindstore copy you in his place and you ride around in his old looks until people forget about him and you come back to me i smiled and ignored the second option for now what if they dont affirm scowling she barked you know exactly what but i want to hear you say it i said before i could stop myself she slapped me hard across my human face her swarm giving the blow just a little extra pain juice the temperature in the room dropped a couple degrees kelvin she pressed her hands against her upper thighs and pushed down smoothing her unitard it was a nervous habit i had seen thousands of times a lifetime ago by rejecting citizenship they identify themselves as a threat to peace among all sentients and they will be treated as such standard operating line it sounded the same as the first time i heard it better get the bombs ready i said the humpties arent going to go for it bertie i can count the number of sentient species that have not affirmed on one hand youll need two hands after tomorrow i said with a sigh youll be damned lucky if they can even come to a consensus by then they debate the names of their children for two years after hatching were persuasive she said sounding almost defeatist in tone i had won most of the arguments and that hadnt changed she had won the fistfights oh i know that now youre telling me things i already know think about my offer she said her eyes pleaded in a way her voice could not she slipped away leaving me to think about those eyes more than i wanted to at the moment i settled into my crate as the redshirts marched back in to take up the guard my energy reserves were running dangerously low thanks to the cellular restructuring so i did what comes naturally in such situations i took a nap i was awakened by a brutal kick to my now fully human ribs i felt one of them break and then the tingling as my swarm jumped into action knitting bone back together i had been tipped out of the crate onto the bay floor adam was standing over me so are you the ghost of christmas future i asked groaning shut up he said and kicked me again enough of that and my crippled swarm would not be able to keep up i know she was in here what did you talk about dont lie ill know if youre lying how bad you are in the sack i said just barely bracing myself in time for the boot the pain while severe was worth it in the good old days there were few things i took more pleasure in than needling cadet adam perhaps in retrospect not the greatest of habits you have no idea what youre talking about he abruptly slumped to the floor beside me i tried to calculate my speed versus his and whether i could grab his neck and snap it before he could call for aid but the math was not in my favor something my swarm helpfully confirmed she orders me to wear your face sometimes he whispered hmm kinky theres this empty space in her bed and i cant fill it no matter what shape i take ive tried everything toys enhancements i even decanted into doubles and had a threesome with myself ugh shes never satisfied he continued why are you telling me this i asked because i cant tell anyone else he shrugged and youre a dead man walking something took over me some impulse that was so unfamiliar i had forgotten the word for it at first pity is that you cant say that ive missed you your sister selfpity has kept me plenty company thanks i proceeded to explain the peculiarities of lewyanas gspot and several sexual techniques that i had developed over the course of a dozen relative years in her bed he listened with a kind of dull eagerness like he didnt want to admit i was teaching him anything useful all youre lacking is time i said in some ways youre a better match for her than me how so he asked his eyes narrowing you dont ask too many questions i said squeezing my eyes shut and preparing myself for another blow but it never came when i opened them he was gone i waited ticking off the hours until the affirmation deadline instead of screaming wordlessly and flailing about uselessly i passed the time asking the redshirts questions i knew they couldnt answer i attempted to teach them how to play gin rummy it would have been easier if i had had a deck of cards i suppose also if the redshirts had more than a peas worth of brain cells just when i was beginning to doubt my people skills and a few minutes after the deadline had passed the neuter returned ne sprayed some kind of pheromone from a spherical canister and the redshirts fell to the ground limp no decision from the humpties then i asked worse than that theyve refused huh i thought for sure the promise of a chicken in every pot would do it for them i said not bothering to explain the historical reference so when does the bombardment begin i noticed that kavs elegant hands were shaking no bombs shes ordered a disassembling swarm the up council considers this method more humane the neuter spat the word humane i would have too i did not so long ago probably the details of that final argument were buried as deep in my hardbrain as i could manage it had not just been painful for lewyana i wish i could say i had discarded her offer but even now it was on my mind then my swarm notified me that their full functions had been restored i queried for my emergent friends and received only dull quizzical responses it would take me a decade to encourage them back into existence but maybe i would have that time now i would never have them back if i agreed to lewyanas proposal with my disposition id never have children my ai were as close as i was going to get if you like i offered ill knock you out and you can pretend that i used villainous spyware to overwhelm you and your swarm adam will believe it and lewyana will pretend to so youll get away fine kav shook nis head i want out im not sure i was ever really in i figured my only hope for escaping the up was to join the corps its the closest thing to unrestricted travel nobody wants to go anywhere anyway everyone looks the same watches the same vids lives in identical houses sameness everywhere thats the up kav shook nis head again theyre talking about discouraging the nongendered you know some on the council think its too nonconformist we dont think like the gendered they say good for you on that point i say but i was only partially kidding when i was described how bad it is out there theres little comfort where i am going are you sure youre ready for that honestly kav laughed im sick of being comfortable right i cracked my knuckles lets go kill some fuck ups then command comm centers hadnt changed a bit since id last been on deck most of it was automated tied into swarms but there were the token data stations for the sentient crews adam was concentrating on a scroll of infodense code but lewyana was waiting for us in the center of the deck kav youre one stupid bitch lewyana said ah i thought so that explained the hands hard to erase every single trait of gender lewyana adam said interrupting what i am sure was about to be a fabulous soliloquy on why the humpties had to die for the good of everyone else blah blah blah heard it i cant shut down his swarm need assistance help support where the hell have you been took refuge hid camouflage among cadet kavs swarm in final moments news so fantastic i could kiss my ais if they had a corporeal form i settled for a giddy laugh instead i dont care captain lewyana said the disassemblers are in the atmosphere already and i can still knock this asshole flat the climate became frigid as her swarm drew on ambient energy to hypercharge her muscles nasty trick and i was almost prepared for it but she moved too quickly for me she always got in the first blow i was sent sprawling my vision was awash with swarm biodamage warnings ill take you up on that offer of help now huzzah for us lewyana adam cried out hes harboring an ai i noticed kav flinch at the claim from the corner of my eye just as i felt the surge of energy from my swarms glucose factories the room grew cold enough for our breath to turn into fog i swung back the blow connected just barely but all i wanted was to make contact my swarm lived up to its namesake rushing into her systems kicking in the doors and generally being right bastards under the command of the artificial intelligence gang i really needed to come up with a better name hmmthe notorious aig lewyanas eyes rolled into the back of her head as my friends wiped the meat blob clean of any trace of her mind pattern from there it was a short hop to adam he didnt go down so easily nanoengineers are prepared for my tricks fuck off he said executing a swarm command override ouch my swarm began to drop individuals by the hundreds error lines crowding my field of vision i dropped to my knees when my vision cleared adam had me by the throat damned human throat so easy to choke i should have gone with that berserker model assistance required um yeah a wave of cold washed over us as someones swarm sucked the airs ambient heat i squeezed my eyes shut for the skullcrushing blow but instead i could breathe again i opened my eyes kav stood over what was left of adams corpse staring at nis bloodsoaked hands i felt another little stab of pity but i told her to get lost i had a planet to save i took a seat at my old control station the memories came flooding back years ago during the incident that convinced me to tell the up to kiss my ass lewyana had pressed a holobutton and bombs had set off tectonic activity in a matter of hours four billion sentients had died in the worst earthquakes ever recorded that was how the up dealt with nonconformist threats if it had been bombs again this time the humpties would have been screwed but i knew a thing or two about swarms i had after all grown my ai friends very carefully the controls and defenses in place in the disassembler were stronger than i had ever seen but my friends had spent a million generations learning their way around a swarm i handed over of my hardbrains processing capacity to the ais they squeezed inside ranting and sharing data so fast it made me dizzy for a brief second i worried that they would overwrite me completely and take over but they calmed down and we got to work cracking codes and hacking back doors in the swarm net we stopped the swarm only halfway through the disassembling process i pulled up a spycam onto the data station and looked out on a world that had suffered more chaos in the past hour than it had in the past fifty thousand years i guess a little evolutionary pressure on the survivors might not be a bad thing in the long run but my work was absolutely ruined i had a record of the humpty culture as it was but not a complete one it would have to do kav was in tears i was too late get used to it i said stiffly were the bad guys and we almost never win in fact not to be a downer but all i did was buy them a little time the up will be back here soon and the next time the humpties wont dare refuse why do you even try then kav asked nis voice breaking i gave kav the same speech my culture archivist friend had given me during my recruitment one day some up citizen is going to wake up and feel hollow inside and theyll go digging on the net and theyll find a hidden datastore i put there rich with cultural history and practices and maybe they wont be a direct descendant of the original species but with swarms it wont matter they can change as easily as their ancestors became up standard theyll sneak off and the culture will come back from the dead if only just for a little while before the up stamps it out again this has happened before i nodded it has and it will again we archivists tend to the process like a garden we harvest the seeds and plant them in the net sometimes it takes a thousand years for them to take root but when they do they grow into one hell of a blossom kav sniffed and wiped at nis eyes thats so bleak i never said it wasnt ne stared off into the middle distance theres a new voice to my swarm ne said is that sorryi guess my friends laid eggs which explained the unexpected help in the fight i was a little disturbed by the news ai didnt replicate they were too complex or so said the conventional wisdom ha ha ha i can has multiplicity quiet you even if i wanted to i couldnt go back now kav said tone halfway between a statement and a question not without purging my swarm of a sentient mind you kind of passed the commitment point a few klicks back i said the lights dimmed as the ships systems began to falter tied as they were to the captains nowdeceased swarm i was surprised it had lasted as long as it did will land safely with relatively little harm only a few bruises almost certainly fatalities i turned back to face kavs tearstained face thanks i said for what kav asked leaving the up i could handle but harboring an illegal ai wasnt kav paused i didnt plan for that another pause i listened to the ais chatter as they merrily hacked through the ships systems i guess i should thank you too my turn to ask what for without you i dont think i would have been able to do it the up would have forced me to change eventually and i cant go back to who i was i had been planning up until that point to bring up the idea of nim swapping back to female but decided against it for the time being i had thought there was some chemistry between us but maybe i was wrong i sure as hell have been before brace for impact in t minus better hold on to something i said its nothing but bumps and bruises from here on out goodbye comfort kav said wistfully the impact was rough but we lived through it and a hell of a lot more after that too maybe if youre lucky youll find another data cache and learn how things ended for us but first you need to look through those files on the humpty culture ask yourself is this who you really are ask yourself and dont be surprised at the answer never stop looking the other side of jordan allen steele twotime hugo award winner allen steele is the author of the novels orbital decay lunar descent chronospace spindrift and many others over the last several years hes been focusing on writing and expanding his coyote milieu of which this story is a part the most recent novel in the coyoteverse coyote horizon came out in march and will be followed by coyote destiny steele is also a prolific writer of short fiction with four published collections and a new one the last science fiction writer on the way his stories have appeared in the magazines asimovs science fiction analog the magazine of fantasy science fiction omni science fiction age and in numerous anthologies the other side of jordan is a simple tale of love lost and found played out upon a galactic scale with aliens and cosmic megastructures aplenty not to mention a nicesized helping of that good old sense of wonder jordan and i broke up on the docks of leeport about as lovely a place as you can have for the end of an affair it was a warm summer evening in hamaliel with sailboats on the water and bearthe local name for ursae majoris bhovering above the west channel wed gone down to the waterfront to have dinner at a small bistro that specialized in grilled brownhead fresh from the fishing net but even before the waiter brought us the menu the inevitable arguments had begun there had been a lot of those lately most of them about issues too trivial to remember but too important to ignore and even though we settled the matter nonetheless the quarrel caused us to lose our appetites so we skipped dinner and instead ordered a bottle of waterfruit wine and by the time wed worked our way through the bottle she and i decided that it was time to call it quits by then it had become apparent that we werent in love mutual infatuation yes we had the strong passions that are both the blessing and the curse of the young and jordan and i never failed to have a good time in bed yet desire was not enough to keep us together when it came right down to it we were very different people shed been born and raised on coyote a thirdgeneration descendant of original colonists i was an émigré from earth one the gringos whod managed to escape the meltdown of the western hemisphere union before the hyperspace bridge to the old world was destroyed she came from money id been a working man all my life she was a patron of the arts my idea of a good time was a jug of bearshine and a hootandholler band down at the tavern she was quiet and reserved i couldnt keep my mouth shut even when it was in my best interests to do so but most importantand this was what really brought things to a headshe was content to live out the rest of her life on coyote indeed jordans ambitions extended no farther than inheriting her familys hemp plantationwhere wed met in the first place much to her parents disapproval since i was little more than a hired handwhile having a platoon of children i was only too willing to help her practice the art of making babies but the thought of everything to follow made my heart freeze after five years on coyotefifteen by earth reckoning long enough for me to have allegedly became an adulti wanted to move on now that the starbridge had been rebuilt and the coyote federation had been tentatively accepted as a member of the talus let me explain the talus in short its a loose alliance of the milky ways starfaring racesor at least those whove built starbridgesformed to promote diplomacy trade and cultural exchange sort of a galactic club so to speak with humankind as the members whove only recently paid their dues humankind was moving out into the galaxy there were worlds out there that no human had ever seen before along with dozens of races whom wed just met this was my calling or at least so i thought and the last thing i wanted to do was settle down to a dull life of being husband and father so we broke up it wasnt hostile just a shared agreement that our romance had gone as far as it could go and perhaps it would be better if we no longer saw each other nonetheless i said something that id later regret i called her a rich girl who liked to slum with lowerclass guys which was how id secretly come to regard her im surprised she didnt dump her glass over my head but at least we managed to get out of the restaurant without causing a scene a brief hug but no kisses then we went our separate ways the next morning i quit my job at the plantationher father couldnt have been more pleasedthen went back to my apartment to pack my bags and turn in the key to the landlady by the end of the day i was aboard the leeport ferry on my way to the new brighton spaceport i thought i was done with jordan and that id never see her again but some women cast a spell that cant easily be broken it wasnt hard to land a job as a spacer the federation merchant marine was always looking for a few good people so long as you were smart enough to fill out the application form were reasonably fit and didnt have any outstanding arrest warrants no experience necessary you trained on the job although the washout rate was high enough that the probation clause of the employment contract was invoked more often than not but the pay was good and the benefits included full health coverage two weeks paid vacation performance bonuses and even a retirement plan when starbridge coyote was destroyed ill explain starbridges too theyre a means of getting from one place in the galaxy to another very fast by using zeropoint energy generators to create artificial wormholes within giant rings you have to have one at your departure point though and another one at your destination for you to get from here to there a religious fanatic blew up the first one we humans built in the ursae majoris system because he didnt like aliens leave it to a nutjob to screw things up for everyone else it was at the height of the refugee crisis with as many as a dozen ships arriving from earth each and every day after the starbridge went down those ships were effectively stranded in the uma system with no way home the coyote federation laid claim to those vessels and reflagged them and once the starbridge was rebuiltwith the technological assistance of the hjadd the hjadd were the first extraterrestrials our people encountered and also our primary sponsors in the talus theyre from a planet in the rho coronae borealis system and look a little like giant tortoises only standing upright and without shells nice folks albeit a little persnickety oh and they eat marijuana the way we eat oregano go figure whose emissaries had been marooned on coyote as wellthe federation now had in its possession a merchant fleet consisting of everything from passenger ships and freighters to a wide assortment of landers and shuttles yet when the hjadd offered a helping hand theyd carefully attached a string or two although theyd come to respect the humans on coyote they were also aware that the individual whod caused the starbridges destruction was from earth and this was just one more reason for them to regard the cradle of humanity with considerable distrust so they made a major stipulation the rebuilt starbridge could be used for travel to any world in our corner of the galaxy except earth or at least until the high council of the talus to which the hjadd belonged determined that earth no longer posed a threat to other starfaring races and if the federation didnt like it the hjadd could always withdraw their ambassadors shut down their embassy on new florida and leave coyote once and for all slamming the door into hyperspace behind them theyd reconstructed the starbridge sure but they also knew how to disable it so that no ships could pass through it without their permission to be sure quite a few people objected to being cut off from earth yet a surprisingly large majority supported the hjadds decision ever since the unexpected arrival of the first western hemisphere union starship four years after the alabama party set foot on coyote and the military occupation that followed earth had been little but trouble for the colonies the refugee crisis had been only the latest example of how the folks back home were using and abusing the new world with little but a supply of trade goods to show for it but if the talus was willing to make up for this shortfall with a new source of vital materials well why bother with earth at all so coyote had become the latest partner in a galactic network of commerce and cultural exchange with vessels constantly coming and going through the starbridge bound for distant worlds whose very existence had been unknown until only a few years ago and those ships needed crews the fleet already had plenty of captains and first officers and navigators and engineers those guys had come with their vessels and their jobs essentially remained unchanged but someone had to load cargo repair hull plates scrub decks cook meals clean toilets and otherwise perform all the menial tasks to go with running a starship and thats how guys like me earned our paychecks after i passed through a fourweek boot camp and earned my union card i became a payload specialist third class which is a polite way of saying that i was a cargo rat my first billet was aboard the lady amelia a jovianclass freighter that made regular runs out to a planet in the hd system locally known as well im not going to try to it spell the name of the place you couldnt pronounce it anyway the inhabitants called themselves the arsashi and they had a use for the mountain briar our loggers cut in the highlands of great dakota so i spent a couple of days loading lumber aboard a pair of payload containers and once the containers were lifted into orbit and attached to the lady amelia off we went to the puppis constellation i didnt see much of the arsashi homeworld a small planet the color of earwax in orbit around a white dwarf its atmosphere had too much ammonia and too little nitrogen for it to be habitable by humanswhich is indeed the case for most worlds of the talus yet the natives were friendly enough for a race of eightfoot tall bugeyed yeti once my fellow rats and i unloaded five tons of wood the arsashi did their best to make amelias crew as comfortable as possible even putting us up for the night in a small dome suitable for humans their food was indigestible but at least we had a nice view of a nearby shield volcano which so far as i could tell was the only thing on their planet worth seeing i stayed aboard amelia for the next six months coyote time long enough to make five more trips to hd by then id ended my probation period and had been promoted to payload specialist second class i was tired of the arsashi and their dismal little wad of a planet so after that last run i gave up my billet to another spacer and went in search of a new job this time i lucked out the next available post for a cargo rat was aboard the pride of cucamonga the freighter that made history by undertaking the first trade expedition to rho coronae borealis word had it that if you were fortunate enough to crew aboard the pride then you could get a job anywhere in the fleet as things turned out the prides cargomaster was about to take maternity leave and captain harkerhimself a nearlegendary figureneeded someone to fill her position i was barely qualified for the job but the letter of recommendation that the lady amelias captain had written on my behalf went far to ease his reluctance so i managed to get one of the choice jobs in the merchant marine cargo for the pride of cucamonga was cannabis sativa but that wasnt the only thing we brought with us the talus races opened trade with coyote for our raw materials yet it wasnt long before we learned that they were willing to pay better for something else entirely not our technology with the exception of seawater desalinization for which the sorenta gave us negativemass drive anything humans had invented the aliens had long since perfected to our surprise what they liked the most about us was our culture the nord enjoyed our music they didnt think much of mozart or bach and thought jazz was boring but they liked bluegrass and were absolutely wild about traditional indian music apparently both the banjo and the sitar sounded much like their own instruments only different the sorenta were fascinated by our art the more abstract the better and didnt mind very much if what we brought them were copies of pollock kandinksy or mondrian the kuatah were interested in nature films coyotes surface gravity and atmospheric density meant that theyd never set foot on our world but they loved seeing vids of the plants and animals wed found there as for the hjadd the hjadd were intrigued by our literature theyd learned how to translate most of our major languages long before humans actually made contact with thema long story that i shouldnt need to repeatso they read everything we brought them from shakespeare milton and shelley to th century potboilers to the chronicles of prince rupurt so not only was the pride of cucamonga carrying five thousand pounds of cannabis to rho coronae borealis but also a comp loaded with novels stories and poems by authors as diverse as jane austen john d macdonald edward e smith and dr seuss all as another payment for the sophisticated microassemblers that had enabled us to transform logcabin colonies like liberty and new boston into cities the likes of which had never been seen on earth our nanotech was primitive compared to theirs but then again theres nothing else in the universe quite like green eggs and ham seriously there isnt i know its a childrens book and quite old at that but if you havent yet read green eggs and ham stop reading this story right now and go find a copy come back when youre done youll thank me for it we never actually landed on hjarr of course no nonhjadd ever had with the sole exception of the chaazbraan the great teacher of the satong instead the pride once again docked at talus quaspah the immense space colony in orbit above hjarr that served as one of the major rendezvous points for the talus races this was the first time id visited the house of the talus the place from which id embark on a journey that would eventually bring me to hex but before then id send a letter home after i left jordan i told myself that she was just another girl with whom id had a brief affair and that id miss her no more than any other woman ive slept with she was gone no regrets as time went by though i gradually discovered that i was wrong i did miss jordan and i did regret the things id said to her it wasnt as if i was lacking female companionship id had a brief fling with lady amelias com officer and on those occasions when another merchant marine vessel was docked at talus quaspah i could always count on a onenight stand with another federation spacer but these dalliances were nothing more than sexual exercise and more than once i woke up in a bunk with a woman whose name i barely knew to find myself thinking if only for a moment that it was jordan who was curled up beside me yet when i tried to get in touch with her those times when i was back on coyote between flights i discovered that shed taken measures to cut me out of her life her pad number had been changed and when i tried calling her house her folks would immediately disconnect leaving me talking to a dead phone mutual friends informed me that she was still in leeport and hadnt yet taken up with anyone else on the other hand she never mentioned my name or seemed to miss me in any way nonetheless i wanted her back and so during my third trip to talus quaspah i wrote her a letter in order to send mail across the galaxy one relies on hyperspace communication links once a message was encrypted and addressed to its recipient its sent to a network of transceivers maintained by the talus which in turn relays the letter to its intended destination unfortunately that means that its theoretically possible for the message to be intercepted decrypted and read anywhere along the line one has to be able to translate the written language of an alien race in order to do that of course and while i doubted that anyone would have much interest in what i had to say to my former girlfriend nonetheless i didnt want others to read my mail so i opted for a slower means of communication i handwrote my letter on pages ripped from my logbook sealed them in an envelope and addressed it to jordans home a friend of mine who was heading back to coyote aboard another ship offered to carry my letter for me an oldfashioned way of doing things sure but at least id be a little more assured of privacy in that letter i let jordan know where i was and what i was doing then went on to apologize for the things id said to her i told her that i missed her very much and that i wanted to see her again i also attached a recent picture of me standing watch on the prides bridge the galaxytrotting spacer and all that after adding the ships hyperlink suffixno sense in her going through the same rigmarole if she didnt want toi gave the letter to my buddy and then i went about my business and tried not to be too anxious about when id get a reply none came a couple of weeks later the pride returned to coyote to drop off cargo and take on another load of weed and books just before we left for rho coronae borealis again captain harker informed me that the regular cargomaster had successfully delivered her baby and that she would soon be coming back to work after this trip id have to find another ship so i sent a second letter to jordan in which i informed her of my change of plans before reiterating everything id written in my first letter i waited still no response at talus quaspah i happened to run into an old acquaintance another guy whod gone through training at the same time as i did his ship was the texas rose a longrange merchanteer that didnt come and go between just two planets but instead traveled among the talus worlds on yearlong voyages carrying freight from one planet to another my friend had done two of these circuits and hed seen enough of the galaxy the time had come for him to go home i spent the night getting drunk and having a long talk with my heart the following morning still nursing a hangover i went to see captain harker and asked permission to leave the pride and take a job that had just opened up on the rose ted was willing to do this and so was the roses captain and so my friend and i swapped billets he returned to coyote aboard the pride while i lets be honest i told myself that i was fulfilling my ambition to see the stars but the truth of the matter was that i was running away from a woman who through her silence had told me that she wanted nothing more to do with me but still i continued to write to her it had become a habit a way of passing time when i was offduty i had no idea whether jordan was receiving my letters let alone reading them but nonetheless it was something i had to do for the next year i visited worlds that were once beyond my reach at tau bootis i walked upon the shores of a methane sea beneath the ruddy glow of a variable star at hd in the ursa minor constellation i found myself on the moon of a superjovian whose orbit about its primary was so eccentric that its summers were hot enough to boil mercury and the carbon dioxide of its atmosphere froze solid during the winter no indigenous life was possible in such a hellhole but the kuatah had established a mining outpost there and so the texas rose took on a load of iron ingots in exchange for vids of ice medusae from high orbit above the sorenta homeworld in the hd system i saw one of the wonders of the galaxy a continental mountain range larger and higher than even the andes which primitive sorenta had spent countless generations carving into the likeness of the god that theyd worshipped in ancient times until it resembled a vast somber face perpetually staring up into the sky im told that the sorenta went to all the trouble to do this because they wanted their god to come down from the sky and pay them a visit which raises the obvious question if their god had never visited them before how did the sorenta know what it looked like i cannot figure out religion all these worlds and many others i told jordan about in my letters for even though id tried to run away i couldnt escape my memory of her i traveled hundreds of lightyears visited nearly a dozen planets and yet every night i lay awake in my bunk and wished that she was there with me and then at the farthest point in the roses circuitous route we arrived at hex humans didnt learn about hex until we made contact with the nord and even then it wasnt until after their homeworld was destroyed when a rogue black hole passed through its system at hd the nord met our people at talus quaspah and when they found that we had something they wanteddid i mention that they really loved bluegrassthey offered to reveal to us the starbridge coordinates of the place where theyd gone after they evacuated nordash at first we were only politely curious but then a federation navy ship went there and realized that this information was worth its weight in banjos and let me tell you thats a hell of a lot of banjos hd is a gclass star located in the volans constellation about lightyears from earth its also the home system of the danui a rather reclusive race that although capable of interstellar travel and hence a member of the talus wasnt much interested in visiting other worlds instead the danui did exactly the opposite they made something that would guarantee that other starfaring races would visit them instead they built hex once several millennia ago hd was home to a fairly modest solar system with a couple of terrestrialsize planets in stable orbits within its habitable zone and a small gas giant in close proximity to the star itself except for the hot jupe hot jupe hot jupiter an oldtime name that spacers still use for jovians that are way too close to their suns not nice places to visit and yes we are weird but fun once you get to know us those planets no longer exist the danui dismantled themdont ask how no one knows and the danui arent tellingto construct the largest artificial habitat in the entire galaxy picture a geodesic spherethe technical term is geode or twisted dual geodesic domecomprised of hexagons with empty space at the center of each hex now make that geode million miles in diameter with a circumference of miles the legs of the individual hexagons are hollow cylinders miles long and miles wide with a total perimeter of miles construct this enormous sphere around a small yellow sun at the radial distance of one au leaving the hot jupe where it is in order to furnish the hexes near the equator with an eclipse once every four days rotate the entire thing so that centrifugal force provides gravity within each cylinder ranging from gs at the equator to nearly zerog at the poles the top half of each cylinder is a transparent roof comprised of some polymeric substance that provides radiation protection while also retaining atmospheric pressure the result is a habitat the size of a planetary system comprised of nearly trillion cylinders each with its own individual environment the danui did this and then they opened the doors and invited their neighbors to move in why go to such effort damned if anyone knew except that they liked company but hated to travel but what everyone agreed upon was that only the danui would even conceive of such a thing let alone pull it off as a race they had what in a human would be diagnosed as asperger syndrome shy inept at communication and ugly as sinthey looked like gigantic tarantulas with enormous lobsterlike headsthe danui nonetheless were genius engineers capable of focusing their entire attention on a single goal and working at it obsessively until it was brought to completion at some point in their history theyd decided to pull apart their homeworld along with its closest neighbor and a nearby asteroid belt and turn it into hex thats what humans called the place the other races of the talus of course had their own names for it and nearly every one of them had accepted the danui invitation to establish colonies within individual hexes there was no reason for anyone to push or shoveplenty of room for everyone and then someand the danui were willing to help newcomers transform their hexes into miniature replicas of their native worlds the only stipulation was that the inhabitants live together in peace which was an easy thing to agree to wars are fought over territory after all and whod go to war over a place where theres more elbow room than anyone could possibly want besides the other talus races had already seen what had happened to the morath when theyd attempted to invade the kuatah hex the danui had simply sealed off the morath hex then jettisoned it into space toward the sun it had taken nearly three months for the morath colony to fall into hd and the few survivors were told to leave hex and never return last footnote i promise but this is just one example of why war is nearly nonexistent within the talus some of the member races are just too damn powerful for anyone to screw around with humans were only the latest race to stake out land on hex our six habs were located about halfway up the northern hemisphere where the surface gravity was about g less than earths but just a little more than coyotes the texas rose entered spherical node between habs one and two a mile in diameter it was spacious enough to hangar the entire federation fleet and indeed two other vessels were already docked there our ships had been coming to hex for over a year now bringing materials necessary to turn our hexagon into a little version of coyote now that the rose had completed its circuit about half of our cargo would end up here most of it various items wed acquired in trade with other races so far only hab onechristened nueva italia by those who lived therewas settled and even so its population was still less than a thousand not many people on coyote were willing to pull up roots and relocate so far away from others of their own kind a small town milan had been built near the western end of the cylinder not far from the tram station that connected nueva italia with the other habs in our hex the dwellings were prefab fauxbirch yurts shipped from uma but it was hoped that once sufficient forestland was cultivated the colonists would have their own supply of lumber i spent the better part of my first day on hex driving a forklift hauling pallets crates and barrels from the tram to an opensided shed where the supplies were stockpiled so i didnt get much of a chance to look around indeed i was trying hard not to id seen many strange things during my tour of the galaxy but even this minuscule corner of hex was mesmerizing it took an effort to not become distracted by a landscape that lacked a discernible horizon but instead curved upward on both sides and at either end until it merged with a barrelshaped sky where a sun perpetually stayed in the same place never rising or setting even so the day on nueva italia did eventually come to an end the danui had programmed the window panes to gradually polarize over the course of hours until a semblance of nighttime came upon milan a collection of yurts in the center of town served as a bedandbreakfast for travelers and nearby was a small tavern after knocking off work i joined the rest of my crew at the tavern hex marked the end of our long voyage and the captain was feeling generous he told the barkeep that hed pay the tab for everyone at our table and so we settled in for a night of drinking i was on my third or fourth pint of ale when i became aware of something tugging at my left foot looking down i found a young woman kneeling beside me the laces of my work shoes had come undone and she was retying them for me her head was bowed so the only thing i saw at first was the top of her scalp light brown hair fell around her shoulders hiding her face from me i started to tell her that i could tie my own shoes thanks anyway but then she looked up at me do i know you she asked yes yes i think you do you should be more careful if you walk around with untied shoes you might trip over them and hurt yourself good advice i make mistakes like that sometimes people are like that they do things they dont mean to do umm yeah youre right sometimes you dont hush jordan reached up to take my face in her hands i forgive you shed received my letters that was my first question any others were unnecessary or at least just then in time she would tell how shed thought about responding but decided instead to maintain an aloof silence while waiting to see what id say or do next and when shed heard enough to convince herself that my apologies were sincere and that i really did love her she left her family and caught the next ship to hex knowing that the rose would eventually make its way there and then shed waited for me to show up to tell me i got your letters jordan said once shed kissed me i read every one of them and im sorry too you dont have to be she was sitting beside me at the table her hands in mine the rest of my crew realizing that we needed to be left alone had quietly moved to another side of the room anything you said i dont no thats not what i mean your letters im sorry but i dont have them any more what did you i had to get here somehow and my family didnt want me to well you know how my parents feel about you so i sold your letters to buy passage out here i dont understand who would buy my letters whod even want to read who do you think who indeed of course i forgave her for this love is a matter of forgiveness if nothing else since then weve had a very happy life together here on hex where the sun never sets and we have plenty of neighbors to keep us company all the same we try to avoid the hjadd they know enough about us already how our story ends is none of their business like they always been free georgina li georgina li is a new writer with just one previous publication a nongenre story called closer to the sky in the current issue of chroma she says she used to write everyday and then for a long time she didnt and now she writes some days but not others when shes not writing she likes to paint bright colors on small canvases torn pages cardboard squares pulled from the recycling bin about like they always been free she says in a larger sense its about the things we value and the things we dont about how everything changes when that one paradigm shifts but mostly its a love story underground there aint nothin but dark and sweat and filth figure that out quick or get on with dyin just werent no other way guard on the transpo told kinger you aint willin you aint worth it and kinger opened his mouth easy guards skinny

the same dank air he spit out the day before one thing bein willin somethin else all together havin vermin burrowed in livin off his meat underground you ate what came your way or it ate you and kinger staked his claim on the food chain day one kept on livin dreamt of boy off and on his voice his skin licked the lichen off the rock walls when it glowed pale blue bitter in his mouth clean

his short stories have appeared in the magazine of fantasy science fiction realms of fantasy weird tales black static and other fine places his stories have received honorable mentions in both the years best science fiction and the years best fantasy horror he is also a graduate of the clarion writers workshop he lives in madison wi hergenrader was inspired to write the story after reading news about the occupation of baghdad when us soldiers were faced with waves of attacks by insurgents i found the scenario distressing because it was and is an impossible situation for our both our troops and the iraqi citizens who want an end to the fighting hergenrader said as a solider in an occupied territory you are always a target so how can you reconcile any desire to show the local civilians that youre not a monster when youre constantly under threat of attack i walked the perimeter of the firestorm watching the pale strands of grass curl and blacken stamping out flare ups even though this alien grass didnt burn well youd never have known it by looking around i could clearly see where each of the three firebombs detonated blackening the sandy earth and obliterating all traces of life firebombs are synergistically engineered so a burst of three in a tight circle created a maelstrom of pure fire in a matter of seconds an area a few hundred meters across becomes a solid wall of flame incinerating anything within the perimeter the superheated fire burns out after a just a few seconds because it consumes all the available fuel in a snap leaving nothing but a blackened ring of devastation firestorms are scary as hell even when you know theyre coming and believe me it makes quite an impression on the locals the dozen or so seditionists lay scattered like shells on the beach their armor too weak to repel the flames one minute they were crouched in the grass executing an ambush the next theyre drowning in a sea of fire they never had a chance given the technological superiority of our weaponry but theyd chosen to prolong hostilities viewing us as enemies rather than visitors normally resisters understand the score quickly and learn to work with the confederation no matter how much it may sting their pride but this was a religious faction according to our local guide adriassi and they were courting annihilation as our squads xenologist i submitted daily activity reports back to confed command if the confed decided to build a refueling hub here which seemed more likely with each passing week they wouldnt tolerate any uprisings instead of a sixteensoldier exploratory squad theyd send a battalion of troops to wipe out any perceived threats adriassi said hed passed this message to liaisons for the seditionists but these pointless ambushes continued during our geologic surveys and they all ended exactly the same waywith a smoldering black spot in the grass look sharp kiernan rauder said over the com there could be more hostiles under cover she shouldered her rifle and scanned the field of tall white grass on the far side of the burned out expanse marsten and finnel squatted near a charred hunk of metal that was all that remained of an armored seditionist as marsten rolled the body over a charred arm broke off in his hand i looked away regulations require us to inspect fallen combatants for technological components that may have survived the firestorm here we werent likely to find anything aggregated confed data suggested this planets tech was a generationandahalf behind our own they were on the verge of some major breakthroughs like interstellar travel but they werent quite there yet that put the confed in a perfect bargaining position since it meant we could trade technology for some friendly real estate on the planet which the confed had designated esqrtt as esqrtts primary xeno im charged with coming up with a suitable name for the place some xenos simply stick with trite standbys with an alphanumeric code tacked on but there have to be two or three hundred planets with names like poseidon xgt or worse the ones obviously named after girlfriends kids or pets unlike many of my colleagues i wanted to distinguish between planets with proper names even if finding a unique name proved to be difficult our translators usually rendered the local names for home planets with words as unpronounceable as the administrative codes and with the confed branching out to hundreds of new planets each year it took time to find a suitable moniker for each new planet i approached the body of one of the dead seditionists who had made a run for it just as the firestorm touched down his momentum had carried him into the grass and tendrils of black smoke curled up from the scorched husk of his armor as a xeno im not required to do survey work with my fireteam but i couldnt abide being that kind of soldier i had no intention of ducking any military responsibility of course thats easier said than done when youre about to inspect corpses that have been burned alive inside suits of armor i set my rifle down and gripped the seditionists ankles when i heard a panting noise and froze i looked up to see a wildeyed robed figure crouched at the head of the body his hands inside the helmets shattered faceplate startled i stumbled backwards with a shout in immediate response there was squawking over the com a jumble of voices and a burst of rifle fire with a small cry the robed man collapsed back into grass with a rustle rauder sprinted to my side kiernan what was that are you all right she said her voice tinged more with irritation than concern for the hapless xeno i didnt see him at first he was hidden in the grass i said catching my breath he was standing over the body was he armed rauder asked she still held her rifle at the ready waiting for the slightest movement in the grass my viewscreen showed marsten and finnel approaching from behind at a run but no combatants in the field no i said regaining my feet he wasnt even wearing any armor marsten pulled the armored body into the clearing as i lifted the robed man from the grass whose chest had been caved in by rauders shot and laid him out beside the seditionist his dead eyes still had a frantic look to them and the glossy sheen of his flesh had already begun to fade i drew his lids shut then noticed something peculiar his hair had been shaved into a triangle one point at his forehead the other two over his ears wed seen plenty of locals on the planet but none who had fashioned their fine white hair like this what do you make of it finnel said who cares rauder replied then asked me who you calling kiernan adriassi of course i said under my breath ignoring her exasperated sigh invariably rauder never liked the cultural contacts i appointed finding them all to be simpering fawning twits and i was sure she felt adriassi fit that description perfectly she refused to accept that a xeno needed someone reliable to help decipher the bewildering maze of local customs for his daily reports most contacts as in adriassis case turned out to be friendly intelligent and helpful what was more startling than the surface differences between cultures were our basic similarities it never ceased to amaze me how much humanoid species resembled one another both in appearance and characteristics if it hadnt been for their waxy complexion and long droopy earlobes adriassis kind could almost have passed for one of us kiernan here i said as the connection opened we encountered something strange adriassi can you help i said remembering the seemingly random rule of local etiquette during telecommunication conversations one should start each question with a persons proper name as a sign of respect i initiated a visual pathway between our armors viewscreens so he could see what i was looking at he blanched the moment the image of the robed man became clear on his screen and ran a nervous hand over his bald head adriassi who is this i continued why does he dress this way and cut his hair so i found him near the body of a terminated seditionist i turned the corpses head down to give adriassi a good look at the pattern on his skull adriassi stroked his earlobes as he spoke hes a priest adriassi said conducting rituals for the deceased i watched his lips move and there was a lag before his voice came through the com meaning our translation device was struggling to find cognates between our languages adriassi what kind of rituals its complicated he answered as we have discussed the seditionists have strict beliefs they think the soul can be trapped in the body after death and left to rot if not properly freed they believe souls leave through the mouth so the priest conducts a mouthopening ceremony freeing the souls to rise to heaven the lag between his moving mouth and the translation was severe enough to be disorienting so i shut down the visuals as he spoke i relayed the information to the rest of the team rauder snorted then patched into the conversation is that so check this out she said adriassis face soured insulted either by her intrusion or her failure to address him properly she opened her own visual pathway with adriassi as she lifted the priests body and ripped off the wide hood of his robe rauder marsten said sounding tired knock it off just doing a little soul catching for fireteam bravo she said as she dragged the corpse of the armored seditionist away from the group a few paces then thrust the hood inside its helmet and made as if she were capturing the dead seditionists soul inside then she twisted the hood shut like it was a sack and held it over her head waving it at the grassland she did this how many times adriassi asked his glassy eyes veering away from mine to scan the front room of the eatery where we sat he had difficulty relaxing in public even in his armor like him id removed my helmet as a gesture of fostering openness in our conversations like him it made me uneasy confed armor could repel most of what the seditionists could throw at us but diagnostics showed that their plasma rifles were strong enough to penetrate our armors weak pointsthe flexjoints at the wrists elbows the thinner material under our arms behind our knees the armors weapons detection sensors would give me enough time to slap on my helmet before an attack but adriassi had no wds in his armor so he would far more vulnerable i had no doubt that some seditionists were gunning for him specifically because he had chosen to cooperate with us but regulations prevented me from offering to upgrade a natives armor or conducting meetings in a confedsecured zone at each of our cultural exchange meetings he was taking a significant risk he knew it and so did i of course such conditions make the work of filing accurate daily reports difficult sometimes impossible and antagonistic behavior like rauders only compounded the problem i let out a sigh she did it fourteen times once for each dead seditionist do you think her gesture will mean anything to someone watching oh yes adriassi said shrugging his shoulders his peoples equivalent of a nod it most certainly will but why would she do such a thing it certainly cannot help i cant explain maybe she thinks it will demoralize them or that theyll become more reckless in their attacks if theyre angry i left out that rauders actions seemed tame compared to some of the atrocities id heard about on other planets the confed investigates allegations of improper conduct but with an infinite set of diverse planets and cultures the circumstances are always extenuating apart from cases of indiscriminate slaughter besides the prosecution would rely heavily on the attendant xenologists reports and i had no desire to stir up a bureaucratic mess that would ultimately lead nowhere attempting to explain this to adriassi would be next to impossible so i made the best excuses i could i waited for the explanation to filter through as the translator had gotten hung up on the words demoralize and perhaps reckless the translator parses about eight million known languages in order for us to communicate with the alien species we encounter crossreferencing grammar syntax and phonology uploading and downloading lexicons even as we spoke it handles the structure of languages incredibly well but it was dicier when it came to semantics the actual meaning of what we want to say the more specific a word or phrase the more difficult it was for the translator to get it right adriassi shrugged slowly his face thoughtful the marosett the ones you call seditionists believe we were fourfooted beasts until the sky king gave us souls and helped us stand upright they want their mouths open when they die so their souls can return to their creator as he spoke the translator again turned sluggish then produced only a single word superstition in an earlier conversation adriassi had explained that many of his people believed emigrants from an advanced civilization had terraformed this planet and then destroyed everything from their past deliberately erasing their origins some of adriassis people believed that one day they would unearth a cache of advanced technology others including adriassi believed that one day their progenitors would return for them no matter how many times i denied it adriassi seemed convinced that our squad was a group of emissaries come to measure his peoples moral progress before inviting them back into the fold fundamentalists like the seditionists however were convinced they have always been of this planet they held the earth sacred even down to the endless fields of tall white grass that had no obvious use i didnt want to dwell on rauders behavior any more so i changed the subject and questioned him about the major industries on esqrtt all the while trying to think of a more appropriate name for the place its funny how insignificant a planets name is while youre there you really only need to refer to it after youve left adriassi answered my questions but in a distracted manner all along keeping his eyes on the street keeping his eyes open for any wouldbe assassins i see your five and bet fourteen marsten said clenching a handrolled cigar between his teeth and exhaling pink smoke he and rauder sat on one side of a triangular table across from finnel and vok the gorgeous redhead from fireteam alpha fourteen what finnel said with a sigh picking through the pile of multicolored square bills and oval stone coins on the table i can never figure out this alien money how about fourteen souls rauder said and laughed too loudly as she pointed to the brown sack hanging from her bunk i rubbed my eyes and hunkered over the monitor indexing bits of information adriassi had relayed over the course of the day trying to give some logical shape to my report a wispy pungent cloud of smoke persisted in the barracks even though id turned the filtration system to the max it was making me lightheaded can it rauder vok said youve got nothing in that bag but hot air not true ive got a nice collection of souls she said and blew a smoke ring across the table isnt that right kiernan i pretended not to hear and continued poring over the report trying to sort adriassis comments and find connections to other conversations weve had about religion economics and civics for a planet of less than two million inhabitants theyd created a remarkably convoluted system of governance trying to make sense of how life functioned here was like sorting through a rats nest kiernan want to fill in for me finnel called im no good at this game always hard at work vok sang at me batting her lashes get over here kiernan and help me finnels right hes terrible theyre up by thirteen points but ive been letting them win so rauder will keep sharing her ratleaf this stuff doesnt need any translation she said and took a drag on her own dainty cigar youre still at it file the report already rauder groaned like anyone reads those things this is a nothing rock in the corner of nowhere if the confederation loses its mind and decides to use this planet as a refueling point we should just move everyone to another planet no tiptoeing around their precious cultural beliefs no locals to interview no need for xenos marsten moaned and threw down his cards here we go youd like that wouldnt you rauder i said rising to the bait relocate the ones who go peacefully wipe out the ones that dont and move on to the next planet of course youd keep whatever you find to get you off an excellent policy rauder said for an ignorant barbarian rauder pounded the table making the stone coins jump and the room went silent im so sick of your bullshit kiernan every planet its the same thing you gobble up as much as you can about these people their habits their histories pretending youre doing good work but thats not reality the confed takes what it can and tries to prevent things being taken from them thats how things work and from everything weve seen over the years thats how it works everywhere none of these people want to be your friend kiernan the only reason locals talk to you is because theyre afraid of what well do if they dont cooperate oversimplifying as always adriassi puts his life on the line to tell me these things i said he wants us to understand maybe if for no other reason than to prove that his people arent just targets on a shooting range theyre more like us than not raud as we went back and forth vok crossed the room and caught my elbow come on she said tugging my arm lets get some air i glowered at rauder allowing myself be pulled to the door we always said bravo acted like a bunch of idiots vok said with a sigh as we leaned against the barracks wall the breeze played with strands of her hair its idiotic i admit we do this every few weeks just for kicks vok held out her tightly rolled ratleaf cigar and i shook my head she pressed it firmly against my lips looking at me hard and not smiling i took a small puff and held it in the tingle hit my fingers and toes immediately and my tensed muscles relaxed i took the cigar and took another drag rauder can be a jerk but shes not stupid vok said i saw you in town with your contact yesterday helmets off chatting away do you have any idea how dangerous that is what if the seditionists have some weapons our sensors cant detect or what if theyve got some longrange sniper rifle blink once and your heads a red smear and your folks get some dry communiqué from the confed sending their deepest regrets is that what you want i rolled my eyes if they had those weapons dont you think wed have seen them by now adriassi and i were in a crowded place having a quiet conversation everyone loves mocking xenos but these interviews are part of my job to do them right you need to drop your guard a little be willing to open up the ratleaf had me buzzing good i raised the cigar to voks mouth brushing my fingers against her lips and she smiled to show them that were not all monsters i said kiernan she said in a low voice believe me im not like rauder i think xenos play an important part of what we do on these planets i really do if we can learn something from each of these places we encounter well all be better for it she placed her hand on my cheek its warm and dry for starters she breathed you could ask your friend if they have any decent pickup lines on this planet we both broke into laughter our giddiness prolonged by the ratleaf she patted my shoulder and turned to the door just promise to be careful she saidyou know what they say about the road to hell being paved by good intentions thats funny i said as she opened the door the data in the xennologist database suggests its paved with brimstone she rolled her eyes you come up with a name for this place yet i smiled and shook my head through the open door rauder thundered you in or out the bet stands at fourteen souls adriassi ground the orange nut in the palm of his gauntlet and sifted the dust into a bowl then squirted a blue liquid from a pouch hed just purchased the merchant warily eyed rauder and me fully armored and with our rifles slung over our shoulders then he turned his attention back to adriassi who motioned for him to add another powder to the bowl the concoction quickly congealed and became a lump adriassi scooped the doughy mixture from the bowl and offered it to me i retracted my faceplate and held it to my nose it smelled earthy and resembled a chunk of sod you sure thats okay to eat rauder asked her voice hesitant sure i said without much confidence one of our first activities on new planets is testing a variety of foods in the public market for toxicity and most check out as safe even if they fail to please our palates occasional successes like the ratleaf however made experimenting worthwhile i closed my eyes and took a bite this is fantastic i said working the material in my mouth its sweet but not overpowering smooth and just a little salty try it raud you wont believe it no thanks she said but again sounded hesitant great stuff i said still chewing now the flavors shifted its deeper more subtle keep this recipe secret adriassi you could trade this stuff to any confederation personnel who might pass through here in the future let me see that rauder said taking it from my hand and retracting her faceplate adriassi shrugged his shoulders in modesty its very common he said beaming but im happy you like it and you rauder cast me a glance sure id buy this i might even send some home i havent tasted anything like it before and were what youd call welltraveled chalk it up in the win column adriassi i said then added quickly as his face twisted in confusion thats just an expression so what else can you show us as rauders faceplate shut with an audible hiss i turned not able to keep myself from smiling before turning in last night i had submitted my report to confed command like always i indicated that i would be doing field work with my cultural contact the following day and requested a companion escort for safety reasons i had briefly mentioned my confrontation with rauder and hoped perhaps naively that the cc officer issuing work details would take the hint i went to sleep praying they would pair me with vok and woke up to discover theyd assigned rauder ive become convinced cc does that kind of thing either for laughs or to be deliberately annoying rauder had been even less pleased but apparently decided to make the most of it and the morning had passed without any conflict rauder hardly spoke as adriassi led us through the maze of carts identifying the multicolored foods medicines and ornamental crafts as i took samples and conducted material studies the eyes of the shoppers and merchants followed us some fearfully others with curiosity rauders free hand often strayed to the priests hood she wore at her belt or her soulbag as shed taken to calling it when adriassi excused himself to haggle with a merchant i asked her think someones going to steal that off you what this rauder asked again covering the bag with her hand no i notice you keep touching it feel a little selfconscious maybe carrying a hateful reminder like that around a peaceful place like this i asked motioning to the shoppers mixing with the locals isnt so bad is it kiernan she started to say her voice hard when our wdss went off in unison a faint but unmistakable highpitched whine alerting us to the presence of hostiles in close proximity my faceplate hissed closed as rauder reported weve got fiftyno sixtyseditionists closing fast from all sides real fast marsten finnel report fireteam alpha check in weve got a situation is there a problem adriassis stood beside me his face gaunt and frightened inside his helmet the seditionists were closing faster than any of their ambushes in the fields and i tried to think of a way to get adriassi to safety when it hit me we were in the center of a sprawling market over the com marsten and finnel reported that they would reach our position in under five minutes but fireteam alpha was on the far side of the city the seditionists would be on us in seconds would they attack us in this market i asked but adriassis face was blank uncomprehending i remembered he couldnt hear over our communications system and would have no idea what i was talking about would the seditionists attack here with all these people around adriassis mouth fell open rauder had her rifle ready and screamed get to cover as the first green plasma bolt shot through the crowd skipping off the top of her helmet then the air was filled with weapons fire from all sides and chaos erupted shoppers rebounded off our armored frames running like crazed animals trampling the fallen in their attempts to escape the barrage stray bolts passed through their limp bodies which offered no resistance rauder tipped over two carts forming a bunker then called to me shots careened off my chest and back each hitting with concussive force driving the wind from my lungs adriassi cried out as a shot tore through his thigh and on instinct i grabbed him by the collar and flung him to safety behind rauders barricade a bolt struck my anklejoint and i screamed at the instant searing pain even as more shots ricocheted off my forearm and shoulder our barrier was disintegrating under the hail of fire as adriassi crouched between us whimpering rauder poked her head out to squeeze off a shot and was rewarded with a halfdozen blows one glancing off her helmet and blasting the earth beside the petrified adriassi fireteam bravo rauder shouted into her headset deploy firebombs when you reach our location you cant i shouted over adriassis head there are still civilians in the area and adriassis armor cant handle a firestorm hell be burned alive launch rauder shouted over the com as a chunk of the barricade exploded and peppered our faceplates my eyes fell on the brown bag hanging at rauders side and without thinking my hand darted out and grabbed it what are you doing she shouted as i rose reaching out and extending the bag out over the edge of our blasted and blackened barrier plasma bolts struck my fist as i began waving the bag knocking it down but i hoisted it high again a few seconds passed and then the bombardment slowed and then stopped rauder mounted her firebomb on the end of her barrel and hissed are you crazy get down i stood up slowly the bag held aloft over my head around me the market stood in ruins blackened and smoking the colorful wares spilled onto the dirt streets amidst the bloody bodies of the fallen in every direction i saw seditionists their rifles trained on me their expressions invisible behind their black faceplates i opened my hand showing i held no weapon then i exaggerated my motions as i opened the bag and again waved it pushing my hand through the bottom turning it inside out i waved it again then let the breeze carry it from my hand i amplified a single wordfreeand the scorched air fell silent the first shot struck the joint at my raised elbow and i shrieked as i my arm hyperextended a splitsecond later a second shot struck the back of my knee and i toppled as hundreds of other bolts buffeted my head back and chest i collapsed onto the ground holding my arm in agonizing pain deploying i heard marsten shout as a bolt struck the side of my head blurring my vision rauder launched her firebomb into the sky even as i cried for her to stop a chestthumping thud reverberated in the air and with the last of my strength i pulled adriassi flat and smothered his body with my own as we heard the second and third firebombs detonating the dust swirled in miniature tornadoes as the bombs sucked the oxygen from the air then a whitehot bath of flame poured over us before the fog of pain enveloped me i remember the flame finding the seared holes in my armor and scorching my flesh and my voice joining with adriassis screaming i write this from an orbital infirmary far away from planet esqrtt the armor saved my life but the firestorm branded me with thirddegree burns thick ropy scars down my arm and leg that will be with me forever had the plasma bolts opened a gap at my neck i would be dead rauders armor was never breached and she walked away from the assault with only some severe bruising from the force of so many direct hits they tell me adriassi survived albeit as a quadruple amputee my body covered his head and vital organs but his exposed arms and legs were incinerated in the firestorm of course theres no way for me to contact him to apologize to tell him how i wished things hadnt turned out this way during voks visit she said some trade agreements on the far side of the galaxy had broken down and as a result the confed has decided against using the planet as a refueling hub the squad was being redeployed to some other faroff rock somewhere else and vok assured me that the replacement xeno temporarily assigned to my squad is even more annoying than me all that remains however is the issue of my naming the planet i have spent a considerable amount of my time laid up in bed researching options and have finally come to a decision ive checked and the name hasnt yet been registered for any other planet so applying for naming rights is a formality besides only a few people will ever remember this planet anyway like many words the one i have chosen has ancient roots and it has spawned many other words during its continuous circuitous evolution originally it meant the hearth or the place of the fire a few thousand years and dozens of permutations later changing spelling and meaning it signifies a black mark on the skin a sign of damage by burning i have decided that this insignificant placea nothing rock in the corner of nowheredeserves a name designating both fire and scars it will be named eskhara in remembrance of what happened there the impact we had on those who would be our enemies and on those who would be our friends the one with the interstellar group consciousnesses james alan gardner james alan gardner is the author of several novels including expendable and the others in the league of peoples series his most recent book is gravity wells a collection of his short fiction when he was first getting started as a writer gardner won the grand prize in the writers of the future contest then went on to win two aurora awards the canadian science fiction and fantasy award one of them for his story three hearings on the existence of snakes in the human bloodstream which was also a finalist for the hugo and nebula awards about this story gardner says that although the protagonist is somewhat unusual deep down hes really just a lonely guy looking for love given that this lonely guy is in fact an entire interstellar society you might say that this story is a romantic comedy of cosmic proportions one day the spinward union of democratic lifeforms decided to seek a wife the union was roughly two thousand years oldstill young by the standards of galactic federations but no longer a carefree adolescent it had responsibilities trade deals with other interstellar entities mutual defense pacts obligations to prevent supernovas and gamma ray bursters from blighting the neighborhood and of course a quadrillion component organisms who expected the union to make possible their brief little lives the organisms thought they ran the union and they did in the same way that a bodys cells run the body on a low level each cell leads its individual life but on a high level an aggregate identity emerges and the cells are minuscule parts of an overall system the union was the same a conscious zeitgeist made from the sum of its citizens a regular guy who just happened to cover four hundred cubic parsecs there was a time when the union had felt free to go on benders wars population explosions unchecked economic bingestheyd seemed like harmless fun at the time but after such bouts of wretched excess came hangovers lasting for decades ugh eventually the union was forced to admit that the wild reckless life had lost its charm i guess it said with a wistful sigh im ready to settle down all that remained was to find the right partner another interstellar entity whod complete the unions life an entity who was smart and fun to be with an entity whose component orgs were carbonbased some of the unions best friends were siliconbased but still what the union was looking for was an entity with its own natural resources and ideally a sharp new space fleet and of course an entity whose citizens were hot for interbreeding the unions first move was to talk to its roommate the digital auxilosphere didge shared the same star systems and energy sources as the union they split the housekeeping between them didge did the unions numbercrunching while the union handled didges scutwork chores that were better done by fungible meatcreatures than by delicate highstrung machines the union always thought twice before talking to didge about relationshipsdidge sometimes went into logicoverdrive and picked apart the unions lifestyle still didge was close at hand and the union was accustomed to consulting with her on everything from financial calculations to geneengineering experiments when the union had a problem talking to didge just came naturally uhh said the union the thing is lately ive been feeling well not feeling but thinking well not thinking but wondering sure didge said i can set you up if you must know the details heres what happened at street level on any given block on any given day the unions citizens simply slogged through their liveshighs and lows pleasure and pain the ups and downs of existence like the individual atoms of a gas people bounced and jostled against each other in chaotic disarray but if you totaled up the haphazard motion a cumulative order emerged an overall direction of flow keep adding day by day year by year and you discovered a prevailing wind constructed from seemingly erratic breezes the prevailing wind was the question is this all there isan anxiety that the union was spinning its wheels diverse voices offered answers to the questionpoliticians and priests artists and oratorsbut they only added wind to the gathering storm while many individuals were perfectly content the union as a whole bridled restlessly when the clamor for renewal grew loud enough members of the unions executive council appointed a subcommittee which spent eighteen months in hearings on a plan for the next millennium they produced a file of recommendations one of which was to investigate the costs and benefits of contacting unknown civilizations for the purpose of productive interaction teams of scientists spent ten years constructing aidriven sensors for determining where such civilizations might be found after several more years of data gathering the computers generated a list of regions of interest which could be reached without much new development in communications and transport but basically the unions zeitgeist was lonely bored and horny so it turned to its version of the internet to arrange a few blind dates the initial list contained several obvious losers such as a technocratic utopia inhabiting a single dyson sphere around a red supergiant the union was surprised that didge had included such a civilization its a total backwater the people havent even gone interstellar but didge said a dyson sphere that size has more habitable land than a dozen normal star systems plenty of room for intellectual and physical diversity until the central star goes nova which could happen any second then the whole damned civilization will want to move in with us its a utopia said didge it must have a pleasant personality the union made a scoffing sound which is to say the media indulged in days of derisive editorials and jokes on latenight broadcasts utopias are so selfrighteous always trying to rewrite your healthandsafety codes no grasp of the concept of acceptable losses if you dont like utopias didge said you should have put that in your dating preferences it should go without saying the union grumbled and what about that cybernetic überweb at the top of the list you know im not into that assimilation stuff now whos being selfrighteous didge asked theres nothing wrong with bonding meatlife and machines into efficient cyberorganisms you shouldnt criticize things youve never even tried my parents tried it the union said dad was one of the great empires of his daythousands of star systems millions of intelligent species a fabulous track record of conquest and pacification then he met mom a nomad fleet of a billion ais just arrived from the next galaxy and crazy for action they came together like matter and antimatter fought like mad hooked up then they fought like mad again back and forth till they merged irrevocably and went through a thousand years of hell i was born from their ashes and my founding species swore never to let machines mess with their brains again you dont have to tell me about your trust issues didge said i just thought if you saw how happy a cybergestalt could be forget iti dont want to change i just want to get married the union studied the list of newfound cultures what about this bloc of likeminded trading partners whats wrong with her the bloc meets your specifications exactly didge replied intelligent worldly affluent strictly biological didge gave a disdainful sniff she peevishly miscalculated the weather on one of the unions favorite planets leading to an unexpected hurricane that killed five hundred people didge went on would you like me to initiate contact the union paused for a brief month then muttered yeah sure okay its only a date didge began an exchange of introductory transmissionsall that nonsense with prime numbers and the base spectral line of hydrogenthen the tedious accumulation of linguistic data in order to evolve translation software and simultaneous research on ultralongrange spacecraft that could travel all the way to bloc territory for its part the union made an effort to spruce itself up it lowered the poverty rate by a percentage point passed a few antipollution ordinances and assassinated several insane dictators who really should have been removed earlier but who werent tyrannizing any important star systems and hey if you get anal about every little atrocity other interstellar federations stop inviting you to parties anyway by the time didge had finished designing scoutships that could reach the bloc the union felt pretty good about itself it could bring guests home and have nothing to be ashamed of first contact was arranged for a barren asteroid in a star system run by one of didges cyberfriends a nanobased ai which spent most of her time processing infinite loops for religious reasons the meeting began with the usual stiffnessthe unions chief delegate spent the first hour talking to the bloc delegates breathing apparatusbut both sides had expected some awkwardness and they took it with good grace soon enough they reached the subject of mutually beneficial trade that broke the ice and both relaxed as they discussed how they could profit from one another they quickly determined several areas of technology where their interests dovetailed in fact by combining their expertise they could produce a new generation of spacecraft that would make it much easier for the two federations to see each other both took that as a good sign after days of talking business the union finally asked the bloc so what about artworks what kind of stuff do your people make the bloc stared blankly artworks well said the union what kind of music do you like the bloc looked confused there seems to be a bug in our translation software music pleasant sounds said the union auditory compositions intended to induce desired states of mind the bloc went back to staring blankly or scripted narratives the union went on books movies holothreads vr any sort of fictive utterance blank come on said the union you must tell stories the bloc looked aghast at its translation device untrue accounts of people who never existed the union sighed so theres no point in asking if youd like to dance back home the union told didge well theres two decades of my life ill never get back didge said you negotiated a promising trade agreement i trade with lots of people what i wanted was sizzle instead i got a lecture about nonessential frivolities the union turned in the general direction of bloc territory and shouted some of us think music is essential in response to the blocs lack of art the citizens of the union embarked on a frenzy of creative output much of it posing as pity for those soulless creatures with no sense of aesthetics meanwhile the bloc began a century of trying to comprehend what the union had been talking about a tentative rd effort managed to produce macramé but when that threatened to lead to mixedmedia sculpture the project was dismantled and the ground sown with salt the union told didge why didnt you ask if she liked art oh didge replied i must have missed that in your requirements must have an appreciation of art no sorry i dont have that written down when you were generating translation software the absence of words for art and music didnt strike you as significant you dont have a word for frelzy but the bloc didnt mind the union asked whats frelzy the ability to set a sensible bedtime and to follow through on your decision the union stared blankly is there someone on the list who does practice art the union asked didge said perhaps youd like the nebular commune they occupy several nebulas around the galaxy but not the areas in between the commune only inhabits regions with heightened visual appeal what about music and dance the commune practices them in abundance also many types of narrative entertainment tactile and olfactory media pyrofantasias pyrofantasias making things explode in pretty colors my kind of girl the union said whats wrong with her why do you keep asking that if a civilization is attractive there must be a reason why she isnt already attached this galaxy is full of federations on the prowlthe silicon syndicate the cybertheologic collective emancipation of the fleshand theyve all got the moves to snap up whoever they want if they leave someone alone i want to know why didge said the commune fits all your dating criteria shes lively shes organic she owns valuable real estate all right all right give her a call the process went smoothly due to new technology obtained from the bloc sometimes you can learn from a failed relationship the unions communication grid now reached farther its scoutships flew faster didge breached the communes language barrier in only five years in another four shed arranged a cozy gettogether first contact took place in a small nebula naturally on a hot rocky planet orbiting a bluewhite star the world had no permanent population but the union couldnt help noticing a complex of thermoproofed buildings several centuries old hey didge the union whispered over a longrange communicator did the commune once have a colony here no didge answered but i believe the commune has employed the planet for previous meetings with foreign delegations what how many other federations has she brought here the silicon syndicate the cybertheologic collective emancipation of the didge at that moment the communes diplomats appeared they belonged to a dozen species but all were dressed in diaphanous robes of vivid colors greetings greetings greetings they sang in complex polyphonic harmonies hi said the union its delegation wore business suits let us retire to the rooms of delight the communes diplomats sang could we talk a little first the union asked about what wed just like to get to know you for instance what are your laws on intellectual property the commune stared blankly okay look the union said intellectual property laws provide clear title of ownership over ideas or information so that those who originate new concepts or designs can have you ever stuck a wire into the pleasure center of your brain the commune interrupted um and another wire into the pain center then you give the controls to a total stranger never knowing which button hell press the union delegation cleared its collective throat um no weve never done that the communes chief diplomat tossed over a black box with a red button and a green one you go first the union asked which buttons which the commune laughed does it matter the union set the black box down mayyyybe later the commune shrugged have you ever planted a device in a bluewhite sun that will make it go nova if new acquaintances dont stop acting like total prudes aww jeez reluctantly the union picked up the black box next time the union told didge we are not broadcasting the first contact ceremonies live throughout union territory the frenzy of creative output had come to an abrupt halt the publics mood had veered sharply toward comfort food and muted conversations on darkened verandas grownup children called their parents without being asked teens sat alone in their rooms and obsessed over wiring diagrams on the bright side didge said the commune is eager to buy your mixedmedia sculpture the union shuddered a decade passed before the union was ready to get on the horse again so to speak during that time the zeitgeist fluctuated through rises and fallselation at the publication of a new math proof agony when a detractor pointed out it tacitly assumed the axiom of choicebut underneath nothing had changed in the unions situation individual lives went through happiness sorrow triumph tragedy but as a wholeas a wholethe union felt like it was strangling it wasnt enough for itself its relationships with other interstellar entities were merely utilitarian it had no one who made it feel special didge did her best to keep the union from moping inventing games and new consumer goods that everyone had to buy two of but in time the union which is to say its trendsetters then its masses and lastly its leaders came to realize it still needed companionship a soulmate a wife didge the union said did the list have anyone who wasnt hopeless you could at least talk to one of the utopias the union made a face i dont want someone with a nice personality i want someone good you want someone better than you deserve im biological of course i want someone better than i deserve didge fell silent for several hours the union wondered what she was thinking then didge said i guess you could try the inner worlds abundance whos she a plutocracy occupying several hundred star systems near the galactic core no claims to being a utopia but generally benevolenteven to the poor as long as they know their place my friends say the abundance produces firstrate art but she isnt too um frisky the union sighed so whats wrong with her oh nothing didge said shes perfectly gracious charming shes even pretty in a packaged way so shes boring you wont think so didge said gloomily biologicals find the abundance fascinating under her breath didge added for some reason why dont you like her the union asked shes one of those federations whos all about appearance ooo lets pass a law to make the water clearer and the skies more blue not because its healthier but to improve the tourism photos and the view from penthouse apartments lets make the peasants dress in colorful national costumes lets provide free cosmetic surgery and eugenic selection for better skin didge grimaced the abundance isnt evil shes just shallow you can do better with whom the union asked didge didnt answer the union looked at her blankly after a while the union said its only one date and frankly goodlooking and not evil sounds pretty appealing ive had enough drama didge sighed ill set it up the process went quickly unbeknownst to the union didge had acquired enough expertise in intercultural communications that shed developed a modest reputation as a matchmaker it was didge whod paired the silicon syndicate with that dyson sphere utopia and to the surprise of the entire galaxy the two had hit it off the utopians enthusiastically embraced every available cyberaugmentation while the syndicatethe cynical syndicate famous for its linkemandleaveem seductionshad been rejuvenated by the innocent sense of wonder shown by the utopians as they ventured out into the stars for the first time meanwhile didge had also matched up the antiart bloc with emancipation of the flesh and the newly emancipated bloc of likeminded trading partners was already planning an offshoot blocette in a nearby globular cluster as for the inner worlds abundance shed been sending out signals for a long long timewell before the union started looking for a mate didge couldnt say why shed never mentioned these signals to the union theyd just struck her as overeager didge knew the union would probably like the abundances outgoing personality but in didges eyes the abundance was smarmy the sort of culture that sent cute little thankyou notes after concluding any trade agreement and never missed an excuse to broadcast candid pictures of itself but if that was what the union really wanted didge gritted her metaphoric teeth and made the call in the kuiper belt of the abundances central star system the unions delegation parked behind a dwarf planet to clean their spaceship the diplomats didnt set out again until the hull was gleaming back home didge muttered thats so superficial the union said but i want to make a good impression the impression should come from the ship itself my designs give it more speed and range than anything the abundance has ever seen their technology is really quite primitivethey should spend more on research and less on getting shiny theres nothing wrong with caring about ones appearance the union glanced at didge it wouldnt hurt you to primp a bit i dont primp i have real work to doyour work then relax take a break design some betterlooking containers for your processors dont you get tired of black boxes black is classic didge snapped okay whatever the union said now shush my delegation is about to meet the abundance the abundance had said there would be no ceremonyjust a quick hello to her board of directors before she and the union departed for an intimate little moon where they could get to know each other the union was still new to the courtship game but not entirely naïve when the quick hello turned into three weeks of pomp and circumstance the diplomats werent surprised in fact the unions delegation had got didge to whip up gifts for the abundances leaders didge had produced gaudy trinkets that did nothing and as she expected the useless doodads went over with oohs and ahhs sullenly didge watched as the welcoming ceremonies wound to a flashy conclusion the choreography clearly calculated to impress biological minds flamboyant music fireworks tinting the sun mauve didge wanted to imagine it was all a sinister ploy that the abundance was actually luring the union into a trap and that as soon as they were alone the abundance would coldcock the union diplomats and plant slavecontrollers in their brains but didge knew it wasnt truethe abundance simply enjoyed extravaganzas and leapt at any opportunity to stage them didge thought she likes dressing up the abundance isnt even showing off for a new suitor she just admires the sight of herself when shes well turned out didge tried to despise the abundances indulgent vanity she didnt quite succeed her silicon soul contained a tiny chip of envy for any entity that was comfortable with itself the union flew the abundance to their planned têteàtête it went as well as didge had feared pleasant talks much in common discussions that quickly went beyond mere trade and into cultural exchangemaybe even some joint colonization efforts to see how the two federations got along the word stimulus cropped up frequently when the union feigned a casual manner and spoke of feeling underenergized the abundance said she felt the same ive felt like somethings missing for years and years and years oh sure i have lots of fun but sometimes i wonder where im going i have many spiritual peoplethe poor are so natural arent they simple but so in touch overall though i just long for something to happen something that would turn my life around an infusion of new blood the union suggested maybe the abundance answered coyly the meetings continued being broadcast to both federations people watched the proceedings whenever they could each one hoping this would be it at the start the union imposed a delay of five minutes on the broadcastno repeating the commune fiascobut after a while without any official decision the delay gradually shortened to nothing the unions populace wanted immediacy to experience the abundance as firsthand as possible new arts new technologies new ways of seeing the universe yet not too weird just spicy nothing challenging or disruptive the idea of integrating arose so naturally that no one could say who first proposed it early on the possibility was treated as a playful fantasy suppose we built a space fleet together suppose we collaborate on a mission to another galaxy suppose just for laughs we built our own dyson sphere utopia only not a serious utopia just a nice vacation resort over time however the pieinthesky dreaming became concreteturning from airy chatter into more tangible logistics the two lovebirds kicked around methods of merging until finally the union said weve really got something here i think its time to have didge work out the details the abundance stared blankly whos didge and that was their first big fight the abundance used computers but never allowed them to achieve intelligence let alone form a unified consciousness the leaders of the abundance and its zeitgeist as a whole firmly believed that the help should never get ideas it just isnt done the abundance told the union you have to set boundaries or the poor dears get confused the union said didge isnt confused well thats worse isnt it if you dont keep the servants in hand they question the natural order next thing you know theyll be making demands and where will it all end didge doesnt make demands i dont know why youre defending her unrest was spreading across the abundance the broadcasts displayed a sign technical difficulties in the diplomatic meetings the abundances chief delegate told the union perhaps you should explain your exact relationship with this didge shes just my roommate the union said baffled at how things had gone wrong so quickly were friends nothing more friends how wholesome youre cohabiting with this entity and im not supposed to mind theres nothing to mind didge and i just hang out we talk play games you know the usual personally i wouldnt know whats usual when living breathing organisms shack up with electronic surrogates the abundance gave the union a haughty look ive been willing to forgive your social gaucheness because i thought you could be trained out of it but im beginning to think the problem runs too deep you cant relate to real people because youre dependent on this didge im not dependent the union protested i take care of myself just fine then prove it the abundance said shut down this didgethe parts with intelligenceand smash the hardware that makes it possible you mean kill her there shouldnt be a her there should only be an it now grow up and take back control of your life dont call me until you have but its didge or me decide the unions mood was somber the peoples mood was somber the union had a choice to make the people had a choice to make for once it was a choice they couldnt talk over with didge some people wondered what if the ais get angry and can we really survive if we dumb them down but the main emotion wasnt fear it was guilt every citizen had relied on the auxilosphere since birth even supposing the computers could be safely lobotomized doing so would be shabby meanwhile didge said and did nothing the auxilosphere seemed hushed computing was so ubiquitous it was mostly unseenpractically everything had invisible digital connections from clothing to stairways to lawnsbut there were still boxstyle computers for heavyduty processing they had run quietly for centuries far past the need for noisy components but their silence had somehow intensified so that the matte black boxes seemed like brooding shadowthings that stifled surrounding sounds people tiptoed when near them still the auxilosphere did its job controlling almost every facet of union life nothing went wrong the union thought about the abundance also about didge about life in general and the question is this all there is people worked at their jobs ate meals made love births and deaths didnt stop life went on at the top committees held hearings costbenefit analyses the practicalities of merging with the abundance the feasibility of dumbing down the auxilosphere factions screamed how dare the abundance tell us what to do others replied so you want to do nothing go back to being restless and lonely still others if we bind ourselves to a preening prima donna how long before were even more restless and lonely the union brooded in the darknessfour hundred cubic parsecs of indecision then then a single component organism a single person whispered to didge queried the auxilosphere how can i connect with you didge could instantly supply the equipment shed designed and built it centuries ago like a wistful platonic friend who keeps a bottle of champagne in the fridge just in case the single component organism scrawled on its bedroom wall let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments then the organism told didge do it the incident made the local newsa crazed individual whod somehow created a cyberdevice that linked the meatbrain with the auxilosphere the individual was now in a state of deranged euphoria apparently subsumed by the machine gestalt health authorities were attempting to determine how to sever the connection without killing the patient in another place and time this would have been an isolated incident but now after the broadcast dozens more people hooked up with the auxilosphere this made the news on every planet in the union government leaders and media experts asked isnt it irresponsible to publicize this wont it encourage others hundreds thousands millions of others but no one stopped the broadcaststhere wasnt the political will which is to say the unions zeitgeist couldnt summon up much outrage in fact the very next day a committee investigating the shutdown of the auxilosphere published its conclusions that the benefits of merging with the abundance couldnt compensate for the losses caused by lobotomizing the digital world with its dumbeddown computers the abundance was lovely but backward and actually a bit of a bitch didge said the union what a fool ive been their nuptials lasted twenty years during which the biological populace slowly but surely and mostly voluntarily linked their brains to the cybergestalt neither silicon nor carbon dominated the final fusion but a truly digitized union emerged eager to share its bliss with everyone it met in time the entire galaxy was assimilated into the joy and they all lived happily ever after golubash

this story marks her first foray into science fiction her fantasy writing is renowned for its exquisite prose style and its highly literary nature i think youll find thats true of her sf as well as the title implies this one is about wine and wara pleasing bouquet with a hint of bloodshed the difficulties of transporting wine over interstellar distances are manifold wine is after all like a child it can bruise it can suffer traumasometimes the poor creature can recover sometimes it must be locked up in a cellar until it learns to behave itself sometimes it is irredeemable i ask that you greet the seven glasses before you tonight not as simple fermented grapes but as the living creatures they are wellbrought up indulged but not coddled punished when necessary shyly seeking your approval with clasped hands and slicked hair after all they have come so very far for the chance to be loved welcome to the first public tasting of domaine zhaba my name is phylloxera nanut and it is the fruit of my familys vines that sits before you please forgive our humble venuesurely we could have wished for something grander than a scorched prewar orbital platform but circumstances and the constant surveillance of château marubouzudébrouillard and their soldiers have driven us to extremity mind the loose electrical panels and pull up a reactor huskthey are inert i assure you spit onto the floora few new stains will never be noticed as every drop about to pass your lips is wholly thoroughly enthusiastically illegal we shall not stand on ceremony shall we begin sudcôtêdugolubash new danube the colonial ship quintessence of dust first blazed across the skies of avalokitesvara two hundred years before i was born under the red stare of barnards star our second solar benefactor her plasma sails streamed kilometers long like sheltering wings simone nanut was on that ship she alongside a thousand others looked down on their new home from that great height the single long unfathomably wide river that circumscribed the globe the golden mountains prickled with cobalt alders the deserts streaked with pink salt how i remember the southern coast of golubash i played there and dreamed there was a girl on the invisible opposite shore and that her family too made wine and cowered like us in the shadow of the asociación my friends in your university days did you not study the manifests of the first colonials did you not memorize their weightlimited cargo verse after verse of spinning wheels bamboo seeds lathes vials of tailored bacteria as holy writ then perhaps you will recall simone nanut and her folly she used her pitiful allotment of cargo to carry the clothes on her back and a tangle of ancient maribor grapevine its roots tenderly wrapped and watered mad slovak witch they all thought her patting those tortured battered vines into the gritty yellow soil of the golubash basin even the hyphens were sure the poor things would fail there were only four of them on all of avalokitesvara immensely tall their watery triune faces catching the old red light of barnards flares their innumerable arms fanned out around their terribly thin torsos like peacocks tails not for nothing was the planet named for a hindu god with eleven faces and a thousand arms the colonists called them hyphens for their way of talking and for the thinness of their bodies they did not understand then what you must all know now rolling your eyes behind your sleeves as your hostess relates ancient history that each of the four hyphens was a quarter of the world in a single body that they were a mere outcropping of the vast intelligences which made up the ecology of avalokitesvara like one of our thumbs or a pair of lips golubash i knew to know more than one hyphen in a lifetime is rare officially the great river is still called new danube but eventually my family came to understand as all families did that the river was the flesh and blood of golubash the fish hisherits thoughts the seaweed hisherits nerves the banks a kind of thoughtful skin simone nanut put vines down into the body of golubash hesheit bent down very low over nanuts hunched little form arms akimbo and said to her that will not worktakethrivebear fruitlast beyond your lifetime yet worktakethrive they did was it a gift to her did golubash make room between what passes for hisherits pancreas and what might be called a liver for foreign vines to catch and hold did he perhaps love my ancestor in whatever way a hyphen can love it is impossible to know but no other hyphen has ever allowed earthorigin flora to flourish not heeminspr the high desert not julka the archipelago not niflamen the softspoken polar waste not even the northern coast of the river proved gentle to grape golubash was generous only to simones farm and only to the southern bank the mad red flares of barnards star flashed often and strange and the grapes pulsed to its cycles the rest of the colony contented themselves with the native rootvegetables something like crystalline rutabagas filled with custard and the teeming rockgeese whose hearts in those barnacled chests tasted of beef and sugar in your glass is an vintage of that hybrid vine a year which should be famous would be if not for rampant fear and avarice born on earth matured in golubash it is cabernet allowing for mineral compounds generated in the digestive tract of the golubash river note its rich garnetlike color the gravitas of its presence in the glass the luscious rolling flavors of blackberry cherry peppercorn and chocolate the subtle airy notes of fresh straw and iron at the back of your tongue you will detect a last whisper of brine and clarygrass the will of simone nanut swirls in your glass resoluteunbrokenunmoveablestone abbaye de st cir tranquilité neufabymes of course the vintage along with all others originating on avalokitesvara were immediately declared not only contraband but biohazard by the asociación de la pureza del vino whose chairman was and is a scion of the marubouzu clan the asociación has never peeked out of the pockets of those fabled hoary hokkaido vineyards when château débrouillard shocked the wine world then relatively small by allowing their ancient vines to be grafted with japanese stock a few years before the first of salvatore yuuhis gates went online an entity was created whose tangled ugly tendrils even a hyphen would call gargantuan nor were we alone in our ban even before the first colony on avalokitesvara the lunar city of st clairinrepose a catholic sanctuary had been nourishing its own strange vines for a century in great glass domes in a mist of temperature and light control a cloister of monks led by fratre sebastién perdue reared priceless pinot vines and heady malbecs their leaves unfurling green and glossy in the pale blue light of the planet that bore them but monks are perverse and none more so than perdue in his youth he was content with the classic vines gloried in the precision of the wines he could coax from them but in his middle age he committed two sins the first involved a young woman from hipparchus the second was to cut their orthodox grapes with tsukibellas the odd hard little berries that sprang up from the lunar dust wherever our leashed bacteria had been turned loose in order to make passable farmland as though they had been waiting all that time for a long drink of rhizomes their flavor is somewhere between a blueberry and a truffle and since genetic sequencing proved it to be within the grape family the monks of st clair deemed it a radical source of heretofore unknown wonders hipparchus was a farming village where tsukibellas grew fierce and thick it does not do to dwell on brother sebastiéns motives what followed would be repeated in more varied and bloodier fashions two hundred years hence well do i know the song for château marubouzudébrouillard and her pet asociación had partnered with the coquilgrollë corporation in order to transport their wines from earth to orbiting cities and lunar clusters coquilgrollë now entirely swallowed by château md was at the time a soda company with vast holdings in other foodstuffs but the tremendous weight restrictions involved in transporting unaltered liquid over interlunar space made strange bedfellows the precious md wines could not be dehydrated and reconstitutedno child can withstand such sadism therefore foul papers were signed with what was arguably the biggest business entity in existence and though it must have bruised the rarified egos of the children of hokkaido and burgundy they allowed their shy fragile wines to be shipped alongside supercolanade and bloo bomb the extraordinary tariffs they paid allowed coquilgrollë to deliver their confections throughout the bustling submundal sphere the asociación writ stated that adulterated wines could at best be categorized as fruitwines silly dessert concoctions that no vintner would take seriously like applemelonkiwi wine from a foilsac not only that but no tariffs had been paid on this wine and therefore abbé st clair could not export it even to other lunar cities it was granted that perhaps if taxes of a certain wildly illegal percentage were applied to the price of such wines it might be possible to allow the monks to sell their vintages to those who came bodily to st clair but transporting it to earth was out of the question at any price as foreign insects might be introduced into the delicate home terroir no competition with the house of débrouillard could be broached on that world or any other though in general wine resides in that lofty category of goods which increase in demand as they increase in price the lockdown of abbé st clair effectively isolated the winery and their products simply could not be hadwhenever a bottle was purchased a new asociación tax would be introduced and soon there was no possible path to profit for perdue and his brothers past a certain point economics became irrelevantthere was not enough money anywhere to buy such a bottle have these taxes been lifted you know they have not sirs but domaine zhaba seized the ruin of abbé st clair in and their cellars neglected filthy simultaneously worthless and beyond price came into our tender possession what sparks red and black in the erratic light of the station status screens is the last vintage personally crafted by fratre sebastién perdue it is pinot noir malbec and forbidden delicate tsukibella to allow even a drop of this to pass your lips anywhere but under the earthlit domes of st clairinrepose is a criminal act i know you will keep this in mind as you savor the taste of corporate sin it is lighter on its feet than the côtédugolubash sapphire sparking in the depths of its dark color a laughing lascivious blend of raspberry chestnut tobacco and clove you can detect the criminal fruitah there it is madam you have itin the midrange the tartness of blueberry and the ashen loam of mushroom a clean almost soapy waft of green coffeebean blows throughout i would not insult it by calling it deliciousit is profound unforgiving and ultimately unforgiven domaine zhaba clos du saleengcarolz cuvée cheval you must forgive me madam my pour is not what it once was if only it had been my other arm i left on the ochre fields of centauri b i have never quite adjusted to being suddenly and irrevocably lefthanded i was fond of that armi bit my nails to the quick it had three moles and a little round birthmark like a drop of spilled syrah shall we toast to old friends in the war they used to say go lose your arm you can still pour but if you let them take your tongue you might as well die here by the time simone nanut and her brood both human and grape were flourishing the yuuhi gates were already bustling with activity though the space between gates was vast it was not so vast as the spaces between stars everything depended on them colonization communication and of course shipping have any of you seen a yuuhi gate i imagine not they are considered obsolete now and we took out so many of them during the war they still hang in space like industrial mandalas titanium and bonein those days an organic component was necessary if unsavory and we never knew whose marrow slowly yellowed to calcified husks in the vacuum the pylons bristled with oblong steel cubes and arcs of golden filament shot across the tain like violin bowsall the gold of the world commandeered by salvatore yuuhi and his grand plan how many wedding rings hurled us all into the stars i suppose one or two of them might still be functional i suppose one or two of them might still be used by poor souls forced underground if they carried contraband if they wished not to be seen the is a prewar vintage but only just the asociación de la pureza del vino little more than a paper sack château marubouzudebrouillard pulled over its head had stationed well they never called them soldiers nor warships but they were not there to sample the wine every wine producing region from luna to the hydroponic orbital agricommunes found itself graced with inspectors and customs officials who wore no uniform but the curling md seal on their breasts every yuuhi gate was patrolled by armed ships bearing the apv crest it wasnt really necessary virtually all shipping was conducted under the aegis of the coquilgrollë corporation so fat and clotted with tariffs and taxes that it alone could afford to carry whatever a heart might desire through empty space there were outposts where chaplains used super colanade in the eucharist so great was their influence governments rented space in their holds to deliver diplomatic envoys corn rice even mail when soypaper letters sent via yuuhi became terribly fashionable in the middle of the century you simply could not get anything if cg did not sell it to you and the only wine they sold was marubouzudébrouillard i am not a mean woman i will grant that though they boasted an extraordinary monopoly the debrouillard wines were and are of exceptional quality their pedigrees will not allow them to be otherwise but you must see it from where we stand i was born on avalokitesvara and never saw earth till the war they were forcing foreign i daresay alien liquors onto us when all we wished to do was to drink from the land which bore us from golubash who hovered over our houses like an old radio tower fretting and wringing hisherits hundred hands saleengcarolz was a bunker it looked like a pleasant cloister with lovely vines draping the walls and a pretty crystal dome over quaint refectories and huts it had to the asociación inspectors would never let us set up barracks right before their eyes i say us but truly i was not more than a child i played with golubashwith the quicksalmon and the riverweed that were no less him than the gargantuan thin man who watched simone nanut plant her vines three centuries past and helped my uncles pile up the bricks of saleengcarolz hyphens do not die any more than continents do we made weapons and stored wine in our bunker bayonets at first and simple rifles later compressedplasma engines and rumblers every other barrel contained guns we might have been caught so easily but by then everything on avalokitesvara was problematic in the view of the asociación the grapes were tainted not even entirely vegetable matter grown in living golubash in some odd sense they were not even grown but birthed springing from hisherits living flesh the barrels too were suspect and none more so than the barrels of saleengcarolz until the apv inspectors arrived we hewed to tradition our barrels were solid cobalt alder recedar and oakberry strange to look at for an apv man certainly gleaming deep blue or striped red and black or pure white and of course they were not really wood at all but the fibrous musculature of golubash ersatz loving wombs they howled biohazard but we smacked our lips in the flarelight savoring the cords of smoke and apple and blood the barrels pushed through our wine but in saleengcarolz my uncle grel nanut tried something new what could be said to be golubashs liver was a vast flock of shaggy horsesnot truly horses but something fourlegged and hoofed and tailed that was reasonably like a horsethat ran and snorted on the open prairie beyond the town of nanut they were essentially hollow no organs to speak of constantly taking in grass and air and soil and fruit and fish and water and purifying it before passing it industriously back into the ecology of golubash uncle grel was probably closer to golubash than any of us he spent days talking with the tall threefaced creature the apv still thought of as independent from the river he even began to hyphenate his sentences a source of great amusement we know now that he was learning about horses about spores and diffusion about the lifecycle of a hyphen but then we just thought grel was in love grel first thought of it and secured permission from golubash who bent his ponderous head and gave his assentblessingencouragementtrepidationconfidence he began to bring the horses within the walls of saleengcarolz and let them drink the wine deep instructing them to hold it close for years on end in this way the rest of the barrels were left free for weapons this is the first wine closed up inside the horses of golubash cabernet syrah tempranillo petit verdot it is specifically banned by every planet under apv control and possession is punishable by death the excuse intolerable biological contamination this is a wine that swallows light its color is deep and opaque mysterious almost black the shadows of closed space revel in the dance of plum almond skin currant pomegranate the musty spike of nutmeg the rich buttery brightness of equine blood and the warm obscene swell of leather the last of the prewar winesyour execution in a glass domaine zhaba white tara baslequat our only white of the evening the baslequat is an unusual blend predominately chardonnay with sprinklings of tsukibella and riesling pale as the moon where it ripened white tara is the second moon of avalokitesvara fully within the orbit of enormous green tara marubouzudébrouillard chose it carefully for their first attack my mother died there defending the alder barrels my sister lost her legs domaine zhaba had committed the cardinal sin of becoming popular and that could not be allowed we were not poor monks on an isolated moon orbiting planetbound plebeians avalokitesvara has four healthy moons and dwells comfortably in a system of three habitable planets huge new worlds thirsty for rich things and nowhere else could wine grapes grow for a while barnarders had been eager to have wine from home but as generations passed and home became barnards system the wines of domaine zhaba were in demand at every table and we needed no glittering yuuhi gates to supply them the apv could and did tax exports and so we skirted the law as best we could for ten years before the war began domaine zhaba wines were given out freely as personal gifts untaxable untouchable then the inspectors descended and stamped all products with their little prohibido seal and well one cannot give biohazards as birthday presents the whole thing is preposterous if anything earthorigin foodstuffs are the hazards in barnards system the hyphens have always been hostile to them offworld crops give them a kind of indigestion that manifests in earthquakes and thunderstorms the marubouzu corporals told us we could not eat or drink the things that grew on our own land because of possible alien contagion we could only order approved substances from the benevolent carbonated bosom of coquilgrollë which is château marubouzudébrouillard which is the asociación de la pureza del vino and anything we liked would be delivered to us all the way from home with a bow on it the lunar winery on white tara exploded into the night sky at am on the first of julka my mother was testing the barrelsno wild ponies on white tara her bones vaporized before she even understood the magnitude of what had happened the aerial bombing both lunar and terrestrial continued past dawn i huddled in the baslequat cellar and even there i could hear the screaming of golubash and julka and heeminspr and poor gentle niflamen as the apv incinerated our world two weeks later uncle grels rumblers ignited our first yuuhi gate the color is almost like water isnt it like tears a ripple of red pear and butterscotch slides over green herbs and honeywax in the lowrange you can detect the delicate dust of blueberry pollen and beneath that the smallest suggestion of crisp lunar snow sweet cold and vanished domaine zhaba grelport hulnairob did you know almost a thousand years ago the wineries in old france were nearly wiped out a secret war of soil came close to annihilating the entire apparatus of winemaking in the grand venerable valleys of the old world but no blanketing fire was at fault no shipping dispute only a tiny insect daktulosphaira vitifoliae phylloxera my namesake i was named to be the tiny thing that ate at the roots of the broken ugly ancient machinery of marubouzu i have done my best for a while the french believed that burying a live toad beneath the vines would cure the blight this was tragically silly but hence simone nanut drew her title zhaba old slovak for toad we are the mites that brought down gods and we are the cure warty and bruised though we may be when my uncle grel was a boy he went fishing in golubash like a child in a fairy tale he caught a great green fish with golden scales and when he pulled it into his little boat it spoke to him well nothing so unusual about that golubash can speak as easily from his fishbodies as from his tallbody the fish said i am lonelyworriedafraidexpectantinneedofcomfortlostsearchinghungry helpholdcarry me after the baslequat attack golubash boiled the vines burned even golubashs tallbody was scorched and blisteredbut not broken not wholly vineyards take lifetimes to replace but golubash is gentle and they will return slowly surely so julka so heeminspr so kind niflamen the burnt world will flare gold again grel knew this and he sorrowed that he would never see it my uncle took one of the great creatures many hands he made a promisewe could not hear him then but you must all now know what he did the vengeance of domaine zhaba the yuuhi gates went one after another we became terribly inventivei could still with my one arm assemble a rumbler from the junk of this very platform we tried to avoid barnards gate we did not want to cut ourselves off in our need to defend those worlds against marauding vintners with sodalabels on their jumpsuits but in the end that too went blazing into the sky gold filaments sizzling we were alone we didnt win we could never win but we ended interstellar travel for fifty years until the new ships with internal yuuhidrives circumvented the need for the lost gates and much passes in fifty years on a dozen worlds when the mail cant be delivered they are not defeated but they are humbled an md cruiser trailed me here i lost her when i used the last gatepair but now my cousins will have to blow that gate or else those sodasipping bastards will know our methods no matter it was worth it to bring our wines to you in this place in this time finally to open our stores as a real winery free of them free of all this is a portwine the last of our tastings tonight the vineyards that bore the syrah and grenache in your cups are wonderful long streaks of soil on the edges of a bridge that spans the golubash a thousand kilometers long there is a city on that bridge and below it where a chain of linked docks cross the water the maps call it longbridge we call it grelport uncle grel will never come home he went through barnards gate just before we detonateda puff of sparkling red and he was gone home to earth to deliversafeguarddisseminatehelpholdcarry his cargo a little spore not much more than a few cells scraped off a blade of clarygrass on golubashs back but it was enough note the luscious rubycaramel color the nose of walnut and roasted peach this is pure avalokitesvara unregulated stored in golubashs horses grown in the ports floating on hisherits spinal fluid rich with the flavors of home they used to say wine was a living thingbut it was only a figure of speech a way of describing liquid with changeable qualities this wine is truly alive every drop it has a name a history brothers and sisters blood and lymph do not draw awaythis should not repulse you life after all is sweet lift your glasses taste the roving currents of sunshine and custard salt skin and pecan truffle and caramelized onion imagine with your fingers grazing these fragile stems simone nanut standing at the threshold of her colonial ship the finnish desert stretching out behind her white and flat strewn with debris in her ample arms is that gnarled vine its roots wrapped with such love imagine sebastién perdue tasting a tsukibella for the first time on the tongue of his hipparchan lady imagine my uncle grel speeding alone in the dark towards his ancestral home with a few brief green cells in his hand wine is a story every glass a history an elegy to drink is to hear the story to spit is to consider it to hold the bottle close to your chest is to accept it to let yourself become part of it thank you for becoming part of my familys story i will leave you now my assistant will complete any transactions you wish to initiate even in these late days it is vital to stay ahead of them despite all they will always have more money more ships more bile perhaps a day will come when we can toast

автора httproyallibruauthoradamsjohnhtml notes footnotes let me explain the talus in short its a loose alliance of the milky ways starfaring racesor at least those whove built starbridgesformed to promote diplomacy trade and cultural exchange sort of a galactic club so to speak with humankind as the members whove only recently paid their dues ill explain starbridges too theyre a means of getting from one place in the galaxy to another very fast by using zeropoint energy generators to create artificial wormholes within giant rings you have to have one at your departure point though and another one at your destination for you to get from here to there a religious fanatic blew up the first one we humans built in the ursae majoris system because he didnt like aliens leave it to a nutjob to screw things up for everyone else the hjadd were the first extraterrestrials our people encountered and also our primary sponsors in the talus theyre from a planet in the rho coronae borealis system and look a little like giant tortoises only standing upright and without shells nice folks albeit a little persnickety oh and they eat marijuana the way we eat oregano go figure seriously there isnt i know its a childrens book and quite old at that but if you havent yet read green eggs and ham stop reading this story right now and go find a copy come back when youre done youll thank me for it im told that the sorenta went to all the trouble to do this because they wanted their god to come down from the sky and pay them a visit which raises the obvious question if their god had never visited them before how did the sorenta know what it looked like i cannot figure out religion and let me tell you thats a hell of a lot of banjos hot jupe hot jupiter an oldtime name that spacers still use for jovians that are way too close to their suns not nice places to visit and yes we are weird but fun once you get to know us
